        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="Memory CD4 T cells are critical to human immunity, yet it is unclear whether viral inflammation during memory formation has long-term consequences. Here, we compared transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of Spike (S)–specific memory CD4 T cells in 24 individuals whose first exposure to S was via SARS-CoV-2 infection or mRNA vaccination. Nearly 2 years after memory formation, S-specific CD4 T cells established by infection remained enriched for transcripts related to cytotoxicity and for interferon-stimulated genes, likely because of a chromatin accessibility landscape altered by inflammation. Moreover, S-specific CD4 T cells primed by infection had reduced proliferative capacity in vitro relative to vaccine-primed cells. Furthermore, the transcriptional state of S-specific memory CD4 T cells was minimally altered by booster immunization and/or breakthrough infection. Thus, infection-associated inflammation durably imprints CD4 T cell memory, which affects the function of these cells and may have consequences for long-term immunity. High-grade inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection imparts a durable transcriptional and epigenetic imprint on memory CD4 T cells. Editor’s summary It is unclear whether the memory CD4 T cells generated via mRNA vaccination and via SARS-CoV-2 infection are comparable in terms of frequency and function. Gray-Gaillard et al. performed single-cell analysis of spike protein (S)–specific memory CD4 T cells taken from a longitudinal sample of individuals variously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 or naturally infected with the virus. Infection-primed S-specific memory CD4 T cells exhibited a durable transcriptional and epigenetic signature of inflammation, a cytotoxic profile, and a proliferative disadvantage compared with vaccine-primed memory CD4 T cells. Breakthrough infections did not generally alter the transcriptional profile of vaccine-primed memory T cells, although re-exposure to antigen accompanied by high levels of inflammation could alter the transcriptional profiles of these cells in a clonotype-specific manner. —Seth Thomas Scanlon">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections such as influenza A virus. This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis, caused by M.tuberculosis (Mtb), remains an enduring global health challenge, especially given the limited efficacy of current therapeutic interventions. Much of existing research has focused on immune failure as a driver of tuberculosis. However, the crucial role of host macrophage biology in controlling the disease remains underappreciated. While we have gained deeper insights into how alveolar macrophages (AMs) interact with Mtb, the precise AM subsets that mediate protection and potentially prevent tuberculosis progression have yet to be identified. In this study, we employed multi-modal scRNA-seq analyses to evaluate the functional roles of diverse macrophage subpopulations across different infection timepoints, allowing us to delineate the dynamic landscape of controller and permissive AM populations during the course of infection. Our analyses at specific time-intervals post-Mtb challenge revealed macrophage populations transitioning between distinct anti- and pro-inflammatory states. Notably, early in Mtb infection, CD38− AMs showed a muted response. As infection progressed, we observed a phenotypic shift in AMs, with CD38+ monocyte-derived AMs (moAMs) and a subset of tissue-resident AMs (TR-AMs) emerging as significant controllers of bacterial growth. Furthermore, scATAC-seq analysis of naïve lungs demonstrated that CD38+ TR-AMs possessed a distinct chromatin signature prior to infection, indicative of epigenetic priming and predisposition to a pro-inflammatory response. BCG intranasal immunization increased the numbers of CD38+ macrophages, substantially enhancing their capability to restrict Mtb growth. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal, dynamic roles of different macrophage subsets in TB infection and reveal rational pathways for the development of improved vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.">

        <tr id="CD4 tissue-resident memory T (CD4 TRM) cells are crucial adaptive immune components involved in preventing influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Despite their importance, their physiological role in the upper respiratory tract, the first site of contact with IAV, remains unclear. Here, we find that, after IAV infection, antigen-specific CD4 TRM persist in the nasal tissue (NT) compartment and play a prime role in local viral clearance. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that NT CD4 TRM are heterogeneous and transcriptionally distinct as compared to their lung counterparts. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the CXCR6- CXCL16 axis is involved in CD4 TRM residency in the NT. Furthermore, we show that the NT of mice and humans contains a high frequency of IL-17-producing CD4 TRM that aid in local viral clearance and in reducing tissue damage. Collectively, our results support a robust physiological role for nasal tissue CD4 TRM in preventing IAV infection.">

        <tr id="Treatments available to prevent progression of virus-induced lung diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are of limited benefit once respiratory failure occurs. The efficacy of approved and emerging cytokine signaling-modulating antibodies is variable and is affected by disease course and patient-specific inflammation patterns. Therefore, understanding the role of inflammation on the viral infectious cycle is critical for effective use of cytokine-modulating agents. We investigated the role of the type 2 cytokine IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 binding/entry, replication, and host response in primary HAE cells in vitro and in a model of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. IL-13 protected airway epithelial cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro by decreasing the abundance of ACE2- expressing ciliated cells rather than by neutralization in the airway surface liquid or by interferon-mediated antiviral effects. In contrast, IL-13 worsened disease severity in mice; the effects were mediated by eicosanoid signaling and were abolished in mice deficient in the phospholipase A2 enzyme PLA2G2D. We conclude that IL-13-induced inflammation differentially affects multiple steps of COVID-19 pathogenesis. IL-13-induced inflammation may be protective against initial SARS-CoV-2 airway epithelial infection; however, it enhances disease progression in vivo. Blockade of IL-13 and/or eicosanoid signaling may be protective against progression to severe respiratory virus-induced lung disease. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT Evidence before this study Prior to this study, various pieces of evidence indicated the significant role of cytokines in the pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 cases were marked by cytokine storm syndrome, leading to immune activation and hyperinflammation. Treatments aimed at modulating cytokine signaling, such as IL-6 receptor antagonists, had shown moderate effects in managing severe COVID-19 cases. Studies also revealed an excessive production of type 2 cytokines, particularly IL-13 and IL-4, in the plasma and lungs of COVID-19 patients, which was associated with adverse outcomes. Treatment with anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies improved survival following SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that IL-13 plays a role in disease severity. Type 2 cytokines were observed to potentially suppress type 1 responses, essential for viral clearance, and imbalances between these cytokine types were linked to negative COVID-19 outcomes. These findings highlighted the complex interactions between cytokines and the immune response during viral infections, underscoring the importance of understanding IL-13’s role in COVID-19 and related lung diseases for developing effective therapeutic interventions. Added value of this study In this study, we explored the impact of IL-13-induced inflammation on various stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle using both murine (in vivo) and primary human airway epithelial (in vitro) culture models. Our findings indicated that IL-13 provided protection to airway epithelial cells against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, partly by reducing the number of ACE2- expressing ciliated cells. Conversely, IL-13 exacerbated the severity of SARS2-N501YMA30-induced disease in mice, primarily through Pla2g2d-mediated eicosanoid biosynthesis. Implications of the available evidence Current evidence indicates that PLA2G2D plays a crucial role in the IL-13-driven exacerbation of COVID-19 in mice, suggesting that targeting the IL-13-PLA2G2D axis could help protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These insights are important for clinical research, especially for studies focusing on drugs that modify IL-13 signaling or modulate eicosanoids in the treatment of asthma and respiratory virus-induced lung diseases.">

Relapse-free survival after surgical resection is heterogeneous in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), the two major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. Yet, little is known about the composition and spatial organisation of the TME that could explain the different prognoses for lung cancer patients. Using spatial multi-omics analyses, we show that LUAD and LUSC have distinct TMEs and that neutrophil-enriched tumors are associated with worse survival, while the accumulation of myeloid-instructed CD14+ T cells in the tumor core was associated with prolonged patient survival. CD14+CD4+ T cells express prototypic markers of myeloid cells and were found to be clonally expanded tumor-specific activated T cells. TNFα signaling was activated in tumors with high infiltration of CD14+CD4+ T cells in the tumor core.

        <tr id="The lung is constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and particles that can cause alveolar damage. Hence, appropriate repair responses are essential for gas exchange and life. Here, we deciphered the spatiotemporal trajectory and function of an atypical population of macrophages after lung injury. Post–influenza A virus (IAV) infection, short-lived monocyte-derived Ly6G-expressing macrophages (Ly6G+ Macs) were recruited to the alveoli of lung perilesional areas. Ly6G+ Macs engulfed immune cells, exhibited a high metabolic potential, and clustered with alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2s) in zones of active epithelial regeneration. Ly6G+ Macs were partially dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 receptor signaling and were essential for AT2-dependent alveolar regeneration. Similar macrophages were recruited in other models of injury and in the airspaces of lungs from patients with suspected pneumonia. This study identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G+ Macs as a spatially restricted, short-lived macrophage subset promoting epithelial regeneration postinjury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target for treating lung damage. Short-lived perilesional Ly6G+ macrophages license alveolar epithelial regeneration after viral-triggered lung injury. Editor’s summary Respiratory virus infections can cause long-lasting lung damage, but how specific lung myeloid cell populations contribute to postinfection recovery is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, Ruscitti et al. identified a distinct population of Ly6G+ monocyte-derived macrophages that emerges during the early recovery phase after viral-triggered lung injury. Ly6G+ lung macrophages were short lived and highly phagocytic and populated the alveoli within perilesional areas undergoing regeneration. Genetically engineered mice lacking lung Ly6G+ macrophages displayed impaired epithelial regeneration after influenza infection. Together, these findings identify a previously unappreciated population of reparative lung macrophages that could be targeted therapeutically to treat lung damage. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Waning immunity and the emergence of immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants jeopardize vaccine efficacy leading to breakthrough infections. We have previously shown that innate immune cells play a critical role in controlling SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the innate immune response during breakthrough infections, we modeled breakthrough infections by challenging low-dose vaccinated mice with a vaccine-mismatched SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. We found that low-dose vaccinated infected mice had a 2-log reduction in lung viral burden, but increased immune cell infiltration in the lung parenchyma, characterized by monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and eosinophils. Single cell RNA-seq revealed viral RNA was highly associated with eosinophils that corresponded to a unique IFN-γ biased signature. Antibody-mediated depletion of eosinophils in vaccinated mice resulted in increased virus replication and dissemination in the lungs, demonstrating that eosinophils in the lungs are protective during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. These results highlight the critical role for the innate immune response in vaccine mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) represent an urgent public health challenge and are estimated to affect more than 60 million individuals globally. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that dysregulated immune reactions may be linked with PASC symptoms, most investigations have primarily centered around blood-based studies, with few focusing on samples derived from affected tissues. Furthermore, clinical studies alone often provide correlative insights rather than causal mechanisms. Thus, it is essential to compare clinical samples with relevant animal models and conduct functional experiments to understand the etiology of PASC. In this study, we comprehensively compared bronchoalveolar lavage fluid single-cell RNA sequencing data derived from clinical PASC samples and a mouse model of PASC. This revealed a pro-fibrotic monocyte-derived macrophage response in respiratory PASC, as well as abnormal interactions between pulmonary macrophages and respiratory resident T cells, in both humans and mice. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) emerged as a key node mediating the immune anomalies in respiratory PASC. Neutralizing IFN-γ after the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced lung inflammation and tissue fibrosis in mice. Together, our study underscores the importance of performing comparative analysis to understand the cause of PASC and suggests that the IFN-γ signaling axis might represent a therapeutic target. Comparative scRNA-seq analysis, combined with functional experiments in an animal model, identified IFN-γ as a target for respiratory PASC. Editor’s summary The term “Long Covid” covers a myriad of symptoms that a person may experience after an acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is also referred to as postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). The specific drivers of these symptoms are unclear, complicating the development of therapeutics for those suffering from this condition. Here, Li et al. used comparative analysis to interrogate a potential driver of respiratory PASC, one of the most debilitating types of PASC. The authors found that humans with respiratory PASC had evidence of an enhanced monocyte-derived macrophage response in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A similar phenotype was observed in aged C57BL/6 mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. This phenotype in mice could be reduced by anti–interferon-γ (anti–IFN-γ) treatment initiated after the resolution of acute disease, suggesting that the IFN-γ signaling pathway may represent a potential therapeutic target for humans. —Courtney Malo">

Neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages recruited to pathogen-infected lungs, including SARS-CoV-2–infected lungs, express phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ), a signaling protein that coordinates both granulocyte and monocyte trafficking to diseased tissues and immune-suppressive, profibrotic transcription in myeloid cells. PI3Kγ deletion and inhibition with the clinical PI3Kγ inhibitor eganelisib promoted survival in models of infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 and MRSA, by suppressing inflammation, vascular leak, organ damage, and cytokine storm. These results demonstrate essential roles for PI3Kγ in inflammatory lung disease and support the potential use of PI3Kγ inhibitors to suppress inflammation in severe infectious diseases. PI3Kγ inhibition suppresses lethal inflammation associated with severe infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. Editor’s summary Respiratory diseases caused by different infectious agents can look similar and can rely on similar therapeutic approaches to dampen inflammation. Here, Shepard et al. identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) as a protein that is up-regulated in innate immune cells in the lungs of individuals with COVID-19. They further showed that this was not a COVID-19–specific marker because PI3Kγ was up-regulated in mice infected with other pathogens and after sterile inflammation. PI3Kγ inhibition promoted survival across distinct mouse models of respiratory inflammation and reduced inflammation and vascular leak in the lungs of these animals. These data, which span across human and murine studies, suggest that PI3Kγ inhibition may be an effective host-directed therapy for lung inflammation. —Courtney Malo">

Here we examine the roles of the prototypic pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and IL-10 using the rhesus macaque model of mild COVID-19. We find that IFNγ drives the development of 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lesions in the lungs as measured by PET/CT imaging but is not required for suppression of viral replication. In contrast, IL-10 limits the duration of acute pulmonary lesions, serum markers of inflammation and the magnitude of virus-specific T cell expansion but does not impair viral clearance. We also show that IL-10 induces the subsequent differentiation of virus-specific effector T cells into CD69+CD103+ tissue resident memory cells (Trm) in the airways and maintains Trm cells in nasal mucosal surfaces, highlighting an unexpected role for IL-10 in promoting airway memory T cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection of macaques.">

We provide the first single cell sequencing characterisation of the human TST reaction, based on skin suction blisters induced at the site of the TST on day 2 in 31 individuals. Integrated single cell RNA and TCR sequencing showed the immune response to be dominated by T cells, with smaller populations of NK cells and myeloid cells. T cells comprised CD4, CD8, gamma/delta and NK T cells, with 50% of all T cells identified as cytotoxic and 14% as regulatory. Interferon gamma gene expression was strongest in CD8 T cells, and distinct CD4 T helper lineages could not unambiguously be identified at this time point. Amongst myeloid cells, 63% displayed antimicrobial gene expression and 28% were functionally polarised towards antigen presentation with higher levels of HLA class 2 expression. We derived and validated transcriptional signatures for cell types and cellular functions relevant to the immune landscape of the TST. These data help to improve our understanding of the immune response to Mtb and enable further exploration of bulk transcriptomic data through context-specific cellular deconvolution.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a heterogeneous population of cells whose phenotypes and functions are shaped by factors that are incompletely understood. Herein, we asked when and where TAMs arise from blood monocytes and how they evolve during tumor development. We initiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in inducible monocyte fate-mapping mice and combined single-cell transcriptomics and high-dimensional flow cytometry to profile the monocyte-to-TAM transition. We revealed that monocytes differentiate first into a transient intermediate population of TAMs that generates two longer-lived lineages of terminally differentiated TAMs with distinct gene expression profiles, phenotypes, and intratumoral localization. Transcriptome datasets and tumor samples from patients with PDAC evidenced parallel TAM populations in humans and their prognostic associations. These insights will support the design of new therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs in PDAC. Intermediate tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) emerge first and give rise to two more differentiated TAM populations in pancreatic cancer. Editor’s summary Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor growth and immune suppression, but how TAMs develop from circulating monocytes and local tissue-resident macrophages remains incompletely understood. Using a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in monocyte fate-mapping mice, Dunsmore et al. examined the dynamics of the monocyte-to-macrophage transition in tumors. A population of “intermediate” TAMs gave rise to two more differentiated TAM subsets, distinguishable by their distinct surface marker phenotype, dependence on the transcription factor Maf, migratory behavior, and localization in tumors. These findings provide a time- and space-resolved picture of TAM heterogeneity and development in PDAC, which could guide the future development of TAM-targeted therapeutic strategies. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Bullous pemphigoid (BP) triggers profound functional changes in both non-immune and immune cells in the skin and circulation, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we conducted single-cell transcriptome analysis on donor-matched lesional and non-lesional skin, as well as blood samples from BP patients. Lesional skin non-immune cells coordinately upregulated metabolism, wound healing, immune activation, and cell migration associated pathways. Skin LAMP3+ DCs derived from cDC2 exhibited higher pro-inflammatory signatures than those from cDC1, and VEGFA+ mast cells driving BP progression, were predominantly from lesional skin. As BP patients transition from active to remission stages, blood B cell function shifts from differentiation and memory formation to heightened type 1 interferon signaling and reduced IL-4 response. Blood CX3CR1+ZNF683+ and LAG3+ exhausted T cells exhibited the highest TCR expansion among clones shared with skin CD8+T cells, suggesting they likely represent BP-reactive cells fueling skin CD8+T cell clonal expansion. Clinical parameters for BP severity correlated positively with blood NK cell IFN-γ production, whereas correlated negatively with NK cell AREG production. In lesional skin, NK cell-keratinocyte interactions exhibited reduced AREG-EGFR and enhanced IFNG-IFNGR1/2 signaling. NK cell-derived AREG mitigates IFN-γ-induced keratinocyte apoptosis, highlighting a crucial balance between AREG and IFN-γ in BP progression. These results reveal significant functional shifts in BP pathology within skin and blood cells and suggest new therapeutic targets for disease management. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Secondary bacterial infection, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is one of the most frequent and severe complications of influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pneumonia. Phenotyping of the pulmonary innate immune landscape after IAV infection revealed a significant depletion of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophage (TR-AM) population at day 7, which was associated with increased susceptibility to Spn outgrowth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TR-AM depletion, and to define putative targets for treatment, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and cell-specific PCR profiling in an unbiased manner, using in vivo models of IAV infection and IAV/Spn co-infection. The TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) ligand-receptor axis was revealed as the driving force behind post-influenza TR-AM death during the early infection phase, enabling the transition to pneumococcal pneumonia, while intrapulmonary transfer of genetically modified TR-AMs and antibody-mediated neutralization of specific pathway components alleviated disease severity. With a mainly neutrophilic expression and a high abundance in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of patients with severe virus-induced ARDS, TNFSF14 emerged as a novel determinant of virus-driven lung injury. Targeting the TNFSF14-mediated intercellular communication network in the virus-infected lung can, therefore, improve host defense, minimizing the risk of subsequent bacterial pneumonia, and ameliorating disease outcome.">

Utilizing transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches, we reveal that JAKi selectively regulate gene programs in IFN-γ-activated human macrophages. Our single-cell analysis identified high expression of IFN-γ signature genes in macrophages from RA and severe COVID-19 patients. JAKi suppressed some inflammatory genes, while a subset remained unresponsive to JAK-STAT inhibition. We discovered that JAKi selectively target IRF-STAT-dependent open chromatin regions, leaving AP-1-C/EBP-regulated genes with open chromatin unaffected.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, still most patients experience limited or no clinical benefit. The immune component dynamics during treatment and how it correlated with treatment efficacy remained largely known. We hypothesize that understanding the modulation dynamics of the TME upon ICI treatment would be key to elucidate the mechanisms of response and resistance. To systematically characterize these dynamics, we aggregated a large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of 141 patients across multiple cancer types and ICI treatment modalities, with longitudinally paired samples. We developed a robust, integration-free, and cluster-free deep phenotyping framework, leveraging multiple pan-cancer references to annotate 876,410 high-quality cells into 80 granular cell states. Our analysis revealed consistent compositional changes in 17 cell subtypes following ICI treatment, including an enhanced adaptive immune response such as CD8+ IL7R+ central memory T cells, GZMK+ effector memory T cells, germinal center B cells, precursor exhausted T cells, and CD4+ TfhTh1 cells, accompanied by a broad reduction in interferon responsive immune cells quiescent CD4+CREM-memory T cells. We uncovered co-regulated cell communities within the TME, highlighting the coordinated interplay between adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as immune and non-immune components. Furthermore, we identified two distinct patient groups exhibiting tightly correlated cellular dynamics within the TME post-treatment. The first group, enriched for responders, displayed a marked expansion of naive lymphocytes, while the second group, predominantly composed of non-responders, showed an increased abundance of immune experienced/suppressive cell states. This dichotomy in TME dynamics offers a potential predictive biomarker for patient stratification and personalized therapeutic strategies. Our study presents a comprehensive landscape of the cellular dynamics within the TME during ICI treatment, enabled by a powerful deep phenotyping approach showcasing the importance of a systems-level understanding of the TME dynamics in improving patient stratification and advancing personalized cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Age is a major risk factor for liver cancer, as is the case for most adult human cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. A better understanding of the role of aging in liver and other cancers can facilitate approaches for risk assessment, early detection and prevention. We hypothesize that age-driven changes render aged liver more sensitive to oncogenic stress and hence tumorigenesis. To investigate how the liver changes with age, we documented the immune profile, transcriptome and epigenome of healthy livers from both young and aged mice, revealing pronounced alterations with aging. Notably, in aged hepatocytes, we identified heightened interferon (IFN) signaling, as well as simultaneous tumor suppressor and oncogene signaling at both bulk and single cell level, suggestive of an aged liver that is poised for neoplasia. To challenge this seemingly poised state, we employed adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of a c-Myc oncogene in young and aged mouse liver hepatocytes in vivo. Analysis of aged hepatocytes expressing c-Myc revealed further elevated expression of IFN Stimulated Genes (ISGs). This ISG upregulation was evident in multiple models of oncogenic stress and transformation in older mice and also observed in aged humans with Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). We determined that Stat1 is both necessary and sufficient for the age specific elevated ISG expression in old wild type mice. Remarkably, inhibiting Jak/Stat signaling alongside ectopic c-Myc expression led to high-grade hepatocyte dysplasia and tumor formation, selectively in aged mice. Together, these results suggest that an aged liver is in a state of “precarious balance”, due to concurrent activation of oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways, but protected against neoplastic progression by IFN-signaling. Age-dependent activation of IFN signaling has been observed in many tissues and recent studies have demonstrated its detrimental consequences on aging, raising the question as to why IFN-signaling is activated during aging. We propose that aged tissues are intrinsically at higher risk of cancer and age-dependent activation of IFN-signaling is an adaptive process to protect from tumorigenesis, but one that also has maladaptive consequences.">

        <tr id="Accumulating evidence suggests that the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) significantly influences the response to immunotherapy, yet this complex relationship remains elusive. To address this issue, we developed TimiGP-Response (TIME Illustration based on Gene Pairing designed for immunotherapy Response), a computational framework leveraging single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data, along with response information, to construct cell-cell interaction networks associated with responders and estimate the role of immune cells in treatment response. This framework was showcased in triple-negative breast cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1:PD-L1 interaction, and orthogonally validated with imaging mass cytometry. As a result, we identified CD8+ GZMB+ T cells associated with responders and its interaction with regulatory T cells emerged as a potential feature for selecting patients who may benefit from these therapies. Subsequently, we analyzed 3,410 patients with seven cancer types (melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, metastatic urothelial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and esophageal cancer) treated with various immunotherapies and combination therapies, as well as several chemo- and targeted therapies as controls. Using TimiGP-Response, we depicted the pan-cancer immune landscape associated with immunotherapy response at different resolutions. At the TIME level, CD8 T cells and CD4 memory T cells were associated with responders, while anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages and mast cells were linked to non-responders across most cancer types and datasets. Given that T cells are the primary targets of these immunotherapies and our TIME analysis highlights their importance in response to treatment, we portrayed the pan-caner landscape on 40 T cell subtypes. Notably, CD8+ and CD4+ GZMK+ effector memory T cells emerged as crucial across all cancer types and treatments, while IL-17-producing CD8+ T cells were top candidates associated with immunotherapy non-responders. In summary, this study provides a computational method to study the association between TIME and response across the pan-cancer immune landscape, offering resources and insights into immune cell interactions and their impact on treatment efficacy.">

        <tr id="Aims/hypothesis Immunotherapeutics targeting T cells are crucial for inhibiting autoimmune disease progression proximal to disease onset in type 1 diabetes. A growing number of T cell-directed therapeutics have demonstrated partial therapeutic efficacy, with anti-CD3 (α-CD3) representing the only regulatory agency-approved drug capable of slowing disease progression through a mechanism involving the induction of partial T cell exhaustion. There is an outstanding need to augment the durability and effectiveness of T cell targeting by directly restraining proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 1 cytotoxic CD8+ T cell (Tc1) subsets, while simultaneously augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Here, we present a novel strategy for reducing diabetes incidence in the NOD mouse model using a blocking monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 diabetes-risk associated T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD226. Methods Female NOD mice were treated with anti-CD226 between 7-8 weeks of age and then monitored for diabetes incidence and therapeutic mechanism of action. Results Compared to isotype-treated controls, anti-CD226 treated NOD mice showed reduced insulitis severity at 12 weeks and decreased disease incidence at 30 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis performed five weeks post-treatment demonstrated reduced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells in spleens of anti-CD226 treated mice. Phenotyping of pancreatic Tregs revealed increased CD25 expression and STAT5 phosphorylation following anti-CD226, with splenic Tregs displaying augmented suppression of CD4+ T cell responders in vitro. Anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited reduced frequencies of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein (IGRP)-reactive CD8+ T cells in the pancreas, using both ex vivo tetramer staining and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) approaches. 51Cr-release assays demonstrated reduced cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells by anti-CD226-treated autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Conclusions/interpretation CD226 blockade reduces T cell cytotoxicity and improves Treg function, representing a targeted and rational approach for restoring immune regulation in type 1 diabetes. Research in Context What is already known about this subject? The co-stimulatory receptor CD226 is upregulated upon activation and is highly expressed on NK cell subsets, myeloid cells, and effector T cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism in CD226 (rs763361; C>T) results in a Gly307Ser missense mutation linked to genetic susceptibility for type 1 diabetes. Global knockout of Cd226 and conditional Cd226 knockout in FoxP3+ Tregs reduced insulitis severity and diabetes incidence in NOD mice, indicating a crucial role for CD226 in disease pathogenesis. What is the key question? Can CD226 blockade reduce T cell cytotoxicity and improve Treg function to diminish diabetes incidence in NOD mice? What are the new findings? Anti-CD226 treatment reduced insulitis, decreased disease incidence, and inhibited splenic CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cell proliferation. Pancreatic Tregs from anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited increased CD25 expression; splenic Tregs displayed augmented STAT5 phosphorylation and suppressive capacity in vitro. Anti-CD226 treatment reduced IGRP-specific pancreatic CD8+ T cell frequencies, and reduced autoreactive CD8+ T cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells in vitro. How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? CD226 blockade could reduce autoreactive T cell cytotoxicity, enhance Treg function, and slow disease progression in high-risk or recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases.">

        <tr id="Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a dual role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, aiding early immune defense but also contributing to lung damage. While NET targeting may improve clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, its impact on adaptive immunity, crucial for fighting the virus, remains unclear. Our study demonstrates that both recombinant human DNase (rhDNase), degrading NET structure, and GSK484, inhibiting NET formation, reduce lung NET concentration and improve clinical outcomes in infected mice, yet they differ in their influence on T cell responses. We show that rhDNase does not impact T cell responses, whereas GSK484 diminishes virus-specific T cell responses. In vitro, GSK484 decreases dendritic cell antigen presentation by impairing antigen uptake and reduces IL-2 signaling by affecting its production by T cells. In a model of lung inflammation, GSK484 diminishes antigen-specific T cell activation and proliferation, while rhDNase shows a potential to boost T cell responses via the presence of NET fragments that reduce T cell activation threshold. Our findings suggest that NET targeting with rhDNase or GSK484 holds therapeutic potential for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, while their distinct modes of action shape T cell responses during the infection.">

        <tr id="The cytokine interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a pivotal T cell-derived signal crucial for germinal center (GC) responses, but the precise mechanisms by which IL-21 influences B cell function remain elusive. Here, we investigated the B cell-intrinsic role of IL-21 signaling by employing a novel IL-21 receptor (Il21r) conditional knock-out mouse model and ex vivo culture systems and uncovered a surprising duality of IL-21 signaling in B cells. While IL-21 stimulation of naïve B cells led to Bim-dependent apoptosis, it promoted robust proliferation of pre-activated B cells, particularly class-switched IgG1+ B cells ex vivo. Consistent with this, B cell-specific deletion of Il21r led to a severe defect in IgG1 responses in vivo following immunization. Intriguingly, Il21r-deleted B cells are significantly impaired in their ability to transition from a pre-GC to a GC state following immunization. Although Il21r-deficiency did not affect the proportion of IgG1+ B cells among GC B cells, it greatly diminished the proportion of IgG1+ B cells among the plasmablast/plasma cell population. Collectively, our data suggest that IL-21 serves as a critical regulator of B cell fates, influencing B cell apoptosis and proliferation in a context-dependent manner.">

        <tr id="Background Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can reduce severity of subsequent LRTIs but have also been linked to respiratory allergy development and exacerbation. Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

        <tr id="Local inflammation in the pancreas is transient but imprints a durable epigenetic memory on epithelial cells, making them more amenable to oncogenic transformation. However, it is unclear whether epithelial cell heterogeneity is impacted by acute pancreatitis (AP) or whether population dynamics during regeneration contributes to the establishment of inflammation memory. To tackle those questions, we deployed experimental pancreatitis in mice and performed paired sequencing of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles at single nucleus resolution. We documented cell type abundance but also applied integrative analyses to infer phenotypically-distinct clusters of mesenchymal and exocrine cells. We found that AP perturbs a subset of “idling” acinar cells, which separate from more canonical “secretory” acini based on a more diversified proteome, which include elevated expression of signal transduction receptors. We linked acinar cell heterogeneity to epigenetic differences that also endow idling cells with superior plasticity. These constitute about 40% of acinar cells but can proliferate and skew their phenotype in response to AP. This leads to a remarkable recovery of pancreas histology and function, but also to the dissemination of idling-like features across the exocrine parenchyma. Mechanistically, idling acinar cells are characterized by enhanced transcriptional activity and protein synthesis. After recovery from pancreatitis, acini show elevation of both and establishment of chronic Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). We finally demonstrated that AP-primed pancreata show signs of elevated UPR and that ER stress promotes acinar cell metaplasia. Our data interrogate phenotypical dynamics during tissue regeneration to identify cell states amenable to epigenetic imprinting. They also suggest that UPR-alleviating strategies might curtail the risk of developing pancreatic cancer for individuals who experiences AP.">

Infected patients show strong systemic inflammation and immune cell activation. NK cells are highly activated in HFRS, suggesting that also other innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) might be responding to infection. Here, we characterized peripheral ILC responses, and measured plasma levels of soluble factors and plasma viral load, in 17 Puumala virus (PUUV)-infected HFRS patients. This revealed an increased frequency of ILC2 in patients, in particular the ILC2 lineage-committed c-Kitlo ILC2 subset. Patients’ ILCs showed an activated profile with increased proliferation and displayed altered expression of several homing markers. How ILCs are activated during viral infection is largely unknown. When analyzing PUUV-mediated activation of ILCs in vitro we observed that this was dependent on type I interferons, suggesting a role for type I interferons—produced in response to virus infection–in the activation of ILCs. Further, stimulation of naïve ILC2s with IFN-β affected ILC2 cytokine responses in vitro, causing decreased IL-5 and IL-13, and increased IL-10, CXCL10, and GM-CSF secretion. These results show that ILCs are activated in HFRS patients and suggest that the classical antiviral type I IFNs are involved in shaping ILC functions.">

        <tr id="Objective Beta cell destruction in type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the combined effect of inflammation and recurrent autoimmunity. In recent years, the role played by beta cells in the development of T1D has evolved from passive victims of the immune system to active contributors in their own destruction. We and others have demonstrated that perturbations in the islet microenvironment promote endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in beta cells, leading to enhanced immunogenicity. Among the underlying mechanisms, secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by beta cells has been suggested to mediate the crosstalk with the immune cell compartment. Methods To study the role of cellular stress in the early events of T1D development, we generated a novel cellular model for constitutive ER stress by modulating the expression of HSPA5, which encodes BiP/GRP78, in EndoC-βH1 cells. To investigate the role of EVs in the interaction between beta cells and the immune system, we characterized the EV miRNA cargo and evaluated their effect on innate immune cells. Results Analysis of the transcriptome showed that HSPA5 knockdown resulted in the upregulation of signaling pathways involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and changes the miRNA content of EVs, including reduced levels of miRNAs involved in IL-1β signaling. Treatment of primary human monocytes with EVs from stressed beta cells resulted in increased surface expression of CD11b, HLA-DR, CD40 and CD86 and upregulation of IL-1β and IL-6. Conclusion These findings indicate that the content of EVs derived from stressed beta cells can be a mediator of islet inflammation.">

Using a toxicogenomic framework, we performed dose-dependent analysis to filter genes truly altered by bleomycin exposure from noise and identified a subset of immune genes with a sustained dose-dependent and differential expression response to profibrotic challenge. We performed an immunoassay and revealed cytokines and proteinases responding to bleomycin exposure that closely correlate to transcriptomic alterations, underscoring the integration between transcriptional immune response and external immune signalling activity. This study not only increases our understanding of the immunological mechanisms of fibrosis, but also offers an innovative framework for the toxicological evaluation of substances with potential fibrogenic effects on macrophage signalling.

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a significant public health problem leading to permanently disfiguring skin lesions caused by Leishmania parasites. Lesion severity stems from an excessive host inflammatory response that prevents healing. Here, we characterized the transcriptional and translational responses of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) during murine CL using historical single-cell RNA sequencing data combined with flow cytometry and in vivo puromycin incorporation to assess translational activity. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation pathways including MHC-I, MHC-II, and immunoproteasome transcripts in dermal LECs from Leishmania major-infected mice compared to naive controls. LECs also exhibited increased expression of guanylate binding proteins and interferon-inducible genes, indicative of immune activation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that LECs in leishmanial lesions displayed heightened translational activity relative to LECs from uninflamed ears, and LEC translational activity was highest in activated LECs. Furthermore, LEC translational activity exceeded that of other cell types within the lesion microenvironment. Validating the transcriptomic data, LECs in lesions expressed elevated MHC-II and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1), supporting their potential role in antigen presentation. Functional assays using DQ-OVA confirmed that LECs from leishmanial lesions efficiently uptake and process antigens, highlighting their capability as antigen presenting cells in the inflamed dermal microenvironment.

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

        <tr id="In chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), tissue-resident self-reactive T cells perpetuate disease. The specific tissue factors governing the persistence and continuous differentiation of these cells remain undefined but could represent attractive therapeutic targets. In a model of chronic CNS autoimmunity, we find that oligodendrocyte-derived interleukin-33 (IL-33), an alarmin, is key for locally regulating the pathogenicity of self-reactive CD8+ T cells. The selective ablation of IL-33 from neo-self-antigen-expressing oligodendrocytes mitigates CNS disease. In this context, fewer self-reactive CD8+ T cells persist in the inflamed CNS, and the remaining cells are largely locked into a stem-like precursor program, failing to form TCF-1low effector progeny. Importantly, interventional IL-33 blockade by locally administered somatic gene therapy reduces T cell infiltrates and improves the disease course. Our study identifies oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 as a druggable tissue factor regulating the differentiation and survival of self-reactive CD8+ T cell in the inflamed CNS. This finding introduces tissue factors as a novel category of immune targets for treating chronic CNS autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Neutrophils, underestimated in multiple sclerosis (MS), are gaining increased attention for their significant functions in patients with MS and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model. However, the precise role of neutrophils in cervical lymph nodes (CLNs), the primary CNS-draining lymph nodes where the autoimmune response is initiated during the progression of EAE, remains poorly understood. Methods Applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we constructed a comprehensive immune cell atlas of CLNs during development of EAE. Through this atlas, we concentrated on and uncovered the transcriptional landscape, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of neutrophils, and their crosstalk with immune cells within CLNs in the neuroinflammatory processes in EAE. Results Notably, we observed a substantial increase in the neutrophil population in EAE mice, with a particular emphasis on the significant rise within the CLNs. Neutrophils in CLNs were categorized into 3 subtypes, and we explored the specific roles and developmental trajectories of each distinct neutrophil subtype. Neutrophils were found to engage in extensive interactions with other immune cells, playing crucial roles in T-cell activation. Moreover, our findings highlighted the strong migratory ability of neutrophils to CLNs, partly regulated by triggering the receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1). Inhibiting TREM1 with LR12 prevents neutrophil migration both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, in patients with MS, we confirmed an increase in peripheral neutrophils with an upregulation of TREM-1. Discussion Our research provides a comprehensive and precise single-cell atlas of CLNs in EAE, highlighting the role of neutrophils in regulating the periphery immune response. In addition, TREM-1 emerged as an essential regulator of neutrophil migration to CLNs, holding promise as a potential therapeutic target in MS.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced cell death is a key contributor to COVID-19 pathology. Cell death induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well studied in myeloid cells but less in its primary host cell type, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing human airway epithelia (HAE). SARS-CoV-2 induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in HAE organotypic cultures. Single-cell and limiting-dilution analysis revealed that necroptosis is the primary cell death event in infected cells, whereas uninfected bystanders undergo apoptosis, and pyroptosis occurs later during infection. Mechanistically, necroptosis is induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA–binding protein 1 (ZBP1) in HAE and lung tissues from patients with COVID-19. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, which causes more severe disease than Omicron (B1.1.529) in humans, is associated with orders of magnitude–greater Z-RNA/ZBP1 interactions, necroptosis, and disease severity in animal models. Thus, Delta induces robust ZBP1-mediated necroptosis and more disease severity. Z-RNA/ZBP1–induced necroptosis is an initiating cell death event that occurs markedly more with Delta than Omicron infection. Editor’s summary SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers multiple cell death pathways that contribute to disease severity. Here, Liang et al. characterized cell death mechanisms in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing cells and primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in autopsied lungs from patients with COVID-19. Necroptosis was the primary form of cell death and was induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA binding protein-1 (ZBP-1). Infected and bystander cells underwent apoptosis, but limiting dilution analysis showed that apoptosis was a bystander effect. The Delta variant induced much greater Z-RNA/ZBP-1 interactions and necroptosis compared with Omicron, thus suggesting a mechanism associated with greater disease severity (see related Focus by Wong and Perlman). —Christiana N.

        <tr id="Abstract A comprehensive immune landscape for Brucella infection is crucial for developing new treatments for brucellosis. Here, we utilized single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) of 290,369 cells from 35 individuals, including 29 brucellosis patients from acute (n = 10), sub‐acute (n = 9), and chronic (n = 10) phases as well as six healthy donors. Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays were applied for validation within this cohort. Brucella infection caused a significant change in the composition of peripheral immune cells and inflammation was a key feature of brucellosis. Acute patients are characterized by potential cytokine storms resulting from systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, primarily due to classical monocytes. Cytokine storm may be mediated by activating S100A8/A9‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway. Moreover, monocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells were the probable contributors to immune paralysis in acute patients. Chronic patients are characterized by a dysregulated Th1 response, marked by reduced expression of IFN‐γ and Th1 signatures as well as a high exhausted state. Additionally, Brucella infection can suppress apoptosis in myeloid cells (e.g., mDCs, classical monocytes), inhibit antigen presentation in professional antigen‐presenting cells (APCs; e.g., mDC) and nonprofessional APCs (e.g., monocytes), and induce exhaustion in CD8+ T/NK cells, potentially resulting in the establishment of chronic infection. Overall, our study systemically deciphered the coordinated immune responses of Brucella at different phases of the infection, which facilitated a full understanding of the immunopathogenesis of brucellosis and may aid the development of new effective therapeutic strategies, especially for those with chronic infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract IκB kinase (IKK)α controls noncanonical NF-κB signaling required for lymphoid organ development. We showed previously that lymph node formation is ablated in IkkαLyve-1 mice constitutively lacking IKKα in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). We now reveal that loss of IKKα in LECs leads to the formation of BALT in the lung. Tertiary lymphoid structures appear only in the lungs of IkkαLyve-1 mice and are not present in any other tissues, and these highly organized BALT structures form after birth and in the absence of inflammation. Additionally, we show that IkkαLyve-1 mice challenged with influenza A virus (IAV) exhibit markedly improved survival and reduced weight loss compared with littermate controls. Importantly, we determine that the improved morbidity and mortality of IkkαLyve-1 mice is independent of viral load and rate of clearance because both mice control and clear IAV infection similarly. Instead, we show that IFN-γ levels are decreased, and infiltration of CD8 T cells and monocytes into IkkαLyve-1 lungs is reduced. We conclude that ablating IKKα in LECs promotes BALT formation and reduces the susceptibility of IkkαLyve-1 mice to IAV infection through a decrease in proinflammatory stimuli.">

        <tr id="Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and adaptive T lymphocytes promote tissue homeostasis and protective immune responses. Their production depends on the transcription factor GATA3, which is further elevated specifically in ILC2s and T helper 2 cells to drive type-2 immunity during tissue repair, allergic disorders, and anti-helminth immunity. The control of this crucial up-regulation is poorly understood. Using CRISPR screens in ILCs we identified previously unappreciated myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2d (Mef2d)-mediated regulation of GATA3-dependent type-2 lymphocyte differentiation. Mef2d-deletion from ILC2s and/or T cells specifically protected against an allergen lung challenge. Mef2d repressed Regnase-1 endonuclease expression to enhance IL-33 receptor production and IL-33 signaling and acted downstream of calcium-mediated signaling to translocate NFAT1 to the nucleus to promote type-2 cytokine-mediated immunity. Editor’s summary The transcription factor GATA3 controls the differentiation of naïve innate lymphoid cells and T cells into their type 2 effector subtypes, innate lymphoid 2 cells (ILC2s) and T helper 2 cells (TH2s), respectively, during immune responses. Szeto et al. found that another transcription factor, Mef2d, augmented the expression of GATA3 and the type-2 cytokine interleukin-13. The authors generated a mouse model that resulted in deletion of Mef2d in mature ILC2s specifically. Using it alongside established gene-knockout systems, the authors determined that Mef2d promotes the function of ILC2 and TH2 cells during lung inflammation. Mef2d controls gene expression associated with type 2 responses by inhibiting the expression of Regnase-1, which controls mRNA abundance, and by interacting with another transcription factor, nuclear factor of Measles outbreaks are on the rise in the US and other countries due to falling vaccination rates. There are currently no available specific antiviral treatments and only limited structural information about neutralizing antibodies that might be useful as therapeutics. Zyla et al. determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of the measles virus fusion protein in complex with an antibody or an engineered peptide, both of which can block fusion (see the Perspective by Aguilar). The authors identified multiple conformational states of the fusion protein and inferred that the antibody can trap an intermediate in the refolding process, thus halting fusion. Therefore, in addition to visualizing an important epitope that may be a therapeutic target, these structures provide mechanistic information about the viral fusion process in this system. —Michael A. Funk INTRODUCTION Type-2 lymphocytes, including group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and adaptive T helper 2 (TH2) cells, orchestrate protective antiparasitic immune responses but their misdirected activities against innocuous substances also underly allergies. Expression of the master transcription factor GATA3 is required to define type-2 lymphocyte identity by promoting the expression of interleukins (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 directly, and by repressing alternative ILC and T cell fates. Despite the key role of GATA3 in type-2 immunity it is unclear how GATA3 is up-regulated in ILC2s and TH2 cells specifically to activate the type-2 cytokine program. Furthermore, their transcriptional and functional similarities hinder efforts to use single gene markers to restrict gene modifications to ILC2s with high specificity, preventing ILC2-targeted effects from being studied in isolation. RATIONALE To identify regulators of GATA3, we performed in vitro CRISPR screens to delineate transcription factors required for the transition from GATA3-low ILC progenitors into GATA3-high ILC2s using a highly optimized ILC culture protocol designed to overcome the rarity of primary murine ILC progenitors and ILC2s. To confirm the importance of candidate genes in physiologically relevant experimental in vivo disease models, we constructed a next-generation mouse strain to knock out genes of interest in ILC2s specifically and avoid collateral effects on similar cell types. We used a synthetic gene circuit comprising three site-specific recombinases (SSRs) that intersect in their expression patterns, and formed a Boolean logic gate such that the expression of the Cre recombinase to excise the gene of interest would be expressed precisely in ILC2s (Boolean-ILC2-Cre, or BIC, mice). The BIC mice could then be used in combination with other mouse strains to restrict Mef2d-deletion to distinct lymphoid populations, e.g., all lymphocytes (Il7r), T cells (Cd4), and ILC2s to help define lineage-specific functions. RESULTS CRISPR screening identified Mef2d as a regulator of GATA3 and IL-13. Mice lacking Mef2d in lymphocytes developed markedly reduced type-2 innate and adaptive allergic lung responses. Further restriction of Mef2d deficiency to either T cells or ILC2s revealed contributions of Mef2d in both cell types to the overall type-2 immune response, depending on the experimental model employed. Mef2d-deficiency resulted in ILC2-specific reduction in GATA3, and the GATA3-regulated gene Il1rl1, which encodes ST2 (the receptor for the alarmin IL-33). Reduced ST2 expression led to decreased IL-33-mediated intracellular signaling and type-2 cytokine production. Mechanistically, Mef2d repressed Regnase-1, a known negative regulator of GATA3 and ST2, thereby enhancing ST2 production, promoting IL-33-signaling and driving cytokine expression. Notably, Mef2d was also important downstream of calcium signal-inducing ligands, such as leukotriene C4, enabling Mef2d to form a complex with NFAT1 to facilitate NFAT entry into the nucleus to up-regulate type-2 cytokine gene expression. CONCLUSION CRISPR screening and orthogonal recombinase-mediated gene targeting enabled the identification and validation of Mef2d as a regulator of type-2 immunity. Our studies have identified a pathway by which type-2-permissive high GATA3 expression is maintained in type-2 lymphocytes: Mef2d lies upstream of GATA3 in the regulation of the type-2 transcriptional cascade, by repressing the negative modulator Regnase-1. In addition, Mef2d participates in the regulation of calcium-NFAT1 signaling. Mef2d-regulated ILC2s and TH2 cells contribute to optimum development of type-2 immunity. Our high-throughput CRISPR-screening platform also identified additional regulators of GATA3 and lymphocyte function, demonstrating its suitability for aiding the discovery of new functional pathways in ILC biology. Furthermore, our proof-of-principle approach to employing Boolean logic gate–mediated gene circuitry can be flexibly adapted to studies in which investigation of specific cell subsets is valuable, for example dendritic cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and neurons. Identifying regulators of allergic immune responses. ILC2s are innate lymphocytes that contribute to asthma and allergies. Using CRISPR screens we identified Mef2d as a regulator of ILC2 function. By engineering the mouse genome, we constructed a Boolean logic gated gene circuit composed of a triad of orthogonal recombinases to delete Mef2d in ILC2s specifically. Using Mef2d-deficient mice challenged with allergens, we demonstrated that Mef2d promotes allergic immune responses.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms of postacute medical conditions and unexplained symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection [Long Covid (LC)] are incompletely understood. There is growing evidence that viral persistence, immune dysregulation, and T cell dysfunction may play major roles. We performed whole-body positron emission tomography imaging in a well-characterized cohort of 24 participants at time points ranging from 27 to 910 days after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using the radiopharmaceutical agent [18F]F-AraG, a selective tracer that allows for anatomical quantitation of activated T lymphocytes. Tracer uptake in the postacute COVID-19 group, which included those with and without continuing symptoms, was higher compared with prepandemic controls in many regions, including the brain stem, spinal cord, bone marrow, nasopharyngeal and hilar lymphoid tissue, cardiopulmonary tissues, and gut wall. T cell activation in the spinal cord and gut wall was associated with the presence of LC symptoms. In addition, tracer uptake in lung tissue was higher in those with persistent pulmonary symptoms specifically. Increased T cell activation in these tissues was also observed in many individuals without LC. Given the high [18F]F-AraG uptake detected in the gut, we obtained colorectal tissue for in situ hybridization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and immunohistochemical studies in a subset of five participants with LC symptoms. We identified intracellular SARS-CoV-2 single-stranded spike protein–encoding RNA in rectosigmoid lamina propria tissue in all five participants and double-stranded spike protein–encoding RNA in three participants up to 676 days after initial COVID-19, suggesting that tissue viral persistence could be associated with long-term immunologic perturbations. Total-body PET imaging and microscopy analysis of rectosigmoid biopsies reveal prolonged T cell activation and SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistence following COVID-19. Editor’s summary The term “Long Covid” covers a diverse array of symptoms that an individual might experience weeks to years after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Many drivers of Long Covid have been proposed, with supporting data for each. Here, Peluso et al. provide compelling evidence for two potential contributors: persistent SARS-CoV-2 and aberrant T cell activation. The authors used whole-body positron emission tomography imaging with a tracer that selectively tags activated T cells to show that those with Long Covid had certain tissues that were enriched for activated T cells in comparison with those without Long Covid. Moreover, because the gut was one of the sites of activated T cell enrichment, the authors analyzed gut biopsies from a subset of individuals with Long Covid. In these samples, the authors were able to identify the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; this feature was consistent across all five samples analyzed. These data suggest that viral persistence and sustained immune activation are linked to Long Covid. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="Beside suppressing immune responses, regulatory T cells (Tregs) maintain tissue homeostasis and control systemic metabolism. Whether iron is involved in Treg-mediated tolerance is completely unknown. Here, we showed that the transferrin receptor CD71 was upregulated on activated Tregs infiltrating human liver cancer. Mice with a Treg-restricted CD71 deficiency spontaneously developed a scurfy-like disease, caused by impaired perinatal Treg expansion. CD71-null Tregs displayed decreased proliferation and tissue-Treg signature loss. In perinatal life, CD71 deficiency in Tregs triggered hepatic iron overload response, characterized by increased hepcidin transcription and iron accumulation in macrophages. Lower bacterial diversity, and reduction of beneficial species, were detected in the fecal microbiota of CD71 conditional knock-out neonates. Our findings indicate that CD71-mediated iron absorption is required for Treg perinatal expansion and related to systemic iron homeostasis and bacterial gut colonization. Therefore, we hypothesize that Tregs establish nutritional tolerance through competition for iron during bacterial colonization after birth.">

        <tr id="Patients aged 65 years and older account for an increasing proportion of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Older TBI patients experience increased morbidity and mortality compared to their younger counterparts. Our prior data demonstrated that by blocking α4 integrin, anti-CD49d antibody (aCD49d Ab) abrogates CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the injured brain, improves survival, and attenuates neurocognitive deficits. Here, we aimed to uncover how aCD49d Ab treatment alters local cellular responses in the aged mouse brain. Consequently, mice incur age-associated toxic cytokine and chemokine responses long-term post-TBI. aCD49d Ab attenuates this response along with a T helper (Th)1/Th17 immunological shift and remediation of overall CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, aCD49d Ab reduces CD8+ T cells exhibiting higher effector status, leading to reduced clonal expansion in aged, but not young, mouse brains with chronic TBI. Together, aCD49d Ab is a promising therapeutic strategy for treating TBI in the older people. Graphic abstract Aged brains after TBI comprise two pools of CD8+ T cells. The aged brain has long been resided by a population of CD8+ T cells that’s exhaustive and dysfunctional. Post TBI, due to BBB impairment, functional CD8+ T cells primarily migrate into the brain parenchyma. Aged, injury-associated microglia with upregulated MHC class I molecules can present neoantigens such as neuronal and/or myelin debris in the injured brains to functional CD8+ T, resulting in downstream CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. aCD49d Ab treatment exerts its function by blocking the migration of functional effector CD8+ T cell population, leading to less cytotoxicity and resulting in improved TBI outcomes in aged mice.">

        <tr id="Actin-binding proteins (ABPs) have been established as important mediators of immune homeostasis, but their effects on lymphocytes are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that LSP1, an ABP, is a master regulator for innate immune responses in B lymphocytes. Lsp1 deficiency in B cells upregulated the expression of myeloid genes, including CD11b, CD11c, and myeloperoxidase, and bestowed myeloid morphology. Strikingly, Lsp1-deficient B cells exhibited dual functions, namely, strong phagocytic activity and high antibody (Ab) production, like ‘chimera’. The PKCβ-CEBPβ pathway was found to be required for such functional chimerism. Moreover, Lsp1 deficiency induced the myeloid B cell phenotype and autoantibody production in B cells and consequently accelerated the progression of experimental lupus in mice. These changes were abrogated by retinoic acid, which upregulated LSP1 expression. In lupus patients, LSP1 expression in B cells was downregulated and inversely correlated with myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression. Overall, this study reveals a new role of the ABP LSP1 in B lymphocytes and emphasizes its critical involvement in promoting autoimmune responses, particularly by generating functionally chimeric B cells.">

        <tr id="Muscle fatigue represents the most prevalent symptom of long-term COVID, with elusive pathogenic mechanisms. We performed a longitudinal study to characterize histopathological and transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle in a hamster model of respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared them with influenza A virus (IAV) and mock infections. Histopathological and bulk RNA sequencing analyses of leg muscles derived from infected animals at days 3, 30, and 60 post-infection showed no direct viral invasion but myofiber atrophy in the SARS-CoV-2 group, which was accompanied by persistent downregulation of the genes related to myofibers, ribosomal proteins, fatty acid β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes. While both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections induced acute and transient type I and II interferon responses in muscle, only the SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated TNF-α/NF-κB but not IL-6 signaling in muscle. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes, a skeletal muscle cell line, with combined IFN-γ and TNF-α but not with IFN-γ or TNF-α alone markedly impaired mitochondrial function. We conclude that a respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause myofiber atrophy and persistent energy metabolism suppression without direct viral invasion. The effects may be induced by the combined systemic interferon and TNF-α responses at the acute phase and may contribute to post-COVID-19 persistent muscle fatigue.">

        <tr id="Developing vaccines that promote CD8+ T cell memory is a challenge for infectious disease and cancer immunotherapy. TCF-1+ stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells are important determinants of long-lived memory. Yet, the developmental requirements for TSCM formation are unclear. Here, we identify the temporal window for type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR) blockade to drive TSCM cell generation. TSCM cells were transcriptionally distinct and emerged from a transitional precursor of exhausted (TPEX) cellular state concomitant with viral clearance. TSCM differentiation correlated with T cell retention within the lymph node paracortex, due to increased CXCR3 chemokine abundance which disrupted gradient formation. These affects were due a counterintuitive increase in IFNψ, which controlled cell location. Combining IFNAR inhibition with mRNA-LNP vaccination promoted specific TSCM differentiation and enhanced protection against chronic infection. These finding propose a new approach to vaccine design whereby modulation of inflammation promotes memory formation and function. HIGHLIGHTS Early, transient inhibition of the type I interferon (IFN) receptor (IFNAR) during acute viral infection promotes stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cell differentiation without establishing chronic infection. TSCM and precursor of exhausted (TPEX) cellular states are distinguished transcriptionally and by cell surface markers. Developmentally, TSCM cell differentiation occurs via a transition from a TPEX state coinciding with viral clearance. Transient IFNAR blockade increases IFNψ production to modulate the ligands of CXCR3 and couple TSCM differentiation to cell retention within the T cell paracortex of the lymph node. Specific promotion of TSCM cell differentiation with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccination elicits enhanced protection against chronic viral challenge.">

Cytokines and chemokines are cell signaling proteins used by immune cells to communicate with each other as well as with other cell types in the body. These proteins control systemic and local immune responses and levels of cytokines/chemokines in the TME have been associated with tumor outcomes. However, cytokines and chemokines have varied expression across cell types, tumors, and host conditions. Therefore, approaches to effectively study the production of these proteins at the single-cell level in the TME are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms governing the anti-cancer immune response. Here, we detail a protocol to assess the production of cytokines/chemokines across leukocyte populations in mouse tumors using RNA flow cytometry. Importantly, this method can be adapted with minimal changes to study various mouse and human tumors, other RNA analytes, and non-tumor tissues. With this approach, we characterize single-cell production of Ifnb1, Xcl1 and Ccl5 in mouse tumors and identify monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages as the main producers of type I interferon transcript Ifnb1 consistent across 4 different syngeneic tumor models.">

In this study, we report the novel finding that co-infection with influenza/A/X31 protects mice from death by Plasmodium berghei NK65-Edinburgh, a model of severe malarial pulmonary leak which underpins malaria-associated acute lung injury (MA-ALI) and malaria-associated acute respiratory distress (MA-ARDS). Co-infected mice exhibit equivalent parasitemia as mice with malaria only, suggesting that the survival phenotype is due to differences in immune kinetics. We demonstrated that the pulmonary leak typical of PbE is attenuated in co-infected mice without alteration in CD8 T cell activation and recruitment to the lung. Upon further examination of the immune response to influenza/A/X31 we identified a population of arginase 1-expressing alveolar macrophages that traffic to the lungs early during infection. In vitro these macrophages inhibit CD8 T cell activation and proliferation better than non-arginase expressing cells. Removal of arginase-1 expressing alveolar macrophages in vivo via administration of the antimetabolite gemcitabine removed the protective effects of influenza/A/X31co-infection on MA-ALI. This study opens a route to better understanding of how to modulate the immunopathology observed in pulmonary leak associated with severe malaria, which must be achieved to rationally design therapeutic interventions for MA-ARDS / MA-ALI.">

Our analysis revealed 18 distinct PBMC subsets, including an IFITM3 overexpressing Interferon-activated (IFN-activated) monocyte subset. We observed an increase in CD4+ T effector memory cells in patients with moderate to high disease activity (DAS28-CRP ≥ 3.2), and a decrease in non-classical monocytes in patients with low disease activity or remission (DAS28-CRP < 3.2). Pseudobulk analysis by cell type identified 168 differentially expressed genes between RA and matched controls, with a downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes in the gamma-delta T cells subset, alteration of genes associated with RA predisposition in the IFN-activated subset, and non-classical monocytes. Additionally, we identified a gene signature associated with moderate-high disease activity, characterized by upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes such as TNF, JUN, EGR1, IFIT2, MAFB, G0S2, and downregulation of genes including HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB5, TNFSF13B. Notably, cell-cell communication analysis revealed an upregulation of signaling pathways, including VISTA, in both moderate-high and remission-low disease activity contexts.

Previously, we developed a murine model of dust mite, ragweed, and aspergillus (DRA)-induced allergic lung inflammation followed by O3 exposure for mechanistic investigation. The present study used single cell RNA-sequencing for unbiased profiling of immune cells within the lungs of mice exposed to DRA, O3, or DRA+O3, to identify the components of the immune cell niche that contribute to AHR. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) had the greatest number of differentially expressed genes following DRA+O3, most of which were unique to the 2-hit exposure. Following DRA+O3, AMs activated transcriptional pathways related to cholesterol biosynthesis, degradation of the extracellular matrix, endosomal TLR processing, and various cytokine signals. We also identified AM and monocyte subset populations that were unique to the DRA+O3 group. These unique AMs activated gene pathways related to inflammation, sphingolipid metabolism, and bronchial constriction. The unique monocyte population had a gene signature that suggested phospholipase activation and increased degradation of the extracellular matrix. Flow cytometry analysis of BAL immune cells showed recruited monocyte-derived AMs after DRA and DRA+O3, but not after O3 exposure alone. O3 alone increased BAL neutrophils but this response was attenuated in DRA+O3 mice. DRA-induced changes in the airspace immune cell profile were reflected in elevated BAL cytokine/chemokine levels following DRA+O3 compared to O3 alone. The present work highlights the role of monocytes and AMs in the response to O3 and suggests that the presence of distinct subpopulations following allergic inflammation may contribute to O3-induced AHR.">

        <tr id="Therapies that harness the immune system to target and eliminate tumor cells have revolutionized cancer care. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which boosts the anti-tumor immune response by inhibiting negative regulators of T cell activation1–3, is remarkably successful in a subset of cancer patients, yet a significant proportion do not respond to treatment, emphasizing the need to understand factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy of ICB4–9. The gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a critical determinant of immune function and response to cancer immunotherapy, with multiple studies demonstrating association of microbiota composition with clinical response10–16. However, a mechanistic understanding of how gut commensal bacteria influence the efficacy of ICB remains elusive. Here we utilized a gut commensal microorganism, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induces an antigen-specific Th17 cell effector program17, to investigate how colonization with it affects the efficacy of ICB in restraining distal growth of tumors sharing antigen with SFB. We find that anti-PD-1 treatment effectively inhibits the growth of implanted SFB antigen-expressing melanoma only if mice are colonized with SFB. Through T cell receptor clonal lineage tracing, fate mapping, and peptide-MHC tetramer staining, we identify tumor-associated SFB-specific Th1-like cells derived from the homeostatic Th17 cells induced by SFB colonization in the small intestine lamina propria. These gut-educated ex-Th17 cells produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, and promote expansion and effector functions of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby controlling tumor growth. A better understanding of how distinct intestinal commensal microbes can promote T cell plasticity-dependent responses against antigen-sharing tumors may allow for the design of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Venous thromboembolism is common in individuals with chronic inflammatory diseases, but the pathogenic basis for this increased thrombotic risk remains poorly understood. Myeloid cell ‘trained immunity’ describes persistent innate immune cell memory arising from prior exposure to an inflammatory stimulus, leading to an enhanced immune response to subsequent unrelated stimuli. We identify enhanced myeloid cell prothrombotic activity as a novel maladaptive consequence of trained immunity. LPS stimulation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages trained previously with either β-glucan or free haem exhibited significantly enhanced procoagulant and antifibrinolytic gene expression and activity compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone. The β-glucan training-mediated increase in activated myeloid cell procoagulant activity was mediated by enhanced acid sphingomyelinase-mediated tissue factor (TF) functional decryption. Furthermore, pre-treatment with methyltransferase and acetyltransferase inhibitors to erase epigenetic marks associated with innate immune memory diminished trained macrophage TF gene expression in β-glucan-trained macrophages. Functional analysis of splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan-trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Remarkably, monocyte procoagulant activity increased proportionately with time since β-glucan administration, before plateauing at 4 weeks. Furthermore, haematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid isolated from β-glucan-trained mice possessed enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice. Trained immunity and associated metabolic perturbations may therefore represent novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in immunothrombotic disease development, opening new avenues for targeted intervention.">

        <tr id="Erythroid cells, serving as progenitors and precursors to erythrocytes responsible for oxygen transport, were shown to exhibit an immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory phenotype. Previous investigations from our research group have revealed an antimicrobial gene expression profile within murine bone marrow erythroid cells which suggested a role for erythroid cells in innate immunity. In the present study, we focused on elucidating the characteristics of human bone marrow erythroid cells through comprehensive analyses, including NanoString gene expression profiling utilizing the Immune Response V2 panel, a BioPlex examination of chemokine and TGF-beta family proteins secretion, and analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data. Our findings demonstrate that an erythroid cell subpopulation manifests a myeloid-like gene expression signature comprised of antibacterial immunity and neutrophil chemotaxis genes which suggests an involvement of human erythroid cells in the innate immunity. Furthermore, we found that human erythroid cells secreted CCL22, CCL24, CXCL5, CXCL8, and MIF chemokines. The ability of human erythroid cells to express these chemokines might facilitate the restriction of immune cells in the bone marrow under normal conditions or contribute to the ability of erythroid cells to induce local immunosuppression by recruiting immune cells in their immediate vicinity in case of extramedullary hematopoiesis.">

Immune cells are reported to upregulate CD47 during infection, however, the role of CD47 in innate and adaptive immune cells remains unclear.


METHODS
To bridge this knowledge gap, we analysed our single cell (sc)-RNA dataset along with other publicly available sc-RNA datasets from healthy controls, people with HIV-1 (PWH) and COVID-19 patients. We characterized each immune cell based on low, intermediate, and high expression of CD47 .


RESULTS
Our analyses revealed that CD47 high pDCs and monocytes exhibited relatively higher expression of IFN-α regulatory genes, antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and MHC-I associated genes compared to CD47 inter. and CD47 low cells. Furthermore, CD47 high NK and CD8+ T cells showed higher expression of antiviral ISGs, as well as genes encoding for cytotoxic markers like granzyme B, perforin, granulysin, interferon gamma and NKG7. Additionally, CD47 high CD8+ T cells expressed higher levels of PD-1 and LAG-3 genes. Lastly, we found that CD47 high B cells had enriched expression of genes involved in cell activation and humoral responses.


CONCLUSION
Overall, our analyses revealed that innate and adaptive immune cells expressing elevated activation and functional gene signatures also express higher CD47 levels.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immunotherapies targeting T cells in solid cancers are revolutionizing clinical treatment. Novel immunotherapies have had extremely limited benefit for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we characterized the immune microenvironment of t(8;21) AML patients to determine how immune cell infiltration status influenced prognosis. Methods Through multi-omics studies of primary and longitudinal t(8;21) AML samples, we characterized the heterogeneous immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and their immune checkpoint gene expression. Further external cohorts were also included in this research. Results CD8+ T cells were enriched and HAVCR2 and TIGIT were upregulated in the CD34+CD117dim%-High group; these features are known to be associated with immune exhaustion. Data integration analysis of single-cell dynamics revealed that a subset of T cells (cluster_2) (highly expressing GZMB, NKG7, PRF1 and GNLY) evolved and expanded markedly in the drug-resistant stage after relapse. External cohort analysis confirmed that the cluster_2 T-cell signature could be utilized to stratify patients by overall survival outcome. Discussion In conclusion, we discovered a distinct T-cell signature by scRNA-seq that was correlated with disease progression and drug resistance. Our research provides a novel system for classifying patients based on their immune microenvironment.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Dendritic cells (DCs) are the main antigen presenting cells of the immune system and are essential for anti-tumor responses. DC-based immunotherapies are used in cancer treatment, but their functionality is not optimized and their clinical efficacy is currently limited. Approaches to improve DC functionality in anti-tumor immunity are therefore required. We have previously shown that the loss of β2-integrin-mediated adhesion leads to epigenetic reprogramming of bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs), resulting in an increased expression of costimulatory markers (CD86, CD80, and CD40), cytokines (IL-12) and the chemokine receptor CCR7. We now show that the loss of β2-integrin-mediated adhesion of BM-DCs also leads to a generally suppressed metabolic profile, with reduced metabolic rate, decreased ROS production, and lowered glucose uptake in cells. The mRNA levels of glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters were reduced, indicating transcriptional regulation of the metabolic phenotype. Surprisingly, although signaling through a central regulator of immune cell metabolisms, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), was increased in BM-DCs with dysfunctional integrins, rapamycin treatment revealed that mTOR signaling was not involved in suppressing DC metabolism. Instead, bioinformatics and functional analyses showed that the Ikaros transcription factor may be involved in regulating the metabolic profile of non-adhesive DCs. Inversely, we found that induction of metabolic stress through treatment of cells with low levels of an inhibitor of glycolysis, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), led to increased BM-DC activation. Specifically, 2DG treatment led to increased levels of Il-12 and Ccr7 mRNA, increased production of IL-12, increased levels of cell surface CCR7 and increased in vitro migration and T cell activation potential. Furthermore, 2DG treatment led to increased histone methylation in cells (H3K4me3, H3K27me3), indicating metabolic reprogramming. Finally, metabolic stress induced by 2DG treatment led to improved BM-DC-mediated anti-tumor responses in vivo in a melanoma cancer model, B16-OVA. In conclusion, our results indicate a role for β2-integrin-mediated adhesion in regulating a novel type of metabolic reprogramming of DCs and DC-mediated anti-tumor responses, which may be targeted to enhance DC-mediated anti-tumor responses in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a pandemic and contributes to long-lasting morbidity. Several studies have investigated immediate cellular and humoral immune responses during acute infection. However, little is known about long-term effects of COVID-19 on the immune system.


METHODS
We performed a longitudinal investigation of cellular and humoral immune parameters in 106 non-vaccinated subjects ten weeks (10 w) and ten months (10 m) after their first SARS-CoV-2 infection. Peripheral blood immune cells were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry, serum cytokines were examined by multiplex technology. Antibodies specific for the Spike protein (S), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the nucleocapsid protein (NC) were determined. All parameters measured 10 w and 10 m after infection were compared with those of a matched, noninfected control group (n = 98).


RESULTS
Whole blood flow cytometric analyses revealed that 10 m after COVID-19, convalescent patients compared to controls had reduced absolute granulocyte, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts, involving T, B, and NK cells, in particular CD3+CD45RA+CD62L+CD31+ recent thymic emigrant T cells and non-class-switched CD19+IgD+CD27+ memory B cells. Cellular changes were associated with a reversal from Th1- to Th2-dominated serum cytokine patterns. Strong declines of NC- and S-specific antibody levels were associated with younger age (by 10.3 years, p < .01) and fewer CD3-CD56+ NK and CD19+CD27+ B memory cells. Changes of T-cell subsets at 10 m such as normalization of effector and Treg numbers, decline of RTE, and increase of central memory T cell numbers were independent of antibody decline pattern.


CONCLUSIONS
COVID-19 causes long-term reduction of innate and adaptive immune cells which is associated with a Th2 serum cytokine profile. This may provide an immunological mechanism for long-term sequelae after COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Due to the historical dogma, that host defense against intracellular pathogens is mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence suggests a more complex and multifaceted role for B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. They accumulate at the side of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity continue to be unraveled. Apart from antibodies, B cells produce a wide range of cytokines, which can influence the local immune response. Here we addressed the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10) secreting B cells in long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Our research highlights the previously unknown role of B cell-derived IL-10 as a negative regulator of protective immunity in TB. For the first time, we demonstrate that mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 show increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, as evidenced by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was accompanied by male-specific immune alterations, indicating a previously unknown sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key effectors in co-ordinating inflammatory and immune responses to threats to the host. How macrophages decipher diverse danger signals to tailor inflammatory responses remains an unanswered question. Cell volume control is critical for normal cellular function. Disturbances in extracellular and intracellular homeostasis induce changes in cell volume, but the impact of disruptions in cell volume in controlling macrophage inflammatory responses is poorly understood. Here, we discover that macrophages use cell volume control as a bona fide danger sensing mechanism to promote and augment inflammatory responses. Using macrophages deficient in the volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), which lack cell volume control under hypo-osmotic conditions, we show that disruptions in cell volume are sensed by macrophages to drive a large transcriptomic response and induction of inflammation. Cell volume disruption, particularly loss of cell volume control, induces type I interferon signalling through a DNA– and STING-dependent mechanism, but independent of cGAS and 2’3’cGAMP transport. Further, we found that cell volume changes synergise with diverse pathogen-mediated signalling to augment type I interferon responses and exacerbate the cytokine storm in a mouse model of hyperinflammation. Our findings highlight cell volume as an important regulator in shaping inflammatory responses, adding to our understanding of how macrophages sense complex danger signals and threats.">

        <tr id="Objective: The immune response initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is poorly elucidated. We aimed to access and compare the antiviral cellular responses and lymphocytes activation between healthy pregnancies and pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We detected the immunological changes of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of healthy non-pregnant women, non-pregnant women with COVID-19, healthy pregnant women, pregnant women with COVID-19 and convalescent group by flow cytometry. In vitro blockade was used to identify NKT-like cell activation through ICOS-ICOSL pathway. Results: We found that CD3+CD56+ NKT-like cells decreased significantly in COVID-19 positive pregnant women compared to healthy pregnant women. NKT-like cells of pregnant women expressed higher level of activating receptors CD69 and NKp46 after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly, they also increased the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule ICOS. NKT-like cells of pregnant women with COVID-19 up-regulated the expression of IFN-γ, CD107a and Ki67. Meanwhile, we found that ICOSL expression was significantly increased on pDCs in pregnant women with COVID-19. Blocking ICOS in vitro significantly decreased the antiviral activity of NKT-like cells in COVID-19 positive pregnant women, suggesting that ICOS-ICOSL may play an important role in the virus clearance by NKT-like cells. Conclusions: During SARS-CoV-2 infection, NKT-like cells of pregnant women activated through ICOS-ICOSL pathway and played an important role in the antiviral response.">

        <tr id="The ability of an organism to overcome infectious diseases has traditionally been linked to killing invading pathogens. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that, apart from restricting pathogen loads, organismal survival is coupled to an additional yet poorly understood mechanism called disease tolerance. Here we report that p16High immune cells play a key role in establishing disease tolerance. We found that the FDA-approved BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a potent and rapid inducer of p16High immune subsets both in mice and humans. In turn, p16High immune cells were indispensable for counteracting different lethal conditions, including LPS-induced sepsis, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and ionizing irradiation. Mechanistically, we propose that activation of TLR7 or a low physiological activity of STING is sufficient to induce p16High immune subset that, in turn, establishes a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance. Furthermore, containing these signals within a beneficial range by deleting MDA5 that appeared sufficient to maintain a low activity of STING, induces p16High immune cells and delays organ deterioration upon aging with improved healthspan.

        <tr id="The effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain rapidly wanes over time. Growing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that influenza vaccination is associated with a reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigate the cross-reactive immune responses of influenza vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides based on in vitro study. Our data indicate enhanced activation-induced-marker (AIM) expression on CD4+ T cells in influenza-vaccination (IV)-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon stimulation with spike-protein-peptide pools. The fractions of other immune cell subtypes, including CD8+ T cells, monocytes, NK cells, and antigen-presenting cells, were not changed between IV-treated and control PBMCs following ex vivo spike-protein-peptide stimulation. However, the classical antiviral (IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-1RA) cytokine responses to spike-protein-peptide stimulation were still enhanced in PBMCs from both IV-immunized adult and aged mice. Decreased expression of proinflammatory IL-1β, IL-12p40, and TNF-α is associated with inhibited levels of histone acetylation in PBMCs from IV-treated mice. Remarkably, prior immunity to SARS-CoV-2 does not result in modification of histone acetylation or hemagglutinin-protein-induced cytokine responses. This response is antibody-independent but can be mediated by manipulating the histone acetylation of PBMCs. These data experimentally support that influenza vaccination could induce modification of histone acetylation in immune cells and reveal the existence of potential cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which may provide insights for the adjuvant of influenza vaccine to limit COVID-19-related inflammatory responses.">

Primarily, they serve to regulate the immune response by limiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, reducing inflammation in infected tissue, and limiting virus-specific T cell responses.

Not much is known about the impact of Tregs during severe influenza. In the present study, we show that CD4+/CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs are strongly involved in disease progression during influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice. By comparing sublethal with lethal dose infection in vivo, we found that not the viral load but an increased number of CD4+/CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs may impair the immune response by suppressing virus specific CD8+ T cells and favors disease progression. Moreover, the transfer of induced Tregs into mice with mild disease symptoms had a negative and prolonged effect on disease outcome, emphasizing their importance for pathogenesis. Furthermore, treatment with MEK-inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction of induced Tregs in vitro and in vivo and positively influenced the progression of the disease. Our results demonstrate that CD4+/CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs are involved in the pathogenesis of severe influenza and indicate the potential of the MEK-inhibitor zapnometinib to modulate CD4+/CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs. Thus, making MEK-inhibitors even more promising for the treatment of severe influenza virus infections.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β cells and involves an interplay between β cells and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), an enzyme implicated in inflammatory pathways in β cells and macrophages, using a mouse model in which the endogenous mouse Alox15 gene is replaced by the human ALOX12 gene. Our findings demonstrate that VLX-1005, a potent 12-LOX inhibitor, effectively delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes in human gene replacement non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. By spatial proteomics analysis, VLX-1005 treatment resulted in marked reductions in infiltrating T and B cells and macrophages with accompanying increases in immune checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and PD-1, suggesting a shift towards an immune-suppressive microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of isolated islets from inhibitor-treated mice revealed significant alteration of cytokine-responsive pathways. RNA sequencing of polarized proinflammatory macrophages showed that VLX-1005 significantly reduced the interferon response. Our studies demonstrate that the ALOX12 human replacement gene mouse provides a platform for the preclinical evaluation of LOX inhibitors and supports VLX-1005 as an inhibitor of human 12-LOX that engages the enzymatic target and alters the inflammatory phenotypes of islets and macrophages to promote the delay of autoimmune diabetes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective Unique metabolic requirements accompany the development and functional fates of immune cells. How cellular metabolism is important in natural killer (NK) cells and their memory‐like differentiation in bacterial infections remains elusive. Methods Here, we utilise our established NK cell memory assay to investigate the metabolic requirement for memory‐like NK cell formation and function in response to the Gram‐negative intracellular bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP), the causative agent of melioidosis. Results We demonstrate that CD160+ memory‐like NK cells upon BP stimulation upregulate glucose and amino acid transporters in a cohort of recovered melioidosis patients which is maintained at least 3‐month post‐hospital admission. Using an in vitro assay, human BP‐specific CD160+ memory‐like NK cells show metabolic priming including increased expression of glucose and amino acid transporters with elevated glucose uptake, increased mTOR activation and mitochondrial membrane potential upon BP re‐stimulation. Antigen‐specific and cytokine‐induced IFN‐γ production of this memory‐like NK cell subset are highly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) with some dependency on glycolysis, whereas the formation of CD160+ memory‐like NK cells in vitro is dependent on fatty acid oxidation and OXPHOS and further increased by metformin. Conclusion This study reveals the link between metabolism and cellular function of memory‐like NK cells, which can be exploited for vaccine design and for monitoring protection against Gram‐negative bacterial infection.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in virus control. However, it has remained largely unclear whether NK cell mobilization in SARS-CoV-2 infections is beneficial or pathologic. To address this deficit, we employed a validated experimental NK cell depletion non-human primate (NHP) model with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant B.1.617.2 challenge. Viral loads (VL), NK cell numbers, activation, proliferation, and functional measures were evaluated in blood and tissues. In non-depleted (control) animals, infection rapidly induced NK cell expansion, activation, and increased tissue trafficking associated with VL. Strikingly, we report that experimental NK cell depletion leads to higher VL, longer duration of viral shedding, significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, and overt lung damage. Overall, we find the first significant and conclusive evidence for NK cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and disease pathology. These data indicate that adjunct therapies for infection could largely benefit from NK cell-targeted approaches.">

However, no single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies have characterized the properties and networks of individual immune cells in T2D. Here, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from non-diabetes and T2D patients by scRNA-seq. We found that CD14 monocytes in T2D patients were in a pro-inflammatory state and intermediate monocytes expressed more MHC class II genes. In T2D patients, cytotoxic CD4 T cells, effector memory CD8 T cells, and γδ T cells have increased cytotoxicity and clonal expansion. B cells were characterized by increased differentiation into intermediate B cells, plasma cells, and isotype class switching with increased expression of soluble antibody genes. These results suggest that monocytes, T cells, and B cells could interact to induce chronic inflammation in T2D patients with pro-inflammatory characteristics.">

        <tr id="Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules present endogenous peptides to CD8+ T-cells for immunosurveillance of infections and cancers. Recent studies revealed unexpected heterogeneity in MHC I expression among cells of different lineages. While respiratory diseases rank among the leading causes of mortality, studies in mice showed that lung epithelial cells (LECs) express lower MHC I levels than all other tested cell types. The present study aimed to evaluate MHC I expression in human LECs from parenchymal explants using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunostaining of primary human LECs. After confirming the low constitutive MHC I expression in human LECs, we observed a significant upregulation of MHC I across three chronic respiratory diseases: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and cystic fibrosis (CF). Additionally, we unveiled an unexpected sexual dimorphism in MHC I expression in both health and disease, with males exhibiting higher levels of MHC I under steady-state conditions. Gene expression analyses suggest that differential redox balance between sexes is instrumental in this dimorphism. Our study unveils the complex interplay between MHC I expression, sex, and respiratory diseases. Since, in other models, MHC I upregulation contributes to the development of immunopathologies, we propose that it might have a similar impact on chronic lung diseases. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study shows that MHC I expression is very low in healthy LECs but escalates significantly in three chronic respiratory diseases, potentially contributing to disease progression. Furthermore, sex-specific divergences in LEC MHC I levels hint at distinct susceptibilities to chronic lung inflammation between males and females. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="One possible determinant of COVID-19 severity is immune imprinting (IP) by Common Cold Coronavirus (CCCV). As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns. Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.">

        <tr id="Persistent inflammation in chronic HIV infection may affect immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed in people with HIV (PWH) with effective cART. There were no significant differences in any of the tested cytokines between COVID-19 severity in PWH, while most of them were significantly higher in individuals with severe disease in HIV-uninfected individuals, suggesting that excess cytokines release by hyper-inflammatory responses does not occur in severe COVID-19 with HIV infection. The strong associations between the cytokines observed in HIV-uninfected individuals, especially between IFN-α/TNF-α and other cytokines, were lost in PWH. The steady state plasma levels of IP-10, ICAM-1, and CD62E were significantly higher in PWH, indicating that PWH are in an enhanced inflammatory state. Loss of the several inter-cytokine correlations were observed in in vitro LPS stimuli-driven cytokines production in PWH. These data suggest that inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection in PWH are distinct from those in HIV-uninfected individuals, partially due to the underlying inflammatory state and/or impairment of innate immune cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract CD19‐targeted chimeric antigen receptor T‐cell (CAR‐T) immunotherapy has transformed the management of relapsed/refractory large B‐cell lymphoma (LBCL), yet durable remissions are observed in less than half of treated patients. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key and understudied factor impacting CD19 CAR‐T therapy outcomes. Using NanoString nCounter transcriptome profiling (n = 24) and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC, n = 15), we studied the TME in pretreatment biopsies from patients with LBCL undergoing CD19 CAR‐T therapy. Patients who achieved complete response (CR) after CAR‐T therapy demonstrated higher expression of genes associated with T‐cell trafficking and function, whereas those who did not achieve CR had higher expression of genes associated with macrophages and T‐cell dysfunction. Distinct patterns of immune infiltration and fibrosis in the TME were associated with CAR‐T therapy outcomes, and these findings were corroborated using artificial intelligence‐assisted image analyses. Patients who achieved CR had a lower proportion of the biopsy occupied by an interspersed immune infiltrate and a higher proportion of hypocellular/fibrotic regions. Furthermore, mIHC revealed lower density of CD4+ T cells and higher densities of both macrophages and tumor cells expressing PD‐L1 in non‐CR patients. Spatial analysis revealed that PD‐1+ T cells were in close proximity to PD‐L1+ macrophages or PD‐L1+ tumor cells in patients who did not compared to those who did achieve CR after CAR‐T therapy. These findings suggest that morphologic patterns in the TME and engagement of the PD‐1/PD‐L1 axis in pretreatment biopsies may impact CD19 CAR‐T immunotherapy response in patients with LBCL.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The Hodgkin and Reed – Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) actively modify the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) attracting immunosuppressive cells and expressing inhibitory molecules. A high frequency of myeloid cells in the TME is correlated with an unfavorable prognosis, but more specific and rare cell populations lack precise markers. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been identified in the peripheral blood of cHL patients, where they appear to be correlated with disease aggressiveness. TNFRSF9 (CD137) is a T cell co-stimulator expressed by monocytic and dendritic cells. Its expression has also been described in HRS cells, where it is thought to play a role in reducing antitumor responses. Here, we perform qualitative and quantitative analyses of lymphocytic and MDSC subtypes and determine the CD137 cell distribution in cHL primary tumors using multiplex immunofluorescence and automated multispectral imaging. The results were correlated with patients’ clinical features. Cells were stained with specific panels of immune checkpoint markers (PD-1, PD-L1, CD137), tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (CD3, PD-1), and monocytic cells/MDSCs (CD68, CD14, CD33, Arg-1, CD11b). This approach allowed us to identify distinct phenotypes and to analyze spatial interactions between immune subpopulations and tumor cells. The results confirm CD137 expression by T, monocytic and HRS cells. In addition, the expression of CD137, T exhausted cells, and monocytic MDSCs (m-MDSCs) in the vicinity of malignant HRS cells were associated with a worse prognosis. Our findings reveal new elements of the TME that mediate immune escape, and confirm CD137 as a candidate target for immunotherapy in cHL.">

        <tr id="Reasons for the spectrum of severity of active tuberculosis (TB) disease are incompletely understood. We sought to identify master regulators of host immune responses that determine disease severity in pulmonary TB. We performed molecular profiling of human in vivo immune responses to discover associations with the extent of radiographic TB disease in a patient cohort. We then undertook mechanistic studies to test causality for the observed associations using the zebrafish larval Mycobacterium marinum infection model. Transcriptional profiling of human immune recall responses to tuberculin skin test (TST) challenge, a surrogate for immune responses to TB in the lung, revealed that type I interferon activity in the TST transcriptome was inversely associated with radiological disease severity. Abrogation of type I interferon signalling, achieved by CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of stat2, led to increased susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to M. marinum infection, as a result of reduced recruitment of myeloid cells required to restrict mycobacterial growth, to the site of disease. Our data support a host protective role for type I interferon responses in mycobacterial infection, with potential applications for risk-stratification of adverse outcomes and development of a host-directed therapy to mitigate against severe disease.">

In this paper, we review the most recent studies on the complicated dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune system, highlight the importance of understanding these dynamics in developing effective treatments and formulate potent management strategies for COVID-19. We describe the activation of the host's innate immunity and the subsequent adaptive immune response following infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the review emphasizes the immune evasion strategies of the SARS-CoV-2, including inhibition of interferon production and induction of cytokine storms, along with the resulting clinical outcomes. Finally, we assess the efficacy of current treatment strategies, including antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and anti-inflammatory treatments, and discuss their role in providing immunity and preventing severe disease.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) show signs of low-grade inflammation, which is related to the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the underlying triggers remain unknown. The gut microbiota is a plausible source as it comprises pro-inflammatory bacteria, bacterial metabolites and viruses, including (bacterio)phages. These prokaryotic viruses have been shown to mediate inflammatory responses in gastrointestinal disease. Given the differences in phage populations in healthy individuals versus those with cardiometabolic diseases such as T2D, we here questioned whether phages from T2D individuals would have increased immunogenic potential. To address this, we isolated intestinal phages from a fresh stool sample of healthy controls and individuals with newly diagnosed, treatment-naive T2D. Phages were purified using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation and incubated with healthy donor dendritic cells (DCs) and autologous T cells. Donors with T2D had slightly higher free viral particle numbers compared to healthy controls (p = .1972), which has been previously associated with disease states. Further, phages from T2D induced a higher inflammatory response in DCs and T cells than phages from HC. For example, the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on DCs (p < .001) and interferon-y secretion from T cells (p < .01) were increased when comparing the two groups. These results suggest that phages might play a role in low-grade inflammation in T2D individuals.">

        <tr id="Background Despite continuous improvements in the new target and construction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T, relapse remains a significant challenge following CAR-T therapy. Tumor microenvironment (TME) strongly correlates with the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA), which exerts a multifaceted and controversial role in regulating the TME, acts not only as a ligand on antigen-presenting cells but also functions as a receptor on T cells. However, the characteristics and underlying mechanisms governing endogenous T-cell activation by VISTA, which are pivotal for reshaping the TME, remain incompletely elucidated. Methods The immunocompetent B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), lymphoma, and melanoma murine models were employed to investigate the characteristics of endogenous T cells within the TME following CD19 and hCAIX CAR-T cell therapy, respectively. Furthermore, we examined the role of VISTA controlled by interferon (IFN)-γ signaling in regulating endogenous T-cell activation and functionality in B-ALL mice. Results We demonstrated that the administration of CD19 CAR-T or hCAIX CAR-T cell therapy elicited augmented immune responses of endogenous T cells within the TME of B-ALL, lymphoma, and melanoma mice, thereby substantiating the efficacy of CAR-T cell efficacy. However, in the TME lacking IFN-γ signaling, VISTA levels remained elevated, resulting in attenuated cytotoxicity of endogenous T cells and reduced B-ALL recipient survival. Mice treated with CD19 CAR-T cells exhibited increased proportions of endogenous memory T cells during prolonged remission, which possessed the tumor-responsive capabilities to protect against B-ALL re-challenge. Compared with wild-type (WT) CAR-T treated mice, the administration of IFN-γ−/− CAR-T to both WT and IFN-γ−/− recipients resulted in a reduction in the numbers of endogenous CD4+ and CD8+ effectors, while exhibiting increased populations of naïve-like CD4+ T and memory CD8+ T cells. VISTA expression consistently remained elevated in resting or memory CD4+ T cells, with distinct localization from programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expressing T subsets. Blocking the VISTA signal enhanced dendritic cell-induced proliferation and cytokine production by syngeneic T cells. Conclusion Our findings confirm that endogenous T-cell activation and functionality are regulated by VISTA, which is associated with the therapeutic efficiency of CAR-T and provides a promising therapeutic strategy for relapse cases in CAR-T therapy.">

        <tr id="Background CD24 plays a crucial role not only in promoting tumor progression and metastasis but also in modulating macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity. However, the impact of tumor CD24 on the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains poorly explored. Here, we investigated the role of CD24a, murine CD24 gene, in the progression and immune dynamics of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods: We employed Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology to perform a gene knockout of Cd24a in 4T1 cells. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the distribution and number of immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and macrophages, within tumors, spleens, and bone marrow. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to detect these immune cells in tumor sections. Additionally, ANDOR Dragonfly High-Speed Confocal was used to perform three-dimensional (3D) mapping of mouse tumors. Results Our study showed that knocking out CD24a significantly impeded tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. Flow cytometry and IF analysis revealed that the loss of CD24a transformed tumor microenvironment from cold to hot by promoting the infiltration of M1 macrophages, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and CD49b+ natural killer (NK) cells while reducing the recruitment and expansion of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) in the TME. Additionally, the 3D mapping of TME further validated the “hot state” of CD24a knockout tumors. Conclusions Our study provides the first evidence that targeting CD24a could effectively reprogram the TME, enhancing its immunogenicity, and transforming immune cold tumors into hot tumors. This strategy may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing the immune response against poorly immunogenic tumors.">

        <tr id="Differential antiviral T cell immunity in early life impacts the clinical outcome of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we found delayed enrichment of early-life murine CMV-specific CD8 T cells due to a general deficiency of αβ T cells. Adoptive transfer of naïve adult T cells into neonates did not protect due to a blockade of CD8 but not of CD4 effector T cell differentiation. Early-life deficiency of critical signal 3 cytokines during T cell priming resulted in the appearance of non-cytotoxic CD8 effector T cells whereas the effector phase of adult-primed T cells was not disrupted in neonates. Accordingly, we found an overall low number of antiviral human CD8 T cells in newborns with congenital CMV. Together, this study suggests defective CD8 T cell immunity as an important factor explaining the higher risk for CMV disease in the early-life phase.">

These conditions are primarily characterized by an immoderate activation of the immune system or deviant immune responses, involving diverse immune components including immune cells, antibodies, and inflammatory mediators. However, the precise molecular dysregulation underlying numerous individual cases of these diseases and unique subsets respond under disease conditions remains elusive. Comprehending the mechanisms and determinants governing the homeostasis and functionality of diseases could offer potential therapeutic opportunities for intervention. Mass cytometry enables precise and high-throughput quantitative measurement of proteins within individual cells by utilizing antibodies labeled with rare heavy metal isotopes. Imaging mass cytometry employs mass spectrometry to obtain spatial information on cell-to-cell interactions within tissue sections, simultaneously utilizing more than 40 markers. The application of single-cell mass cytometry presents a unique opportunity to conduct highly multiplexed analysis at the single-cell level, thereby revolutionizing our understanding of cell population heterogeneity and hierarchy, cellular states, multiplexed signaling pathways, proteolysis products, and mRNA transcripts specifically in the context of many autoimmune diseases. This information holds the potential to offer novel approaches for the diagnosis, prognostic assessment, and monitoring responses to treatment, thereby enriching our strategies in managing the respective conditions. This review summarizes the present-day utilization of single-cell mass cytometry in studying immune-related skin diseases, highlighting its advantages and limitations. This technique will become increasingly prevalent in conducting extensive investigations into these disorders, ultimately yielding significant contributions to their accurate diagnosis and efficacious therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can increase the risk of neuroinflammation, and subsequent neurodegenerative diseases. Certain IAV strains, such as avian H7N7 subtype, possess neurotropic properties, enabling them to directly invade the brain parenchyma and infect neurons and glia cells. Host sex significantly influences the severity of IAV infections. Studies indicate that females of the reproductive age exhibit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses to IAVs compared to males. This heightened immune response correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, and potential neuronal damage in females. Understanding the sex-specific neurotropism of IAV and associated mechanisms leading to adverse neurological outcomes is essential. Our study reveals that primary hippocampal cultures from female mice show heightened interferon-β and pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion following neurotropic IAV infection. We observed sex-specific differences in microglia activation: both sexes showed a transition into a hyper-ramified state, but only male-derived microglia exhibited an increase in amoeboid-shaped cells. These disparities extended to alterations in neuronal morphology. Neurons derived from female mice displayed increased spine density within 24 h post-infection, while no significant change was observed in male cultures. This aligns with sex-specific differences in microglial synaptic pruning. Data suggest that amoeboid-shaped microglia preferentially target postsynaptic terminals, potentially reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. Conversely, hyper-ramified microglia may focus on presynaptic terminals, potentially limiting viral spread. In conclusion, our findings underscore the utility of primary hippocampal cultures, incorporating microglia, as an effective model to study sex-specific, virus-induced effects on brain-resident cells.">

Alphavirus infection induces robust immune responses in infected hosts, leading to the upregulation of several cytokines and chemokines, including chemokine C ligand 4 (CCL4). CCL4 is a chemoattractant for immune cells such as T cells, natural killer cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, recruiting these cells to the site of infection, stimulating the release of proinflammatory mediators, and inducing T cell differentiation. CCL4 has been found at high levels in both the acute and chronic phases of chikungunya disease; however, the role of CCL4 in arthritogenic alphavirus disease development remains unexplored. Here, we tested the effect of CCL4 on MAYV infection in mice through antibody depletion and treatment with recombinant mouse CCL4. We observed no differences in mice depleted of CCL4 or treated with recombinant CCL4 in terms of disease progression such as weight loss and footpad swelling or the development of viremia. CCL4 uses the G protein-coupled receptor C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). To determine whether CCR5 deficiency would alter disease outcomes or virus replication in mice, we inoculated CCR5 knockout (CCR5-/-) mice with MAYV and observed no effect on disease development and immune cell profile of blood and footpads between CCR5-/- and wild type mice. These studies failed to identify a clear role for CCL4 or its receptor CCR5 in MAYV infection.">

We investigated the ATP-P2X7R axis in circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells during Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. Methods We analyzed two cohorts: children with RSV infection (moderate, n=30; severe, n=21) and healthy children (n=23). We utilized ELISA to quantify the levels of PreF RSV protein-specific IgG antibodies, IL-21 cytokine, and soluble P2X7R (sP2X7R) in both plasma and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Additionally, luminometry was employed to determine ATP levels in plasma, NPA and supernatant culture. The frequency of cTfh cells, P2X7R expression, and plasmablasts were assessed by flow cytometry. To evaluate apoptosis, proliferation, and IL-21 production by cTfh cells, we cultured PBMCs in the presence of Bz-ATP and/or P2X7R antagonist (KN-62) and a flow cytometry analysis was performed. Results In children with severe RSV disease, we observed diminished titers of neutralizing anti-PreF IgG antibodies. Additionally, severe infections, compared to moderate cases, were associated with fewer cTfh cells and reduced plasma levels of IL-21. Our investigation revealed dysregulation in the ATP-P2X7R pathway during RSV infection. This was characterized by elevated ATP levels in both plasma and NPA samples, increased expression of P2X7R on cTfh cells, lower levels of sP2X7R, and heightened ATP release from PBMCs upon stimulation, particularly evident in severe cases. Importantly, ATP exposure decreased cTfh proliferative response and IL-21 production, while promoting their apoptosis. The P2X7R antagonist KN-62 mitigated these effects. Furthermore, disease severity positively correlated with ATP levels in plasma and NPA samples and inversely correlated with cTfh frequency.

        <tr id="NKT cells are innate-like T cells, recruited to the skin during viral infection, yet their contributions to long-term immune memory to viruses are unclear. We identified granzyme K, a product made by cytotoxic cells including NKT cells, is linked to induction of Th1-associated antibodies during primary dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. We examined the role of NKT cells in vivo using DENV-infected mice lacking CD1d-dependent (CD1ddep) NKT cells. In CD1d-KO mice, Th1-polarized immunity and infection resolution were impaired, which was dependent on intrinsic NKT cell production of IFN-γ, since it was restored by adoptive transfer of WT but not IFN-γ-KO NKT cells. Furthermore, NKT cell deficiency triggered immune bias, resulting in higher levels of Th2-associated IgG1 than Th1-associated IgG2a, which failed to protect against a homologous DENV re-challenge and promoted antibody-dependent enhanced disease during secondary heterologous infections. Similarly, Th2-immunity, typified by a higher IgG4:IgG3 ratio, was associated with worsened human disease severity during secondary infections. Thus, CD1ddep NKT cells establish Th1 polarity during the early innate response to DENV, which promotes infection resolution, memory formation and long-term protection from secondary homologous and heterologous infections. These observations illustrate how early innate immune responses during primary infections can influence secondary infection outcomes.">

        <tr id="Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is a severe complication of influenza infection that occurs in critically ill patients and results in higher mortality compared to influenza infection alone. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) and the Type 17 immune signaling pathway cytokine family are recognized for their pivotal role in fostering protective immunity against various pathogens. In this study, we investigate the role of IL-17 and Type 17 immune signaling components during IAPA. Wild-type mice were challenged with influenza A H1N1 (Flu) and then exposed to Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC42202 resting conidia on day 6 post-influenza infection, followed by the quantification of cytokines and chemokines at 48 hours post-fungal infection. Gene and protein expression levels revealed that IL-17 and Type 17 immune cytokines and antimicrobial peptides are downregulated during IAPA compared to mice singularly infected solely with A. fumigatus. Restoration of Type 17 immunity was not sufficient to provide protection against the increased fungal burden observed during IAPA. These findings contrast those observed during post-influenza bacterial super-infection, in which restoration of Type 17 immune signaling protects against exacerbation seen during super-infection. Our study highlights the need for future studies to understand the immune mechanisms that increase susceptibility to fungal infection. Importance IAPA significantly elevates the risk of mortality in patients with severe influenza. Type-17 immunity is critical to host defense during fungal infections and, therefore, vital to understand its role during IAPA. The observations in this study reveal that Type 17 immunity is impaired during IAPA, potentially increasing susceptibility to secondary infection with Aspergillus fumigatus. However, restoration of IL-17 signaling alone is not sufficient to reduce fungal burden in our murine IAPA model. These observations differ from those observed in post-influenza bacterial super-infections, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying viral-fungal super-infection are different than those that underly viral-bacterial super-infection. By elucidating the complex interactions between the host immune system, influenza, and A. fumigatus, these findings are vital for developing strategies to enhance immune responses and improve survival rates during IAPA.">

        <tr id="A natural infection or a vaccination can initially prime the immune system to form immunological memory. The immunity engendered by vaccination against COVID-19 versus natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 has not been well studied in the Indian population. In this study, we compared the immunity conferred by COVID-19 vaccines to naturally acquired immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in a South Indian population. We examined binding and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels against the ancestral and variant lineages and assessed the ex vivo cellular parameters of memory T cells, memory B cells, and monocytes and finally measured the circulating cytokine response. COVID-19 vaccination stimulates heightened levels of IgG antibodies against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, as well as increased binding to the spike protein and neutralizing antibody levels. This enhanced response extends to variant lineages such as B.1.617.2 (Delta, India), B.1.1.529 (Omicron, India), B.1.351 (Beta, South Africa), and B.1.1.7 (Alpha, UK). COVID-19 vaccination differs from SARS-CoV-2 infection by having increased frequencies of classical memory B cells, activated memory B and plasma cells, CD4/CD8 T cells of effector memory, effector cells, stem cell-like memory T cells, and classical and intermediate monocytes and diminished frequencies of CD4/CD8 T cells of central memory and non-classical monocytes in vaccinated individuals in comparison to those with natural infection. Thus, COVID-19 vaccination is characterized by enhanced humoral responses and robust activation of innate and memory T cell responses in comparison to natural infection in a South Indian population.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Type III interferon signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of the important human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus in the airway. Little is known of the cellular factors important in this response. Using Ifnl2-green fluorescent protein reporter mice combined with flow cytometry and cellular depletion strategies, we demonstrate that the alveolar macrophage is the primary producer of interferon lambda (IFN-λ) in response to S. aureus in the airway. Bone marrow chimeras showed reduced bacterial burden in IFN-λ receptor (IFNLR1)-deficient recipient mice, indicative that non-hematopoietic cells were important for pathogenesis, in addition to significant reductions in pulmonary inflammation. These observations were confirmed through the use of an airway epithelial-specific IFNLR knockout mouse. Our data suggest that upon entry to the airway, S. aureus activates alveolar macrophages to produce type III IFN that is subsequently sensed by the airway epithelium. Future steps will determine how signaling from the epithelium then exerts its influence on bacterial clearance. These results highlight the important, yet sometimes detrimental, role of type III IFN signaling during infection and the impact the airway epithelium plays during host–pathogen interactions. IMPORTANCE The contribution of type III interferon signaling to the control of bacterial infections is largely unknown. We have previously demonstrated that it contributes to the pathogenesis of acute Staphylococcus aureus respiratory infection. In this report, we document the importance of two cell types that underpin this pathogenesis. We demonstrate that the alveolar macrophage is the cell that is responsible for the production of type III interferon and that this molecule is sensed by airway epithelial cells, which impacts both bacterial clearance and induction of inflammation. This work sheds light on the first two aspects of this important pathogenic cascade. The contribution of type III interferon signaling to the control of bacterial infections is largely unknown.

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is highly heterogeneous in terms of disease severity and tissue damage extent. Improving myelin restoration is essential to prevent neurodegeneration and the associated disability in MS patients. However, remyelinating therapies are failing in clinical trials, in part, due to the absence of classifying biomarkers of different endogenous regenerative capacities amongst enrolled patients. We previously reported that circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) at the onset of the murine model of MS experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are associated with milder disease courses and less degree of demyelination and axonal damage in spinal cord lesions, while at peak are indicative of a better symptom recovery. Moreover, M-MDSCs are able to promote in vitro oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation towards mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) through the release of the soluble factor osteopontin. Results Here, we show a relationship between disease severity and a gradient of OPCs between the rim and the core in mixed active-inactive lesions of MS patients, along with a positive correlation between M-MDSC density and OPC abundance in the same lesions. We also show that EAE disease severity negatively influences the density of total and newly generated OPCs found associated to the demyelinated lesions of the spinal cord at the peak of the disease. In addition, disease severity also impacts the abundance of newly generated OLs originated either during the effector phase or during the early recovery phase. We also demonstrate the positive association between infiltrated M-MDSCs and the abundance of OPCs in the periplaque of demyelinating lesions at the peak of EAE. Interestingly, circulating M-MDSCs at EAE onset and peak of the disease are directly associated to a higher density of newly generated OLs in the plaque and periplaque, respectively. Conclusion Disease severity clearly impacts oligodendrocyte generation during a neuroinflammatory insult like EAE. Our results set the basis for further studies on M-MDSCs as a promising new biomarker that identify a CNS prone to the generation of new OLs that may contribute to restore myelin.">

The initial site of virus replication is the mosquito biting site in the host skin, yet the role of host skin bacteria remains unclear. Here, we observed accelerated progression of Zika virus (ZIKV)-induced disease in mice with depleted skin bacteria by topical antibiotic treatment prior to ZIKV infection. Increased viral loads in the blood, draining lymph node, spleen and brain of antibiotic-treated mice suggested faster ZIKV dissemination. Flow cytometry revealed increased frequencies of T cells in the lymph nodes, along with enhanced activation of T cells in the brain upon antibiotic treatment. The antibiotic-induced phenotype was rescued by restoring the skin bacteria prior to infection. Our findings demonstrate an increased susceptibility to ZIKV infection in mice with depleted skin microbiomes, suggesting a potential role of skin bacteria in modulating the infection outcome.">

        <tr id="Measles virus (MeV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus transmitted via aerosols. To understand how MeV exits the airways of an infected host, we use unpassaged primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE). MeV typically remains cell-associated in HAE and forms foci of infection, termed infectious centers, by directly spreading cell-to-cell. We previously described the phenomenon in which infectious centers detach en masse from HAE and remain viable. Here we investigate the mechanism of this cellular detachment. Via immunostaining, we observed loss of tight junction and cell adhesion proteins within infectious centers. These morphological changes indicate activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT can contribute to wound healing in respiratory epithelia by mobilizing nearby cells. Inhibiting TGF-β, and thus EMT, reduced infectious center detachment. Compared to uninfected cells, MeV-infected cells also expressed increased levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a regulator of live cell extrusion. Live cell extrusion encourages cells to detach from respiratory epithelia by contracting the actomyosin of neighboring cells. Inhibition or induction of live cell extrusion impacted infectious center detachment rates. Thus, these two related pathways contributed to infectious center detachment in HAE. Detached infectious centers contained high titers of virus that may be protected from the environment, allowing the virus to live on surfaces longer and infect more hosts. This mechanism may contribute to the highly contagious nature of MeV. IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV) is an extremely contagious respiratory pathogen that continues to cause large, disruptive outbreaks each year. Here, we examine a phenomenon that may help explain the contagious nature of MeV: detachment of MeV-infected cells. MeV spreads cell-to-cell in human airway epithelial cells (HAE) to form groups of infected cells, termed “infectious centers”. We reported that infectious centers ultimately detach from HAE as a unit, carrying high titers of virus. Viral particles within cells may be more protected from environmental conditions, such as ultraviolet radiation and desiccation. We identified two host pathways, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and live cell extrusion, that contribute to infectious center detachment. Perturbing these pathways altered the kinetics of infectious centers detachment. These pathways influence one another and contribute to epithelial wound healing, suggesting infectious center detachment may be a usurped consequence of the host’s response to infection that benefits MeV by increasing its transmissibility between hosts.">

Previous studies have emphasized the importance of innate immune cells and signalling pathways in clearing E. faecium, but a comprehensive analysis of host-pathogen interactions is lacking. Here, we investigated the interplay of host and E. faecium in a murine model of septic peritonitis. Following injection with a sublethal dose, we observed significantly increased murine sepsis score and histological score, decreased weight and bacterial burden, neutrophils and macrophages infiltration, and comprehensive activation of cytokine-mediated signalling pathway. In mice receiving a lethal dose, hypothermia significantly improved survival, reduced bacterial burden, cytokines, and CD86 expression of MHC-II+ recruited macrophages compared to the normothermia group. A mathematical model constructed by observational data from 80 animals, recapitulated the host-pathogen interplay, and further verified the benefits of hypothermia. These findings indicate that E. faecium triggers a severe activation of cytokine-mediated signalling pathway, and hypothermia can improve outcomes by reducing bacterial burden and inflammation.">

To generate a tool that combines specific advantages and avoids select drawbacks of the two methods we engineer adeno-associated viral vectors expressing depletion-mAbs (depletion-AAVs). Single-dose depletion-AAV administration permanently eliminates lymphocyte subsets in mice while avoiding accessory deficiencies of GEMMs such as marginal zone defects in B cell-deficient animals. Depletion-AAVs can be used irrespective of the animals’ genetic background, and multiple depletion-AAVs can readily be combined. Exploiting depletion-AAV technology, we show that B cells are required for unimpaired CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to chronic viral infection. Importantly, CD8 T cells fail to suppress viremia when B cells are depleted, and they only help resolving chronic infection if antibodies suppress viral loads.

        <tr id="The immune system is a highly complex and tightly regulated system that plays a crucial role in protecting the body against external threats, such as pathogens, and internal abnormalities, like cancer cells. It undergoes development during fetal stages and continuously learns from each encounter with pathogens, allowing it to develop immunological memory and provide a wide range of immune protection. Over time, after numerous encounters and years of functioning, the immune system can begin to show signs of erosion, which is commonly named immunosenescence. In this review, we aim to explore how the immune system responds to initial encounters with antigens and how it handles persistent stimulations throughout a person’s lifetime. Our understanding of the immune system has greatly benefited from advanced technologies like flow cytometry. In this context, we will discuss the valuable contribution of flow cytometry in enhancing our knowledge of the immune system behavior in aging, with a specific focus on T-cells. Moreover, we will expand our discussion to the flow cytometry-based assessment of extracellular vesicles, a recently discovered communication channel in biology, and their implications for immune system functioning.">

        <tr id="The circulation of seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs) in humans relies on effective evasion and subversion of the host immune response. While the evolution of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to avoid humoral immunity is well characterized, relatively little is known about the evolution of innate immune antagonism phenotypes in these viruses. Numerous studies have established that only a small subset of infected cells is responsible for initiating the type I and type III interferon (IFN) response during IAV infection, emphasizing the importance of single cell studies to accurately characterize the IFN response during infection. We developed a flow cytometry-based method to examine transcriptional changes in IFN and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression at the single cell level. We observed that NS segments derived from seasonal H3N2 viruses are more efficient at antagonizing IFN signaling but less effective at suppressing IFN induction, compared to the pdm2009 H1N1 lineage. We compared a collection of NS segments spanning the natural history of the current seasonal IAV lineages and demonstrate long periods of stability in IFN antagonism potential, punctuated by occasional phenotypic shifts. Altogether, our data reveal significant differences in how seasonal and pandemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses antagonize the human IFN response at the single cell level.">

        <tr id="Children living with HIV have a higher risk of developing tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Gamma delta (γδ) T cells in the context of HIV/Mtb coinfection have been understudied in children, despite in vitro evidence suggesting γδ T cells assist with Mtb control. We investigated whether boosting a specific subset of γδ T cells, phosphoantigen-reactive Vγ9+Vδ2+ cells, could improve TB outcome using a nonhuman primate model of pediatric HIV/Mtb coinfection. Juvenile Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), equivalent to 4–8-year-old children, were infected intravenously (i.v.) with SIV. After 6 months, MCM were coinfected with a low dose of Mtb and then randomized to receive zoledronate (ZOL), a drug that increases phosphoantigen levels, (n=5; i.v.) at 3- and 17-days after Mtb accompanied by recombinant human IL-2 (s.c.) for 5 days following each ZOL injection. A similarly coinfected MCM group (n=5) was injected with saline as a control. Vγ9+Vδ2+ γδ T cell frequencies spiked in the blood, but not airways, of ZOL+IL-2-treated MCM following the first dose, however, were refractory to the second dose. At necropsy eight weeks after Mtb, ZOL+IL-2 treatment did not reduce pathology or bacterial burden. γδ T cell subset frequencies in granulomas did not differ between treatment groups. These data show that transiently boosting peripheral γδ T cells with ZOL+IL-2 soon after Mtb coinfection of SIV-infected MCM did not improve Mtb host defense.">

This study aimed to assess whether the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 can induce lasting non-specific immune responses in myeloid cells following a three-dose vaccination scheme. In a sample size consisting of 20 healthy individuals from Romania, we assessed inflammatory proteins using the Olink® Target 96 Inflammation panel, as well as ex vivo cytokine responses following stimulations with unrelated PRR ligands.

Further phenotypical analysis confirmed the granulocytic-like features of this monocyte subpopulation that is associated with an increase in granulocyte–monocyte precursors (GMPs) in the PB of these patients (pts). Mechanistically, this granulocyte-like monocyte population suppressed NK cell activity by inducing TIGIT and engaging NKp30. Accordingly, an increased frequency of TIGIT+ NK cells with impaired functions was found in both the PB and tumoral tissue of CRC pts. Collectively, we provided new mechanistic explanations for tumor immune escape occurring in CRC by showing the increase in this new kind of MDSC, in both PB and CRC tissue, which is able to significantly impair the effector functions of NK cells, thereby representing a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cellular metabolism is a crucial determinant of immune cell fate and function. Extensive studies have demonstrated that metabolic decisions influence immune cell activation, differentiation, and cellular capacity, in the process impacting an organism’s ability to stave off infection or recover from injury. Conversely, metabolic dysregulation can contribute to the severity of multiple disease conditions including autoimmunity, alloimmunity, and cancer. Emerging data also demonstrate that metabolic cues and profiles can influence the success or failure of adoptive cellular therapies. Importantly, immunometabolism is not one size fits all; and different immune cell types, and even subdivisions within distinct cell populations utilize different metabolic pathways to optimize function. Metabolic preference can also change depending on the microenvironment in which cells are activated. For this reason, understanding the metabolic requirements of different subsets of immune cells is critical to therapeutically modulating different disease states or maximizing cellular function for downstream applications. Fatty acid oxidation (FAO), in particular, plays multiple roles in immune cells, providing both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. Herein, we review the major metabolic pathways available to immune cells, then focus more closely on the role of FAO in different immune cell subsets. Understanding how and why FAO is utilized by different immune cells will allow for the design of optimal therapeutic interventions targeting this pathway.">

        <tr id="Immune cells are present inside tumor tissue and can alter tumor growth. Expression profiles of human tumors hold transcripts from cancer cells and their microenvironment, including the infiltrating immune cells. Few standardized methods examine tumor immunobiology relying only on tumor transcriptome data. Using a new in-house developed R analysis workflow called AMOCATI, we classified 43 cancer types from 11,176 patients according to the degree of infiltration by 18 distinct immune cell subsets, measured by the abundance of their transcriptomic signature, and calculated its effect on the disease outcome. In about half of cancers affecting organs without immune privilege, immune cell infiltration has beneficial effects. In contrast, immune infiltration in cancers of immune-privileged organs (eye, testis and brain) confers poor prognosis. Moreover, transcriptional evidence of increased immune cell activity in immune-privileged cancer sites is associated with bad prognosis. Thus, our results suggest that the effect of immune infiltration may depend on the origin of the primary tumor. SIGNIFICANCE Our in-house developed computational R approach AMOCATI allows to easily download public transcriptomic and clinical data, classify and analyze them. AMOCATI permitted us to define gene expression signatures associated with short- or long-term survival from 11,176 untreated patient unsorted biopsies in 43 types of cancer. We present the level of infiltration of 18 types of immune cell subsets transcriptomic signatures and 50 immune-related pathways in all these cancers Correlation between immune infiltration of the tumor and survival establishes a link between tumor tissue of origin and the overall effect of immune infiltration on survival. Immune cell infiltration in tumors from ‘immune privileged organs’ correlate with shorter survival. Contrary to what we observe in ‘hot’ tumors, biological pathways of immune response are associated with a short-term survival profile in these cancers.">

        <tr id="Adult stem cells play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis and repair through multiple mechanisms. In addition to being able to replace aged or damaged cells, stem cells provide signals that contribute to the maintenance and function of neighboring cells. In the lung, airway basal stem cells also produce cytokines and chemokines in response to inhaled irritants, allergens, and pathogens, which affect specific immune cell populations and shape the nature of the immune response. However, direct cell-to-cell signaling through contact between airway basal stem cells and immune cells has not been demonstrated. Recently, a unique population of intraepithelial airway macrophages (IAMs) has been identified in the murine trachea. Here, we demonstrate that IAMs require Notch signaling from airway basal stem cells for maintenance of their differentiated state and function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Notch signaling between airway basal stem cells and IAMs is required for antigen-induced allergic inflammation only in the trachea where the basal stem cells are located whereas allergic responses in distal lung tissues are preserved consistent with a local circuit linking stem cells to proximate immune cells. Finally, we demonstrate that IAM-like cells are present in human conducting airways and that these cells display Notch activation, mirroring their murine counterparts. Since diverse lung stem cells have recently been identified and localized to specific anatomic niches along the proximodistal axis of the respiratory tree, we hypothesize that the direct functional coupling of local stem cell-mediated regeneration and immune responses permits a compartmentalized inflammatory response.">

        <tr id="Type I interferons (IFN-I) are cytokines with potent antiviral and inflammatory capacities. IFN-I signaling drives the expression of hundreds of IFN-I stimulated genes (ISGs), whose aggregate function results in the control of viral infection. A few of these ISGs are tasked with negatively regulating the IFN-I response to prevent overt inflammation. ISG15 is a negative regulator whose absence leads to persistent, low-grade elevation of ISG expression and concurrent, self-resolving mild autoinflammation. The limited breadth and low-grade persistence of ISGs expressed in ISG15 deficiency are sufficient to confer broad-spectrum antiviral resistance. Inspired by ISG15 deficiency, we have identified a nominal collection of 10 ISGs that recapitulate the broad antiviral potential of the IFN-I system. The expression of the 10 ISG collection in an IFN-I non-responsive cell line increased cellular resistance to Zika, Vesicular Stomatitis, Influenza A (IAV), and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. A deliverable prophylactic formulation of this syndicate of 10 ISGs significantly inhibited IAV PR8 replication in vivo in mice and protected hamsters against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, suggesting its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral against many current and future emerging viral pathogens.

        <tr id="Type I interferons (IFN) are immune-stimulatory cytokines involved in antiviral and antitumor immune responses. They enhance the efficacy of immunogenic anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy by activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Macrophages are one of the most abundant innate immune cells in the immune microenvironment of melanoma brain metastases (MBMs) and can exert potent immune-suppressive functions. Here, we investigate the potential of tumoral type I IFNs to re-polarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in two murine MBM models and assess the effects of radiotherapy-induced type I IFNs on TAMs in a transcriptomic MBM patient dataset. In mice, we describe a pro-inflammatory M1-like TAM phenotype induced by tumoral IFNβ and identify a myeloid type I IFN-response signature associated with a high M1/M2-like TAM ratio. Following irradiation, patients with MBMs displaying a myeloid type I IFN-response signature showed increased overall survival, providing evidence that tumoral IFNβ supports an effective antitumor immune response by re-educating immune-regulatory TAMs. These findings uncover type I IFN-inducing therapies as a potential macrophage-targeting therapeutic approach and provide a rationale for combining radiotherapy with concomitant immunotherapy to improve treatment response in patients with MBM.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer of stem cells originating in the bone marrow. Increasing evidence suggests that AML survival and relapse are controlled by genetic alterations, as well as a functional interaction between the tumor and the immune system. In this review, we will discuss the biology of immune evasion in AML and explore the current landscape of immune-based therapies. We argue that a better understanding of the immune microenvironment in AML could help predict responses to immunotherapy and guide decisions for future treatment. Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex hematopoietic clonal disorder with limited curative options beyond stem cell transplantation. The success of transplant is intimately linked with the graft versus leukemia effect from the alloreactive donor immune cells including, T and NK cells. The immune system plays a dynamic role in leukemia survival and resistance. Despite our growing understanding of the immune microenvironment, responses to immune-based therapies differ greatly between patients. Herein, we review the biology of immune evasion mechanisms in AML, discuss the current landscape of immunotherapeutic strategies, and discuss the implications of therapeutic targets. This review focuses on T and NK cell-based therapy, including modified and non-modified NK cells, CAR-T and CAR-NK cells, antibodies, and checkpoint blockades. Understanding the complex interchange between immune tolerance and the emergence of tumor resistance will improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects a wide range of cell types in the body, including a variety of epithelial cell types. Despite the significance of epithelial cells during infection, HCMV has been difficult to study in epithelial cells. In this study, we examined HCMV infection in mammary and prostate epithelial cell lines, finding that the virus establishes a semi-permissive, biosynthetically abortive state. Building on previous work, we hypothesized that shifting epithelial cells to a mesenchymal cell state would restore HCMV biosynthesis and progeny production. To test this hypothesis, we induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using TGF-β and the EMT-transcription factor (EMT-TF) SNAIL. We found that shifting strongly epithelial cell lines to a mesenchymal cell state shifted HCMV infection from a semi-permissive to fully permissive state. This effect appeared to involve two distinct mechanisms: EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral entry and EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral mRNA translation. Although the precise mechanisms remain elusive, our findings identify the epithelial-mesenchymal cell state axis as an important regulator of HCMV infection and provide new insights into how cellular differentiation states influence viral replication. They also raise the possibility that the EMT pathway, a fundamental pathway involved in development and cancer metastasis, could regulate HCMV infection in-vivo, potentially contributing to viral persistence or pathogenesis in epithelial tissues.">

        <tr id="Nearly six million people worldwide have died from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although COVID-19 vaccines are largely successful in reducing the severity of the disease and deaths, the decline in vaccine-induced immunity over time and the continuing emergence of new viral variants or mutations underscore the need for an alternative strategy for developing broad-spectrum host-mediated therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. A key feature of severe COVID-19 is dysregulated innate immune signaling, culminating in a high expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and a lack of antiviral interferons (IFNs), particularly type I (alpha and beta) and type III (lambda). As a natural host defense, the myeloid differentiation primary response protein, MyD88, plays pivotal roles in innate and acquired immune responses via the signal transduction pathways of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a type of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). However, recent studies have highlighted that infection with viruses upregulates MyD88 expression and impairs the host antiviral response by negatively regulating type I IFN. Galectin-3 (Gal3), another key player in viral infections, has been shown to modulate the host immune response by regulating viral entry and activating TLRs, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and NF-κB, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributing to the overall inflammatory response, the so-called “cytokine storm”. These studies suggest that the specific inhibition of MyD88 and Gal3 could be a promising therapy for COVID-19. This review presents future directions for MyD88- and Gal3-targeted antiviral drug discovery, highlighting the potential to restore host immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="Cytokines, chemokines, and interferons are released in response to viral infection with the ultimate aim of viral clearance. However, in SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is an imbalanced immune response, with raised cytokine levels but only a limited interferon response with inefficient viral clearance. Furthermore, the inflammatory response can be exaggerated, which risks both acute and chronic sequelae. Several observational studies have suggested a reduced risk of progression to severe COVID-19 in subjects with a higher omega-3 index. However, randomized studies of omega-3 supplementation have failed to replicate this benefit. Omega-3 fats provide important anti-inflammatory effects; however, fatty fish contains many other fatty acids that provide health benefits distinct from omega-3. Therefore, the immune health benefit of whole salmon oil (SO) was assessed in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. Eleven subjects were randomized to best supportive care (BSC) with or without a full spectrum, enzymatically liberated SO, dosed at 4g daily, for twenty-eight days. Nasal swabs were taken to measure the change in gene expression of markers of immune response and showed that the SO provided both broad inflammation-resolving effects and improved interferon response. The results also suggest improved lung barrier function and enhanced immune memory, although the clinical relevance needs to be assessed in longer-duration studies. In conclusion, the salmon oil was well tolerated and provided broad inflammation-resolving effects, indicating a potential to enhance immune health.">

        <tr id="Modest response rates to immunotherapy observed in advanced lung cancer patients underscore the need to identify reliable biomarkers and targets, enhancing both treatment decision-making and efficacy. Factors such as PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation burden, and a ‘hot’ tumor microenvironment with heightened effector T cell infiltration have consistently been associated with positive responses. In contrast, the predictive role of the abundantly present tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell (TIMs) fraction remains somewhat uncertain, partly explained by their towering variety in terms of ontogeny, phenotype, location, and function. Nevertheless, numerous preclinical and clinical studies established a clear link between lung cancer progression and alterations in intra- and extramedullary hematopoiesis, leading to emergency myelopoiesis at the expense of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lymphoid differentiation. These observations affirm that a continuous crosstalk between solid cancers such as lung cancer and the bone marrow niche (BMN) must take place. However, the BMN, encompassing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, differentiated immune and stromal cells, remains inadequately explored in solid cancer patients. Subsequently, no clear consensus has been reached on the exact breadth of tumor installed hematopoiesis perturbing cues nor their predictive power for immunotherapy. As the current era of single-cell omics is reshaping our understanding of the hematopoietic process and the subcluster landscape of lung TIMs, we aim to present an updated overview of the hierarchical differentiation process of TIMs within the BMN of solid cancer bearing subjects. Our comprehensive overview underscores that lung cancer should be regarded as a systemic disease in which the cues governing the lung tumor-BMN crosstalk might bolster the definition of new biomarkers and druggable targets, potentially mitigating the high attrition rate of leading immunotherapies for NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Through widespread immunization against SARS-CoV-2 prior to or post-infection, a substantial segment of the global population has acquired both humoral and cellular immunity, and there has been a notable reduction in the incidence of severe and fatal cases linked to this virus and accelerated recovery times for those infected. Nonetheless, a significant demographic, comprising around 20% to 30% of the adult population, remains unimmunized due to diverse factors. Furthermore, alongside those recovered from the infection, there is a subset of the population experiencing persistent symptoms referred to as Long COVID. This condition is more prevalent among individuals with underlying health conditions and immune system impairments. Some Long COVID pathologies stem from direct damage inflicted by the viral infection, whereas others arise from inadequate immune system control over the infection or suboptimal immunoregulation. There are differences in the serum cytokines and miRNA profiles between infected individuals who develop severe COVID-19 or Long COVID and those who control adequately the infection. This review delves into the advantages and constraints associated with employing imiquimod in human subjects to enhance the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 immunization. Restoration of the immune system can modify it towards a profile of non-susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. An adequate immune system has the potential to curb viral propagation, mitigate symptoms, and ameliorate the severe consequences of the infection.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint blockade targeting the adaptive immune system has revolutionized the treatment of cancer. Despite impressive clinical benefits observed, patient subgroups remain non-responsive underscoring the necessity for combinational therapies harnessing additional immune cells. Natural killer (NK) cells are emerging tools for cancer therapy. However, only subpopulations of NK cells that are differentially controlled by inhibitory receptors exert reactivity against particular cancer types. How to leverage the complete anti-tumor potential of all NK cell subsets without favoring the emergence of NK cell-resistant tumor cells remains unresolved. Methods We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout resistance screen in melanoma cells in co-cultures with human primary NK cells. We comprehensively evaluated factors regulating tumor resistance and susceptibility by focusing on NK cell subsets in an allogenic setting. Moreover, we tested therapeutic blocking antibodies currently used in clinical trials. Results Melanoma cells deficient in antigen-presenting or the IFNγ-signaling pathways were depleted in remaining NK cell-co-cultured melanoma cells and displayed enhanced sensitivity to NK cells. Treatment with IFNγ induced potent resistance of melanoma cells to resting, IL-2-cultured and ADCC-activated NK cells that depended on B2M required for the expression of both classical and non-classical MHC-I. IFNγ-induced expression of HLA-E mediated the resistance of melanoma cells to the NKG2A+ KIR− and partially to the NKG2A+ KIR+ NK cell subset. The expression of classical MHC-I by itself was sufficient for the inhibition of the NKG2A− KIR+, but not the NKG2A+ KIR+ NK cell subset. Treatment of NK cells with monalizumab, an NKG2A blocking mAb, enhanced the reactivity of a corresponding subset of NK cells. The combination of monalizumab with lirilumab, blocking KIR2 receptors, together with DX9, blocking KIR3DL1, was required to restore cytotoxicity of all NK cell subsets against IFNγ-induced resistant tumor cells in melanoma and tumors of different origins. Conclusion Our data reveal that in the context of NK cells, IFNγ induces the resistance of tumor cells by the upregulation of classical and non-classical MHC-I. Moreover, we reveal insights into NK cell subset reactivity and propose a therapeutic strategy involving combinational monalizumab/lirilumab/DX9 treatment to fully restore the antitumor response across NK cell subsets.">

        <tr id="Background Gamma-delta (γδ) T cells are a major immune cell subset in pigs. Approximately 50% of circulating T cells are γδ T cells in young pigs and up to 30% in adult sows. Despite this abundance, the functions of porcine γδ T cells are mostly unidentified. In humans and mice, activated γδ T cells exhibit broad innate cytotoxic activity against a wide variety of stressed, infected, and cancerous cells through death receptor/ligand-dependent and perforin/granzyme-dependent pathways. However, so far, it is unknown whether porcine γδ T cells have the ability to perform cytotoxic functions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of porcine γδ T cells isolated from blood, lung, and nasal mucosa. To further analyze the cytolytic potential of γδ T cells, in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed using purified γδ T cells as effector cells and virus-exposed or mock-treated primary porcine alveolar macrophages as target cells. Results Our results show that only CD2+ γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers (CD16, NKp46, perforin) with higher perforin and NKp46 expression in γδ T cells isolated from lung and nasal mucosa. Moreover, we found that γδ T cells can exhibit cytotoxic functions in a cell-cell contact and degranulation-dependent manner. However, porcine γδ T cells did not seem to specifically target Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus or swine Influenza A Virus-infected macrophages, which may be due to viral escape mechanisms. Conclusion Porcine γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers and can exhibit cytotoxic activity in vitro. The specific mechanisms by which porcine γδ T cells recognize target cells are not fully understood but may involve the detection of cellular stress signals.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
T-cell-mediated immunity is crucial for the effective clearance of viral infection, but the T-cell-mediated immune responses that are induced by booster doses of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) remain unclear.


METHODS
Forty-five PLWH who had received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for more than two years and 29 healthy controls (HCs) at Beijing Youan Hospital were enrolled to assess the dynamic changes in T-cell responses between the day before the third vaccine dose (week 0) and 4 or 12 weeks (week 4 or week 12) after receiving the third dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot), and multiplex cytokines profiling were used to assess T-cell responses at the three timepoints in this study.


RESULTS
The results of the ELISpot and activation-induced marker (AIM) assays showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were increased in both PLWH and HCs after the third dose of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and a similar magnitude of immune response was induced against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant compared to the wild-type strain. In detail, spike-specific T-cell responses (measured by the ELISpot assay for interferon γ [IFN-γ] release) in both PLWH and HCs significantly increased in week 4, and the spike-specific T-cell responses in HCs were significantly stronger than those in PLWH 4 weeks after the third vaccination. In the AIM assay, spike-specific CD4+ T-cell responses peaked in both PLWH and HCs in week 12. Additionally, significantly higher spike-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were induced in PLWH than in HCs in week 12. In PLWH, the release of the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-22 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that were stimulated with spike peptides increased in week 12. In addition, the levels of IL-4 and IL-5 were higher in PLWH than in HCs in week 12. Interestingly, the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses in PLWH was negatively associated with the extent of CD8+ T-cell activation and exhaustion. In addition, positive correlations were observed between the magnitude of spike-specific T-cell responses (determined by measuring IFN-γ release by ELISpot) and the amounts of IL-4, IL-5, IL-2 and IL-17F.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses could be enhanced by the booster dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines and further illustrate the importance of additional vaccination for PLWH.">

Unraveling the mechanisms underlying treatment response for targeted therapeutics in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients is challenging due to the limited understanding of diverse responses of circulating immune cells, particularly B cells. We investigated B lymphocyte dynamics during anti-BAFF treatment, utilizing longitudinal single-cell transcriptome data.


METHODS
We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on PBMCs in four Korean SLE patients before and after belimumab treatment at the following time points: 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.


RESULTS
Analyzing over 73 000 PBMCs, we identified 8 distinct subsets of B cells and plasmablasts and analyzed dynamic changes within these cell subsets: initial declines in naive and transitional B cells followed by an increase at three months, contrasted by an initial increase and subsequent decrease in memory B cells by the third month. Meanwhile, plasmablasts exhibited a consistent decline throughout treatment. B cell activation pathways, specifically in naive and memory B cells, were downregulated during the third and sixth months. These findings were validated at the protein level throughout the first four weeks of treatment using flow cytometry. Comparative analysis with bulk transcriptome data from 22 Japanese SLE patients showed increased NR4A1 expression six months post-belimumab treatment, indicating its role in restricting self-reactive B cells, thereby contributing to the biological responses of anti-BAFF treatment.


CONCLUSION
The observed B cell dynamics provided insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of anti-BAFF in SLE patients. Furthermore, it underscores the need for research in predicting drug responses based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="Abstract Haematopoiesis dysregulation with the presence of immature myeloid and erythroid immunosuppressive cells are key characteristics of the immune escape phase of tumour development. Here, the role of in vitro generated B16F10 tumour cell‐derived extracellular vesicles (tEVs) as indirect cellular communicators, participating in tumour‐induced dysregulation of haematopoiesis, was explored. The isolated tEVs displayed features of small EVs with a size range of 100–200 nm, expressed the common EV markers CD63, CD9, and Alix, and had a spherical shape with a lipid bilayer membrane. Proteomic profiling revealed significant levels of angiogenic factors, particularly vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), osteopontin, and tissue factor, associated with the tEVs. Systemic administration of these tEVs in syngeneic mice induced splenomegaly and disrupted haematopoiesis, leading to extramedullary haematopoiesis, expansion of splenic immature erythroid progenitors, reduced bone marrow cellularity, medullary expansion of granulocytic myeloid suppressor cells, and the development of anaemia. These effects closely mirrored those observed in tumour‐bearing mice and were not seen after heat inactivating the tEVs. In vitro studies demonstrated that tEVs independently induced the expansion of bone marrow granulocytic myeloid suppressor cells and B cells while reducing the frequency of cells in the erythropoietic lineage. These effects of tEVs were significantly abrogated by the blockade of VEGF or heat inactivation. Our findings underscore the important role of tEVs in dysregulating haematopoiesis during the immune escape phase of cancer immunoediting, suggesting their potential as targets for addressing immune evasion and reinstating normal hematopoietic processes.">

        <tr id="Innate immune cells play a key role in inflammation as a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it remains unclear how innate immunity-mediated inflammation is fine-tuned to minimize tissue damage and assure the host’s survival at the early phase of systemic inflammation. The results of this study with mouse models demonstrate that the supply of monocytes is restricted depending on the magnitude of inflammation. During the acute phase of severe inflammation, monocytes, but not neutrophils, were substantially reduced by apoptosis and the remaining monocytes were dysfunctional in the bone marrow. Monocyte-specific ablation of Casp3/7 prevented monocyte apoptosis but promoted monocyte necrosis in the bone marrow, leading to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the increased mortality of mice during systemic inflammation. Importantly, the limitation of monocyte supply was dependent on pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo. Consistently, a reduction of monocytes was observed in the peripheral blood during cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) patients, a pathogen-unrelated systemic inflammation induced by chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T cell) therapy. Thus, monocytes act as a safety valve to alleviate tissue damage caused by inflammation and ensure host survival, which may be responsible for a primitive immune-control mechanism that does not require intervention by acquired immunity.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells are central mediators of protective immunity to blood-stage malaria, particularly for their capacity in orchestrating germinal center reaction and generating parasite-specific high-affinity antibodies. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are predominant CD4+ effector T cell subset implicated in these processes, yet the factors and detailed mechanisms that assist Tfh cell development and function during Plasmodium infection are largely undefined. Here we provide evidence that receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), an adaptor protein of various intracellular signals, is not only important for CD4+ T cell expansion as previously implied but also plays a prominent role in Tfh cell differentiation and function during blood-stage Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL infection. Consequently, RACK1 in CD4+ T cells contributes significantly to germinal center formation, parasite-specific IgG production, and host resistance to the infection. Mechanistic exploration detects specific interaction of RACK1 with STAT3 in P. yoelii 17XNL-responsive CD4+ T cells, ablation of RACK1 leads to defective STAT3 phosphorylation, accompanied by substantially lower amount of STAT3 protein in CD4+ T cells, whereas retroviral overexpression of RACK1 or STAT3 in RACK1-deficient CD4+ T cells greatly restores STAT3 activity and Bcl-6 expression under the Tfh polarization condition. Further analyses suggest RACK1 positively regulates STAT3 stability by inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation process, thus promoting optimal STAT3 activity and Bcl-6 induction during Tfh cell differentiation. These findings uncover a novel mechanism by which RACK1 participates in posttranslational regulation of STAT3, Tfh cell differentiation, and subsequent development of anti-Plasmodium humoral immunity.">

Individuals infected with Mtb who acquire HIV are approximately 16 times more likely to develop active tuberculosis. T cells play an important role as both targets for HIV infection and mediators of the immune response against both pathogens. This review aims to synthesize the current literature and provide insights into the effects of HIV/Mtb coinfection on T cell populations and their contributions to immunity. Evidence from multiple in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that T helper responses are severely compromised during coinfection, leading to impaired cytotoxic responses. Moreover, HIV’s targeting of Mtb-specific cells, including those within granulomas, offers an explanation for the severe progression of the disease. Herein, we discuss the patterns of differentiation, exhaustion, and transcriptomic changes in T cells during coinfection, as well as the metabolic adaptations that are necessary for T cell maintenance and functionality. This review highlights the interconnectedness of the immune response and the pathogenesis of HIV/Mtb coinfection.">

        <tr id="Most healthy individuals recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas a remarkable number continues to suffer from unexplained symptoms, known as Long COVID or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). It is therefore imperative that methods for preventing and treating the onset of PASC be investigated with the utmost urgency.A mathematical model of the immune response to vaccination and viral infection with SARS-CoV-2, incorporating immune memory cells, was developed.Similar to our previous model, persistent infection was observed by the residual virus in the host, implying the possibility of chronic inflammation and delayed recovery from tissue injury. Pre-infectious vaccination and antiviral medication administered during onset can reduce the acute viral load; however, they show no beneficial effects in preventing persistent infection. Therefore, the impact of these treatments on the PASC, which has been clinically observed, is mainly attributed to their role in preventing severe tissue damage caused by acute viral infections. For PASC patients with persistent infection, vaccination was observed to cause an immediate rapid increase in viral load, followed by a temporary decrease over approximately one year. The former was effectively suppressed by the coadministration of antiviral medications, indicating that this combination is a promising treatment for PASC.">

        <tr id="Background The emergence of the hypermutated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) BA.2.86 variant raises significant concerns due to its potential to evade pre-existing immunity. Methods We measured cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses to BA.2.86 in 52 previously exposed participants and investigated clinic-demographic and viral genetic determinants affecting T-cell responses. Findings We found that despite notable escape from neutralizing antibodies, T-cell responses remained generally preserved, albeit with a significant but small loss in T-cell cross-recognition (7.5 %, 14.2 % and 10.8 % average loss for IFN-g, IL-2 and IFN-g + IL-2, respectively, p < 0.05). This is consistent with the prediction of 6 out of 10 immunodominant T-cell epitopes (TCEs) altered by BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutations to have reduced peptide presentation. This effect is expected to be mitigated due to total TCEs across the genome. Remarkably, T-cell responses and cross-recognition were 3.5 (IFN-g), 2 (IL-2) and 2.4 (IFN-g + IL-2) times higher when first induced by natural infection rather than vaccination three years before, by increasing number of infections, and by ancestral/Delta than Omicron infections. Interpretation Our findings underscore the critical role and the factors influencing T-cell immunity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as first antigen encounter (vaccination or infection), which is essential for developing effective control strategies against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

        <tr id="Immune cell engagers are molecular agents, usually antibody-based constructs, engineered to recruit immune cells against cancer cells and kill them. They represent a versatile and powerful tool for cancer immunotherapy. Despite the multiplication of new engagers tested and accepted in the clinics, how molecular and cellular parameters influence their action is poorly understood. In particular, disentangling the respective role of host immune cells and engager biophysical characteristics is needed to improve their design and efficiency. Focusing here on harnessing antibody dependent Natural Killer cell cytotoxicity, we measure the efficiency of 6 original bispecific antibodies (bsAb), associating an anti-HER2 nanobody and an anti-CD16 nanobody. In vitro cytotoxicity data using primary human NK cells on different target cell lines exposing different antigen densities were collected, exhibiting a wide range of bsAb dose response. In order to rationalize our observations, we introduce a simple multiscale model, postulating that the density of bsAb bridging the two cells is the main parameter triggering the cytotoxic response. We introduce two new microscopic parameters: the surface cooperativity describing bsAb affinity at the bridging step and the threshold of bridge density determining the donor-dependent response. Both parameters permit to rank Abs and donors and to predict bsAb potency as a function of antibodies bulk affinities and receptor surface densities on cells. Our approach thus provides a general way to decouple donor response from immune engagers characteristics, rationalizing the landscape of molecule design.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) displays an infiltrative growth characteristic that recruits neighboring normal cells to facilitate tumor growth, maintenance, and invasion into the brain. While the blood-brain barrier serves as a critical natural defense mechanism for the central nervous system, GBM disrupts this barrier, resulting in the infiltration of macrophages from the peripheral bone marrow and the activation of resident microglia. Recent advancements in single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics have refined the categorization of cells within the tumor microenvironment for precise identification. The intricate interactions and influences on cell growth within the tumor microenvironment under multi-omics conditions are succinctly outlined. The factors and mechanisms involving microglia, macrophages, endothelial cells, and T cells that impact the growth of GBM are individually examined. The collaborative mechanisms of tumor cell-immune cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment synergistically promote the growth, infiltration, and metastasis of gliomas, while also influencing the immune status and therapeutic response of the tumor microenvironment. As immunotherapy continues to progress, targeting the cells within the inter-tumor microenvironment emerges as a promising novel therapeutic approach for GBM. By comprehensively understanding and intervening in the intricate cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment, novel therapeutic modalities may be developed to enhance treatment outcomes for patients with GBM.">

Disease progression in Swiss albino mice was compared with the previously documented outcomes in BALB/c mice using an identical ocular route and parasite burden (2 × 105 tachyzoites), with saline as the control. Contrary to expectations, the Swiss albino mice displayed rapid, lethal disease progression, marked by pronounced sickness behaviors and mortality within 11–12 days post-infection, while the survivors exhibited no apparent signs of infection. Comparative analysis revealed the T. gondii-infected BALB/c mice exhibited reduced avoidance of feline odors, while the infected Swiss albino mice showed enhanced avoidance responses. There was an important increase in microglial cells in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of the infected Swiss albino mice compared to the BALB/c mice and their respective controls. Hierarchical cluster and discriminant analyses identified three microglial morphological clusters, differentially affected by T. gondii infection across strains. The BALB/c mice exhibited increased microglial branching and complexity, while the Swiss albino mice showed reduced shrunken microglial arbors, diminishing their morphological complexity. These findings highlight strain-specific differences in disease progression and inflammatory regulation, indicating lineage-specific mechanisms in inflammatory responses, tolerance, and resistance.

        <tr id="Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are major contributors to immunological responses following solid organ transplantation. Donor derived EVs are best known for their role in transplant rejection through transferring donor major histocompatibility complex proteins to recipient antigen presenting cells, a phenomenon known as ‛cross‐decoration’. In contrast, donor liver‐derived EVs are associated with organ tolerance in small animal models. Therefore, the cellular source of EVs and their cargo could influence their downstream immunological effects. To investigate the immunological effects of EVs released by the liver in a physiological and transplant‐relevant model, we isolated EVs being produced during normothermic ex vivo liver perfusion (NEVLP), a novel method of liver storage prior to transplantation. We found EVs were produced by the liver during NEVLP, and these EVs contained multiple anti‐inflammatory miRNA species. In terms of function, liver‐derived EVs were able to cross‐decorate allogeneic cells and suppress the immune response in allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions in a concentration‐dependent fashion. In terms of cytokine response, the addition of 1 × 109 EVs to the mixed lymphocyte reactions significantly decreased the production of the inflammatory cytokines TNF‐α, IL‐10 and IFN‐γ. In conclusion, we determined physiologically produced liver‐derived EVs are immunologically regulatory, which has implications for their role and potential modification in solid organ transplantation.">

        <tr id="Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) targets the central nervous system (CNS), leading to potentially severe neurological complications. The neurovascular unit plays a fundamental role in the CNS and in the neuroinvasion of TBEV. However, the role of human brain pericytes, a key component of the neurovascular unit, during TBEV infection has not yet been elucidated. In this study, TBEV infection of the primary human brain perivascular pericytes was investigated with highly virulent Hypr strain and mildly virulent Neudoerfl strain. We used Luminex assay to measure cytokines/chemokines and growth factors. Both viral strains showed comparable replication kinetics, peaking at 3 days post infection (dpi). Intracellular viral RNA copies peaked at 6 dpi for Hypr and 3 dpi for Neudoerfl cultures. According to immunofluorescence staining, only small proportion of pericytes were infected (3% for Hypr and 2% for Neudoerfl), and no cytopathic effect was observed in the infected cells. In cell culture supernatants, IL-6 production was detected at 3 dpi, together with slight increases in IL-15 and IL-4, but IP-10, RANTES and MCP-1 were the main chemokines released after TBEV infection. These chemokines play key roles in both immune defense and immunopathology during TBE. This study suggests that pericytes are an important source of these signaling molecules during TBEV infection in the brain.">

        <tr id="Cytokine storm is usually described as one of the main reasons behind COVID-associated mortality. Cytokines are essential protein molecules engaged in immune responses; they play a critical role in protection against infections. However, they also contribute to inflammatory reactions and tissue damage, becoming a double-edged sword in the context of COVID-19. Recent studies have suggested various cytokines and chemokines that play a crucial role in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. One such cytokine is interleukin 27 (IL-27), which has been found to be elevated in the blood plasma of patients with COVID-19. Within this study, we will explore the role of IL-27 in immune responses and analyze both the existing literature and our own prior research findings on this cytokine in the context of COVID-19. It affects a wide variety of immune cells. Regardless of the pathological process it is involved in, IL-27 is critical for upholding the necessary balance between tissue damage and cytotoxicity against infectious agents and/or tumors. In COVID-19, it is involved in multiple processes, including antiviral cytotoxicity via CD8+ cells, IgG subclass switching, and even the activation of Tregs.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in infants presents distinctive challenges due to their developing immune systems and unique viral-host interactions compared to adults. This review examines current knowledge on viral-host interactions and immune responses in HIV-infected infants, focusing on immune development, viral dynamics, and therapeutic implications. The immune system of infants undergoes rapid maturation during early life, influencing their susceptibility to HIV infection and responses to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Key aspects include thymic function, cytokine profiles, and the establishment of immune memory, which collectively shape immune responses against HIV. Viral dynamics in HIV-infected infants differ markedly from those in adults, characterized by high viral loads, diverse viral subtypes, and the early establishment of viral reservoirs within immune cells. These reservoirs, particularly in sanctuary sites like the central nervous system, pose challenges for achieving viral eradication and long-term remission. Effective management requires strategies to characterize and target these reservoirs, alongside early intervention to mitigate viral replication and preserve immune function. Advances in viral monitoring technologies and treatment regimens are essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing the global burden of pediatric HIV infection.

        <tr id="Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an age-related disease with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Activation of lung fibroblasts and differentiation to myofibroblasts are the principal effectors of disease pathology, but damage and senescence of alveolar epithelial cells, specifically type II (ATII) cells, has recently been identified as a potential trigger event for the progressive disease cycle. Targeting ATII senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is an attractive therapeutic strategy; however, translatable primary human cell models that enable mechanistic studies and drug development are lacking. Here, we describe a novel system of conditioned medium (CM) transfer from bleomycin-induced senescent primary alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) onto normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) that demonstrates an enhanced fibrotic transcriptional and secretory phenotype compared to non-senescent AEC CM treatment or direct bleomycin damage of the NHLFs. In this system, the bleomycin-treated AECs exhibit classical hallmarks of cellular senescence, including SASP and a gene expression profile that resembles aberrant epithelial cells of the IPF lung. Fibroblast activation by CM transfer is attenuated by pre-treatment of senescent AECs with the senolytic Navitoclax and AD80, but not with the standard of care agent Nintedanib or senomorphic JAK-targeting drugs (e.g., ABT-317, ruxolitinib). This model provides a relevant human system for profiling novel senescence-targeting therapeutics for IPF drug development.">

Our previous study demonstrated the protective effect of tofacitinib against murine toxin-induced shock and a beneficial effect against S. aureus sepsis. In the current study, we examined the effects of tofacitinib on T-cell response in peripheral blood using a mouse model of enterotoxin-induced shock. Our data revealed that tofacitinib suppresses the activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. Furthermore, both gene and protein levels of Th1 cytokines were downregulated by tofacitinib treatment in mice with enterotoxin-induced shock. Importantly, we demonstrated that CD4+ cells, but not CD8+ cells, are pathogenic in mice with enterotoxin-induced shock. In conclusion, our findings suggest that tofacitinib treatment suppresses CD4+ T-cell activation and Th1 response, thereby aiding in protection against staphylococcal toxic shock in mice. This insight may guide the future development of novel therapies for STSS.">

        <tr id="Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major pathogen responsible for severe complications in patients with prior influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We have previously demonstrated that S. pneumoniae exhibits increased intracellular survival within IAV-infected cells. Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are widely used to treat pneumococcal infections. However, our prior work has shown that S. pneumoniae can develop intracellular FQ persistence, a phenomenon triggered by oxidative stress within host cells. This persistence allows the bacteria to withstand high FQ concentrations. In this study, we show that IAV infection enhances pneumococcal FQ persistence during intracellular survival within pneumocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. This enhancement is partly due to increased oxidative stress induced by the viral infection. We find that this phenotype is particularly pronounced in autophagy-proficient host cells, potentially resulting from IAV-induced blockage of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Moreover, we identified several S. pneumoniae genes involved in oxidative stress response that contribute to FQ persistence, including sodA (superoxide dismutase), clpL (chaperone), nrdH (glutaredoxin), and psaB (Mn+2 transporter component). Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of antibiotic persistence promoted by viral infection within host cells. This underscores the importance of considering this phenomenon when using FQs to treat pneumococcal infections, especially in patients with concurrent influenza A infection.">

In this study, we explored the immune and hematological dynamics in COVID-19 patients to gain insights into disease severity and prognosis. Our findings revealed distinct cytokine profiles in moderate and severe cases. IL12A was significantly upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from moderate cases, suggesting a potential role in initiating an effective immune response. Conversely, severe cases exhibited downregulation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL23A, TNFalpha, IL1B, and IFNG) alongside an upregulation of the immunosuppressive IL10, indicative of a dysregulated immune environment. Serum analysis showed elevated IL6 and IL10 levels in both moderate and severe cases, emphasizing their potential as markers for disease severity. Notably, no significant differences in serum cytokines were found between recovery and lethal cases. In lethal cases of COVID-19, elevated D-dimer, urea, and creatinine correlated with IL6 and IL10. This study contributes valuable information to the ongoing efforts to understand and manage the dysregulated immune responses underlying COVID-19 pathology.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as well as nontuberculous mycobacteria are intracellular pathogens whose treatment is extensive and increasingly impaired due to the rise of mycobacterial drug resistance. The loss of antibiotic efficacy has raised interest in the identification of host-directed therapeutics (HDT) to develop novel treatment strategies for mycobacterial infections. In this study, we identified amiodarone as a potential HDT candidate that inhibited both intracellular Mtb and Mycobacterium avium in primary human macrophages without directly impairing bacterial growth, thereby confirming that amiodarone acts in a host-mediated manner. Moreover, amiodarone induced the formation of (auto)phagosomes and enhanced autophagic targeting of mycobacteria in macrophages. The induction of autophagy by amiodarone is likely due to enhanced transcriptional regulation, as the nuclear intensity of the transcription factor EB, the master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, was strongly increased. Furthermore, blocking lysosomal degradation with bafilomycin impaired the host-beneficial effect of amiodarone. Finally, amiodarone induced autophagy and reduced bacterial burden in a zebrafish embryo model of tuberculosis, thereby confirming the HDT activity of amiodarone in vivo. In conclusion, we have identified amiodarone as an autophagy-inducing antimycobacterial HDT that improves host control of mycobacterial infections. IMPORTANCE Due to the global rise in antibiotic resistance, there is a strong need for alternative treatment strategies against intracellular bacterial infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Stimulating host defense mechanisms by host‐directed therapy (HDT) is a promising approach for treating mycobacterial infections. This study identified amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent, as a potential HDT candidate that inhibits the survival of Mtb and Mycobacterium avium in primary human macrophages. The antimycobacterial effect of amiodarone was confirmed in an in vivo tuberculosis model based on Mycobacterium marinum infection of zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, amiodarone induced autophagy and inhibition of the autophagic flux effectively impaired the host-protective effect of amiodarone, supporting that activation of the host (auto)phagolysosomal pathway is essential for the mechanism of action of amiodarone. In conclusion, we have identified amiodarone as an autophagy-inducing HDT that improves host control of a wide range of mycobacteria.

These treatments have marked a pivotal shift in cancer management. However, as “living drugs,” their effectiveness is dependent on their ability to proliferate and persist in patients. Recent studies indicate that the mechanisms regulating these crucial functions, as well as the T cell's differentiation state, are conditioned by metabolic shifts and the distinct utilization of metabolic pathways. These metabolic shifts, conditioned by nutrient availability as well as cell surface expression of metabolite transporters, are coupled to signaling pathways and the epigenetic landscape of the cell, modulating transcriptional, translational, and post‐translational profiles.

        <tr id="Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has converted HIV from a lethal disease to a chronic condition, yet co-morbidities persist. Incomplete immune recovery and chronic immune activation, especially in the gut mucosa, contribute to these complications. Inflammasomes, multi-protein complexes activated by innate immune receptors, appear to play a role in these inflammatory responses. In particular, preliminary data indicate the involvement of IFI16 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in chronic HIV infection. This study explores inflammasome function in monocytes from people with HIV (PWH); 22 ART-treated with suppressed viremia and 17 untreated PWH were compared to 33 HIV-negative donors. Monocytes were primed with LPS and inflammasomes activated with ATP in vitro. IFI16 and NLRP3 mRNA expression were examined in a subset of donors. IFI16 and NLRP3 expression in unstimulated monocytes correlated negatively with CD4 T cell counts in untreated PWH. For IFI16, there was also a positive correlation with viral load. Monocytes from untreated PWH exhibit increased release of IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF compared to treated PWH and HIV-negative donors. However, circulating monocytes in PWH are not pre-primed for inflammasome activation in vivo. The findings suggest a link between IFI16, NLRP3, and HIV progression, emphasizing their potential role in comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. The study provides insights into inflammasome regulation in HIV pathogenesis and its implications for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis and AIDS remain two of the most relevant human infectious diseases. The pathogens that cause them, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV, individually elicit an immune response that treads the line between beneficial and detrimental to the host. Co-infection further complexifies this response since the different cytokines acting on one infection might facilitate the dissemination of the other. In these responses, the role of type I interferons is often associated with antiviral mechanisms, while for bacteria such as Mtb, their importance and clinical relevance as a suitable target for manipulation are more controversial. In this article, we review the recent knowledge on how these interferons play distinct roles and sometimes have opposite consequences depending on the stage of the pathogenesis. We highlight the dichotomy between the acute and chronic infections displayed by both infections and how type I interferons contribute to an initial control of each infection individually, while their chronic induction, particularly during HIV infection, might facilitate Mtb primo-infection and progression to disease. We expect that further findings and their systematization will allow the definition of windows of opportunity for interferon manipulation according to the stage of infection, contributing to pathogen clearance and control of immunopathology.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Glioblastoma (GBM) has a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), largely mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we utilized a retroviral replicating vector (RRV) to deliver Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8), a master regulator of type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) development, in a syngeneic murine GBM model. We hypothesized that RRV-mediated delivery of IRF8 could "reprogram" intratumoral MDSCs into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby restore T-cell responses.


METHODS
Effects of RRV-IRF8 on survival and tumor growth kinetics were examined in the SB28 murine GBM model. Immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression assays. We assayed functional immunosuppression and antigen presentation by ex vivo T-cell-myeloid co-culture.


RESULTS
Intratumoral injection of RRV-IRF8 in mice bearing intracerebral SB28 glioma significantly suppressed the tumor growth and prolonged survival. RRV-IRF8 treated tumors exhibited significant enrichment of cDC1s and CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, myeloid cells derived from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed decreased expression of the immunosuppressive markers Arg1 and IDO1 and demonstrated reduced suppression of naïve T-cell proliferation in ex vivo co-culture, compared to controls. Furthermore, DCs from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed increased antigen presentation compared to those from control tumors. In vivo treatment with azidothymidine (AZT), a viral replication inhibitor, showed that IRF8 transduction in both tumor and non-tumor cells is necessary for survival benefit, associated with a reprogrammed, cDC1- and CD8 T-cell-enriched TIME.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that reprogramming of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells by in vivo expression of IRF8 may reduce immunosuppression and enhance antigen presentation, achieving improved tumor control.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma IDH-wildtype is highly immune suppressive and is characterized by a strong component of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). To interfere with the immune suppressive functions of MDSCs, a comprehensive understanding on how MDSCs acquire their suppressive phenotype is essential. Previously, we and others have shown a distinct Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptor expression profile for MDSCs in glioblastoma. Siglec receptors can transmit inhibitory signals comparable to PD-1 and are suggested to act as glyco-immune checkpoints. Here, we investigated how glioma specific Siglec-sialic acid interactions influence myeloid immune suppressive functions. Co-culturing monocytes with glioblastoma cells induced CD163 expression on the monocytes. Upon desialylation of the glioblastoma cells, this induction of CD163 was hampered, and furthermore, the monocytes were now able to secrete higher amounts of IL-6 and TNFα compared to fully sialylated glioblastoma cells. Additionally, Siglec-specific triggering using anti-Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 antibodies displayed a decreased TNFα secretion by the monocytes, validating the role of the Siglec–Sialic axis in the co-culture experiments. Together, our results demonstrate that glioblastoma cells induce a myeloid immune-suppressive phenotype that could be partly rescued by lowering the glioblastoma-associated sialic acid levels. This manuscript supports further research of the Siglec–Sialic acid axis in the context of glioblastoma and its potential to improve clinical outcome.">

        <tr id="AbstractThroughout history, the influenza A virus has caused numerous devastating global pandemics. Macrophages, as pivotal innate immune cells, exhibit a wide range of immune functions characterized by distinct polarization states, reflecting their intricate heterogeneity. In this study, we employed the time-resolved single-cell sequencing technique coupled with metabolic RNA labelling to elucidate the dynamic transcriptional changes in distinct polarized states of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) upon infection with the influenza A virus. Our approach not only captures the temporal dimension of transcriptional activity, which is lacking in conventional scRNA-seq methods, but also reveals that M2-polarized Arg1_macrophages is the sole state supporting successful replication of influenza A virus. Furthermore, we identified distinct antigen presentation capabilities to CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells across diverse polarized states of macrophages. Notably, the M1 phenotype, exhibited by both bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and murine alveolar macrophages (AMs), demonstrated superior conventional and cross-presentation abilities for exogenous antigens, with a particular emphasis on cross-presentation capacity. Additionally, as CD8+ T cell differentiation progressed, M1 polarization exhibited an enhanced capacity for cross-presentation. All three phenotypes of BMDMs, including M1, demonstrated robust presentation of CD4+ regulatory T cells, while displaying limited ability to present naive CD4+ T cells. These findings offer novel insights into the immunological regulatory mechanisms governing distinct polarized states of macrophages, particularly their roles in restricting the replication of influenza A virus and modulating antigen-specific T cell responses through innate immunity.">

        <tr id="Identifying the origins and contributions of different immune cell populations following brain injury is crucial for understanding their roles in inflammation and tissue repair. This study investigated the infiltration and phenotypic characteristics of skull bone marrow-derived immune cells in the murine brain after TBI. We performed calvarium transplantation from GFP donor mice and subjected the recipients to controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury 14 days post-transplant. Confocal imaging at 3 days post-CCI revealed GFP+ calvarium-derived cells infiltrating the ipsilateral core lesional area, expressing CD45 and CD11b immune markers. These cells included neutrophil (Ly6G+) and monocyte (Ccr2+) identities. Calvarium-derived GFP+/Iba1+ monocyte/macrophages expressed the efferocytosis receptor MerTK and displayed engulfment of NeuN+ and caspase 3+ apoptotic cells. Phenotypic analysis showed that greater calvarium-derived monocyte/macrophages disproportionately express the anti-inflammatory arginase-1 marker than pro-inflammatory CD86. To differentiate the responses of blood- and calvarium-derived macrophages, we transplanted GFP calvarium skull bone into tdTomato bone marrow chimeric mice, then performed CCI injury 14 days post-transplant. Calvarium-derived GFP+ cells predominantly infiltrated the lesion boundary, while blood-derived TdTomato+ cells dispersed throughout the lesion and peri-lesion. Compared to calvarium-derived cells, more blood-derived cells expressed pro-inflammatory CD86 and displayed altered 3D morphologic traits. These findings uniquely demonstrate that skull bone-derived immune cells infiltrate the brain after injury and contribute to the neuroinflammatory milieu, representing a novel immune cell source that may be further investigated for their causal role in functional outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection playsa significant role in the etiology and progression of liver‐relatedpathologies, encompassing chronic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventual hepatocellularcarcinoma (HCC). Notably, HBV infection stands as the primary etiologicalfactor driving the development of HCC. Given the significant contribution ofHBV infection to liver diseases, a comprehensive understanding of immunedynamics in the liver microenvironment, spanning chronic HBV infection,fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC, is essential. In this review, we focused on thefunctional alterations of CD8+ T cells within the pathogenic livermicroenvironment from HBV infection to HCC. We thoroughly reviewed the roles ofhypoxia, acidic pH, metabolic reprogramming, amino acid deficiency, inhibitory checkpointmolecules, immunosuppressive cytokines, and the gut‐liver communication in shapingthe dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in the liver microenvironment. Thesefactors significantly impact the clinical prognosis. Furthermore, we comprehensivelyreviewed CD8+ T cell‐based therapy strategies for liver diseases,encompassing HBV infection, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. Strategies includeimmune checkpoint blockades, metabolic T‐cell targeting therapy, therapeuticT‐cell vaccination, and adoptive transfer of genetically engineered CD8+ T cells, along with the combined usage of programmed cell death protein‐1/programmeddeath ligand‐1 (PD‐1/PD‐L1) inhibitors with mitochondria‐targeted antioxidants.Given that targeting CD8+ T cells at various stages of hepatitis Bvirus‐induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV + HCC) shows promise, we reviewedthe ongoing need for research to elucidate the complex interplay between CD8+ T cells and the liver microenvironment in the progression of HBV infection toHCC. We also discussed personalized treatment regimens, combining therapeuticstrategies and harnessing gut microbiota modulation, which holds potential forenhanced clinical benefits. In conclusion, this review delves into the immunedynamics of CD8+ T cells, microenvironment changes, and therapeuticstrategies within the liver during chronic HBV infection, HCC progression, andrelated liver diseases.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Evidence suggests that COVID-19 predisposes to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). While monocytes/macrophages play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of atherosclerosis, less is known about their immunopathogenic mechanisms that lead to CVDs during COVID-19. Natural killer (NK) cells, which play an intermediary role during pathologies like atherosclerosis, are dysregulated during COVID-19. Here, we sought to investigate altered immune cells and their associations with CVD risk during severe COVID-19.


METHODS
We measured plasma biomarkers of CVDs and determined phenotypes of circulating immune subsets using spectral flow cytometry. We compared these between patients with severe COVID-19 (severe, n=31), those who recovered from severe COVID-19 (recovered, n=29), and SARS-CoV-2-uninfected controls (controls, n=17). In vivo observations were supported using in vitro assays to highlight possible mechanistic links between dysregulated immune subsets and biomarkers during and after COVID-19. We performed multidimensional analyses of published single-cell transcriptome data of monocytes and NK cells during severe COVID-19 to substantiate in vivo findings.


RESULTS
During severe COVID-19, we observed alterations in cardiometabolic biomarkers including oxidized-low-density lipoprotein, which showed decreased levels in severe and recovered groups. Severe patients exhibited dysregulated monocyte subsets, including increased frequencies of proinflammatory intermediate monocytes (also observed in the recovered) and decreased nonclassical monocytes. All identified NK-cell subsets in the severe COVID-19 group displayed increased expression of activation and tissue-resident markers, such as CD69. We observed significant correlations between altered immune subsets and plasma oxidized-low-density lipoprotein levels. In vitro assays revealed increased uptake of oxidized-low-density lipoprotein into monocyte-derived macrophages in the presence of NK cells activated by plasma of patients with severe COVID-19. Transcriptome analyses confirmed enriched proinflammatory responses and lipid dysregulation associated with epigenetic modifications in monocytes and NK cells during severe COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides new insights into the involvement of monocytes and NK cells in the increased CVD risk observed during and after COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Cystatin F (CstF) is a protease inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, including those involved in activating the perforin/granzyme cytotoxic pathways. It is targeted at the endolysosomal pathway but can also be secreted to the extracellular milieu or endocytosed by bystander cells. CstF was shown to be significantly increased in tuberculous pleurisy, and during HIV coinfection, pleural fluids display high viral loads. In human macrophages, our previous results revealed a strong upregulation of CstF in phagocytes activated by interferon γ or after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). CstF manipulation using RNA silencing led to increased proteolytic activity of lysosomal cathepsins, improving Mtb intracellular killing. In the present work, we investigate the impact of CstF depletion in macrophages during the coinfection of Mtb-infected phagocytes with lymphocytes infected with HIV. The results indicate that decreasing the CstF released by phagocytes increases the major pro-granzyme convertase cathepsin C of cytotoxic immune cells from peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes. Consequently, an observed augmentation of the granzyme B cytolytic activity leads to a significant reduction in viral replication in HIV-infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Ultimately, this knowledge can be crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches to control both pathogens based on manipulating CstF.">

        <tr id="Abstract The late 2019 emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, caused profound and unprecedented disruption to the global socio-economic structure, negatively affecting millions of lives worldwide. A typical hallmark of severe COVID-19 is hyper inflammation due to aberrant cytokine release (cytokine storm) by innate immune cells. Recent studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2, through its spike (S) protein, can activate the body’s innate immune cells via Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR4. In silico studies have demonstrated that the S protein binds with high affinity to TLR4, triggering downstream signaling processes that result in pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Compared to other TLRs, such as TLR2, TLR4 plays a more significant role in initiating and sustaining the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, interactions between the virus and target cells can enhance the cellular expression of TLR4, making cells more susceptible to viral interactions and subsequent inflammation. This increased expression of TLR4 upon viral entry creates a feedback loop, where heightened TLR4 levels lead to amplified inflammatory responses, contributing to the severity of the disease. Additionally, TLR4’s potent activation of inflammatory pathways sets it apart from other TLRs, underscoring its pivotal role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this review, we thoroughly explore the multitude of regulatory signaling pathways that SARS-CoV-2 employs to incite inflammation. We specifically focus on the critical impact of TLR4 activation compared to other TLRs, highlighting how TLR4’s interactions with the viral S protein can exacerbate the severity of COVID-19. By delving into the mechanisms of TLR4-mediated inflammation, we aim to shed light on potential therapeutic targets that could mitigate the inflammatory damage caused by severe COVID-19. Understanding the unique role of TLR4 in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection could pave the way for novel treatment strategies that specifically inhibit this receptor’s activity, thereby reducing the overall disease burden and improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The recent pandemic was caused by the emergence of a new human pathogen, SARS-CoV-2. While the rapid development of many vaccines provided an end to the immediate crisis, there remains an urgent need to understand more about this new virus and what constitutes a beneficial immune response in terms of successful resolution of infection. Indeed, this is key for development of vaccines that provide long lasting protective immunity. The interferon lambda (IFNL) family of cytokines are produced early in response to infection and are generally considered anti-viral and beneficial. However, data regarding production of IFNL cytokines in COVID-19 patients is highly variable, and generally from underpowered studies. In this study, we measured all three IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3 cytokines in plasma from a well characterised, large COVID-19 cohort (n=399) that included good representation from patients with a more indolent disease progression, and hence a beneficial immune response. While all three cytokines were produced, they differed in both the frequency of expression in patients, and the levels produced. IFNL3 was produced in almost all patients but neither protein level nor IFNL3/IFNL4 SNPs were associated with clinical outcome. In contrast, both IFNL1 and IFNL2 levels were significantly lower, or absent, in plasma of patients that had a more severe disease outcome. These data are consistent with the concept that early IFNL1 and IFNL2 cytokine production is protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Despite its importance, the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on intestinal epithelia is poorly understood. To address this, we established an intestinal barrier model integrating epithelial Caco-2 cells, mucus-secreting HT29 cells and Raji cells. This gut epithelial model allows efficient differentiation of Caco-2 cells into microfold-like cells, faithfully mimics intestinal barrier function, and is highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early strains of SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta variant replicated with high efficiency, severely disrupted barrier function, and depleted tight junction proteins, such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1. In comparison, Omicron subvariants also depleted ZO-1 from tight junctions but had fewer damaging effects on mucosal integrity and barrier function. Remdesivir, the fusion inhibitor EK1 and the transmembrane serine protease 2 inhibitor Camostat inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication and thus epithelial barrier damage, while the Cathepsin inhibitor E64d was ineffective. Our results support that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts intestinal barrier function but further suggest that circulating Omicron variants are less damaging than earlier viral strains.">

Despite the progress made in the treatment of DLBCL through the development of novel drugs, an estimated one-third of patients encounter relapse or acquire refractory disease. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of DLBCL, a complex network consisting of cellular and noncellular components that engage in interactions with the tumor, is a parameter that is gaining increasing attention. The TME comprises both the immune and nonimmune microenvironments. The immune microenvironment comprises natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T and B lymphocytes. The nonimmune microenvironment consists of the extracellular matrix (ECM), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), mesenchymal stromal cells, and other molecules that are secreted. Despite ongoing research, the exact impact of these components and their interaction on the progression of the disease remains elusive. A comprehensive review of significant discoveries concerning the cellular and noncellular constituents, molecular characteristics, and treatment response and prognosis of the TME in DLBCL, as well as the potential targeting of the TME with novel therapeutic approaches, is provided in this article.">

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential impacts of Mr BMT approach on peripheral organs. The Mr BMT approach involves depleting resident microglia through colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibition, so we first evaluated the survival of peripheral macrophages after CSF-1R inhibition. We observed that the CSF-1R antagonist, PLX5622, exerted significant elimination of peripheral tissue macrophages, albeit with lower efficiency than in the CNS. Furthermore, we discovered that Mr BMT achieved replacement efficiencies comparable to tBMT in peripheral tissues such as the liver, kidney, lung, and spleen. Our findings suggested Mr BMT is a highly efficient strategy for allogeneic macrophage replacement in both the CNS and peripheral organs, and it could have potential clinical applications.">

        <tr id="Hepatitis B, caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), often progresses to chronic infection, leading to severe complications, such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic HBV infection is characterized by a complex interplay between the virus and the host immune system, resulting in immune cell exhaustion, a phenomenon commonly observed in chronic viral infections and cancer. This state of exhaustion involves elevated levels of inhibitory molecules, cells, and cell surface receptors, as opposed to stimulatory counterparts. This review aims to elucidate the expression patterns of various co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptors on immune cells isolated from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. By analyzing existing data, the review conducts comparisons between CHB patients and healthy adults, explores the differences between HBV-specific and total T cells in CHB patients, and examines variations between intrahepatic and peripheral immune cells in CHB patients. Understanding the mechanisms underlying immune exhaustion in CHB is crucial for developing novel immunotherapeutic approaches. This detailed analysis sheds light on the immune exhaustion observed in CHB and lays the groundwork for future combined immunotherapy strategies aimed at leveraging checkpoint receptors to restore immune function and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Solid gastrointestinal tumors often respond poorly to immunotherapy for the complex tumor microenvironment (TME), which is exacerbated by immune system alterations. Immunosenescence is the process of increased diversification of immune genes due to aging and other factors, leading to a decrease in the recognition function of the immune system. This process involves immune organs, immune cells, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The most fundamental change is DNA damage, resulting in TME remodeling. The main manifestations are worsening inflammation, increased immunosuppressive SASP production, decreased immune cell antitumor activity, and the accumulation of tumor-associated fibroblasts and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, making antitumor therapy less effective. Senotherapy strategies to remove senescent cells and block key senescence processes can have synergistic effects with other treatments. This review focuses on immunoenescence and its impact on the solid TME. We characterize the immunosenescent TME and discuss future directions for antitumor therapies targeting senescence.">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses pose a significant burden on global human health. Influenza has a broad cellular tropism in the airway, but how infection of different epithelial cell types impacts replication kinetics and burden in the airways is not fully understood. Using primary human airway cultures, which recapitulate the diverse epithelial cell landscape of the human airways, we investigated the impact of cell type composition on virus tropism and replication kinetics. Cultures were highly diverse across multiple donors and 30 independent differentiation conditions and supported a range of influenza replication. Although many cell types were susceptible to influenza, ciliated and secretory cells were predominantly infected. Despite the strong tropism preference for secretory and ciliated cells, which consistently make up 75% or more of infected cells, only ciliated cells were associated with increased virus production. Surprisingly, infected secretory cells were associated with overall reduced virus output. The disparate response and contribution to influenza virus production could be due to different pro- and antiviral interferon-stimulated gene signatures between ciliated and secretory populations, which were interrogated with single-cell RNA sequencing. These data highlight the heterogeneous outcomes of influenza virus infections in the complex cellular environment of the human airway and the disparate impacts of infected cell identity on multiround burst size, even among preferentially infected cell types.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against β-coronaviruses (β-CoVs), a family of viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2. Viral sensing via pattern recognition receptors triggers inflammation and cell death, which are essential components of the innate immune response that facilitate viral clearance. However, excessive activation of the innate immune system and inflammatory cell death can result in uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in cytokine storm and pathology. PANoptosis, innate immune, inflammatory cell death initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes, has been implicated in the pathology of viral infections. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PANoptosis in response to β-CoV infection is critical for identifying new therapeutic targets that can mitigate disease severity. In the current study, we analyzed findings from a cell death-based CRISPR screen with archetypal β-CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as the trigger to characterize host molecules required for inflammatory cell death. As a result, we identified SMARCA4, a chromatin regulator, as a putative host factor required for PANoptosis in response to MHV. Furthermore, we observed that gRNA-mediated deletion of Smarca4 inhibited MHV-induced PANoptotic cell death in macrophages. These findings have potential translational and clinical implications for the advancement of treatment strategies for β-CoVs and other infections.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, is a promising treatment modality in oncology that involves augmenting the tumor-attacking capabilities of the immune system. Several preclinical and clinical studies have underscored the transformative potential of ICBs in the context of malignancies. 1 However, the efficacy of ICB therapy is often impeded by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in solid tumors, which are commonly due to a paucity of tumor neoantigens, checkpoint targets, and the inflammatory presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is profoundly immunosuppressive, which is the key reason for the limited clinical efficacy of ICB therapy. Within this milieu, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant myeloid cell subset, and their high infiltration levels have been implicated in mediating resistance to ICB therapy, thereby correlating with adverse prognosis across a spectrum of cancers. 3 Recent advances reported in Nature Cancer have shed light on specific TAM subpopulations that are instrumental in facilitating tumor immune evasion and resistance to ICB therapy. Two recent studies have delineated the roles of Sirp α + TAMs in colorectal cancer (CRC) 4 and Siglec-9 + TAMs in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. The role of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in pediatric COVID-19 patients remains unclear.


METHODS
We isolated EVs from healthy controls (n = 13) and pediatric COVID-19 patients (n = 104) with varying severity during acute and convalescent phases using serial ultracentrifugation. EV effects on healthy PBMCs, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocytes were assessed through in vitro assays, flow cytometry, and ELISA.


RESULTS
Our findings indicate that COVID-19 severity correlates with diverse immune responses. Severe acute cases exhibited increased cytokine levels, decreased IFNγ levels, and lower CD4+ T cell and monocyte counts, suggesting immunosuppression. EVs from severe acute patients stimulated healthy cells to express higher PDL1, increased Th2 and Treg cells, reduced IFNγ secretion, and altered Th1/Th17 ratios. Patient-derived EVs significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (p < .001 for mild, p = .0025 for severe cases) and decreased CD4+ T cell (p = .043) and monocyte (p = .033) populations in stimulated healthy PBMCs.


CONCLUSION
This study reveals the complex relationship between immunological responses and EV-mediated effects, emphasizing the impact of COVID-19 severity. We highlight the potential role of plasma-derived EVs in early-stage immunosuppression in severe COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="GMCSF, discovered in 1977, was one of the first growth factors for myelopoiesis. However, over time, it has been found to be redundant for basal myelopoiesis. Rather, its important function seems to be its effect on mature myeloid cells and the immune system. It is produced by a variety of cells, including macrophages, endothelial cells, T-cells etc. and works on the GMCSF receptor, which is mainly expressed by mature myeloid cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. It has been found to be an important mediator of at least two autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Animal models prove that GMCSF produced from T-cells play a crucial role in their pathogenesis of both these autoimmune diseases. This has led to the development of therapeutics which target GMCSF or its receptor. Clinical trials have been carried out in rheumatoid arthritis, which have shown modest efficacy. In addition, anti-GMCSF therapy has shown promise in giant cell arteritis.">

        <tr id="Since late 2019, the world has been devastated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with more than 760 million people affected and ∼seven million deaths reported. Although effective treatments for COVID-19 are currently limited, there has been a strong focus on developing new therapeutic approaches to address the morbidity and mortality linked to this disease. An approach that is currently being investigated is the use of exosome-based therapies. Exosomes are small, extracellular vesicles that play a role in many clinical diseases, including viral infections, infected cells release exosomes that can transmit viral components, such as miRNAs and proteins, and can also include receptors for viruses that facilitate viral entry into recipient cells. SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to impact the formation, secretion, and release of exosomes, thereby potentially facilitating or intensifying the transmission of the virus among cells, tissues and individuals. Therefore, designing synthetic exosomes that carry immunomodulatory cargo and antiviral compounds are proposed to be a promising strategy for the treatment of COVID-19 and other viral diseases. Moreover, exosomes generated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) might be employed as cell-free therapeutic agents, as MSC-derived exosomes can diminish the cytokine storm and reverse the suppression of host anti-viral defences associated with COVID-19, and boost the repair of lung damage linked to mitochondrial activity. The present article discusses the significance and roles of exosomes in COVID-19, and explores potential future applications of exosomes in combating this disease. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, exosome-based therapies could represent a promising avenue for improving patient outcomes and reducing the impact of this disease.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells have the potential to eliminate HIV-1-infected cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). NK cell activation is tightly regulated by the engagement of its inhibitory and activating receptors. The activating receptor CD16 drives ADCC upon binding to the Fc portion of antibodies; NK cell activation is further sustained by the co-engagement of activating receptors NTB-A and 2B4. During HIV-1 infection, Nef and Vpu accessory proteins contribute to ADCC escape by downregulating the ligands of NTB-A and 2B4. HIV-1 also evades ADCC by keeping its envelope glycoproteins (Env) in a “closed” conformation which effectively masks epitopes recognized by non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) which are abundant in the plasma of people living with HIV. To achieve this, the virus uses its accessory proteins Nef and Vpu to downregulate the CD4 receptor, which otherwise interacts with Env and exposes the epitopes recognized by nnAbs. Small CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mc) have the capacity to expose these epitopes, thus sensitizing infected cells to ADCC. Given the central role of NK cell co-activating receptors NTB-A and 2B4 in Fc-effector functions, we studied their contribution to CD4mc-mediated ADCC. Despite the fact that their ligands are partially downregulated by HIV-1, we found that both co-activating receptors significantly contribute to CD4mc sensitization of HIV-1-infected cells to ADCC.">

Mounting evidence suggests involvement of peripheral immune cells in PD pathogenesis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the potential role of peripheral immune secreted cytokines in modulating midbrain astrocyte reactivity. Human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes were exposed to 5% and 10% CD4+ T cell conditioned media (CD4CM) for 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days to assess chronic exposure. Additionally, astrocytes were exposed to the Th17 cell cytokine, IL-17A (10 ng/mL), alone and in combination with TNF-α (0.3 ng/mL) to assess potential synergistic effects of both cytokines at 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days. CD4CM induced acute and chronic alterations in midbrain astrocytes. Increased NFκB translocation to the nucleus, increased expression of the pro-inflammatory genes, IL-1β, CXCL10 at 24 h, C3, LCN2, IL-6 at 24 and 48 h, as well as an increase in their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CXCL10 at both these time points were observed. A synergistic response to the combination of IL-17A and TNF-α on increasing inflammatory gene expression and cytokine release occurred. IL-17A and TNF-α increased intensity of S100β at 24 h, decreased nuclear area and increased circularity of astrocytes at 72 h. A synergistic effect on γH2AX intensity at 72 h and an increase in LDH release at 7 days was observed. Our results demonstrate that IL-17A and TNF-α act synergistically, enhancing midbrain astrocyte reactivity to a similar degree as CD4CM. This highlights the importance of the peripheral immune secreted cytokines in increasing the reactivity status of midbrain astrocytes, implicating their role in PD.">

However, the precise pathogenic mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of viral–bacterial co-infections remain elusive, posing significant challenges for disease management. In our study, we administered a combination of IAV and LPS to mice and examined associated parameters, including the lung function, lung index, wet/dry ratio, serum inflammatory cytokines, Nedd4L expression in lung tissue, and mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines. Co-infection with IAV and LPS exacerbated lung tissue inflammation and amplified M1 macrophage expression in lung tissue. Additionally, we stimulated macrophages with IAV and LPS in vitro, assessing the inflammatory cytokine content in the cell supernatant and cytokine mRNA expression within the cells. This combined stimulation intensified the inflammatory response in macrophages and upregulated Nedd4L protein and mRNA expression. Subsequently, we used siRNA to knockdown Nedd4L in macrophages, revealing that suppression of Nedd4L expression alleviated the inflammatory response triggered by concurrent IAV and LPS stimulation. Collectively, these results highlight the pivotal role of Nedd4L in mediating the exacerbated inflammatory responses observed in IAV and LPS co-infections.">

This study explores the host’s innate and adaptive immune system response to TB in HIV immunocompromised patients, highlighting the significant role of CD8+ T cells. While the crucial role of macrophages and cytokines, like TNF-α and IFN-γ, in managing the host’s immune response to M. tb is examined, the emphasis is on the changes that occur as a result of HIV coinfection. With the progression of HIV infection, the primary source of IFN-γ changes from CD4+ to CD8+ T cells, especially when latent TB advances to an active state. This study sheds light on the necessity of developing new preventative measures such as vaccines and new treatment approaches to TB, especially for immunocompromised patients, who are at a higher risk of life-threatening complications due to TB-HIV coinfection.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a complex condition of inflammatory and immune dysregulation, triggered by severe infection. In survivors, chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation linger, facilitating the emergence of infections. CD8 dysfunction contributes to immunosuppression in sepsis survivors. We devised an animal model that enabled us to identify and analyze CD8-intrinsic defects induced by sepsis. We adoptively transferred CD45.1 CD8 OT-I T cells into CD45.2 congenic mice and subjected them to cecal ligature and puncture, to induce abdominal sepsis. One month later, we isolated the transferred CD8 cells. Surface marker expression confirmed they had not been activated through the TCR. CD8 OT-I T cells isolated from septic (or sham-operated) mice were transferred to second recipients, which were challenged with OVA-expressing Listeria monocytogenes. We compared effector capacities between OT-I cells exposed to sepsis and control cells. Naive mice that received OT-I cells exposed to sepsis had higher bacterial burden and a shorter survival when challenged with OVA-expressing L. monocytogenes. OT-I cells isolated from septic mice produced less IFN-γ but had conserved activation, expansion potential, and cytotoxic function. We observed lower transcript levels of IFN-γ and of the long noncoding RNA Ifng-as1, a local regulator of the epigenetic landscape, in cells exposed to sepsis. Accordingly, local abundance of a histone modification characteristic of active promoter regions was reduced in sepsis-exposed CD8 T cells. Our results identify a mechanism through which inflammation in the context of sepsis affects CD8 T cell function intrinsically.">

        <tr id="Brucella abortus (Ba) is a pathogen that survives inside macrophages. Despite being its preferential niche, Ba infects other cells, as shown by the multiple signs and symptoms humans present. This pathogen can evade our immune system. Ba displays a mechanism of down-modulating MHC-I on monocytes/macrophages in the presence of IFN-γ (when Th1 response is triggered) without altering the total expression of MHC-I. The retained MHC-I proteins are located within the Golgi Apparatus (GA). The RNA of Ba is one of the PAMPs that trigger this phenomenon. However, we acknowledged whether this event could be triggered in other cells relevant during Ba infection. Here, we demonstrate that Ba RNA reduced the surface expression of MHC-I induced by IFN-γ in the human bronchial epithelium (Calu-6), the human alveolar epithelium (A-549) and the endothelial microvasculature (HMEC) cell lines. In Calu-6 and HMEC cells, Ba RNA induces the retention of MHC-I in the GA. This phenomenon was not observed in A-549 cells. We then evaluated the effect of Ba RNA on the secretion of IL-8, IL-6 and MCP-1, key cytokines in Ba infection. Contrary to our expectations, HMEC, Calu-6 and A-549 cells treated with Ba RNA had higher IL-8 and IL-6 levels compared to untreated cells. In addition, we showed that Ba RNA down-modulates the MHC-I surface expression induced by IFN-γ on human monocytes/macrophages via the pathway of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). So, cells were stimulated with an EGFR ligand-blocking antibody (Cetuximab) and Ba RNA. Neutralization of the EGFR to some extent reversed the down-modulation of MHC-I mediated by Ba RNA in HMEC and A-549 cells. In conclusion, this is the first study exploring a central immune evasion strategy, such as the downregulation of MHC-I surface expression, beyond monocytes and could shed light on how it persists effectively within the host, enduring unseen and escaping CD8+ T cell surveillance.">

The ability of vertebrate T and B lymphocytes to exhibit classic recall responses has long been regarded as a distinguishing characteristic. However, natural killer (NK) cells have been found to acquire immunological memory in a manner akin to T and B cells. The fundamental principles derived from the investigation of NK cell memory offer novel insights into innate immunity and have the potential to pave the way for innovative strategies to enhance therapeutic interventions against multiple diseases including cancer. Here, we reviewed the fundamental characteristics, memory development and regulatory mechanism of NK cell memory. Moreover, we will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the accomplishments, obstacles, and future direction pertaining to the utilization of NK cell memory in the field of cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The liver is a vital organ that continuously adapts to a wide and dynamic diversity of self-antigens and xenobiotics. This involves the active contribution of immune cells, particularly by the liver-resident macrophages, the Kupffer cells (KCs), which exert a variety of central functions in liver homeostasis and disease. As such, KCs interact with their microenvironment to shape the hepatic cellular landscape, control gut-derived signal integration, and modulate metabolism. On injury, the rapid recruitment of bone marrow monocyte-derived macrophages alters this status quo and, when unrestrained, drastically compromises liver homeostasis, immune surveillance, and tissue organization. Several factors determine the functional roles of liver macrophages in these processes, such as their ontogeny, activation/polarization profile and, importantly, spatial distribution within the liver. Loss of tolerance and adaptability of the hepatic immune environment may result in persistent inflammation, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and a tumorigenic niche promoting liver cancer. In this review, we aim at providing the most recent breakthroughs in our understanding of liver macrophage biology, particularly their diversity and adaptability in the hepatic spatiotemporal context, as well as on potential therapeutic interventions that may hold the key to tackling remaining clinical challenges of varying etiologies in hepatology.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Antibiotic-Refractory Lyme Arthritis (ARLA) involves a complex interplay of T cell responses targeting Borrelia burgdorferi antigens succeeding towards autoantigens by epitope spreading. However, the precise molecular mechanisms driving the pathogenic T cell response in ARLA remain unclear. Our aim was to elucidate the molecular program of disease-specific Th cells.


METHODS
Using flow cytometry, high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and scRNA-seq of CD4+ Th cells isolated from the joints of European ARLA patients, we aimed at inferring antigen specificity through unbiased analysis of TCR repertoire patterns, identifying surrogate markers for disease-specific TCRs and connecting TCR specificity to transcriptional patterns.


RESULTS
PD-1hiHLA-DR+CD4+ effector T cells were clonally expanded within the inflamed joints and persisted throughout disease course. Among these cells, we identified a distinct TCRβ motif restricted to HLA-DRB1*11 or *13 alleles. These alleles, being underrepresented in North American ARLA patients, were unexpectedly prevalent in our European cohort. The identified TCRβ motif served as surrogate marker for a convergent TCR response specific to ARLA, distinguishing it from other rheumatic diseases. In the scRNA-seq dataset, the TCRβ motif particularly mapped to peripheral T helper (TPH) cells displaying signs of sustained proliferation, continuous TCR signaling, and expressing CXCL13 and IFN-γ.


CONCLUSION
By inferring disease-specific TCRs from synovial T cells we identified a convergent TCR response in the joints of ARLA patients that continuously fueled the expansion of TPH cells expressing a pathogenic cytokine effector program. The identified TCRs will aid in uncovering the major antigen targets of the maladaptive immune response.

        <tr id="Inflammation is a key factor in both influenza and radiation-induced lung pathophysiology. This implies a commonality of response to pulmonary damage from these insults and suggests exacerbated pathology may occur after combined exposure. We therefore tested the hypothesis that past inflammation from viral infection alters the lung microenvironment and lowers tolerance for radiation injury. Mice were inoculated with influenza A virus (IAV) and three weeks later, after virus clearance, mice received total-body irradiation (TBI). Survival as well as systemic and local lung inflammation were assessed, and strategies to mitigate pulmonary injury were investigated. After IAV infection alone, body condition recovered within 3 weeks, however inflammatory pathways remained active for 15 weeks. IAV infection exacerbated subsequent TBI responses, evident by increased lethality, enhanced histologically evident lung injury and an altered lung macrophage phenotype. To mitigate this enhanced sensitivity, captopril [an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)] was administered to limit tissue inflammation, or inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophage recruitment was blocked with a C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) inhibitor. Both treatments abrogated the changes in circulating immune cells observed 4 weeks after TBI, and attenuated pro-inflammatory phenotypes in lung alveolar macrophages, appearing to shift immune cell dynamics towards recovery. Histologically apparent lung injury was not improved by either treatment. We show that latent lung injury from viral infection exacerbates radiation morbidity and mortality. Although strategies that attenuate proinflammatory immune cell phenotypes can normalize macrophage dynamics, this does not fully mitigate lung injury. Recognizing that past viral infections can enhance lung radiosensitivity is of critical importance for patients receiving TBI, as it could increase the incidence of adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="The re-emergence of the Mpox (formerly monkeypox) in 2022 in non-endemic countries has raised many concerns for global health due to its high transmissibility and mortality rate. A major challenge in fighting Mpox is its ability to evade the host's innate immune system, which is the first line of defense against viral infections. Mpox encodes various proteins that interfere with key antiviral pathways and mechanisms, such as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, cytokine production, complement and inflammasome activation, and chemokine binding. These proteins modulate the expression and function of innate immune mediators, such as interferons, interleukins, and toll-like receptors, and impair the recruitment and activation of innate immune cells, such as natural killer cells. By suppressing or altering these innate immune responses, Mpox enhances its replication and infection in the host tissues and organs, leading to systemic inflammation, tissue damage, and organ failure. This study reveals new insights into the molecular and cellular interactions between Mpox and the host's innate immunity and identifies potential targets and strategies for antiviral interventions.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects warm-blooded vertebrates across the world. In humans, seropositivity rates of T. gondii range from 10% to 90% across communities. Despite its prevalence, few studies address how T. gondii infection changes the metabolism of host cells. In this study, we investigate how T. gondii manipulates the host cell metabolic environment by monitoring the metabolic response over time using noninvasive autofluorescence lifetime imaging of single cells, metabolite analysis, extracellular flux analysis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Autofluorescence lifetime imaging indicates that infected host cells become more oxidized and have an increased proportion of bound NAD(P)H compared to uninfected controls. Over time, infected cells also show decreases in levels of intracellular glucose and lactate, increases in oxygen consumption, and variability in ROS production. We further examined changes associated with the pre-invasion “kiss and spit” process using autofluorescence lifetime imaging, which also showed a more oxidized host cell with an increased proportion of bound NAD(P)H over 48 hours compared to uninfected controls, suggesting that metabolic changes in host cells are induced by T. gondii kiss and spit even without invasion. IMPORTANCE This study sheds light on previously unexplored changes in host cell metabolism induced by T. gondii infection using noninvasive, label-free autofluorescence imaging. In this study, we use optical metabolic imaging (OMI) to measure the optical redox ratio (ORR) in conjunction with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to noninvasively monitor single host cell response to T. gondii infection over 48 hours. Collectively, our results affirm the value of using autofluorescence lifetime imaging to noninvasively monitor metabolic changes in host cells over the time course of a microbial infection. Understanding this metabolic relationship between the host cell and the parasite could uncover new treatment and prevention options for T. gondii infections worldwide.

        <tr id="Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains an important global public health problem. About 40 million people are infected with HIV, and this infection caused about 630,000 deaths in 2022. The hallmark of HIV infection is the depletion of CD4+ T helper lymphocytes (Th cells). There are at least seven different Th subtypes, and not all are the main targets of HIV. Moreover, the effect of the virus in a specific subtype can be completely different from that of the others. Although the most compromised Th subtype in HIV infection is Th17, HIV can induce important dysregulations in other subtypes, such as follicular Th (Tfh) cells and regulatory Th cells (Treg cells or Tregs). Several studies have shown that HIV can induce an increase in the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs without causing a significant reduction in their numbers, at least in the early phase of infection. The increased activity of this Th subtype seems to play an important role in determining the immunodeficiency status of HIV-infected patients, and Tregs may represent a new target for innovative anti-HIV therapies, including the so-called “Kick and Kill” therapeutic method whose goal is the complete elimination of the virus and the healing of HIV infection. In this review, we report the most important findings on the effects of HIV on different CD4+ T cell subtypes, the molecular mechanisms by which the virus impairs the functions of these cells, and the implications for new anti-HIV therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Discovered over 4 decades ago in the supernatants of activated T cells, interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a potent pleiotropic cytokine involved in the regulation of immune responses. It is required for effector T cell expansion and differentiation as well as for peripheral tolerance induced by regulatory T cells. High-dose IL-2 treatment was the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, achieving single agent complete and durable responses, albeit only in a small proportion of patients. The therapeutic potential of wild type IL-2 is clinically limited by its short half-life and severe vascular toxicity. Moreover, the activation of regulatory T cells and the terminal differentiation of effector T cells on IL-2 pose additional restrictions. To overcome the toxicity of IL-2 in order to realize its full potential for patients, several novel engineering strategies are being developed and IL-2 based immunotherapy for cancer has emerged as a burgeoning field of clinical and experimental research. In addition, combination of IL-2 with PD-1/L1 pathway blockade shows vastly improved anti-tumor efficacy over either monotherapy in preclinical tumor models. In this review we discuss the biological characteristics of IL-2 and its receptors, as well as its efficacy and treatment limiting toxicities in cancer patients. We also explore the efforts aimed at developing novel and safer IL-2 therapies to harness the full therapeutic potential of this cytokine.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide; annually, approximately 830,000 deaths related to liver cancer are diagnosed globally. Since early-stage HCC is clinically asymptomatic, traditional treatment modalities, including surgical ablation, are usually not applicable or result in recurrence. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), provides new hope for cancer therapy; however, immune evasion mechanisms counteract its efficiency. In addition to viral exposure and alcohol addiction, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become a major cause of HCC. Owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance, NASH-associated HCC patients respond much less efficiently to ICB treatment than do patients with other etiologies. In addition, abnormal inflammation contributes to NASH progression and NASH–HCC transition, as well as to HCC immune evasion. Therefore, uncovering the detailed mechanism governing how NASH-associated immune cells contribute to NASH progression would benefit HCC prevention and improve HCC immunotherapy efficiency. In the following review, we focused our attention on summarizing the current knowledge of the role of CD4+T cells in NASH and HCC progression, and discuss potential therapeutic strategies involving the targeting of CD4+T cells for the treatment of NASH and HCC.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor microenvironment (TME) represents the key factor inducing leukemia development. As stromal cells within the leukemia microenvironment, Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BM-MSCs) can trigger leukemia progression under certain conditions. As a critical transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid related factor 2 (Nrf2) can modulate antioxidant response and antioxidant enzyme gene expression, and prevent various oxidative changes. We previously identified a novel mechanism by which Nrf2 promotes leukemia resistance, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of drug-resistant/refractory leukemias. However, the role of Nrf2 in BM-MSCs from B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients has not been clearly reported. The present work focused on investigating the effect of Nrf2 overexpression within MSCs on leukemia cell invasion, extramedullary infiltration and proliferation as well as its downstream pathway. Methods Through clinical sample detection, in vitro cell experiments and in vivo animal experiments, the role of Nrf2 within MSCs within adult B-ALL cell migration and invasion and its potential molecular mechanism was explored through transcriptome sequencing analysis, RT-PCR, Western blot, cell migration, cell invasion, lentivirus transfection and other experiments. Results Nrf2 was highly expressed in BM-MSCs from patients with B-ALL as well as in BM-MSCs co-cultured with leukemia cells. Overexpression of Nrf2 within MSCs significantly promoted leukemia cell migration, invasion and proliferation. The extramedullary organ infiltration rate in B-ALL model mice receiving the combined infusion of both cell types dramatically increased relative to that of leukemia cells alone, accompanied by the significantly shortened survival time. Mechanism study found that Nrf2 overexpression within MSCs promoted PI3K-AKT/ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the downstream pathway by activating SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, ultimately leading to extramedullary infiltration of leukemia cells. Conclusion High Nrf2 expression with in MSCs enhances leukemia cell invasion and migration, which then accelerates infiltration in leukemic extramedullary organs. Targeting Nrf2 or inhibiting its downstream signal molecules may be the effective interventions for B-ALL patients treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract The monocyte–macrophage system plays an important role in phagocytosis of pathogens and cellular debris following infection or tissue injury in several pathophysiological conditions. We examined ENaC/ASIC subunit transcript expression and the importance of select subunits in migration of bone marrow derived monocytes (freshly isolated) and macrophages (monocytes differentiated in culture). We also examined the effect of select subunit deletion on macrophage phenotype. BM monocytes were harvested from the femurs of male and female WT and KO mice (6–12 weeks of age). Our results show that α, β, γENaC, and ASIC1‐5 transcripts are expressed in BM macrophages and monocytes to varying degrees. At least αENaC, βENaC, and ASIC2 subunits contribute to chemotactic migration responses in BM monocyte–macrophages. Polarization markers (CD86, soluble TNFα) in BM macrophages from mice lacking ASIC2a plus βENaC were shifted towards the M1 phenotype. Furthermore, select M1 phenotypic markers were recovered with rescue of βENaC or ASIC2. Taken together, these data suggest that βENaC and ASIC2 play an important role in BM macrophage migration and loss of βENaC and/or ASIC2 partially polarizes macrophages to the M1 phenotype. Thus, targeting ENaC/ASIC expression in BM macrophages may regulate their ability to migrate to sites of injury.">

        <tr id="The skin, as the first physical barrier for invading pathogens, also serves as an immunologically active organ. Breaching the skin barrier is thus essential for pathogens to enter the body. The skin contains various immune responsive cells that initiate both the innate and adaptive immune response upon invasion. Activated immune cells help to regulate cytokine response and their differentiation to promote or suppress the crucial immune response against invading pathogens. Human herpes simplex viruses (HHSVs) are the oldest pathogen that can escape immune surveillance of the human host by a well-developed escape mechanism within ganglia, as their evolutionary strategy. In primary infection, a non-specific defense of the host initiates the response against the invading virion. The initial direct antiviral action of the host is regulated by activated macrophages, via the release of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and type-1 interferon (IFN-1). The host-derived cytokines including IFN-12, TNF, and IFN-1 in turn induce natural killer (NK) cells to release IFN-γ. Their positive feedback with synergistic interactions collectively releases nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) against the invading virus. Simultaneously, the combination of cytokines, macrophages, and other cells activates the immune system to eliminate the pathogen. However, the virus has also evolved various mechanisms to counter the host defense strategies. This review will highlight virus-mediated skin infections, especially by HSV, and portray a detailed role of virus-induced cytokines in host-immunity to challenge the invading virion during mucocutaneous HSV infection. Further, this review will discuss the viral-interference on host defense to provide a simplistic overview of the complications of cutaneous HSV infection.">

This was revealed both by detailed analysis of their phenotypical features and gene expression profile and by functional explorations comparing capacity of purified B cells and PCs to suppress T cell proliferation and IFN{gamma} secretion ex vivo.

        <tr id="Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer. CRC has no apparent symptoms in the early stages of disease, and most patients receive a confirmed diagnosis in the middle or late disease stages. The incidence of CRC continues to increase, and the affected population tends to be younger. Therefore, determining how to achieve an early CRC diagnosis and treatment has become a top priority for prolonging patient survival. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a group of bone marrow-derived immuno-negative regulatory cells that are divided into two subpopulations, polymorphonuclear-MDSCs and monocytic-MDSCs, based on their phenotypic similarities to neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. These cells can inhibit the immune response and promote cancer cell metastasis in the tumour microenvironment (TME). A large aggregation of MDSCs in the TME is often a marker of cancer and a poor prognosis in inflammatory diseases of the intestine (such as colonic adenoma and ulcerative colitis). In the present review, the phenotypic classification of MDSCs in the CRC microenvironment are first discussed. Then, the amplification, role and metastatic mechanism of MDSCs in the CRC TME are described, focusing on genes, gene modifications, proteins and the intestinal micro-environment. Finally, the progress in CRC-targeted therapies that aim to modulate the quantity, function and structure of MDSCs are summarized in the hope of identifying potential screening markers for CRC and improving CRC prognosis and therapeutic options.">

Here we show that immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated significantly lower TLR9 levels in breast cancer tumors compared to normal breast tissue epithelium. Similarly, TLR9 downregulation was also observed in several transformed breast cancer cell lines versus untransformed breast epithelial cell lines. Furthermore, overexpression of TLR9 led to reduced proliferation potential of breast cancer cell associated with activation of senescence as was evident by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, chemokines IL-8 and CXCL1; and growth factor GM-CSF. These findings support TLR9’s regulatory role in mitigating breast cancer and highlight its critical connection between the inflammatory response and tumor immunity.">

Gene-knockout models established that NFκB cRel is required for stimulus-driven B cell proliferation, but whether variability in its expression is responsible for proliferative heterogeneity remains unknown. In this study, we developed a fluorescent reporter mTFP1-cRel mouse to directly observe natural cRel variation in B cells and relate it to proliferation kinetics. We found that cRel abundance in naïve B-cells is highly heterogeneous due to combined positive and negative feedback. While high-cRel-expressing cells enter the proliferative program faster, they have diminished proliferative capacity.

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer (OC) poses a significant global health challenge with high mortality rates, emphasizing the need for improved treatment strategies. The immune system’s role in OC progression and treatment response is increasingly recognized, particularly regarding peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cytokine production. This study aimed to investigate PBMC subpopulations (T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, monocytes) and cytokine production, specifically interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), in monocytes of OC patients both preoperatively and during the early postoperative period. Thirteen OC patients and 23 controls were enrolled. Preoperatively, OC patients exhibited changes in PBMC subpopulations, including decreased cytotoxic T cells, increased M2 monocytes, and the disbalance of monocyte cytokine production. These alterations persisted after surgery with subtle additional changes observed in PBMC subpopulations and cytokine expression in monocytes. Considering the pivotal role of these altered cells and cytokines in OC progression, our findings suggest that OC patients experience an enhanced pro-tumorigenic environment, which persists into the early postoperative period. These findings highlight the impact of surgery on the complex interaction between the immune system and OC progression. Further investigation is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms during this early postoperative period, which may hold potential for interventions aimed at improving OC management.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive and malignant form of brain cancer, continues to pose a significant challenge in the field of oncology. Despite ongoing advancements in treatment strategies, the prognosis for GBM patients remains grim, with a 5-year survival rate hovering around 5%. The management of GBM involves multiple therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapy, but optimal treatment outcomes in terms of overcoming tumor recurrence and resistance have not been achieved. A key factor contributing to therapy resistance and the progression of GBM is the tumor's ability to evade the immune system, referred to as immune escape from cancer. This phenomenon reflects the tumor cells' efforts to adapt and survive the body's immune response. The release and expression of molecules like TGF-ß, IL-10, PD-L1, and NKG2DL by GBM cells impact the activation, recognition, and elimination of tumor cells by the immune system. Additionally, the involvement of cells such as MDSCs, Tregs, and TAMs plays a role in inhibiting the immune system's function, thereby promoting the development of GBM cells. A better comprehension of GBM's immune escape, supported by technological advances, will significantly aid in the future management of GBM patients' treatment.Keywords: glioblastoma multiforme, GBM, cancer immunity, immune evasion, immune escape, immunotherapy">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is a major global health concern, particularly affecting those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly. CD4+ T cell response is crucial for immunity against M.tb, but chronic infections and aging can lead to T cell exhaustion and senescence, worsening TB disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction, prevalent in aging and chronic diseases, disrupts cellular metabolism, increases oxidative stress, and impairs T-cell functions. This study investigates the effect of mitochondrial transplantation (mito-transfer) on CD4+ T cell differentiation and function in aged mouse models and human CD4+ T cells from elderly individuals. Mito-transfer in naïve CD4+ T cells is found to promote protective effector and memory T cell generation during M.tb infection in mice. Additionally, it improves elderly human T cell function by increasing mitochondrial mass and altering cytokine production, thereby reducing markers of exhaustion and senescence. These findings suggest mito-transfer as a novel approach to enhance aged CD4+ T cell functionality, potentially benefiting immune responses in the elderly and chronic TB patients. This has broader implications for diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to T-cell exhaustion and senescence.">

        <tr id="Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the severity of COVID-19, since the respiratory, thrombotic and myocardial complications of the disease are closely linked to vascular endothelial damage. To address this issue, we evaluate here the effect of conditioned media from spike S1-activated macrophages (CM_S1) on the proliferation of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), focusing on the specific role of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Results obtained demonstrate that the incubation with CM_S1 for 72 h hinders endothelial cell proliferation and induces signs of cytotoxicity. Comparable results are obtained upon exposure to IFN-γ + TNF-α, which are thus postulated to play a pivotal role in the effects observed. These events are associated with an increase in p21 protein and a decrease in Rb phosphorylation, as well as with the activation of IRF-1 and NF-kB transcription factors. Overall, these findings further sustain the pivotal role of a hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines as a trigger for endothelial activation and injury in the immune-mediated effects of COVID-19.">

In non-responders, tumors show evidence of increased tumor proliferation, neuronal stem cell markers, and IL-1. Responders have increased type I/II interferons and pre-existing tissue resident (Trm) CD8 or Vd1 gd T cells that functionally converge with overlapping antigen-specific transcriptional programs and clonal expansion of public TCRs. Spatial transcriptomics demonstrated co-localization of T cells with B and dendritic cells, which supply chemokines and co-stimulation. Lastly, ICB significantly increased clonal expansion or recruitment of Trm and Vd1 cells in tumors specifically in responders, underscoring their therapeutic importance.

        <tr id="High expression of cellular self‐activated immunosuppressive molecules and extensive infiltration of suppressive immune cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main factors contributing to glioma's resistance to immunotherapy. Nonetheless, technology to modify the expression of glioma cellular self‐molecules through gene editing requires further development. This project advances cell therapy strategies to reverse the immunosuppressive microenvironment of glioma (TIME). Bone marrow‐derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are engineered to express bioactive proteins and demonstrate tumor‐homing characteristics upon activation by TGF‐β. These MSCs are designed to secrete the anti‐tumor immune cytokine IL‐12 and the nCD47‐SLAMF7 fusion protein, which regulates T‐cell activity and macrophage phagocytosis. The engineered MSCs are then injected in situ into the glioma site, circumventing the blood‐brain barrier to deliver high local concentrations of bioactive proteins. This approach aims to enhance the M1 polarization of infiltrating macrophages, stimulate macrophage‐mediated tumor cell phagocytosis, activate antigen‐presenting cells, and promote effector CD8+ T cell infiltration, effectively controlling glioma. Additionally, the engineered MSCs may serve as a universal treatment for other tumors that express TGF‐β at high levels. This study proposes a novel treatment strategy for the clinical management of glioma patients.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) possess unique immunosuppressive activity among CD4-positive T cells. Tregs are ubiquitously present in mammals and function to calm excessive immune responses, thereby suppressing allergies or autoimmune diseases. On the other hand, due to their immunosuppressive function, Tregs are thought to promote cancer progression. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a multicellular system composed of many cell types, including tumor cells, infiltrating immune cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Within this environment, Tregs are recruited by chemokines and metabolic factors and impede effective anti-tumor responses. However, in some cases, their presence can also improve patient’s survival rates. Their functional consequences may vary across tumor types, locations, and stages. An in-depth understanding of the precise roles and mechanisms of actions of Treg is crucial for developing effective treatments, emphasizing the need for further investigation and validation. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the complex and multifaceted roles of Tregs within the TME, elucidating cellular communications, signaling pathways, and their impacts on tumor progression and highlighting their potential anti-tumor mechanisms through interactions with functional molecules.">

 Seasonal flu, primarily caused by influenza H1N1 and H3N2 subtype viruses or influenza B viruses, is the most prevalent respiratory tract infection globally and leads to substantial morbidity and mortality annually. Despite the influenza virus being initially recognized as a respiratory pathogen with well-characterized transmission through respiratory droplets, its impact on ocular epithelium and associated gene expression remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional profiles of immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-S) and A549 human lung epithelial cells infected with H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus. In comparison with A549 cells, a reduced number of differentially expressed genes was observed in HCE-S upon influenza virus infection. Specifically, there was a significant upregulation of the genes IFI44L and OAS1, along with lower release of CCL5/RANTES protein. Notably, our findings revealed uniquely upregulated LGALS9 (encoding galectin-9) in HCE-S following infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Furthermore, targeted knockdown of LGALS9 in these cells resulted in a measurable decrease in viral infection, highlighting its role in the cellular responses to influenza virus and suggesting a novel avenue for antiviral therapy. Overall, our findings provide insight into the distinct mechanisms of influenza virus interactions with different epithelial cells and underscore the importance of studying the ocular surface in understanding influenza pathogenesis.">

The results demonstrated the effect of immunogenetic variations in immune system-related genes associated with innate and adaptive immune responses, cytokine, and chemokine secretions, and signaling pathways. These genetic diversities may affect the crosstalk between tumor and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, influencing cancer progression, invasion, and prognosis. Given the considerable variability in the individual immunegenomics profiles, future studies should prioritize large-scale analyses to identify potential genetic variations associated with lung cancer using highthroughput technologies across different populations. This approach will provide further information for predicting response to targeted therapy and promotes the development of new measures for individualized cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="One of the challenges in studying islet inflammation–insulitis–is that it is a transient phenomenon. Traditional reporting of the insulitis progression is based on cumulative, donor-averaged values of leucocyte density in the vicinity of pancreatic islets, that hinder intra- and inter-islet heterogeneity of disease progression. Here, we aimed to understand why insulitis is non-uniform, often with peri-insulitis lesions formed on one side of an islet. To achieve this, we demonstrated the applicability of network theory in detangling intra-islet multi-cellular interactions during insulitis. Specifically, we asked the question “What is unique about regions of the islet that interact with immune cells first”. This study utilized the non-obese diabetic mouse model of type one diabetes and examined the interplay among α-, β-, T-cells, myeloid cells, and macrophages in pancreatic islets during the progression of insulitis. Disease evolution was tracked based on the T/β cell ratio in individual islets. In the early stage, we found that immune cells are preferentially interacting with α-cell-rich regions of an islet. At the islet periphery α-linked β-cells were found to be targeted significantly more compared to those without α-cell neighbors. Additionally, network analysis revealed increased T-myeloid, and T-macrophage interactions with all β-cells.">

Asthma and allergic diseases can result from maladaptive immune responses, resulting in exaggerated and persistent type 2 immunity and tissue inflammation. Summary: Among the diverse populations of tissue immune cells, CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are central to controlling immune responses and inflammation and restoring tissue homeostasis. Humans and mice that are deficient in Treg cells experience extensive inflammation in their mucosal organs and skin. During past decades, major progress has been made toward understanding the immunobiology of Treg cells and the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control their differentiation and function. It is now clear that Treg cells are not a single cell type and that they demonstrate diversity and plasticity depending on their differentiation stages and tissue environment. They could also take on a proinflammatory phenotype in certain conditions. Key Messages: Treg cells perform distinct functions, including the induction of immune tolerance, suppression of inflammation, and promotion of tissue repair. Subsets of Treg cells in mucosal tissues are regulated by their differentiation stage and tissue inflammatory milieu. Treg cell dysfunction likely plays roles in persistent immune responses and tissue inflammation in asthma and allergic diseases.">

        <tr id="The study of immunometabolism, which examines how immune cells regulate their metabolism to maintain optimal performance, has become an important area of focus in cancer immunology. Recent advancements in this field have highlighted the intricate connection between metabolism and immune cell function, emphasizing the need for further research. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have gained attention for their ability to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression and impact various biological processes, including immune function and cancer progression. While the role of miRNAs in immunometabolism is still being explored, recent studies have demonstrated their significant influence on the metabolic activity of immune cells, such as macrophages, T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells, particularly in cancer contexts. Disrupted immune cell metabolism is a hallmark of cancer progression, and miRNAs have been linked to this process. Understanding the precise impact of miRNAs on immune cell metabolism in cancer is essential for the development of immunotherapeutic approaches. Targeting miRNAs may hold potential for creating groundbreaking cancer immunotherapies to reshape the tumor environment and improve treatment outcomes. In summary, the recognition of miRNAs as key regulators of immune cell metabolism across various cancers offers promising potential for refining cancer immunotherapies. Further investigation into how miRNAs affect immune cell metabolism could identify novel therapeutic targets and lead to the development of innovative cancer immunotherapies.">

By generating large numbers of effector/memory and terminal differentiated effector memory CD8+ T cells with diminished naïve subsets, memory inflation is believed to play critical roles in connecting the viral infection and the onset of multiple diseases. Here, we reviewed the current understanding of memory inflated CD8+ T cells in their distinct phenotypic features that different from exhausted subsets; the intrinsic and extrinsic roles in regulating the formation of memory inflation; and the key proteins in maintaining the expansion and proliferation of inflationary populations. More importantly, based on the evidences from both clinic and animal models, we summarized the potential mechanisms of memory inflation to trigger autoimmune neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and multiple sclerosis; the correlations of memory inflation between tumorigenesis and resistance of tumour immunotherapies; as well as the effects of memory inflation to facilitate vascular disease progression. To sum up, better understanding of memory inflation could provide us an opportunity to beyond the acute phase of viral infection, and shed a light on the long-term influences of CD8+ T cell heterogeneity in dampen host immune homeostasis.">

        <tr id="Myeloproliferative neoplasms represent a group of clonal hematopoietic disorders of which myelofibrosis (MF) is the most aggressive. In the context of myeloid neoplasms, there is a growing recognition of the dysregulation of immune response and T-cell function as significant contributors to disease progression and immune evasion. We investigated cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion in MF to restore immune response against malignant cells. Increased expression of inhibitory receptors like CTLA-4 was observed on cytotoxic T cells from MF patients together with a reduced secretion of IFNɣ and TNFɑ. CTLA-4 ligands CD80 and CD86 were increased on MF granulocytes and monocytes highlighting a possible role for myeloid cells in suppressing T-cell activation in MF patients. Unlike healthy donors, the activation of cytotoxic T cells from MF patients was attenuated in the presence of myeloid cells and restored when T cells were cultured alone or treated with anti-CTLA-4. Moreover, anti-CTLA-4 treatment promoted elimination of neoplastic monocytes and granulocytes in a co-culture system with cytotoxic T cells. To test CTLA-4 inhibition in vivo, patient-derived xenografts were generated by transplanting MF CD34+ cells and by infusing homologous T cells in NSGS mice. CTLA-4 blockade reduced human myeloid chimerism and led to T-cell expansion in spleen and bone marrow. Overall, these findings shed light on T-cell dysfunction in MF and suggest that CTLA-4 blockade can boost the cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells.">

        <tr id="Like TNFα, IL-6 is upregulated in Crohn’s disease (CD) especially in patients associated with Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) infection, and both cytokines have been targeted as a therapeutic option for the treatment of the disease despite the accepted partial response in some patients. Limited response to anti-IL-6 receptor-neutralizing antibodies therapy may be related to the homeostatic dual role of IL-6. In this study, we investigated the effects and the signaling mechanism of IL-6 involved in intestinal epithelial integrity and function during MAP infection using an in vitro model that consists of THP-1, HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines. Clinically, we determined that plasma samples from MAP-infected CD patients have higher IL-6 levels compared to controls (P-value < 0.001). In CD-like macrophages, MAP infection has significantly upregulated the secretion of IL-6 and the shedding of (IL-6R) from THP-1 macrophages, P-value < 0.05. Intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and HT-29) were treated with the supernatant of MAP-infected THP-1 macrophages with or without a neutralizing anti-IL-6R antibody. Treating intestinal Caco-2 cells with supernatant of MAP-infected macrophages resulted in significant upregulation of intestinal damage markers including claudin-2 and SERPINE1/PAI-1. Interestingly, blocking IL-6 signaling exacerbated that damage and further increased the levels of the damage markers. In HT-29 cells, MAP infection upregulated MUC2 expression, a protective response that was reversed when IL-6R was neutralized. More importantly, blocking IL-6 signaling during MAP infection rescued damaged Caco-2 cells from MAP-induced apoptosis. The data clearly supports a protective role of IL-6 in intestinal epithelia integrity and function especially in CD patients associated with MAP infection. The findings may explain the ineffective response to anti-IL6 based therapy and strongly support a therapeutic option that restores the physiologic level of IL-6 in patient’s plasma. A new treatment strategy based on attenuation of IL-6 expression and secretion in inflammatory diseases should be considered.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
There is an established yet unexplained link between interferon (IFN) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The expression of sequences derived from transposable elements (TEs) may contribute to SLE phenotypes, specifically production of type I IFNs and generation of autoantibodies.


METHODS
We profiled cell-sorted RNA-sequencing data (CD4+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, and natural killer cells) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 120 patients with SLE and quantified TE expression identifying 27,135 TEs. We tested for differential TE expression across 10 SLE phenotypes, including autoantibody production and disease activity.


RESULTS
We found 731 differentially expressed (DE) TEs across all SLE phenotypes that were mostly cell specific and phenotype specific. DE TEs were enriched for specific families and open reading frames of viral genes encoded in TE sequences. Increased expression of DE TEs was associated with genes involved in antiviral activity, such as LY6E, ISG15, and TRIM22, and pathways such as IFN signaling.


CONCLUSION
These findings suggest that expression of TEs contributes to activation of SLE-related mechanisms in a cell-specific manner, which can impact disease diagnostics and therapeutics.">

The virus enters host cells by binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is then facilitated by the protease activity of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). It triggers a cytokine storm that eventually leads to cell apoptosis, tissue damage, and organ failure. Therefore, any organs in the human body that have both receptors are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection, potentially resulting in multiple-organ failure. The prostate has been reported to express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While there are limited studies regarding the association between COVID-19 and prostatitis, the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could cause prostatitis cannot be denied.

        <tr id="Metabolic reprogramming is a k`ey hallmark of tumors, developed in response to hypoxia and nutrient deficiency during tumor progression. In both cancer and immune cells, there is a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, which then leads to lactate acidification, increased lipid synthesis, and glutaminolysis. This reprogramming facilitates tumor immune evasion and, within the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer and immune cells collaborate to create a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The growing interest in the metabolic reprogramming of the TME, particularly its significance in colorectal cancer (CRC)—one of the most prevalent cancers—has prompted us to explore this topic. CRC exhibits abnormal glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and increased lipid synthesis. Acidosis in CRC cells hampers the activity of anti-tumor immune cells and inhibits the phagocytosis of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), while nutrient deficiency promotes the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages. In CRC cells, activation of G-protein coupled receptor 81 (GPR81) signaling leads to overexpression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and reduces the antigen presentation capability of dendritic cells. Moreover, the genetic and epigenetic cell phenotype, along with the microbiota, significantly influence CRC metabolic reprogramming. Activating RAS mutations and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) occur in approximately 50% and 80% of patients, respectively, stimulating glycolysis and increasing levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and MYC proteins. Certain bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which activate CD8+ cells and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, while other mechanisms support pro-tumor activities. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in selected CRC patients has shown promise, and the combination of these with drugs that inhibit aerobic glycolysis is currently being intensively researched to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
The metabolic characteristics of liver cancer drive considerable hurdles to immune cells function and cancer immunotherapy. However, how metabolic reprograming in the tumour microenvironment impairs the antitumour immune response remains unclear.


DESIGN
Human samples and multiple murine models were employed to evaluate the correlation between GPR109A and liver cancer progression. GPR109A knockout mice, immune cells depletion and primary cell coculture models were used to determine the regulation of GPR109A on tumour microenvironment and identify the underlying mechanism responsible for the formation of intratumour GPR109A+myeloid cells.


RESULTS
We demonstrate that glutamine shortage in liver cancer tumour microenvironment drives an immunosuppressive GPR109A+myeloid cells infiltration, leading to the evasion of immune surveillance. Blockade of GPR109A decreases G-MDSCs and M2-like TAMs abundance to trigger the antitumour responses of CD8+ T cells and further improves the immunotherapy efficacy against liver cancer. Mechanistically, tumour cells and tumour-infiltrated myeloid cells compete for glutamine uptake via the transporter SLC1A5 to control antitumour immunity, which disrupts the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homoeostasis and induces unfolded protein response of myeloid cells to promote GPR109A expression through IRE1α/XBP1 pathway. The restriction of glutamine uptake in liver cancer cells, as well as the blockade of IRE1α/XBP1 signalling or glutamine supplementation, can eliminate the immunosuppressive effects of GPR109A+ myeloid cells and slow down tumour progression.


CONCLUSION
Our findings identify the immunometabolic crosstalk between liver cancer cells and myeloid cells facilitates tumour progression via a glutamine metabolism/ER stress/GPR109A axis, suggesting that GPR109A can be exploited as an immunometabolic checkpoint and putative target for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Alloreactive memory T cells have been implicated as central drivers of transplant rejection. Perplexingly, innate cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-12, are also associated with rejection of organ transplants. However, the pathways of innate immune activation in allogeneic transplantation are unclear. While the role of microbial and cell death products has been previously described, we identified alloreactive memory CD4 T cells as the primary triggers of innate inflammation. Memory CD4 T cells engaged MHC II-mismatched dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the production of innate inflammatory cytokines. This innate inflammation was independent of several pattern recognition receptors and was primarily driven by TNF superfamily ligands expressed by alloreactive memory CD4 T cells. Blocking of CD40L and TNFα resulted in dampened inflammation, and mice genetically deficient in these molecules exhibited prolonged survival of cardiac allografts. Furthermore, myeloid cell and CD8 T cell infiltration into cardiac transplants was compromised in both CD40L- and TNFα-deficient recipients. Strikingly, we found that priming of naive alloreactive CD8 T cells was dependent on licensing of DCs by memory CD4 T cells. This study unravels the key mechanisms by which alloreactive memory CD4 T cells contribute to destructive pathology and transplant rejection.">

In this issue of the JCI, Cubitt et al. investigated the role of CD8α, a coreceptor present on approximately 40% of human NK cells. IL-15 stimulation of CD8α– NK cells induced CD8α expression via the RUNX3 transcription factor, driving formation of a unique induced CD8α (iCD8α+) population. iCD8α+ NK cells displayed higher proliferation, metabolic activity, and antitumor cytotoxic function compared with preexisting CD8α+ and CD8α– subsets. Therefore, CD8α expression can be used to define a potential dynamic spectrum of NK cell expansion and function. Because these cells exhibit enhanced tumor control, they may be used to improve in NK cell therapies for patients with AML.">

While apoptosis has been extensively studied in CD4+ T cell depletion, recent research has highlighted the significant role of necroptosis, a regulated form of necrosis, in this process. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) has emerged as a central player in necroptosis, regulating both cell death and inflammatory responses. This review delves into the intricate mechanisms by which RIPK1 orchestrates necroptosis in CD4+ T cells during HIV infection. We explore the structural intricacies of RIPK1, its interactions with other signaling molecules, and the downstream events that culminate in necroptotic cell death. Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting RIPK1 to mitigate CD4+ T cell loss and control HIV disease progression. Understanding the multifaceted role of RIPK1 in HIV-induced necroptosis may pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions to combat this devastating disease.">

These include the extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune microenvironment, both of which are integral components of the tumor microenvironment. The present review describes the roles of pancreatic stellate cells, differentiated cancer-associated fibroblasts and the interleukin family, either independently or in combination, in the progression of precursor lesions in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and PDAC. These elements contribute to ECM deposition and immunosuppression in PDAC. Therapeutic strategies that integrate interleukin and/or stromal blockade for PDAC immunomodulation and fibrogenesis have yielded inconsistent results.

Spleen pathology begins at the marginal zone (MZ), apparent by 2 d postinfection (dpi), and progresses throughout the red pulp by 4 dpi. To better understand how M.R2k/b mice respond to infection and how Cmv5s contributes to tissue damage in the spleen, we assessed the regulation of myeloid cells and inflammation during acute MCMV infection in MA/My and M.R2k/b mice. We found that Cmv5s drove increased neutrophil accumulation and cell death at the MZ, which corresponded with evidence of localized oxidative stress and increased overall spleen IL-6 and TGF-β1 early during infection. Further assessment of MCMV infection dynamics at the early MZ revealed infected SIGNR1+ MZ macrophages as the first apparent cell type lost during infection in these mice and the likely target of early neutrophil recruitment. Spleen macrophages were also identified as the mediators of differential spleen IL-6 and TGF-β1 between MA/My and M.R2k/b mice. Interrogation of MCMV progression past 2 dpi revealed substantial M.R2k/b F480+ red pulp macrophage loss along with buildup of oxidative stress and MZ macrophage debris that was not neutrophil dependent. Together we identify Cmv5s-driven macrophage loss and inflammation during acute MCMV infection corresponding with the spatial and temporal development of spleen tissue damage.">

Fully elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the immune response against viral infections is crucial for epidemic prevention and control. The innate immune response, the host's primary defense against viral infection, plays a pivotal role and has become a breakthrough in research mechanisms. A component of the innate immune system, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are involved in inducing inflammatory responses to viral infections. Numerous DAMPs are released from virally infected cells, activating downstream signaling pathways via internal and external receptors on immune cells. This activation triggers immune responses and helps regulate viral host invasion. This review examines the immune regulatory mechanisms of various DAMPs, such as the S100 protein family, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and heat shock proteins, in various viral infections to provide a theoretical basis for designing novel antiviral drugs.">

Secondary and co-infections can exacerbate the immune response, leading to amplified cytokine release and potentially severe disease outcomes. This review aims to evaluate the expression of TLR-4 in fungal and bacterial infections that are associated with and secondary to SARS-CoV2. The study collected specimens from 70 patients admitted to a Baghdad hospital’s ICUs and 35 healthy controls, aged 15-80 years, from June 2022 to April 2023. Re¬al-time RT-PCR was used for infection detection, while conventional methods were used to isolate patho¬genic microorganisms and the Vitec 2 system. The findings of this study suggest that TLR-4 may play a crucial role in secondary and co-infections in individuals with severe SARS-CoV2. The study implies that increased TLR-4 expression might contribute to the development of bacterial secondary and co-infections. When TLR-4 detects bacterial components, it triggers immune responses aimed at eliminating the bacte¬ria. However, an overactive TLR-4 response may lead to an excessive release of cytokines, resulting in a cytokine storm. This excessive immune response can cause tissue damage and exacerbate the severity of SARS-CoV2. Furthermore, the TLR-4 expression may not significantly contribute to the immune response against co-fungal infections with SARS-CoV-2, despite its role in antiviral responses and bacterial defense.">

        <tr id="Infection by bacteria leads to tissue damage and inflammation, which need to be tightly controlled by host mechanisms to avoid deleterious consequences. It is previously reported that TMEM16F, a calcium-activated lipid scramblase expressed in various immune cell types including T cells and neutrophils, is critical for the control of infection by bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) in vivo. This function correlated with the capacity of TMEM16F to repair the plasma membrane (PM) damage induced in T cells in vitro, by the Lm toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). However, whether the protective effect of TMEM16F on Lm infection in vivo is mediated by an impact in T cells, or in other cell types, is not determined. Herein, the immune cell types and mechanisms implicated in the protective effect of TMEM16F against Lm in vivo are elucidated. Cellular protective effects of TMEM16F correlated with its capacity of lipid scrambling and augment PM fluidity. Using cell type-specific TMEM16F-deficient mice, the indication is obtained that TMEM16F expressed in liver Kupffer cells (KCs), but not in T cells or B cells, is key for protection against Listeria in vivo. In the absence of TMEM16F, Listeria induced PM rupture and fragmentation of KCs in vivo. KC death associated with greater liver damage, inflammatory changes, and dysregulated liver metabolism. Overall, the results uncovered that TMEM16F expressed in Kupffer cells is crucial to protect the host against Listeria infection. This influence is associated with the capacity of Kupffer cell-expressed TMEM16F to prevent excessive inflammation and abnormal liver metabolism.">

        <tr id="Gut mucosal immunity in infants exposed to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) presents a complex interplay of developmental processes, viral dynamics, and therapeutic interventions that significantly impact clinical outcomes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms, clinical implications, and therapeutic strategies concerning gut mucosal immunity in HIV-exposed infants. The gut mucosa serves as a critical site for immune maturation and defense against pathogens, but HIV infection disrupts this delicate balance, leading to compromised immune function and increased susceptibility to infections.  Infants born to HIV-positive mothers experience unique challenges in gut mucosal immunity due to vertical transmission of the virus and exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV infection disrupts gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), resulting in early depletion of CD4+ T cells and compromised mucosal barrier function. These alterations contribute to microbial translocation, chronic inflammation, and immune dysregulation, impacting overall immune competence and increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Despite advances in ART, persistent immune activation and residual gut mucosal damage pose ongoing challenges in achieving optimal immune reconstitution and preventing long-term complications in HIV-exposed infants. Clinical implications of compromised gut mucosal immunity in HIV-exposed infants extend beyond gastrointestinal health to encompass systemic immune dysfunction and increased risks of non-AIDS comorbidities. Impaired gut barrier function exacerbates microbial translocation, leading to systemic inflammation that may contribute to neurodevelopmental abnormalities and metabolic disorders.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) arise at chronic inflammatory sites where they function as miniature lymph nodes to generate immune responses, which can be beneficial or detrimental, in diseases as diverse as autoimmunity, chronic infections and cancer. A growing number of studies show that a TLS presence in tumors from cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors is closely linked with improved clinical outcomes. TLS may foster the generation of specific anti-tumor immune responses and immunological memory that recognizes a patient's own tumor. Due to repeated rounds of chronic inflammation, some tumor-associated TLS may be immunologically inactive, with immune checkpoint inhibitors functioning to revitalize them through pathway activation.This review summarizes work on TLS and how they mediate immune responses in human tumors. We also explore TLS as potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy.


EXPERT OPINION
The presence of TLS in human tumors has been linked with a better clinical prognosis, response to treatment(s) and overall survival. TLS provide a structured microenvironment for the activation, expansion and maturation of immune cells at the tumor site. These activities can enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines by revitalizing local anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="To investigate how host and pathogen diversity govern immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), we performed a large-scale screen of vaccine-mediated protection against aerosol Mtb infection using three inbred mouse strains [C57BL/6 (B6), C3HeB/FeJ (C3H), Balb/c x 129/SvJ (C129F1)] and three Mtb strains (H37Rv, CDC1551, SA161) representing two lineages and distinct virulence properties. We compared three protective modalities, all of which involve inoculation with live mycobacteria: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the only approved TB vaccine, delivered either subcutaneously or intravenously, and concomitant Mtb infection (CoMtb), a model of pre-existing immunity in which a low-level Mtb infection is established in the cervical lymph node following intradermal inoculation. We examined lung bacterial burdens at early (Day 28) and late (Day 98) time points after aerosol Mtb challenge and histopathology at Day 98. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the reduction of bacterial load afforded by these modalities at Day 28 across the combinations and noted a strong positive correlation between bacterial burden in unvaccinated mice and the degree of protection afforded by vaccination. Although we observed variation in the degree of reduction in bacterial burdens across the nine mouse/bacterium strain combinations, virtually all protective modalities performed similarly for a given strain-strain combination. We also noted dramatic variation in histopathology changes driven by both host and bacterial genetic backgrounds. Vaccination improved pathology scores for all infections except CDC1551. However, the most dramatic impact of vaccination on lesion development occurred for the C3H-SA161 combination, where vaccination entirely abrogated the development of the large necrotic lesions that arise in unvaccinated mice. In conclusion, we find that substantial TB heterogeneity can be recapitulated by introducing variability in both host and bacterial genetics, resulting in changes in vaccine-mediated protection as measured both by bacterial burden as well as histopathology. These differences can be harnessed in future studies to identify immune correlates of vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Hepatic inflammatory cell accumulation and the subsequent systematic inflammation drive acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) development. Previous studies showed that the vagus nerve exerts anti-inflammatory activity in many inflammatory diseases. Here, we aimed to identify the key molecule mediating the inflammatory process in ACLF and reveal the neuroimmune communication arising from the vagus nerve and immunological disorders of ACLF.


METHODS
Proteomic analysis was performed and validated in ACLF model mice or patients, and intervention animal experiments were conducted using neutralizing antibodies. PNU-282987 (acetylcholine receptor agonist) and vagotomy were applied for perturbing vagus nerve activity. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining, and CRISPR/Cas9 technology were used for in vivo or in vitro mechanistic studies.


RESULTS
The unbiased proteomics identified C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) as the greatest differential protein in the livers of mice with ACLF and its relation to the systematic inflammation and mortality were confirmed in patients with ACLF. Interventions on CXCL9 and its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) improved liver injury and decreased mortality of ACLF mice, which were related to the suppressing of hepatic immune cells' accumulation and activation. Vagus nerve stimulation attenuated while vagotomy aggravated the expression of CXCL9 and the severity of ACLF. Blocking CXCL9 and CXCR3 ameliorated liver inflammation and increased ACLF-associated mortality in ACLF mice with vagotomy. scRNA-seq revealed that hepatic macrophages served as the major source of CXCL9 in ACLF and were validated by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis. Notably, the expression of CXCL9 in macrophages was modulated by vagus nerve-mediated cholinergic signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
Our novel findings highlighted that the neuroimmune communication of the vagus nerve-macrophage-CXCL9 axis contributed to ACLF development. These results provided evidence for neuromodulation as a promising approach for preventing and treating ACLF.">

        <tr id="Introduction
Genetic mutations in critical nodes of pulmonary epithelial function are linked to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and other interstitial lung diseases. The slow progression of these pathologies is often intermitted and accelerated by acute exacerbations, complex non-resolving cycles of inflammation and parenchymal damage, resulting in lung function decline and death. Excess monocyte mobilization during the initial phase of an acute exacerbation, and their long-term persistence in the lung, is linked to poor disease outcome.


Methods
The present work leverages a clinical idiopathic PF dataset and a murine model of acute inflammatory exacerbations triggered by mutation in the alveolar type-2 cell-restricted Surfactant Protein-C [SP-C] gene to spatially and phenotypically define monocyte/macrophage changes in the fibrosing lung.


Results
SP-C mutation triggered heterogeneous CD68+ macrophage activation, with highly active peri-injured cells relative to those sampled from fully remodeled and healthy regions. Ingenuity pathway analysis of sorted CD11b-SigF+CD11c+ alveolar macrophages defined asynchronous activation of extracellular matrix re-organization, cellular mobilization, and Apolipoprotein E (Apoe) signaling in the fibrosing lung. Cell-cell communication analysis of single cell sequencing datasets predicted pro-fibrogenic signaling (fibronectin/Fn1, osteopontin/Spp1, and Tgfb1) emanating from Trem2/TREM2 + interstitial macrophages. These cells also produced a distinct lipid signature from alveolar macrophages and monocytes, characterized by Apoe expression. Mono- and di-allelic genetic deletion of ApoE in SP-C mutant mice had limited impact on inflammation and mortality up to 42 day after injury.


Discussion
Together, these results provide a detailed spatio-temporal picture of resident, interstitial, and monocyte-derived macrophages during SP-C induced inflammatory exacerbations and end-stage clinical PF, and propose ApoE as a biomarker to identify activated macrophages involved in tissue remodeling.">

        <tr id="Chronic viral infections cause thymic involution yet the potential for broader, longer-term impact on thymic composition remains unexplored. Here we show that chronic, but not acute, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection promotes a unique population of immature B cells in the thymus. We show that chronic viral infection promotes signals within the thymus, including the expression of B-cell activating factor (BAFF), that favor the maturation of this population as these cells acquire expression of CD19 and immunoglobulin M. Mechanistically, type I interferon (IFN-I), predominantly IFNβ, signals to thymic hematopoietic cells, strongly delaying T-cell development at the earliest precursor stage. Furthermore, IFN-I signaling to the nonhematopoietic compartment provides a second signal essential to favor B-cell differentiation and maturation within the thymus. Importantly, chronic infection yields changes in the B-cell population for at least 50 days following infection, long after thymic atrophy has subsided. Thus, the inflammatory milieu induced by chronic viral infection has a profound, and long-lasting, effect on thymic composition leading to the generation of a novel population of thymic B cells.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Dendritic cells are important mediators in the activation of the innate and adoptive immune response. The generation of DC/DCleu was comparable under physiological hypoxic and normoxic culture conditions, with no significant differences in frequencies of generated DC/DCleu from leukemic cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear as well as whole blood cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, the composition of immune cells and anti-leukemic immune activity after T cell enriched mixed lymphocyte culture with patients’ blood pretreated vs not pretreated with defined response modifiers (Kits) was improved, particularly under hypoxic conditions. These data show that the generation of DC/DCleu as well as the induction of anti-leukemic immune activating functionality is possible under standard normoxic as well as physiological hypoxic culture conditions ex vivo. Abstract Hypoxia can modulate the immune system by affecting the function and activity of immune cells, potentially leading to altered immune responses. This study investigated the generation of leukemia-derived dendritic cells (DCleu) from leukemic blasts and their impact on immune cell activation under hypoxic (5–10% O2) compared to normoxic (21% O2) conditions using various immunomodulatory Kits. The results revealed that DC/DCleu-generation was similar under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, with no significant differences observed in frequencies of generated DC/DCleu. Furthermore, the study showed that the activation of immune cells and their anti-leukemic activity improved when T cell-enriched immunoreactive cells were co-cultured with DC/DCleu which were generated with Kit I and M compared to the control after mixed lymphocyte cultures. The anti-leukemic activity was improved under hypoxic compared to normoxic conditions after MLCWB-DC Kit M. These findings suggest that DC/DCleu-cultures of leukemic whole blood with Kits under hypoxic conditions yield comparable frequencies of DC/DCleu and can even increase the anti-leukemic activity compared to normoxic conditions. Overall, this research highlights the potential of utilizing DC/DCleu (potentially induced in vivo with Kits) as a promising approach to enhance immune response in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.">

        <tr id="Chronic Hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection is a global health challenge, causing damage ranging from hepatitis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In our study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis was performed in livers from mice models with chronic inflammation induced by CHB infection and we found that endothelial cells (ECs) exhibited the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among all ten cell types. NF-κB signaling was activated in ECs to induce cell dysfunction and subsequent hepatic inflammation, which might be mediated by the interaction of macrophage-derived and cholangiocyte-derived VISFATIN/Nampt signaling. Moreover, we divided ECs into three subclusters, including periportal ECs (EC_Z1), midzonal ECs (EC_Z2), and pericentral ECs (EC_Z3) according to hepatic zonation. Functional analysis suggested that pericentral ECs and midzonal ECs, instead of periportal ECs, were more vulnerable to HBV infection, as the VISFATIN/Nampt- NF-κB axis was mainly altered in these two subpopulations. Interestingly, pericentral ECs showed increasing communication with macrophages and cholangiocytes via the Nampt-Insr and Nampt-Itga5/Itgb1 axis upon CHB infection, which contribute to angiogenesis and vascular capillarization. Additionally, ECs, especially pericentral ECs, showed a close connection with nature killer (NK) cells and T cells via the Cxcl6-Cxcr6 axis, which is involved in shaping the microenvironment in CHB mice livers. Thus, our study described the heterogeneity and functional alterations of three subclusters in ECs. We revealed the potential role of VISFATIN/Nampt signaling in modulating ECs characteristics and related hepatic inflammation, and EC-derived chemokine Cxcl16 in shaping NK and T cell recruitment, providing key insights into the multifunctionality of ECs in CHB-associated pathologies.">

        <tr id="The peripheral immune system has emerged as a regulator of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Microglia are resident immune cells in the brain that may orchestrate communication between the central nervous system and peripheral immune system, though the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we found that gamma-type immunoglobulin, a product originating from peripheral blood B cells, localized in the brain parenchyma of multiple mouse models with amyloid pathology, and was enriched on microglia but not on other brain cell types. Further experiments showed that gamma-type immunoglobulin bound to microglial cell membranes and led to diverse transcriptomic changes, including upregulation of pathways related to phagocytosis and immunity. Functional assays demonstrated that gamma-type immunoglobulin enhanced microglial phagocytic capacity for amyloid-beta fibrils via its Fc, but not Fab, fragment. Our data indicate that microglia, when exposed to gamma-type immunoglobulin, exhibit an enhanced capacity for clearing amyloid-beta fibrils, potentially via the gamma-type immunoglobulin Fc fragment signaling pathway. This suggests that parenchymal gamma-type immunoglobulin should be further investigated to determine whether it may play a beneficial role against Alzheimer's disease by enhancing microglial function.">

This knowledge gap has hindered the development of therapeutic strategies to overcome tumor immune resistance induced by hypoxia.

A hypoxic microenvironment promotes binding of HIF-1α complex is demonstrated to the ALCAM promoter therefore increasing its expression in macrophages, and the ALCAMhigh macrophages co-localize with exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor spatial microenvironment and promote T cell exhaustion. Preclinically, HIF-1ɑ inhibition reduces ALCAM expression in macrophages and exhausted CD8+ T cells and potentiates T cell antitumor function to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.

        <tr id="Introduction Granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) show fast recovery following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) constituting the major part of peripheral blood in the early phase. Although G-MDSCs mediate immune suppression through multiple mechanisms, they may also promote inflammation under specific conditions. Methods G-MDSCs were isolated from 82 patients following allo-HSCT within 90 days after allo-HSCT, and their interactions with autologous CD3+ T-cells were examined. T-cell proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry following CFSE staining, while differentiation and interferon-γ secretion were characterized using chemokine receptor profiling and ELISpot assays, respectively. NK cell cytotoxicity was evaluated through co-culture with K562 cells. An aGVHD xenogeneic model in humanized mice was employed to study the in vivo effects of human leukocytes. Furthermore, transcriptional alterations in G-MDSCs were analyzed via RNA sequencing to investigate functional transitions. Results G-MDSCs promoted inflammation in the early-stage, by facilitating cytokine secretion and proliferation of T cells, as well as their differentiation into pro-inflammatory T helper subsets. At day 28, patients with a higher number of G-MDSCs exhibited an increased risk of developing grades II-IV aGvHD. Besides, adoptive transfer of G-MDSCs from patients at day 28 into humanized mice exacerbated aGvHD. However, at day 90, G-MDSCs led to immunosuppression, characterized by upregulated expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase gene and interleukin-10 secretion, coupled with the inhibition of T cell proliferation. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis of G-MDSCs at day 28 and day 90 revealed that 1445 genes were differentially expressed. These genes were associated with various pathways, revealing the molecular signatures of early post-transplant differentiation in G-MDSCs. In addition, genes linked to the endoplasmic reticulum stress were upregulated in patients without aGvHD. The acquisition of immunosuppressive function by G-MDSCs may depend on the activation of CXCL2 and DERL1 genes. Conclusion Our findings revealed the alteration in the immune characteristics of G-MDSCs within the first 90 days post-allo-HSCT. Moreover, the quantity of G-MDSCs at day 28 may serve as a predictive indicator for the development of aGvHD.">

        <tr id="Respiratory virus infections remain a significant challenge to human health and the social economy. The symptoms range from mild rhinitis and nasal congestion to severe lower respiratory tract dysfunction and even mortality. The efficacy of therapeutic drugs targeting respiratory viruses varies, depending upon infection time and the drug resistance engendered by a high frequency of viral genome mutations, necessitating the development of new strategies. The MAPK/ERK pathway that was well delineated in the 1980s represents a classical signaling cascade, essential for cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Since this pathway is constitutively activated in many cancers by oncogenes, several drugs inhibiting Raf/MEK/ERK have been developed and currently used in anticancer treatment. Two decades ago, it was reported that viruses such as HIV and influenza viruses could exploit the host cellular MAPK/ERK pathway for their replication. Thus, it would be feasible to repurpose this category of the pathway inhibitors for the treatment of respiratory viral infections. The advantage is that the host genes are not easy to mutate such that the drug resistance rarely occurs during short-period treatment of viruses. Therefore, in this review we will summarize the research progress on the role of the MAPK/ERK pathway in respiratory virus amplification and discuss the potential of the pathway inhibitors (MEK inhibitors) in the treatment of respiratory viral infections.">

Immunohistochemistry showed that CD206-positive (CD206+) macrophages were enriched in bmCRPC bone biopsy specimens compared with primary tumors or lymph node metastases. In preclinical osteogenic prostate cancer (Pca) xenograft models, CD206+ macrophages were recruited to areas with tumor-induced bone. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis showed higher expression of an M2-like gene signature, with activated canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways, in tumor-associated macrophages isolated from osteogenic tumors (bone-TAMs) than in TAMs isolated from nonosteogenic tumors (ctrl-TAMs). Mechanistic studies showed that endothelial cells (ECs) that had undergone EC-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition, the precursors of tumor-induced OSBs, produced paracrine factors, including Wnts, CXCL14, and lysyl oxidase, which induced M2 polarization and recruited M2-like TAMs to the bone-tumor microenvironment (bone-TME). Bone-TAMs suppressed CD8+ T cells' proliferation and cytolytic activity, and these effects were partially reversed by treating bone-TAMs with Wnt inhibitors. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pca-induced EC-to-OSB transition reduced the levels of M2-like macrophages in osteogenic tumors. Our study demonstrates that Pca-induced EC-to-OSB transition drives immunosuppression in the bone-TME, suggesting that therapies that reduce Pca-induced bone formation may improve immunotherapeutic outcomes for bmCRPC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which consist of chromatin DNA studded with granule proteins, are released by neutrophils in response to both infectious and sterile inflammation. Beyond the canonical role in defense against pathogens, the extrusion of NETs also contributes to the initiation, metastasis, and therapeutic response of malignant diseases. Recently, NETs have been implicated in the development and therapeutic responses of various types of tumors. Although extensive work regarding inflammation in tumors has been reported, a comprehensive summary of how these web‐like extracellular structures initiate and propagate tumor progression under the specific microenvironment is lacking. In this review, we demonstrate the initiators and related signaling pathways that trigger NETs formation in cancers. Additionally, this review will outline the current molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of NETs during dormant cancer cells awakening, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) extravasation, and metastatic recurrence of cancer. This is followed by a perspective on the current and potential clinical potential of NETs as therapeutic targets in the treatment of both local and metastatic disease, including the improvement of the efficacy of existing therapies.">

        <tr id="Tissue regeneration and remodeling involve many complex stages. Macrophages are critical in maintaining micro-environmental homeostasis by regulating inflammation and orchestrating wound healing. They display high plasticity in response to various stimuli, showing a spectrum of functional phenotypes that vary from M1 (pro-inflammatory) to M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages. While transient inflammation is an essential trigger for tissue healing following an injury, sustained inflammation (e.g., in foreign body response to implants, diabetes or inflammatory diseases) can hinder tissue healing and cause tissue damage. Modulating macrophage polarization has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing immune-mediated tissue regeneration and promoting better integration of implantable materials in the host. This article provides an overview of macrophages’ functional properties followed by discussing different strategies for modulating macrophage polarization. Advances in the use of synthetic and natural biomaterials to fabricate immune-modulatory materials are highlighted. This reveals that the development and clinical application of more effective immunomodulatory systems targeting macrophage polarization under pathological conditions will be driven by a detailed understanding of the factors that regulate macrophage polarization and biological function in order to optimize existing methods and generate novel strategies to control cell phenotype.">

        <tr id="While many studies have associated HIV prevalence with socio-economic status, few have explored the host's immunity status prior to HIV infection. High HIV prevalence in Africa may in part be contributed by a high prevalence of other persistent infections that modulate the host immunity towards phenotypes that promote HIV acquisition. In this narrative review, we examined how four most prevalent pathogens in Africa (human papillomavirus, herpesviruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and helminth infections) modulate immunity to favor their survival and in turn, also influence HIV acquisition. We have described how these pathogens expand the number of memory and activated T cells, increase the expression of HIV entry receptors leading to an increased HIV susceptibility, and show how these pathogens' immunoevasive strategies may favor HIV persistence. A better understanding of the association between immunomodulation caused by other prevalent infections and HIV/AIDS prevalence may improve HIV/AIDS preventive strategies in Africa. We suggest intensifying efforts to control these chronic infections by making drugs or vaccines available in endemic regions. This may act as another indirect strategy to complement current HIV/AIDS interventions in Africa. We also call for more research to understand better the relationship between immunomodulation by other prevalent infections and HIV incidence.

        <tr id="The recent outbreak of monkeypox virus (MPXV) was unprecedented in its size and distribution. Those living with uncontrolled HIV and low CD4 T cell counts might develop a fulminant clinical mpox course with increased mortality, secondary infections, and necrotizing lesions. Fatal cases display a high and widespread MPXV tissue burden. The underlying pathomechanisms are not fully understood. We report here the pathological findings of an MPXV-driven abscess in gastrocnemius muscle requiring surgery in an immunocompromised patient with severe mpox. Presence of virus particles and infectivity were confirmed by electron microscopy, expansion microscopy, and virus culture, respectively. MPXV tissue distribution by immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed a necrotic core with infection of different cell types. In contrast, at the lesion rim fibroblasts were mainly infected. Immune cells were almost absent in the necrotic core, but were abundant at the infection rim and predominantly macrophages. Further, we detected high amounts of alternatively activated GPNMB+-macrophages at the lesion border. Of note, macrophages only rarely colocalized with virus-infected cells. Insufficient clearance of infected cells and infection of lesion-associated fibroblasts sustained by the abundance of profibrotic macrophages might lead to the coalescing of lesions and the severe and persistent clinical mpox course observed in immunocompromised patients.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immature cells that expand in the circulation of patients with cancer, sepsis or chronic inflammation, modulate the immune response against cancer (favoring tumor onset and progression) and promote neoangiogenesis. These premises suggest that MDSCs could be involved in the pathogenesis of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by chronic inflammation and extensive neoangiogenesis in bone marrow and spleen). In this paper, we found that (1) MDSCs are increased both in the circulation and in the spleen of PMF patients and strongly correlate with disease progression; and (2) reduced CXCR4 expression on MDSCs along with increased plasmatic SDF-1α can be involved in their mobilization. These findings suggest that circulating MDSCs can be considered a parameter of disease severity and set MDSCs as potential new targets for cancer therapy. Abstract Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a chronic inflammatory state that plays a relevant role in the disease pathogenesis (as proven by high levels of inflammatory cytokines with prognostic significance and by a persistent oxidative stress) and by extensive neoangiogenesis in bone marrow (BM) and spleen. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immature cells that expand in patients with cancer, sepsis or chronic inflammation, favoring tumor onset and progression mainly through the decrease in immune surveillance and the promotion of neoangiogenesis. In this paper, we evaluated the presence of circulating MDSCs in PMF patients, the plasmatic factors involved in their mobilization/expansion and the correlations with laboratory, genetic and clinical parameters. The data indicated that MDSCs could have a relevant role in PMF as a new pathogenic mechanism contributing to explaining the phenotypic diversity observed during the clinical course of the disease, or a potential new target for personalized treatment.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presents a considerable global health burden due to its late diagnosis and high morbidity. The liver's specific anatomical and physiological features expose it to various antigens, requiring precise immune regulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a comprehensive overview of the interactions between the immune system and gut microbiota in the development of HCC, as well as the relevant therapeutic approaches are discussed. Dysregulation of immune compartments within the liver microenvironment drives HCC pathogenesis, characterized by elevated regulatory cells such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and M2 macrophages as well as suppressive molecules, alongside reduced number of effector cells like T cells, natural killer cells, and M1 macrophages. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota also contributes to HCC by disrupting intestinal barrier integrity and triggering overactivated immune responses. Immunotherapy approaches, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, have exhibited promise in HCC management, yet adoptive cell therapy and cancer vaccination research are in the early steps with relatively less favorable outcomes. Further understanding of immune dysregulation, gut microbiota involvement, and therapeutic combination strategies are essential for advancing precision immunotherapy in HCC.">

        <tr id="Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium representing one of the leading causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The development of pneumonia results from a complex interplay between pathogens and pulmonary innate mucosal immunity. Therefore, the knowledge of the host immune responses is pivotal for the development of effective therapeutics to treat A. baumannii infections. Previous studies were conducted using cell lines and animal models, but a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between A. baumannii and primary human immune cells is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we investigated the response of primary monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells to the A. baumannii-type strain and an epidemic clinical isolate. We found that all immune cells trigger different responses when interacting with A. baumannii. In particular, macrophages and monocytes mediate bacterial clearance, whereas monocytes and dendritic cells activate a late response through the production of cytokines, chemokines, and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules. The epidemic strain induces lower expression of interleukin-10 and CD80 compared with the type strain, potentially constituting two immune evasion strategies.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint proteins have become recent research hotspots for their vital role in maintaining peripheral immune tolerance and suppressing immune response function in a wide range of tumors. Therefore, investigating the immunomodulatory functions of immune checkpoints and their therapeutic potential for clinical use is of paramount importance. The immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is an important component of cancer immunotherapy, as it targets inhibitory immune signaling transduction with antagonistic antibodies to restore the host immune response. Anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies are two main types of widely used ICBs that drastically improve the survival and prognosis of many patients with cancer. Nevertheless, the response rate of most cancer types remains relatively low due to the drug resistance of ICBs, which calls for an in-depth exploration to improve their efficacy. Accumulating evidence suggests that immune checkpoint proteins are glycosylated in forms of N-glycosylation, core fucosylation, or sialylation, which affect multiple biological functions of proteins such as protein biosynthesis, stability, and interaction. In this review, we give a brief introduction to several immune checkpoints and summarize primary molecular mechanisms that modulate protein stability and immunosuppressive function. In addition, newly developed methods targeting glycosylation on immune checkpoints for detection used to stratify patients, as well as small-molecule agents disrupting receptor–ligand interactions to circumvent drug resistance of traditional ICBs, in order to increase the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy strategies of patients with cancer, are also included to provide new insights into scientific research and clinical treatments.">

Additionally, other viral infections including EBV, the herpes family of viruses, hepatitis viruses, influenza, HIV, and hemorrhagic fevers can be complicated by MAS. The diagnosis and management of the condition remain challenging due to the lack of consensus on specific guidelines, especially among the adult population. Currently, therapeutic options primarily rely on medications that are typically used to treat primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, such as corticosteroids and etoposide. In addition, cytokine-targeted therapies present promising treatment options.

Through proteins on their cell surface, DCs sense changes in the environment, internalize pathogens, present processed Ags, and communicate with other immune cells. By combining chemical labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry, we systematically profiled and compared the cell-surface proteomes of human primary conventional DCs (cDCs) in their resting and activated states. TLR activation by a lipopeptide globally reshaped the cell-surface proteome of cDCs, with >100 proteins upregulated or downregulated. By simultaneously elevating positive regulators and reducing inhibitory signals across multiple protein families, the remodeling creates a cell-surface milieu promoting immune responses. Still, cDCs maintain the stimulatory-to-inhibitory balance by leveraging a distinct set of inhibitory molecules. This analysis thus uncovers the molecular complexity and plasticity of the cDC cell surface and provides a roadmap for understanding cDC activation and signaling.">

These cell populations include myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a heterogeneous, immature myeloid population with immunosuppressive abilities. Obesity-associated MDSCs have been linked with tumor dissemination, progression and poor clinical outcomes. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to assess the impact of obesity-associated MDSCs on cancer in both preclinical models and oncological patients with obesity. A secondary objective was to examine the key role that leptin, the most important proinflammatory mediator released by adipocytes, plays in MDSC-driven immunosuppression Finally, an overview is provided of the different therapeutic approaches available to target MDSCs in the context of obesity-related cancer.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) comprise diverse cell populations that play critical roles in antigen presentation and triggering immune responses in the body. However, several factors impair the immune function of DCs and may promote immune evasion in cancer. Understanding the mechanism of DC dysfunction and the diverse functions of heterogeneous DCs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for designing effective strategies for cancer immunotherapy. Clinical applications targeting DCs summarized in this report aim to improve immune infiltration and enhance the biological function of DCs to modulate the TME to prevent cancer cells from evading the immune system. Herein, factors in the TME that induce DC dysfunction, such as cytokines, hypoxic environment, tumor exosomes and metabolites, and co-inhibitory molecules, have been described. Furthermore, several key signaling pathways involved in DC dysfunction and signal-relevant drugs evaluated in clinical trials were identified. Finally, this review provides an overview of current clinical immunotherapies targeting DCs, especially therapies with proven clinical outcomes, and explores future developments in DC immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumor‐driven immune suppression is a critical mechanism by which cancer cells evade the host immune system, leading to tumor growth and metastasis. The tumor immune microenvironment contains a large population of immune‐suppressing myeloid cells, which play a key role in tumor development and drug resistance to existing immunotherapy. Polymorphonuclear myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (PMN‐MDSCs) are important components of the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms of PMN‐MDSCs and finding specific targets for PMN‐MDSCs to regulate tumor immune microenvironment is the focus and challenge of current immunotherapy. In a recent issue of Nature, Wang and colleagues revealed that CD300ld on PMN‐MDSCs is required for tumor‐driven immune suppression(1), this provided a new target for cancer immunotherapy, The study identified CD300ld as a novel, highly conserved tumor immunosuppressive receptor. CD300ld is highly expressed specifically on PMN‐MDSCs and is a key receptor in regulating the recruitment and immunosuppressant function of PMN‐MDSCs. Targeting CD300ld can reshape the tumor immune microenvironment by inhibiting the recruitment and function of PMN‐MDSCs, resulting in broad‐spectrum anti‐tumor effects. CD300ld target shows good safety, conservation, anti‐tumor effectiveness, and synergism with the Programmed death‐1 target, which is expected to become a new ideal target for tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most prevalent cancer and a significant global health burden, with increasing incidence rates and limited treatment options. Immunotherapy has become a promising approach due to its ability to affect the immune microenvironment and promote antitumor responses. The immune microenvironment performs an essential role in both the progression and the development of HCC, with different characteristics based on specific immune cells and etiological factors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and durvalumab) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitors (tremelimumab and ipilimumab), have the potential to treat advanced HCC and overcome adverse effects, such as liver failure and chemoresistance. Phase II and phase III clinical trials highlight the efficacy of pembrolizumab and nivolumab, respectively, in advanced HCC patients, as demonstrated by their positive effects on overall survival and progression-free survival. Tremelimumab has exhibited modest response rates, though it does possess antiviral activity. Thus, it is still being investigated in ongoing clinical trials. Combination therapies with multiple drugs have demonstrated potential benefits in terms of survival and tumor response rates, improving patient outcomes compared to monotherapy, especially for advanced-stage HCC. This review addresses the clinical trials of immunotherapies for early-, intermediate-, and advanced-stage HCC. Additionally, it highlights how combination therapy can significantly enhance overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rate in advanced-stage HCC, where treatment options are limited.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) alone caused over a billion deaths in the last 200 years, making it one of the deadliest diseases to humankind. Understanding the immune mechanisms underlying protection or pathology in TB is key to uncover the much needed innovative approaches to tackle TB. The scavenger receptor cysteine-rich molecule CD5 antigen-like (CD5L) has been associated with TB, but whether and how CD5L shapes the immune response during the course of disease remains poorly understood. Here, we show an upregulation of CD5L in circulation and at the site of infection in C57BL/6 Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice. To investigate the role of CD5L in TB, we studied the progression of M. tuberculosis aerosol infection in a recently described genetically engineered mouse model lacking CD5L. Despite the increase of CD5L during infection of wild-type mice, absence of CD5L did not impact bacterial burden, histopathology or survival of infected mice. Absence of CD5L associated with a modest increase in the numbers of CD4+ T cells and the expression of IFN-γ in the lungs of infected mice, with no major effect in overall immune cell dynamics. Collectively, this study confirms CD5L as a potential diagnostic biomarker to TB, showing no discernible impact on the outcome of the infection.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Preserving barrier integrity is of great importance in mucosal tissues while simultaneously defending against inflammatory threats and exposures to pathogens. NK cells at barrier sites are essential for viral control during infections such as herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) but must also balance pathogen response with tissue protection. We have characterized human tissue NK cells in the vaginal tissue (VT) as having distinct effector and tissue protective functions. Using scRNA-seq and high- parameter flow cytometry, we uncovered a unique signature for VT NK cells, indicating a reduced effector phenotype with increased factors related to tissue residency and immunoregulation at steady state. Despite their functionally quiescent nature, these cells were able to respond robustly to inflammatory signals, suggesting they are poised for pathogen response. We found that the gene signatures between mouse and human NK cells were remarkably similar, demonstrating the feasibility of using a mouse model to probe distinct NK cell functions during mucosal infection. In mice, VT NK cells responded robustly to acute HSV-2 infection and retained an enhanced recall potential after viral clearance. They also secreted tissue repair factors and played a role in restricting tissue damage following viral infection. Our data, using both human tissues and a mouse model, reveal an unexpected role of mucosal tissue NK cells in the VT in balancing host protection with tissue repair in the context of localized mucosal tissue infection.">

        <tr id="Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) presents an emerging public threat due to its high mortality rate and ever‐expanding geographic distribution. However, characterization of SFTSV infection pathogenesis and immunological impact at single‐cell level remains underexplored. Here, we employ single‐cell transcriptome‐wide sequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from hospitalized SFTSV‐infected patients to map the immune landscape across acute and convalescent stages of infection. The results reveal significant alterations in immune cell compositions, along with profound disruption in intercellular crosstalk. B cells and neutrophils appear to be the primary target for SFTSV infection besides monocytes, as evidenced by heightened virus‐related pathways in these two cell types during the acute phase. In addition, SFTSV infection induces a substantial inflammatory response, which were prominently reflected in monocytes and neutrophils. These data illustrate the complex immune remodeling and inflammatory cascades triggered by SFTSV, with a particular focus on its effects on B cells and neutrophils, bringing novel insights into future therapeutic developments.">

        <tr id="Background. Immunotherapy is efficacious in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the benefits are limited to a minority of patients. Most HCC patients show resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Agonists of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), potent immune stimulators, showed limited effectiveness. Using preclinical models, we studied the mechanisms of resistance to ICB and STING agonism. Methods. Murine HCA-1 and RIL-175 HCCs were orthotopically grown in mice with underlying liver fibrosis, to mimic the presentation of human HCC. Established tumors were treated with a STING agonist (BMS-986301) or anti-PD1 ICB, and mice were followed to evaluate safety and efficacy, as well as the mechanisms of treatment resistance by RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence, B-cell depletion and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) ICB. Results. Unbiased analyses of transcriptomic data from murine HCC tissues from ICB-treated mice showed an increased abundance of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and B cells. STING agonism alone showed efficacy in the ICB-responsive RIL-175 HCC model but more limited efficacy in the ICB-resistant HCA-1 model. STING agonism increased circulating IL-10 and intratumoral infiltration by B-cells, including TIM-1+ B cells, and promoted the formation of tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS)-like structures, especially in the peritumoral areas. Strikingly, adding B cell depletion to ICB or STING agonism treatment significantly increased survival. Interestingly, unlike ICB, STING agonism also had a pronounced anti-metastatic activity. In addition, the combination of STING agonism and TIM-1 blockade augmented B cell differentiation and antigen presentation in vitro and improved the anti-tumor effects in murine HCC in vivo. This approach decreased the number of TIM-1+ B cells in the tumor and shifted B cells to higher expression of CD86 and MHC class II, enhancing the antigen presentation capability and further boosting the antitumor efficacy of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that B cells are associated with ICB- and STING-mediated therapy resistance, and that depleting B-cells or targeting TIM-1 enhances both innate and acquired therapeutic efficacy in HCC.">

        <tr id="The gastric mucosa is characterized by continuous innate immune surveillance and inflammatory signaling, yet a high proportion of gastric carcinomas (GCs) are recalcitrant to immune-directed therapies. The mechanisms by which GCs evade adaptive immune surveillance within the highly antigenic microenvironment of the gastric mucosa remains unknown. To address this, we collected patient-matched tumor tissue, distant normal tissue, metastasis, and draining lymph nodes to generate a large-scale single-cell immune profiling dataset from 64 patients (n=179 samples, >150,000 cells). From single cell analysis, we identified two distinct sources of impaired tumor surveillance within tumor draining lymph nodes. First, we observed that a significant fraction of tumor draining lymph nodes had undergone cytokine-driven reprogramming, leading to reduced dendritic cell homing and limited T cell priming. Second, T cells undergoing successful activation exhibited limited expansion and constrained differentiation, marked by expression of the quiescence-associated transcription factor Kruppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2). Overexpression of KLF2 in primary T cells limited both their differentiation and cytotoxic capacity. These findings implicate both impaired T cell priming and KLF2-dependent T cell quiescence in limiting T cell immunity in gastric adenocarcinoma. We suggest these findings represent an emerging model for immune silencing in tumors developing from tissues with chronic inflammation.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV treated during acute infection are the group for whom achieving functional cure appears most viable. Follicular CD8+ T cells could contribute to HIV reservoir clearance by accessing B cell follicles through CXCR5 expression. This study examines peripheral follicular CD8+ T cells using flow cytometry, transcriptome analyses, and functional assays in people treated during acute (n = 37) and chronic (n = 18) infection, as well as in individuals naturally controlling HIV (n = 20) and living without HIV (n = 10). Our results reveal that early, as opposed to late, treatment initiation preserves antiviral effector functions of follicular CD8+ T cells, which are further enhanced by PD1 inhibition. We also identify a correlation between follicular CD8+ T cells and intact proviral HIV DNA levels in acute, but not chronic, infection. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of peripheral effector cells after 48 weeks of suppressive therapy indicated traits of recent antigen exposure, suggesting potential recirculation into lymphoid tissue. These findings underscore the pivotal role of follicular CD8+ T cells in anti-HIV responses and support investigating targeted cure strategies, such as anti-PD1 therapy, especially in individuals initiating treatment during acute infection.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8+ T cells are pivotal for long-term anti-tumor immunity due to their longevity and rapid response upon encountering tumor cells. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a member of the Ste20 family of kinases, restricts proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and plays critical roles in T cell priming and activation. However, the impact of HPK1 on CD8+ T cell differentiation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells derived from patients lacking HPK1 exhibit a stronger memory phenotype. HPK1 deletion promotes the formation of precursor and central memory CD8+ T cells, resulting in superior and long-lasting antitumor activity in murine cancer models compared to WT mice. Additionally, HPK1 knockout induces metabolic reprogramming by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial respiration complex activity. Mechanistically, HPK1 deletion downregulates mTOR signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of mTOR and S6. Increased mitophagy activity is observed in HPK1-depleted cells, with upregulation of key mitophagy regulators, including Pink1 and Bnip3l, maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Our study reveals that HPK1 regulates CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming, guiding cell differentiation and antitumor responses.">

The Eyes absent (EYA) family of proteins, which are crucial for embryonic development, become dysregulated in cancer, where they have been shown to mediate proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our study reveals an unusual mechanism by which EYA3 reduces the presence of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells in the premetastatic niche (PMN) to enhance metastasis, independent of its effects on the primary tumor. We find that EYA3 up-regulates nuclear factor κB signaling to enhance CCL2 expression, which, in contrast to previous findings, suppresses cytotoxic NK cell activation in vitro and their infiltration into the PMN in vivo. These findings uncover an unexpected role for CCL2 in inhibiting NK cell responses at the PMN and suggest that targeting EYA3 could be an effective strategy to reactivate antitumor immune responses to inhibit metastasis.">

        <tr id="CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has significantly advanced the treatment landscape for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL). However, up to 60% of patients do not achieve a complete response. To uncover determinants of therapeutic efficacy, we analyzed the infusion products of eight r/r DLBCL patients with distinct clinical responses to axicabtagene ciloleucel using single-cell transcriptomics. Compared to patients who exhibited progressive disease, infusion products of complete responders demonstrated enriched signatures of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Based on these findings, we developed a novel strategy to improve CD19-directed CAR T-cell treatment efficacy by incorporating IFN-I as an enhancer during the ex vivo manufacturing process. For both CD28- and 4-1BB-costimulated second-generation CARs, we found that low-strength IFN-I signaling enhanced CAR T-cell cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy. On the other hand, high-strength IFN-I signaling compromised cell viability and in vivo efficacy. Our low-strength IFN-I signaling approach leverages an existing FDA-approved pharmacologic agent and is compatible with current CAR constructs and manufacturing workflows. Together, our results establish IFN-I as a potent and costimulation-independent enhancer of CAR T-cell efficacy and provide a translationally feasible approach to enhance CAR T-cell therapies for r/r DLBCL.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. The lack of ICIs efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of tumor-reprogrammed glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs) that create a “cold” immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), impeding the infiltration and activation of effector T cells. GBM-derived αvβ3/αvβ5-integrin ligands, including SPP1, were shown to mediate the emergence of GAMs. We hypothesized that a combination strategy aiming to block the reprogramming of GAMs using a synthetic 7aaRGD peptide that targets SPP1/integrin signaling might overcome resistance to ICIs and reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. Methods Matrigel invasion assay was used to test the efficacy of 7aaRGD in glioma-microglia co-cultures. We determined the impact of 7aaRGD, administered as a monotherapy or combined with PD-1 blockade, on tumor growth, GAMs accumulation and phenotypes, arginase-1 levels and neovasculature in experimental gliomas. The effects of treatments on the tumor immune landscape were dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, cytokine profiling and RNA-seq analysis of sorted GAMs followed by CITE-seq based data deconvolution. Results 7aaRGD efficiently blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in vitro. Intratumorally delivered 7aaRGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in orthotopic gliomas but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive GAMs and led to normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining 7aaRGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, with an increase in the number of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depletion of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, reflecting the restored “hot” inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. Intratumoral administration of 7aaRGD similarly modified the phenotypes of GAMs in human U87-MG gliomas in immunocompromised mice. Exploration of transcriptomic datasets revealed that high expression of integrin receptor coding genes in pre-treatment biopsies was associated with a poorer response to immune check-point blockade in patients with several types of cancers. Conclusions We demonstrate that combining the blockade of SPP1/integrin signaling with ICIs modifies innate immunity and reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses, which paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.

        <tr id="Background Early administration of IL-6R blockade is effective in adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD), but the underlying immune alterations during combined immunotherapy remain unclear. Methods We employed high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry and an unbiased bioinformatics pipeline to characterize the immune landscape in treatment-naïve AOSD patients, stable AOSD patients after 24 weeks of IL-6R blockade plus methotrexate and prednisone, and matched healthy controls. Cytokine profiling was conducted using a high-throughput cytometric bead array, and potential regulatory networks were identified using the PerformanceAnalytics package. Validation was performed via flow cytometry and mRNA sequencing. Results We identified 22 peripheral immune cell populations and characterized their composition and phenotypic markers. Treatment-naïve AOSD patients exhibited significant depletion of CD4+ T cells and B cells, along with excessive activation of CD8+ T cells and a previously unreported CD45+CD3−CD19−CD10−CD66a+ population, findings that were validated in an independent AOSD cohort. mRNA sequencing revealed the proinflammatory role of CD8+ T cells. Notably, these dysregulated immune profiles were markedly restored following immunotherapy. IL-18, IL-21, and IFN-γ demonstrated strong associations with adaptive immune cells and AOSD clinical indices. Conclusions Combined IL-6R blockade effectively modulates immune dysregulation in refractory AOSD, reversing key pathological immune alterations and highlighting its therapeutic potential.

Numerous observational and immunological studies in newborns have shown that live attenuated vaccines have beneficial, non-specific effects (NSEs) against secondary infections to unrelated pathogens. These beneficial effects have been attributed to trained immunity, and emergency granulopoiesis plays an essential role. However, trained immunity has been shown to affect multiple myeloid subsets and how trained immunity influences the host protective response is still undefined. Here we show that Bacillus-Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination improves survival to polymicrobial sepsis by simultaneously reprogramming broad aspects of myelopoiesis. Specifically, BCG vaccination expands multiple myeloid subsets, including the lineage (Lin)−Sca- 1+c-kit+ (LSK) and granulocytic-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and increases CD11b+Gr1+ cell number, as well as their oxidative metabolism and capacity to stimulate T-cell proliferation in response to sepsis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of neonatal splenocytes suggests that BCG-vaccination changes the broad transcriptional landscape of multiple myeloid subsets. The result is the maturation of various neutrophil and monocyte subsets, stimulation of antimicrobial processes, and suppression of inflammatory pathways and myeloid-derived suppressor cell transcription. These findings reveal that BCG administration early after birth fundamentally reorganizes the myeloid landscape to benefit the subsequent response to polymicrobial infection.

        <tr id="Background Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), as key immune components of the TME, play a pivotal role in tumor progression by fostering an immunosuppressive environment. Programmed death 1 (PD-1), a critical immune checkpoint molecule predominantly expressed on T cells, mediates immune suppression by binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Emerging evidence reveals that TAMs also express PD-1, however, the expression and functional regulatory mechanisms of PD-1 on TAM remain poorly understood. Methods In this study, we combined bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to investigate the association between PD-1 expression on macrophages and patient prognosis, while also uncovering the molecular mechanisms by which PD-1 regulates macrophage function. To further investigate the role of PD-1 in macrophage activity, we established a fluorescence-labeled tumor-bearing mouse model using CT26 cells, a murine colorectal cancer cell line, to evaluate the relationship between PD-1 expression on TAMs and their phagocytic activity as well as other functions. Additionally, to mimic the TME in vitro, we cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with CT26-conditioned medium (CT26-CM). Results Our results suggest that PD-1 expression on TAMs drives macrophage polarization toward an M2-like phenotype, suppresses their phagocytic activity, inhibits the synthesis of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling molecules, and ultimately promotes tumor progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PD-1 regulates the synthesis of IFN-γ signaling molecules and the polarization of M2-type macrophages in BMDMs through the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Overall, our study demonstrates that PD-1 expression on TAMs facilitates the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, ultimately accelerating tumor progression.

 Background:
 By forming an immunological synapse between T cells and tumor antigen, bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) like blinatumomab have shown great promise in treating B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, many relapsed and refractory (R/R) patients fail to achieve long-term survival, with 40% not surviving past 24 months. Prolonged T cell activation with blinatumomab therapy may lead to changes in differentiation that leave the T cell population unable to elicit a sustained anti-tumor response. A deeper understanding of the dynamics of the T cell compartment in R/R B-ALL patients will lead to improved treatment strategies and optimized patient selection for blinatumomab therapy.
 Methods:
 To characterize T cell persistence and response in this context, we assessed memory and exhaustion phenotypes in blinatumomab-treated T cells isolated from 10 R/R pediatric B-ALL patients treated with blinatumomab. CD8+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples and analyzed for memory and exhaustion phenotypes via flow cytometry. Absolute lymphocyte counts were measured and linked to the sample flow cytometry data to assess expansion and contraction of T cell memory subsets throughout the course of therapy. Whole genome enzymatic methyl sequencing was performed on post-treatment PD-1 High and PD-1 Low CD8 T cells to determine the multipotency of the patient T cell compartment after blinatumomab treatment.
 Results:
 After 7 days of continued blinatumomab infusion, patient T cells demonstrated a significant expansion of terminally differentiated and effector memory T cells. Notably, we observed that non-responders had a high tumor burden at the start of the therapy and possessed a large population of naïve CD8 T cells that failed to expand. These CD8 T cells exhibited a significant increase in expression of TIM-3 and PD-1 compared to responders after the 7-day infusion. Methylation analysis of post-treatment CD8 T cells showed decreased methylation of exhaustion regulators IKZF1 and CD300a in non-responders compared to the responders. Additionally,
 in vitro
 treatment of T cells with blinatumomab induced T-cell exhaustion in a target-dependent manner.
 Conclusions:
 Blinatumomab therapy in pediatric B-ALL patients induced variable epigenetic and phenotypic changes to the T cell compartment indicative of exhaustion, corresponding to differences in T cell expansion and persistence between patients. Our study is the first to link epigenetic changes in exhaustion regulators with response variability in blinatumomab-treated patients. Furthermore, our findings highlight a potential role of baseline T cell composition and tumor burden in determining therapeutic outcomes. These insights provide a novel framework for improving patient stratification and treatment strategies to mitigate T cell exhaustion in blinatumomab therapy.

        <tr id="Various inhibitors targeting T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing molecule 3 (TIM3) aimed at reversing T-cell exhaustion for better immunotherapy outcomes have demonstrated limited clinical efficacy as monotherapy, with the underlying mechanisms remaining ambiguous. TIM3 is markedly expressed in dendritic cells (DCs), and the inconsistent research findings on its role in myeloid cells underscore its vital function within DCs. Through the establishment of an in vitro differentiation model generating mature dendritic cells (mDCs) under TIM3-targeted interventions, combined with an RNA sequencing analysis, this investigation systematically examined TIM3-mediated regulation and ligand interactions in human primary DCs. The findings indicate that TIM3 inhibition hinders DC maturation, which subsequently diminishes the antigen-presenting capacity of DCs, ultimately leading to immune suppression in T cells. These findings collectively establish TIM3 as a regulator of DC differentiation that promotes DC maturation while optimizing the antigen-processing and presentation capacity. This study elucidates the rationale behind the suboptimal efficacy of TIM3 inhibitors and advocates for retaining TIM3 signaling pathways in DCs.">

        <tr id="Patients with peritoneal metastasized colorectal cancer (PM-CRC) have a dismal prognosis. We hypothesized that an immunosuppressive environment in the peritoneal cavity underlies poor prognosis. We define the composition of the human peritoneal immune system (PerIS) using single-cell technologies in 18 patients with- and without PM-CRC, as well as in matched peritoneal metastases (n = 8). Here we show that the PerIS contains abundant immunosuppressive C1Q+VSIG4+ and SPP1+VSIG4+ peritoneal-resident macrophages (PRMs), as well as monocyte-like cavity macrophages (mono-CMs), which share features with tumor-associated macrophages, even in homeostasis. In PM-CRC, expression of immunosuppressive cytokines IL10 and VEGF increases, while simultaneously expression of antigen-presenting molecules decreases in PRMs. These intratumoral suppressive PRMs originate from the PerIS, and intraperitoneal depletion of PRMs in vivo using anti-CSF1R combined with anti-PD1 significantly reduces tumor burden and improves survival. Thus, PRMs define a metastatic site-specific immunosuppressive niche, and targeting PRMs is a promising treatment strategy for PM-CRC.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and, despite treatment advances, immune suppression remains an obstacle to effective therapy. Effector CD4+ T cells (CD4+ Teffs) are critical for antitumor immunity, but their function is often inhibited by regulatory T cells (Tregs), which accumulate in lung tumors and perform suppressive functions through multiple mechanisms. This suppression leads to tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated suppression are not fully understood. Here, we identify the extracellular ATP receptor P2RX7 as a key regulator of Treg function in lung tumors. Using a murine lung cancer model induced by Lewis lung carcinoma cells, we demonstrate that P2RX7 enhances the suppressive capacity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, promoting tumor growth. In T cell-specific P2RX7-KO mice, reduced Treg infiltration was accompanied by increased CD4+ Teff accumulation and improved tumor control. Treg-specific P2RX7-KO mice exhibit reduced tumor growth, confirming a cell-intrinsic role of P2RX7 in Tregs. Suppression assays revealed that tumor-infiltrating WT Tregs have greater suppressive activity compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs, which failed to inhibit type 1 and Tfh-like responses. This was associated with increased tumor-specific IgG production by lung B cells in P2RX7-KO mice. We also observed that WT Tregs express higher levels of the immunosuppressive surface molecule CTLA-4 when compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs. In summary, we show that P2RX7 expression on Tregs is essential for their suppressive function in lung cancer, and targeting of P2RX7 may constitute a novel strategy to improve lung cancer treatment by alleviating Treg-mediated immune suppression.">

        <tr id="First-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combinations show responses in subsets of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Nearly half of HCCs are Wnt-active with mutations in CTNNB1 (encoding for β-catenin), AXIN1/2, or APC, and demonstrate heterogeneous and limited benefit to ICI due to an immune excluded tumor microenvironment. We show significant tumor responses in multiple β-catenin-mutated immunocompetent HCC models to a novel siRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle targeting CTNNB1 (LNP-CTNNB1). Both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal cellular and zonal reprogramming, along with activation of immune regulatory transcription factors IRF2 and POU2F1, re-engaged type I/II interferon signaling, and alterations in both innate and adaptive immunity upon β-catenin suppression with LNP-CTNNB1 at early- and advanced-stage disease. Moreover, ICI enhances response to LNP-CTNNB1 in advanced-stage disease by preventing T cell exhaustion and through formation of lymphoid aggregates (LA). In fact, expression of an LA-like gene signature prognosticates survival for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in the IMbrave150 phase III trial and inversely correlates with CTNNB1-mutatational status in this patient cohort. In conclusion, LNP-CTNNB1 is efficacious as monotherapy and in combination with ICI in CTNNB1-mutated HCCs through impacting tumor cell-intrinsic signaling and remodeling global immune surveillance, providing rationale for clinical investigations.">

Here, we discovered that CD39 was highly expressed in exhausted CD8 + T cells from 10 CC patients in our center via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Furthermore, we validated that CC patients with CD39 highly expressed in CD8 + T cells associated with poor prognosis and immunoevasive subtype of CC both in cohort from our center and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Moreover, it was also confirmed that CD39-inhibiting not only enhanced the cytotoxicity of CD8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) but also promoted the infiltration of B cells through increasing CXCL13 secretion both in vitro experiments and subcutaneous tumor models, thereby amplifying anti-tumor immunity of PD-1 blockade.

Method The macrophage therapy was prepared from bone marrow-derived macrophages, pretreated ex vivo with an activation cocktail containing interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, and anti-CD40 antibody. The therapy was administered to tumor-bearing mice via the tail vein. Tumor growth and survival of the treated mice were monitored to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Tumors and spleens were processed to examine immune responses and underlying mechanisms. Results This immunotherapy platform elicits systemic immune responses while infiltrating the tumor to exert direct antitumor effects in support of the systemic adaptive response. The macrophage-based immunotherapy produced a strong CD8+T cell response along with robust natural killer and CD4+T cell activation, inducing a “hot” tumor transition and achieving effective tumor suppression. Conclusions Owing to their inherent ability to home to and infiltrate inflamed tissues, macrophage-based cancer immunotherapies exhibited a unique in vivo trafficking behavior, efficiently reaching and persisting within tumors. Macrophages orchestrated a multiarmed immune attack led by CD8+T cells, with the potential for local, intratumoral activation of effector cells, demonstrating a novel cancer immunotherapy platform with meaningfully different characteristics than clinically evaluated alternatives.">

Rapamycin, a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is known to modulate adaptive and innate immunity, while the full spectrum of its immunosuppressive mechanisms remains incompletely understood. Given the broad expression of mTOR, we investigated the understudied effects of rapamycin on lymph node (LN) architecture, leukocyte trafficking, and the gut microbiome and metabolism after 3, 7, and 30 days of rapamycin treatment, to characterize the early, intermediate, and late changes. Rapamycin significantly reduced CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T (Treg) cells in peripheral LNs, mesenteric LNs, and the spleen over time. Rapamycin induced early pro-inflammation transition to pro-tolerogenic status, by modulating the LN laminin α4:α5 expression ratios through LN stromal cells laminin α5 expression and by adjusting Treg numbers and distribution. Additionally, rapamycin significantly altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic functions, shifting the Bacteroides to Firmicutes ratio and increasing amino acid bioavailability in the gut lumen. These effects were evident by 7 days and became most pronounced by 30 days in naïve mice, with notable changes as early as 3 days in allogeneic splenocyte-stimulated mice.

With the hypothesis that CD8+ tissue resident memory T cell (TRM) phenotypes might be more competent at controlling tissue viral recrudescence, we examined their capacity to control HIV after reactivation and the benefit of inducing TRM-like phenotypes through cytokine stimulation from blood. CD8+TRM derived from cervical tissue were more efficient at eliminating reactivated HIV-infected CD4+T cells compared to circulating effector CD8+T cells. Expansion of CD8+TRM-like phenotypes from blood through IL-15/TGF-β1 stimulation recovered functional HIV-specific CD8+T cells displaying residency features, increased clonotypic diversity and mitochondrial function, and were the most efficient phenotypes at eliminating intact viruses after reactivation. Altogether, we provide a relevant therapeutic strategy to enhance elimination of persistent antigens like HIV by generating functional CD8+TRM-like phenotypes.">

        <tr id="Managing immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by cancer immunotherapy is essential for developing effective and safer therapies. However, cellular mechanism(s) underlying organ toxicity during anti–PD-(L)1 therapy remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of chronological aging on anti–PD-(L)1 therapy–induced irAE-like lung toxicity, utilizing tumor-bearing aged mice. Anti–PD-(L)1 therapy facilitated ectopic infiltration of T and B cells, and antibody deposition in lungs of aged but not young mice. Adoptive transfer of aged lung–derived CD4+ T cells into TCR-deficient mice revealed that both pathogenic CD4+ T cells and an aged host environment were necessary for the irAE-inducible responses. Single-cell transcriptomics of lung-infiltrating cells in aged mice demonstrated that anti–PD-(L)1 therapy elicited ICOS+CD4+ T cell activation. Disruption of the ICOS-ICOSL interaction attenuated germinal center B cell differentiation and subsequent lung damage, which were overcome by local administration of IL-21 in the lungs of anti–PD-1 therapy–treated aged mice. Therefore, ICOS+CD4+ T cells elicited under an aged environment exacerbated aberrant immune responses and the subsequent lung dysfunction. Consistent with the findings from the mouse model, ICOS upregulation in CD4+ T cells was associated with later irAE incidence in patients with cancer. These finding will help development of useful strategies for irAE management in patients with cancer, many of whom are elderly.">

        <tr id="While checkpoint immunotherapy effectively mobilizes T‐cell responses against tumors, its success in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently undermined by immunosuppressive myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment. This study investigates the role of nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1), a gene prominently expressed in tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs), in mediating this suppression and influencing immunotherapy outcomes. Through comprehensive analysis of single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) datasets and functional assays in vitro and in vivo, NUPR1 is identified as a critical regulator within TAMs. The upregulation of NUPR1 is associated with enhanced M2 macrophage polarization and increased expression of immune checkpoints PD‐L1 and SIRPA, resulting in CD8+ T cell exhaustion and a diminished response to immunotherapy. Mechanistically, NUPR1 inhibits the ERK and JNK signaling pathways, thereby creating an immunosuppressive milieu conducive to tumor progression. Additionally, tumor‐derived lactate is shown to upregulate NUPR1 expression in macrophages via histone lactylation, perpetuating a feedback loop that intensifies immune suppression. Pharmacological targeting of NUPR1 reverses M2 polarization, curtails tumor growth, and augments the efficacy of PD‐1 blockade in preclinical models, positioning NUPR1 as both a potential biomarker for immunotherapy responsiveness and a therapeutic target to boost immunotherapy efficacy in HCC.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in immuno-oncology research have revolutionised our understanding of the interplay between immune cells and the tumour microenvironment (TME), profoundly impacting patient responses to therapy. The TME, comprising tumour cells, immune cells, extracellular matrix, stromal cells, and co-existing microbes, orchestrates the immune phenotype of cancers, shaping disease progression and treatment outcomes. Immune-cell infiltration serves as a significant prognostic marker in various cancers, with higher rates correlating with improved prognosis. Recent discoveries have paved the way for immune checkpoint blockade therapies, which exhibit remarkable efficacy across multiple cancer types. However, understanding the nuanced contributions of different immune-cell populations to therapeutic responses remains a challenge. The majority of research has focussed on the role of T cells in the immune response to cancer therapies, with the potential importance of B cells only recently being recognised. Here, we review the diverse phenotypes of B cells within the TME, their structural organisation within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and the role of both B cells and TLS in cancer prognosis and response to different therapies for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) are versatile professional antigen-presenting cells and play an instrumental role in the generation of antigen-specific T-cell responses. Modulation of DC function holds promise as an effective strategy to improve anti-tumor immunotherapy efficacy and enhance self-antigen tolerance in autoimmune diseases. Methods Wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (KO) mice at 2 weeks of age were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to induce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Four weeks later, WT and KO mice were randomly divided into control and treatment groups and treated once every two days for 30 weeks with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and a mix of 4 TLR2-activating lactic acid-producing probiotics (LAP), respectively. Mice were euthanized after 30 weeks of LAP treatment and their liver tissues were collected for gene expression, histological, flow cytometric and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Results We demonstrate here that oral administration of a mix of TLR2-activating LAP triggers a marked accumulation of regulatory DCs (rDCs) in the liver of mice. LAP-treated mice are protected from DEN-induced liver injury, fibrosis and HCC in a TLR2-dependent manner. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that LAP treatment determines an immunosuppressive hepatic T-cell program that is characterized by a significantly reduced cytotoxic activity. The observed functional changes of T cells correlated well with the presence of a hepatic DC subset displaying a regulatory or tolerogenic transcriptional signature. Conclusion Overall, these data suggest that stimulation of regulatory dendritic cells (rDCs) in the liver by LAP suppresses cytotoxic T-cell function and alleviates DEN-induced liver damage, fibrosis and tumorigenesis.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a malignant hematologic disorder with limited curative options, primarily reliant on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Anemia, a prevalent symptom of MDS, has few effective treatment strategies. Realgar, though known for its therapeutic effects on MDS, remains poorly understood in terms of its mechanism of action. In this study, both in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted using Realgar and its primary active component, As2S2, to examine their impact on mouse erythroblasts at the single-cell level. Realgar treatment significantly altered the transcriptional profiles and cellular composition of bone marrow in mice, both in vivo and in vitro. Differentially expressed genes in erythroblasts regulated by Realgar were identified, unveiling potential regulatory functions and signaling pathways, such as heme biosynthesis, hemoglobin production, oxygen binding, IL-17 signaling, and MAPK pathways. These findings suggest that Realgar enhances the differentiation of erythroblasts in mouse bone marrow and improves overall blood cell counts. This work offers preliminary insights into Realgar’s mechanisms, expands the understanding of this mineral medicine, and may inform strategies to optimize its therapeutic potential in hematologic diseases.

As a major cell component in the tumor, the metabolic reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study found that sphingolipid (particularly, sphingosine-1-phosphate or S1P) levels are a clinical indicator for prognosis and immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. S1P primarily derived from TAMs, where NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) plays a key role in controlling the activity of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in S1P biosynthesis. The S1P produced by NEK2hi TAMs promotes hepatic tumor progression and confers immunotherapy resistance. Targeting S1P synthesis with a NEK2 inhibitor or S1P antagonist disrupted the immunosuppressive function of macrophages, shifted regulatory T cells (Tregs) to TH17 cells, and increased the number and activity of tumor-infiltrating T effectors, thereby enhancing antitumor efficacy in synergy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.">

        <tr id="Previous studies have demonstrated the significant impact of NK cells on adaptive immune responses against chlamydial infections through modulating DCs, yet the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the role of NK cells in modulating DC signaling pathways and the recruitment of DCs during Chlamydia muridarum infection. Transcriptomic analyses revealed significant downregulation of key genes in DCs from NK-depleted mice involved in type I immunity, including IL12rb2, IL-18rap, and chemokine signaling components such as Ccl3, Ccl5, and Ccr5. Gene ontology (GO) analyses confirmed impaired chemokine–chemokine receptor interactions in DCs from NK-depleted mice. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis showed that NK-cell depletion reduced CCR5 expression on splenic and pulmonary DCs, impairing their migration toward CCL3 and CCL5. Furthermore, IFN-γ enhanced CCR5 expression on the surface of DCs, consequently promoting their migration, which was blocked by anti-IFN-γ antibodies. In vitro migration assays showed that treatment of DCs with IFN-γ increased their responsiveness to CCL3 and CCL5, the ligands of CCR5. Collectively, this study provides new insights into the indispensable role of NK cells in orchestrating DC signaling and the recruitment of DCs during chlamydial infection.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Cellular senescence within the TME, characterized by irreversible growth arrest and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), profoundly impacts tumor biology and immunotherapy efficacy. The senescent TME promotes tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis through complex interactions between senescent cells, SASP factors, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Simultaneously, senescence-induced alterations in immune cell function, including T cell exhaustion, macrophage polarization, and impaired natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, contribute to an immunosuppressive niche that hinders immunosurveillance and fosters tumor immune evasion. Mounting evidence suggests that the senescent TME is a critical mediator of resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Senescence-associated changes in the TME dampen antitumor immunity by reducing CD8+ T cell infiltration and functionality while promoting the accumulation of immunosuppressive cell populations such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Consequently, strategies targeting the senescent TME have emerged as promising approaches to enhance ICI efficacy. Senolytic agents, SASP inhibitors, and combinatorial therapies aimed at eliminating senescent cells, modulating SASP, and reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME have shown potential in preclinical models to sensitize tumors to immunotherapy. As our understanding of the senescent TME evolves, it is becoming increasingly clear that a multifaceted approach integrating TME-targeted interventions with immunotherapy is necessary to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying senescence-driven immunotherapy resistance, identifying robust biomarkers to predict treatment response, and developing novel therapeutic strategies that synergize with ICIs. By harnessing the potential of TME-targeted approaches, we can expand the scope and efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, ultimately leading to improved survival and quality of life for cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Asthma, a chronic airway disease, is marked by allergic inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and tissue remodeling. Influenza infections in asthma patients can cause severe exacerbations, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated how pre-existing allergic inflammation affects immune responses to influenza infection in mice exposed to house dust mite (HDM). Mice were repeatedly exposed to HDM, followed by infection with the influenza A virus, and were sacrificed three days post-infection. Plasma was analyzed for HDM-specific immunoglobulins, while lung tissue was used for immune cell flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analysis. HDM exposure induced allergic inflammation, evidenced by more HDM-specific IgE, IgG1, IgG2, eosinophils, neutrophils, Th1, and Th17 cells compared to controls. Upon influenza infection, the effects of HDM and influenza co-infection interacted, showing fewer Th1 cells and regulatory T cells and more Th2 cells compared to mice exposed to the influenza virus alone. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis revealed less upregulation of Th1-related genes and antiviral pathways in co-exposed mice, suggesting impaired Th1 immunity and antiviral responses. Pre-existing allergic inflammation significantly altered immune responses in mice co-infected with influenza, revealing underdeveloped antiviral responses as early as three days post-infection. These findings may explain the increased susceptibility of patients with asthma to severe viral diseases.">

 Multiple Myeloma (MM), a hematological malignancy, is characterized by the clonal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM), which serves as the tumor microenvironment. Despite recent advancements in MM treatment, many patients experience disease progression after multiple therapies. Daratumumab, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, has emerged as a breakthrough in the treatment of MM, including in cases of relapsed and refractory MM. However, MM remains incurable and therefore understanding the impact of daratumumab on immune microenvironment may enable the development of better-targeted therapies. This study represents a detailed case of a 45-year-old female with relapsed refractory MM undergoing daratumumab therapy. BM aspirates were collected from the patient before treatment initiation & 7-days post final infusion. To delineate the early cellular and molecular changes induced by daratumumab within the TME, we employed flow cytometry and single-cell whole transcriptome sequencing with CITE-seq. Flow cytometry was used to assess the changes in cell populations within the TME, particularly focusing on CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing enabled the high-resolution analysis of both transcriptomic and surface protein changes within individual cells. Post-infusion, we observed an increased percentage in CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cell subsets accompanied by a corresponding decrease in effector memory expressing CD45-RA (TEMRA). Single-cell sequencing identified heightened activity in the interferon and TNF pathways. Additionally, there was an increased percentage of granzyme B expressing CD8+ T cells. Although we observed no significant change in the percentage of NK cells post-infusion, we did note an increased percentage of CD56BrightCD16- NK and CD3+CD8+CD56+ NK-T-like subsets as well as decreased CD57+ terminally differentiated NK cells. We observed increased transcript expression of CD160 (encoding the activating receptor CD160/NK1) in the post-daratumumab NK cell cluster. Further, we noted increased activity in the NFκB pathway in post-treatment NK cells. This case study underscores daratumumab’s rapid impact on the immune cell landscape within the BM TME. By combining flow cytometry with single-cell whole transcriptome sequencing and CITE-seq this study provided a comprehensive view of the effect of therapy on the MM TME. Through CITE-seq, we identified the dynamic changes in the BM immune cell landscape and captured protein expression patterns specific to targeted cell populations. This approach allowed us to link surface marker expression with gene expression profiles, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the BM TME. For Research-Use Only.

        <tr id="Despite significant advances in cancer biology research and treatment, clinical outcomes for patients with liver cancer remain unsatisfactory. The biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the bidirectional signaling between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes tumor progression in the liver, remain to be elucidated. Fibroblasts are crucial regulators of tumor progression and response to therapy; however, our understanding of their roles remains limited. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data of pan-liver cancers to characterize the different subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). siRNA transfection was used for knockdown the expression of LAMA4. Western blot assay was used for gene expression analysis. Flow cytometry was used to detect proliferation, toxicity and cytolytic capacity of CD8+ T cells. To establish a spontaneous murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model, a combined DEN and CCL4 approach was performed. Notably, we identified CD90+ extracellular matrix CAFs (eCAFs) associated with poor prognosis. These CD90+ eCAFs, located distal to the tumor nest, overlapped with the distribution of CD8+ T cells. Functional experiments demonstrated that CD90+ eCAFs recruited CD8+ T cells and inhibited their function through secretion of LAMA4. Further investigation revealed that LAMA4 induced the CD8+ T cell senescence through a DNA damage signaling pathway mediated by the receptor ITGA6. In a mouse model of spontaneous HCC, targeting LAMA4 can inhibit the progression of malignant transformation and synergize with anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study reveals the function of specific CAFs subtypes and highlights the importance of interactions with the immune system.

        <tr id="Recombinant interferon alpha (IFNα) has been used to treat cancer patients for over 30 years; however, its clinical utility has been limited by a narrow therapeutic index. Given the recognized anti-tumor and immunomodulatory impacts of IFNα, the development of novel strategies to harness these attributes while minimizing associated toxicity could provide significant benefit for patients. The concept of attenuating IFNα binding affinity for its receptor was conceived to address this challenge and led to the development of CD38-targeted Attenukine™, a CD38-targeted antibody attenuated IFNα immunocytokine. In this study, we sought to delineate the effects of targeting AttenukineTM specifically to tumor cells and/or immune cells using an antibody to CD38, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on certain tumor and immune cells, using different mouse models and anti-human or anti-mouse CD38-targeted Attenukine™. Our results demonstrate that an anti-human CD38 AttenukineTM inhibits tumor growth through direct anti-proliferative effects of IFNα on CD38 + tumor cells as well as by indirectly modulating the anti-tumor immune response. In various in vivo models leveraging syngeneic mice bearing tumors with or without CD38 expression, administration of CD38-murine AttenukineTM mediated anti-tumor efficacy with increased immune activation and intra-tumoral infiltration. These data point to a potential dual mechanism of action for CD38-targeted Attenukine™, involving both tumor- and immune-directed effects, and highlight the potential benefit of a CD38-targeted attenuated IFNα therapy to deliver the known effects of IFNαtreatment to a broad spectrum of patients, while limiting the toxicity typically associated with recombinant IFNα.">

        <tr id="Background Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a severe complication in lung cancer, characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and limited therapeutic options. This study investigates the role of IL-6 in regulating immune suppression and tumor progression in MPE and evaluates the efficacy of dual IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade. Methods IL-6 levels were measured in MPE and paired serum samples from lung cancer patients, and correlations with PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes were analyzed using publicly available datasets. RNA sequencing and immune deconvolution were used to assess immune cell infiltration. CAFs and immune cell infiltration were further evaluated using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and multiplex immunofluorescence. In vitro co-culture systems were employed to simulate the MPE microenvironment and explore IL-6 interactions with CAFs, as well as its regulatory effect on tumor cell PD-L1 expression. Results IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in MPE compared to paired serum and correlated with higher PD-L1 expression and poor survival outcomes in lung cancer patients. In the MPE mouse model, combination therapy with IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade reduced MPE volume, tumor burden, and PD-L1 expression, while enhancing T cell infiltration and alleviating TME immunosuppression. IL-6 was found to drive a positive feedback loop with iCAFs, promoting an immunosuppressive environment. In vitro, IL-6 from the MPE upregulated tumor cell PD-L1 expression the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Conclusion This study identifies IL-6 as a critical contributor of immune suppression and tumor progression in MPE. The combination of IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade effectively alleviated immunosuppression and reduced tumor burden, offering a potential therapeutic approach for MPE management.

        <tr id="Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents a formidable challenge in oncology due to its molecular heterogeneity and the dynamic suppressive nature of its tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite the transformative impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) on cancer therapy, the majority of NSCLC patients experience resistance, necessitating novel approaches to overcome immune evasion. This review highlights shared and subtype-specific mechanisms of immune resistance within the TME, including metabolic reprogramming, immune cell dysfunction, and physical barriers. Beyond well-characterized components such as regulatory T cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, emerging players - neutrophil extracellular traps, tertiary lymphoid structures, and exosomal signaling networks - underscore the TME’s complexity and adaptability. A multi-dimensional framework is proposed to transform cold, immune-excluded tumors into hot, immune-reactive ones. Key strategies include enhancing immune infiltration, modulating immunosuppressive networks, and activating dormant immune pathways. Cutting-edge technologies, such as single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and nanomedicine, are identified as pivotal tools for decoding TME heterogeneity and personalizing therapeutic interventions. By bridging mechanistic insights with translational innovations, this review advocates for integrative approaches that combine ICIs with metabolic modulators, vascular normalizers, and emerging therapies such as STING agonists and tumor vaccines. The synergistic potential of these strategies is poised to overcome resistance and achieve durable antitumor immunity. Ultimately, this vision underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and real-time TME profiling in refining precision oncology for NSCLC, offering a blueprint for extending these advances to other malignancies.">

It highlights the dual roles of key immunocytes—including T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells—which can either inhibit or support tumor progression based on their phenotypic polarization and local metabolic conditions. The article further elucidates mechanisms of immune cell plasticity, such as the M1/M2 macrophage switch and the balance between effector T cells and regulatory T cells, underscoring their impact on tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, emerging therapeutic strategies, including checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and NK cell therapies, as well as approaches targeting metabolic pathways, are discussed as promising avenues to reinvigorate antitumor immunity.

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review highlights the role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options. TAMs, which constitute a substantial portion of the TME, exhibit high phenotypic plasticity and dynamically shift between pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive states. GBM exploits this plasticity to drive tumor growth by inducing TAM polarization toward the immunosuppressive phenotype through mechanisms involving cytokine secretion, immune checkpoint pathways, and metabolic interactions. This polarization contributes to immune evasion, tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs include depletion, reprogramming toward the pro-inflammatory phenotype, and inhibiting pro-tumor signals. Several approaches are under investigation, such as blocking CSF-1R, disrupting CCL2/CCR2 and PI3K pathways, targeting PD-L1 expression, and utilizing nanoparticle-based delivery systems for selective TAM modulation. Further research targeting TAM plasticity and polarization is essential for developing treatments that overcome GBM’s robust immunosuppressive TME and improve patient survival.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity serves as a de facto memory for innate immune responses, resulting in long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. It enhances resistance to pathogens and augments immunosurveillance under physiological conditions. Given that innate immune cells typically have a short lifespan and do not divide, persistent innate immune memory may be mediated by epigenetic and metabolic changes in long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. HSCs fine-tune their state and fate in various training conditions, thereby generating functionally adapted progeny cells that orchestrate innate immune plasticity. Notably, both beneficial and maladaptive trained immunity processes can comprehensively influence HSC state and fate, leading to divergent hematopoiesis and immune outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize recent advances regarding HSC state and fate in the context of trained immunity. By elucidating the stem cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory network, we aim to refine current models of innate immune memory and provide actionable insights for developing targeted therapies against infectious diseases and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for engineering precision-trained immunity through HSC-targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Individuals with underlying chronic inflammatory conditions are prone to increased morbidity when posed with an additional inflammatory challenge such as an injury or infection, but why this occurs remains unclear. Herein, we address this question in mouse models by demonstrating that chronic inflammation results in a pronounced expansion of circulating immature neutrophils that exhibit dysregulated effector functions as determined by single cell RNA sequencing and ex vivo functional assays. We show that these immature neutrophils are associated with and contribute to increased immunopathology in response to a new inflammatory challenge. Blocking the migration or function of these immature neutrophils through the administration of therapeutic antibodies or small molecules, profoundly lowers the immunopathology caused by the inflammatory challenge. Together, these studies establish a causal link between immature neutrophils and increased immunopathology, while also providing insights into new therapeutic strategies for treating individuals with chronic inflammatory ailments.">

        <tr id="Introduction: In mouse models of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an effective anti-leukemia immune response was obtained by depleting a specific regulatory T-cell (Treg) subset. While STAT5 signaling could alter the homeostasis of naïve (nTreg) and activated (aTreg) subsets, which are capable of suppressing also CLL patients’ responses to microbial antigens, perturbed STAT3 signaling could drive CXCR5 expression in circulating T-follicular regulatory cells (Tfr) and their entry into the lymph node/tumor microenvironment. Materials and Methods: By using phospho-specific flow cytometry, we monitored STAT signaling/phosphorylation (pSTAT), in vitro responses to Sars-Cov2-antigen-specific stimulation, and circulating Treg subsets in relation to Binet stage and total tumor mass/tumor distribution (TTM/TD) scoring in 62 patients with CLL. Results: The percentage of CXCR5+ Treg significantly increased in patients with Binet stage B disease, and Tfr-like subsets were associated with higher TTM and lower TD. The pSTAT3 levels in CD4+ T-cells were only significantly increased in patients undergoing therapy. Lower nTreg percentages correlated with increased disease duration, and an increased aTreg/nTreg ratio correlated with SARS-CoV-2-antigen-induced STAT5 signaling responses. Conclusions: The results show increased amounts of circulating CXCR5+ Tfr-like subsets in patients with extensive lymph node involvement and augmented STAT3 signaling in patients on therapy. While STAT5 responses may drive nTreg differentiation into aTreg, nTreg decline is associated with increased disease duration.">

        <tr id="The prevalence of acute lower respiratory infections in individuals with iron deficiency (ID) has significantly increased, and is correlated with reduced numbers of immune cells and impaired immune function. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in combating the influenza A virus (IAV) by initiating adaptive immune responses. However, the impact of ID on DCs and their response to IAV infection remain unclear. This study showed that ID impairs the antigen‐presenting ability of DCs, thereby hindering their capacity to mediate T‐cell proliferation and clear viruses. The restrictive effects of ID on DCs begin in the bone marrow and specifically affect the monocyte DC progenitor (MDP) stage. A reduction in the number of MDPs and compromised immune potential lead to a decrease in the population and functionality of DCs in the subsequent common DC precursor (CDP) stage in the blood, spleen, and lungs. This study highlights the previously unrecognized impact of ID on DCs and provides valuable insights into immune cell responses and the application of iron supplementation in the fight against viral infections.">

We collected and quantitatively profiled the intratumoral mycobiome data from 1044 patients with RCC across four international cohorts, of which 466 patients received immunotherapy. Patients were stratified into mycobiota ecology-depauperate and mycobiota ecology-flourishing (MEF) groups based on fungal abundance. The MEF group had worse prognosis, higher fungal diversity, down-regulated lipid catabolism, and exhausted CD8+ T cells. We developed the intratumoral mycobiota signature and intratumoral mycobiota-related genes expression signature, which robustly predicted prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes in RCC and other cancers. Aspergillus tanneri was identified as a potential key fungal species influencing RCC prognosis.

        <tr id="Background Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. Tumor-secreted proteins foster an immunosuppressive environment, enabling immune evasion and reducing the effectiveness of antitumor immunity. Interleukin (IL)-10, an immune-regulatory cytokine, is upregulated in breast cancer (BRCA), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methods In silico analysis was used to identify candidate genes associated with IL-10 expression. Mouse model of BRCA and in vitro co-culture assays were conducted to identify immune cells responsible for IL-10 upregulation. The efficacy of galectin-3 (Gal-3) inhibition combined with chemotherapy was also evaluated. Results Tumor-secreted Gal-3 served as a key immunosuppressive factor in BRCA. Gal-3 promoted IL-10 production in B cells, thus impairing antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, Gal-3 triggered CD45 polymerization, reducing its phosphatase activity and subsequently activating STAT3 to promote IL-10 production. Knockdown of STAT3 or its blockade abrogated Gal-3-induced IL-10 upregulation. Furthermore, Gal-3 inhibition combined with chemotherapy significantly reduced tumor growth and enhanced antitumor immunity. Conclusions Gal-3 is a crucial regulator of immune evasion in BRCA. Targeting Gal-3 may improve the efficacy of BRCA therapies.">

        <tr id="One of the earliest steps of breast cancer metastasis occurs when tumor cells (TCs) disseminate through the bloodstream. There, they interact with several blood components. Among them, platelet favor TC survival and metastatic spread. While the binding of platelet to TC is highly variable, its molecular controls and downstream consequences remain unidentified. Here, we first document that high CD24 expression correlates with increased platelet binding and poorer survival in breast cancer. We further demonstrate that CD24-mediated platelet binding regulates TC cluster formation and resistance to anoikis in vitro. Depleting CD24 expression significantly reduces TC metastatic potential by rewiring the metastatic tumor microenvironment (mTME), affecting immune compartments and secreted factors. Overall, our work identifies CD24 as a molecular cue controlling TC-platelet interaction, dictating their metastatic potential. As such, it represents a druggable target to counteract platelet-TC collaboration in metastasis.">

        <tr id="The roles of circulating complement C3, produced in hepatocytes, in immune defense are well defined in the literature. Interestingly, the C3 gene evolved before the circulatory system, suggesting an essential but yet unknown role of locally produced C3. Here, we investigated the effect of C3 on cancer immunotherapy and found that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived C3, not hepatocyte-derived C3, determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Tumors developed in CAF-specific C3 knockout mice exhibited resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, with increased immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, the C3 degradation product iC3b suppressed myeloid cell infiltration via complement receptor 3 signaling, and the therapeutic targeting of this pathway restored ICB sensitivity of immunotherapy-resistant tumors. In human cancers, stromal C3 expression correlates with reduced M2-like macrophage infiltration and improved immunotherapeutic outcomes. These data demonstrate the role of locally produced C3 in the innate immune response, which may have been conserved across many organisms.">

        <tr id="Suppression of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells is common within the tumor microenvironment. However, little is known about how tumors systemically affect the overall CD8+ T cell compartment. Here we demonstrate that peripheral blood CD8+ T cells from patients with lung cancer showed altered compositions particularly within CD45RA−CCR7− effector memory subpopulation. Specifically, patients with lung cancer exhibited increased frequency of more differentiated effector memory cells, which are less susceptible to T cell-receptor-induced proliferation. Further analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that these alterations were correlated with reduced quiescence and increased spontaneous activation at a systemic level, indicative of homeostatic dysregulation of the entire CD8+ T cell population. This phenomenon was found to be correlated with a poor clinical response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy across four independent cohorts, consisting of a total of 224 patients with lung cancer. These findings suggest that lung cancers continue to counteract potentially tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells by inducing homeostatic dysregulation of the entire CD8+ T cell compartment systematically.">

        <tr id="Innate immune memory, also called trained immunity, is a metabolic and epigenetically regulated process that enables innate immune cells to recalibrate their inflammatory reactivity in response to pathogenic or endogenous stimuli. In addition to its function in host defense, trained immunity contributes to diverse immune-mediated diseases.

We found that C1q leads to profound reprogramming of myeloid cell metabolism, particularly glycolysis, and exerts control over the transcriptional regulation of important metabolic and inflammatory genes. We corroborate our findings by identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms close to the C1q gene that are linked to induction of trained immunity by Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) or beta-glucan in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results reveal an immunomodulatory role for C1q and provide evidence of a molecular interaction between the complement system and innate immune memory.

        <tr id="Introduction CD73, a recently discovered immune checkpoint, catalyzes the conversion of AMP to adenosine, thereby suppressing anti-tumor immune responses.CD8+ T cells play a critical role in the immune response against cancer, yet their functionality can be modulated by various factors within the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we focus on identifying and characterizing CD73+CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), aiming to elucidate their functional and phenotypic roles in tumor immunity. Methods Using flow cytometry, we analyzed the expression of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1, TIM-3) and activating markers (e.g., CD25, CD69) on CD73+CD8+ T cells compared to CD73−CD8+ T cells. In vitro functional assays were conducted to assess their cytotoxic activity against tumor cells, including cytokine production and tumor cell killing capacity. Results CD73+CD8+ T cells exhibited a distinct immunophenotypic profile, characterized by reduced expression of inhibitory receptors and enhanced cytotoxic activity compared to their CD73− counterparts. These cells demonstrated higher levels of effector molecules (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) and lower exhausted markers. The findings suggest that CD73+CD8+ T cells may retain stronger anti-tumor potential. Discussion This study highlights CD73+CD8+ T cells as a unique functional subset with potential therapeutic relevance in DLBCL. Their reduced exhaustion and heightened cytotoxicity position them as promising targets for immunotherapy strategies. However, the dual role of CD73 in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression warrants further investigation to reconcile its pro-tumorigenic effects with the observed anti-tumor activity of CD73+CD8+ T cells. Our findings deepen the understanding of CD8+ T cell heterogeneity in DLBCL and emphasize the need for mechanistic studies to explore CD73’s context-dependent functions.">

        <tr id="Although anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cells demonstrate high response rates in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas, a considerable proportion of patients eventually encounter disease progression or relapse. The short-term and long-term outcomes of CAR-T treatment are intricately linked to the tumor microenvironment (TME), wherein macrophages with polarized characteristics can exhibit either anti-tumorigenic or pro-tumorigenic roles. Despite evidence implicating the crucial involvement of macrophages in CAR-T cell-treated lymphoma, their dynamic distribution and immune function related to lymphoma progression remain poorly understood. Immunocompetent mice were utilized to establish syngeneic A20 lymphoma/leukemia models. The distribution and polarization of macrophages were detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry techniques. We observed that CD19 CAR-T therapy exhibited significant efficacy in protecting mice against lymphoma, leading to increased infiltration of macrophages into the tumor tissue. Notably, during remission stages, M1-like macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+C206−CD80+) were predominant, whereas in relapsed mice, there was a shift towards M2-like phenotypes (CD11b+F4/80+C206+CD80+). The transition from remissive to relapsed status was accompanied by a reduction in the M1/M2 ratio and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed differential expression levels of CD206 and CD163 between remissive and relapsed mice, while signaling pathways involving PI3K and STAT3 may contribute to the skewing towards M2 polarization. In summary, our findings highlight the dynamic transformation of macrophage polarization during different stages of lymphoma progression and underscore its potential implications for immunotherapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Background Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis) could regulate inflammatory markers, promote intestinal barrier integrity, and block tumor formation in colon. However, the regulatory effect of P. distasonis on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of P. distasonis on NSCLC and its impact on tumor immunity. Methods We first established a mouse model of Lewis lung cancer, and administered P. distasonis and intrabitoneal injection of anti-mouse PD-1 monoclonal antibody to assess the impact of P. distasonis on tumor immunity, and mouse intestinal barrier. Then, we explored the effect of P. distasonis on CD8+T cells and CXCL9 secretion mediated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). We used the TLR1/2 complex inhibitor CPT22 to evaluate its effect on macrophage activation. Finally, we explored the effect of P. distasonis on CD8+T cells and CXCL9 secreted by TAM in vivo. Results In vivo, P. distasonis enhanced anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-1 in NSCLC mice, improved intestinal barrier integrity, recruited macrophages, and promoted M1 polarization. In vitro, CD86 and iNOS levels in BMDM were elevated and CD206 and Arg1 levels were suppressed in membrane fraction of P. distasonis (PdMb) group in comparison to Control group. With additional CPT22 pre-treatment, the levels of CD86 and iNOS in BMDM were reduced, and the levels of CD206 and Arg1 were increased. Compared to PBS group, P. distasonis group exhibited higher proportion of CD8+T cells in tumor tissues, along with increased positive proportion of GZMB and IFN-γ in CD8+T cells. Additionally, in comparison to Control group, PdMb group showed an elevated proportion of GZMB+T and IFN-γ+T cells within CD8+T cells, and secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin, and GZMB in CD8+T cell supernatant increased. Moreover, the proportion of CXCL9+F4/80+ macrophages in tumor tissues was higher in P. distasonis group compared to PBS group. In comparison to Control group, CXCL9 protein level in BMDM and CXCL9 secretion level in BMDM supernatant were increased in PdMb group. Finally, P. distasonis enhanced CD8+T cell activity by secreting CXCL9 from macrophages in vivo. Conclusions P. distasonis promoted CXCL9 secretion of TAM and enhanced CD8+T cell activity to trigger anti-tumor immunity against anti-PD-1 treatment in NSCLC mice.

        <tr id="T cell engagers (TCEs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the treatment of B and plasma cell malignancies and are emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of solid tumors. These molecules harness T cells to bind to and eliminate cancer cells, effectively bypassing the need for antigen-specific T cell recognition. Despite their established clinical efficacy, a subset of patients is either refractory to TCE treatment (e.g. primary resistance) or develops resistance during the course of TCE therapy (e.g. acquired or treatment-induced resistance). In this review we comprehensively describe the resistance mechanisms to TCEs, occurring in both preclinical models and clinical trials with a particular emphasis on cellular and molecular pathways underlying the resistance process. We classify these mechanisms into tumor intrinsic and tumor extrinsic ones. Tumor intrinsic mechanisms encompass changes within tumor cells that impact the T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, including tumor antigen loss, the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitory ligands and intracellular pathways that render tumor cells resistant to killing. Tumor extrinsic mechanisms involve factors external to tumor cells, including the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and reduced T cell functionality. We further propose actionable strategies to overcome resistance offering potential avenues for enhancing TCE efficacy in the clinic.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) are clonal hematologic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and a variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite growing recognition of the role of innate immunity in MDS pathogenesis, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed bone marrow CD34+ expression data from 183 MDS patients to investigate the impact of the Toll‐like receptor (TLR) pathway on disease progression. Six key innate immunity genes (IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK4, MYD88, TRAF6, and NFKB1) were used to define two distinct immune clusters: a hyperactive immune cluster (HIC) and a moderate immune cluster (MIC). The HIC was enriched in 155 immune‐related pathways and showed higher infiltration of activated natural killer cells and M1 macrophages, while the MIC exhibited increased infiltration of naïve B cells and mast cells. Differential expression analysis identified 35 genes that distinguished the clusters. Validation in an independent cohort of 82 patients revealed that reduced expression of these genes correlated with markers of advanced disease, including lower hemoglobin levels, lower neutrophil counts, altered cytogenetics, and higher bone marrow blast percentages. These findings underscore the critical role of immune dysregulation in MDS progression and highlight novel therapeutic opportunities within the innate immunity pathway for tailored interventions.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated bone marrow failure (BMF) entails a complex immune landscape. Myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are involved in the development and progression of immune aplastic anemia (AA). We used a murine model of BMF to explore the effects of CSF-1R inhibition on immune pathophysiology. Hematopoiesis, immune cell populations, and gene expression were assessed by flow cytometry, cytokine analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing. CSF-1R inhibition with the small molecule PLX3397 intensified BMF in CByB6F1 mice, enhancing inflammation and macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. This was accompanied by increased leukocyte apoptosis, a reduction in CD11b+ myeloid cells, and worsened animal survival. In contrast, the JAK-inhibitor baricitinib attenuated BMF, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, and decreasing CD8+ T cell infiltration of bone marrow. Single-cell RNA analysis revealed upregulation of M1 signature genes in both murine BMF and also AA human samples. In patients with severe AA, there was a shift towards an M1-like monocyte phenotype, correlating with increased inflammatory cytokine expression and altered MDSC populations. These findings highlight the role of myeloid-derived cells in BMF and suggest that M1 macrophages, with defective MDSC function, contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression. Targeting macrophage polarization or MDSCs offers alternative therapeutic strategies in immune-mediated BMF.">

        <tr id="Despite the significant advances in the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), primary and acquired ICI resistance remains the primary impediment to effective cancer immunotherapy. Residing in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in tumor progression by regulating diverse signaling pathways. Notably, accumulating evidence has confirmed that TAMs interplay with various cellular components within the TME directly or indirectly to maintain the dynamic balance of the M1/M2 ratio and shape an immunosuppressive TME, consequently conferring immune evasion and immunotherapy tolerance. Detailed investigation of the communication network around TAMs could provide potential molecular targets and optimize ICI therapies. In this review, we systematically summarize the latest advances in understanding the origin and functional plasticity of TAMs, with a focus on the key signaling pathways driving macrophage polarization and the diverse stimuli that regulate this dynamic process. Moreover, we elaborate on the intricate interplay between TAMs and other cellular constituents within the TME, that is driving tumor initiation, progression and immune evasion, exploring novel targets for cancer immunotherapy. We further discuss current challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need to decode TAM-TME interactions and translate preclinical findings into clinical breakthroughs. In conclusion, while TAM-targeted therapies hold significant promise for enhancing immunotherapy outcomes, addressing key challenges—such as TAM heterogeneity, context-dependent plasticity, and therapeutic resistance—remains critical to achieving optimal clinical efficacy.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Conventional therapies are frequently limited by tumor heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Dendritic cells (DCs), central to orchestrating antitumor immunity, have become key targets for HCC immunotherapy. This review examines the biological functions of DC subsets (cDC1, cDC2, pDC, and moDC) and their roles in initiating and modulating immune responses against HCC. We detail the mechanisms underlying DC impairment within the TME, including suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Additionally, we discuss novel DC-based therapeutic strategies, such as DC-based vaccines designed to enhance antigen presentation and T cell activation. Combining DC vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockers, demonstrates synergistic effects that can overcome immune evasion and improve clinical outcomes. Despite progress, challenges related to DC subset heterogeneity, TME complexity, and patient variability require the further optimization and personalization of DC-based therapies. Future research should focus on refining these strategies, leveraging advanced technologies like genomic profiling and artificial intelligence, to maximize therapeutic efficacy and revolutionize HCC treatment. By restoring DC function and reprogramming the TME, DC-based immunotherapy holds immense potential to transform the management of HCC and improve patient survival.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic stem cell transplant and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) are the current standard treatments for patients with aplastic anemia (AA). However, IST also carries significant risks and side effects, and up to 30–50% of patients experienced refractory or relapsed disease following IST. Treating AA remains challenging and novel efficient therapies are in critical need. The IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) plays a crucial role in the T cell response and functions as a regulator of T cell activity. While ITK inhibition has shown promise in various immune-related disorders, its potential role in the pathophysiology of AA has not been thoroughly investigated. We observed elevated level of phosphorylated ITK in T cells from AA patients and AA mouse models. Moreover, we found that both treatment with an ITK inhibitor or conditional depletion of Itk in donor mice alleviated bone marrow hypoplasia, improved cytopenia, and extended survival rates. Notably, ITK inhibition orchestrates T cell quantity and function by reducing T cell infiltration and suppressing the secretion of key inflammatory cytokines in AA mice. Our data suggest that ITK inhibitor could potentially offer a new therapeutic strategy for AA.

        <tr id="Background Ovarian cancer (OC) progression is heavily influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), where immune suppression plays a critical role. This study explores the role of thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) in regulating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), T cell exhaustion, and immune checkpoint expression, as well as its transcriptional regulation by SNF2H. Methods We analyzed THBS1 expression and its clinical significance using publicly available datasets (TCGA-OV, GSE14407) and tissue microarrays containing OC and adjacent normal tissues. In vitro functional studies were conducted using OC cell lines (SKOV3, A2780) and co-cultures with macrophages. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and RNA interference were employed to investigate SNF2H-mediated transcriptional regulation of THBS1. In vivo, the role of THBS1 in immune suppression was validated using mouse tumor models. Results THBS1 was significantly overexpressed in OC tissues and associated with poor prognosis. High levels of THBS1 correlated with increased TAM infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization, and upregulation of immune checkpoints PD-L1 and GAL-3, which contribute to T cell exhaustion. Functional assays demonstrated that THBS1 promotes macrophage recruitment and induces M2 polarization through TGF-β1 and IL-4 signaling. Additionally, ChIP assays identified SNF2H as a transcriptional regulator of THBS1, contributing to its overexpression. In vitro targeting of THBS1 reduced TAM-mediated immune suppression and restored T cell cytotoxicity. Conclusion This study positions THBS1 as a key regulator of the OC TME, linking TAM recruitment and polarization to CD8+ T cell exhaustion via immune checkpoint modulation. By identifying SNF2H as a transcriptional regulator of THBS1, we offer new insights into its epigenetic dysregulation and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to reprogram the TME and improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy.

CAFs impair DC maturation and function by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, reducing their ability to present antigens and stimulate T cells, thus promoting an immunosuppressive environment favorable to tumor growth. Additionally, CAFs contribute to the differentiation of tolerogenic DCs, fostering regulatory T cells (Tregs) that further suppress antitumor immunity. This review examines the molecular mechanisms underlying CAF-DC crosstalk and discusses potential therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring DC functionality. Targeting the CAF-driven immunosuppressive network offers promising opportunities to enhance the efficacy of DC-based vaccines and immunotherapies, paving the way for improved cancer treatment outcomes.">

We observe opposing changes in the abundance of myeloid cells and T cells, with T cell clonal expansion dominated by effector memory cells. Therapy reduces and suppresses cytotoxic T cells, but new T cell clones emerge hindering robust hematopoietic recovery. Enhanced cell-cell interactions including between hematopoietic cells and immune cells, in particular evolving IFNG and IFNGR, are noted in patients and are suppressed post-therapy.

        <tr id="Radiation therapy can modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing antitumor immune responses. This study compared the immunomodulatory effects of alpha-emitting (225Ac) and beta-emitting (177Lu) radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT) using NM600 in murine prostate cancer models.We assessed immunological changes in TRAMP-C1 and Myc-CaP tumor models treated with 225Ac-NM600 or 177Lu-NM600. Flow cytometry was used to profile immune cell populations, activation markers, and checkpoint molecules, while multiplex assays analyzed cytokine and chemokine expression.In general, 225Ac-NM600 elicited stronger immunomodulatory effects than 177Lu-NM600, including cell line dependent increased CD8/Treg ratios, activation of effector and memory T cells, and depletion of suppressive Tregs and MDSCs. The treatment elevated Th1 cytokines, pro-inflammatory chemokines, and checkpoint molecules like PD-1 on CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 on MDSCs, creating a more “hot” TME.Alpha-emitting 225Ac-NM600 demonstrated superior ability to enhance antitumor immunity compared to beta-emitting 177Lu-NM600. These findings support the use of 225Ac-NM600 in combination with immunotherapies for advanced prostate cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world and the second cause of death related to cancer. Regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration is enriched in several tumor types including CRC and correlates with suppression of the anti-tumor immune response. In the large intestine, thymic Tregs (tTregs Helios+) and peripheral Tregs (pTregs Helios−) coexist and maintain intestinal homeostasis under steady state conditions. The recruitment of Treg cells to the intestine is orchestrated by the CCR9/CCL25 axis, which is potentiated under inflammatory conditions. Interestingly, the balance between cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and Tregs within the tumor microenvironment is critical for antitumor immunity and cancer progression. An elevated CD8+/Treg ratio has been associated with improved clinical outcomes in various cancers, including CRC. Therefore, here we investigate the potential role of chemokine receptor CCR9 on CD8+/Treg ratio and the effect of the recruitment of Treg subpopulations (Helios+ and Helios−) into the tumor microenvironment using the AOM/DSS induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer murine model. Our findings reveal that CCR9 deficiency leads to distinct alterations in the CRC microenvironment, characterized by decreased intratumoral Tregs Helios+. Also, the lack of the receptor leads to an improvement of the antitumor immune response, increasing the CD8+/Treg ratio within the tumor immune infiltrate. These results underscore the importance of CCR9 in shaping the immune microenvironment during CRC development.">

 Background:
 Reprogramming or repolarizing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has emerged as a novel strategy in tumor immunotherapy, leveraging their remarkable plasticity. Our previous studies have demonstrated that SLAMF8, predominantly expressed in macrophages, is a promising biomarker for predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to elucidate further the regulatory role of SLAMF8 in TAMs and its influence on the tumor immune microenvironment.
 Methods:
 In vitro, M2 macrophage and TAM models were established to investigate the regulatory role of SLAMF8 in macrophage immunophenotypic transition and its impact on CD8+ T cell function using qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and co-culture assays. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data and western blotting were conducted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. In vivo, SLAMF8-specific small interfering RNA (siSLAMF8) was utilized to inhibit SLAMF8 expression in subcutaneous colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor models. Subsequent observations included tumor growth monitoring and analysis of immune cell infiltration via flow cytometry. Furthermore, two subcutaneous tumor models, one sensitive and one resistant to PD-1 therapy, were constructed to explore potential synergistic effects between SLAMF8 inhibition and anti-PD-1 treatment.
 Results:
 In vitro studies reveal that SLAMF8 facilitates the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, contributing to the immunosuppressive characteristics of TAMs and dysfunction of CD8+ T cells. Inhibiting SLAMF8 in vivo significantly delayed colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the infiltration of anti-tumor TAMs (CD86+ F4/80+) and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (IFNγ+ GZMB+ CD8+ T cells) was augmented, while the infiltration of pro-tumor TAMs (CD206+ F4/80+) and exhausted CD8+ T cells (PD1+ LAG3+ CD8+ T cells) was reduced in tumors treated with SLAMF8-specific small interfering RNA (siSLAMF8). Additionally, targeting SLAMF8 enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. Mechanistically, Western blotting experiments confirmed that the phosphorylation levels of key molecules in the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways were significantly increased in SLAMF8-overexpressing macrophages.
 Conclusions:
 Inhibition of SLAMF8 delays tumor growth, enhances the sensitization to ICI therapy, and reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment by modulating TAMs via the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT3 pathways in CRC. These findings reveal the potential of SLAMF8 as a therapeutic target for immunotherapy focused on TAMs.

Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is now recognized as a major cause of septic death, and identifying effective strategies to counteract it poses a significant challenge. This immunosuppression results from the disruption of immune homeostasis, characterized by the abnormal death of immune effector cells, hyperproliferation of immune suppressor cells, release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of immune checkpoints. Preclinical studies targeting immunosuppression, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promise in reversing immunocyte dysfunctions and establishing host resistance to pathogens.

        <tr id="Background The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited by heterogeneity in individual responses to therapy. The heterogeneous phenotypes and crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in immunotherapy resistance remain largely unclear. Methods A specific CAF subset was identified by integrating comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and transcriptome profiling of patients with HCC with different responses to antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. Mouse orthotopic HCC models and a coculture system were constructed, and cytometry by time-of-flight analysis was performed to investigate the functions and mechanisms of specific CAFs in the immune context of HCC. Results We identified a distinct flavin-containing monooxygenase 2 (FMO2)+ CAF subset associated with a favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy and better clinical outcomes. FMO2+ CAFs increase anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy by promoting tertiary lymphoid structure formation and increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and M1-like macrophages through the C-C motif chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19)-C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 axis. Mechanistically, FMO2 promotes nuclear factor kappa B/p65-mediated CCL19 expression by competitively binding to glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) with praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 1 (PJA1), thereby suppressing the PJA1-mediated proteasomal degradation of GYS1. CCL19 treatment potentiated the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in mouse orthotopic HCC models. A favorable immunotherapy response was observed in patients with HCC with high serum levels of CCL19. Conclusions We identified a novel FMO2+ CAF subset that serves as a critical regulator of microenvironmental immune properties and a predictive biomarker of the immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. CCL19 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.">

        <tr id="Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) serves as a critical molecular orchestrator in the germinal center (GC) reaction within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), driving the production of high-affinity antibodies through somatic hypermutation. While its pathological implications are well-documented - including ectopic expression in non-B cell populations and transcriptional dysregulation linked to hematological malignancies and solid tumorigenesis - the cellular provenance of AID in solid tumors remains an unresolved paradox. This review advances two principal hypotheses: (1) AID may derive from tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), ectopic immune niches mirroring SLO organization, and (2) exhibits context-dependent transcriptional duality, capable of both potentiating and suppressing gene expression based on microenvironmental cues. Through systematic analysis of AID/GC involvement across cancer subtypes, we delineate mechanistic connections between lymphoid neogenesis and tumor progression. Our examination extends to TLS architecture, revealing three critical dimensions: (i) structural organization and cellular heterogeneity, (ii) developmental trajectories, and (iii) bidirectional interactions with tumor microenvironments. Crucially, we establish functional parallels between tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIL-Bs) in SLOs versus TLSs, while elucidating the differential roles of AID in canonical GC versus TLS-associated GC formation. This synthesis ultimately proposes that AID’s functional dichotomy - acting as both oncogenic collaborator and tumor suppressor - underlies the paradoxical prognostic associations observed with TLS presence across malignancies. The review thereby provides a conceptual framework reconciling AID’s dual functionality with the context-dependent immunobiology of tumor-associated lymphoid structures.">

ICI has shown its effectiveness in many solid tumors, but it lacks activity against “cold” tumors which lack CTL infiltration, including most of the colon, prostate, lung and breast cancers. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) responds to PD-1 blockade only in 5–20% cases. Chemotherapy has been shown to have a PD1-sensitizing effect in a fraction of patients with TNBC but the underlying mechanism and the reasoning behind its limitation to only a subset of patients are unknown. Recent data demonstrate the key roles played by paclitaxel-driven Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and the resulting activation of type-1 and type-2 interferon pathways in tumor-associated macrophages, resulting in local M2 to M1 transition and enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation, in the paclitaxel-driven sensitization of “cold” tumors to ICI. These data and the known ability of the TLR4-activated MyD88-NFκB pathway to mobilize both antitumor and tumor-promoting events in the TME provide new tools to enhance the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy for metastatic, and potentially early, TNBC and other taxane-sensitive cancers.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant tumor and stands as the fourth leading contributor to cancer-related fatalities on a global scale. The specific link between CD2 Associated Protein (CD2AP) expression and the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear, and further exploration is needed to understand its potential role in immune response and as a target for immunotherapy in GC. Utilizing RNA sequencing data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for a pan-cancer analysis, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out to determine the expression pattern and immunological involvement of CD2AP. Systematic association of CD2AP with immunological features within the stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) TME was subsequently performed, encompassing factors like cancer immunity cycles, immune checkpoints, immunomodulators, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs). We found that CD2AP was enhanced expression in the TME of a variety of malignancies. CD2AP contributes to forming a stromal reduced TME in GC and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. It was observed that patients with elevated levels of CD2AP, along with high scores on their CD4, CD20, and CD57 immune markers, tended to experience the most favorable prognosis. Furthermore, an IRS was constructed to accurately assess the prognosis of STAD patients. Since CD2AP was associated with the formation of stromal reduced TME in STAD, the expression of CD2AP can improve the effect of immunotherapy of STAD. CD2AP could emerge as a novel prognostic biomarker for STAD, offering a fresh avenue for molecular targeted therapy.

This study focuses on TIGIT, a newly identified immune checkpoint, to explore its expression, prognostic significance, and therapeutic potential in hematologic malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we found TIGIT highest expression levels in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, with enrichment in immune cells such as NK-T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). A prognostic model incorporating TIGIT expression and other immune-related genes effectively stratified AML patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with the former displaying significantly shorter overall survival times. Our model outperformed traditional prognostic factors, highlighting TIGIT’s potential as a superior predictive biomarker. Additionally, our in vitro and in vivo studies showed that combining tiragolumab with azacitidine (AZA) synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, reducing tumor burden and extending survival in a murine AML model. Our findings underscore TIGIT’s role in hematologic malignancies and its potential as a therapeutic target in AML. The combination of AZA with TIGIT inhibition offers a promising new approach for AML treatment, warranting further clinical evaluation.">

        <tr id="Recipients’ age has emerged as a key factor that impacts on acute renal allograft rejection and graft survival. Age-related functional and structural changes in the immune system have been observed, yet the precise influence of aged immunity on kidney transplant remains unclear. In an initial retrospective analysis of clinical data gathered from two major centers in China and Germany, we found a correlation between aging and mitigated rejection outcomes in kidney recipients. To study the mechanism, we performed kidney transplantation on mice and observed attenuated allograft rejection in senescent recipients. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of allograft kidneys indicated a protective role of p21high macrophages in aged mice. Supernatant collected from p21high macrophage primary culture inhibited the cytotoxic function and proliferation of CD8+ T cells. Zfp36 is highly expressed in senescent p21high macrophages. To determine its role in renal allograft rejection, we studied mice with Zfp36 conditionally deleted in macrophages (Zfp36-cKO). These mice developed exacerbated allograft rejection with enhanced IL-27 production and CD8+ T cell hyperactivation. Inhibition of IL-27 with neutralizing antibody or deletion of IL-27 receptor on CD8+ T cells reversed acute renal allograft rejection in Zfp36-cKO mice. Moreover, in vitro silencing Zfp36 with siRNA led to impaired degradation of IL-27 p28 mRNA and a subsequent increase of IL-27 in p21high macrophages. In conclusion, senescent macrophages protect renal allograft rejection by suppressing CD8+ T cells via a Zfp36/IL-27-dependent mechanism. These findings may provide innovative therapeutic strategies for addressing kidney allograft rejection.">

Tubulin tyrosine ligase 12 (TTLL12), as a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase protein family, is associated with the prognosis of patients with cancer and implicated in regulating innate immunity. However, the role of TTLL12 in modulating antitumor immunity remains unclear. Methods We analyzed the expression of TTLL12 in several cancer types and evaluated the putative correlation between TTLL12 expression and the immune infiltration in our own proteomic profile of human colorectal cancer. The gain-of-function or loss-of-function approaches were then implemented in vitro and in vivo, followed by flow cytometry to quantify immune cell population frequency. In vitro assays were used to confirm the influence of TTLL12 on the migration and proliferation of the immune subset. Mass spectrometry and chromatin-immunoprecipitation were used to further explore how TTLL12 influenced the immune subset. Finally, whether TTLL12 could enhance the antitumor efficacy of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy was assessed in an immunocompetent mouse model. Results We demonstrated that TTLL12 was upregulated in several cancer types and was linked with poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer. TTLL12 was found to be negatively correlated with the immune effector signature on the protein level in our proteomic datasets. TTLL12 ectopic expression in tumor cells did not influence cell proliferation but promoted tumor progression in syngeneic mouse models by modulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), resulting in a suppressive immune response. TTLL12 was further proved to enrich MDSCs by promoting MDSC migration and proliferation in vitro. Mechanistically, tumor-derived TTLL12 induced the secretion of chemokine CCL9 via promoting its transcription, probably through binding to the promoter region of CCL9. Downregulating TTLL12 could significantly improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in an immunocompetent murine model. Conclusion We identify TTLL12 as a key determinant of suppressive immune response, highlighting a previously unknown therapeutic target to increase the efficacy of antitumor immunotherapy.">

 The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is a critical immunomodulatory hub governing multiple processes relating to anti-tumor immunity. TMEM33 is an ER-resident membrane protein implicated in various ER-associated functions including cholesterol metabolism, calcium oscillations, and proteostasis. We previously reported TMEM33 as a negative modulator of the innate immune signaling protein STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes). Here we identify a central role of TMEM33 in tumor immunology where its deficiency profoundly impacts infiltrating immune populations and T cell phenotype. STING-mediated ISG (interferon-stimulated gene) expression was augmented in Tmem33-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages and TMEM33-depleted Flp-In T-REx 293 cells. Strikingly, Tmem33-/- mice exhibited significantly attenuated B16F10-OVA tumor growth and enhanced CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration compared to wild-type (WT) controls, while immunosuppressive immune populations including Treg cells, monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and M2-like macrophages were diminished. CD8+ T cell enrichment was also observed in MC38 tumor-bearing Tmem33-/- hosts. Unchallenged mice displayed no overt phenotypic or immunological differences compared to WT, however. High dimensional spectral flow cytometry was leveraged to further examine effects of Tmem33-/- on T cell compartments in B16F10-OVA tumors and draining lymph nodes (DLNs). Progenitor exhausted (Tpex) TCF-1+PD-1+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were significantly enriched in Tmem33-/- hosts, notable given that Tpex are responsive to checkpoint blockade therapy and associate with improved patient prognosis. Compared to WT counterparts, OVA-specific Tmem33-/- TILs exhibited increased cytotoxicity and effector function, expressing elevated granzyme-B and TNF-α. Moreover, EOMESloT-bethi TILs were more frequent among TCF-1+PD-1+ and TCF-1+ populations in Tmem33-/- hosts further suggestive of a more persistent CD8+ precursor pool, while inhibitory receptor (LAG-3, TIGIT) abundance was blunted, indicating reduced exhaustion. In DLNs of Tmem33-/- mice, antigen-specific CD8+ populations demonstrated enhanced effector memory (CD44+CD62L-) phenotypes alongside elevated CXCR3 expression compared to WT, suggesting increased tumor-migratory potential. In summary, here we identify TMEM33 as a novel immunoregulatory factor, the loss of which in hosts majorly reshapes the tumor-immune landscape and ameliorates multiple aspects of CD8+ T cell fitness including stemness, exhaustion, memory, cytotoxicity and migratory capacity. Further analysis of T cell populations from tumor-bearing mice and ex vivo analysis will enable mechanistic refinement of the role of TMEM33. Moreover, our study supports the importance of ER-resident proteins in fine-tuning immune cell function, underlining their potential as promising targets for therapeutic intervention.

        <tr id="Background Progesterone and adipose Q receptor 5 (PAQR5), a membrane receptor characterized by seven transmembrane domains, has been indirectly implicated in pro-carcinogenic activities, though its specific role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be defined. Methods This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PAQR5 facilitates HCC progression and contributes to the immunosuppressive microenvironment through an integrative approach combining multi-omics analysis and experimental validation. Utilizing data from bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics cohorts, this study systematically assessed the expression patterns, immune landscape, and functional characteristics of PAQR5 across different levels of resolution in HCC. Results PAQR5 expression was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and correlated with poor clinical outcomes. Enrichment analysis revealed that PAQR5 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway in HCC. Single-cell transcriptomics identified PAQR5 as predominantly localized within malignant cell clusters, with significant association with NF-κB pathway activation. Spatial transcriptomics further corroborated the alignment of PAQR5 expression with tumor cell distribution. In vitro assays showed elevated PAQR5 levels in HCC cell lines, and silencing PAQR5 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and prevented the formation of immunosuppressive microenvironment. In vivo studies demonstrated that targeting PAQR5 attenuated tumorigenic potential, disrupted the invasion-metastasis cascade and inhibited the tumor immune escape. Mechanistically, PAQR5 was found to activate NF-κB signaling by inducing ERK phosphorylation, thereby driving proliferation, invasion, EMT, and immune escape in HCC through the pathway.

 Dual inhibition of the PD-1 and TIGIT checkpoint receptor pathways has demonstrated synergistic anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, but its mechanism(s) of action remains incompletely understood. We now know that PD-1 and TIGIT regulate CD28 and CD226 costimulatory signals and thus co-blockade presents a rational strategy to facilitate the transmission of these activating signals to T cells. However, therapeutic efficacy of the combination is contingent upon a functional anti-TIGIT Fc domain, thereby implicating a role for myeloid cells, which abundantly express Fc receptors (FcR). Here, we aimed to delineate the relevant myeloid cells at play and investigate how they facilitate improved anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses during PD-1 and TIGIT co-blockade therapy.



 We compared the tumor immune infiltrate from wild-type or genetically modified mice treated with anti-PD-L1 in combination with either Fc-active mIgG2a anti-TIGIT (‘Combo-mG2a’) or Fc-inert mIgG2a-LALAPG anti-TIGIT (‘Combo-LALAPG’). Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing were used for cell profiling. Antibody blocking studies and in vitro co-culture assays were performed to confirm in vivo results.



 Tumor-bearing mice treated with Combo-mG2a were able to robustly control their tumors compared to their Combo-LALAPG-treated counterparts. We uncovered a requirement for type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) during Combo-mG2a treatment administration for anti-tumor efficacy and non-exhausted CD8+ T cell programming. Transcriptional profiling and immunophenotyping studies revealed a cDC1 activation state enriched in Combo-mG2a tumors marked by FcR expression and upregulation of the costimulatory ligands CD80/CD86 and PVR (termed ‘FcR+ cDC1’). The receptors for these ligands, CD28 and CD226, respectively, were co-expressed by therapy-responsive CD8+ T cells, with only CD226 being strongly upregulated following Combo-mG2a therapy. CD8+ T cell-intrinsic CD226 signaling was essential for non-exhausted T cell differentiation. Despite the widespread expression of PVR, cDC1-specific PVR expression was critical for maximal therapeutic efficacy of TIGIT and PD-L1 combination blockade. Type-I interferon (IFN-I) administration was sufficient to induce the FcR+ cDC1 state to rescue anti-tumor immunity in Combo-LALAPG tumors, highlighting IFN-I as a key downstream component of FcR engagement in Combo-mG2a tumors that activated cDC1.



 Our study identifies cDC1-facilitated costimulation as a critical factor in the therapeutic efficacy of TIGIT and PD-L1 combination blockade. Mechanistic insights from this work can inform the design of new therapeutic strategies to increase immunotherapy responses.

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in tumor immunotherapy, especially in immune checkpoint therapy, and therefore have become the focus of cancer research. However, although immune checkpoint treatment has shown some efficacy in clinical trials, its effect is still limited by tumor immune escape. Tumors weaken CD8+ T cell function by adapting to immune stress, while mechanisms such as metabolic reprogramming and regulation of immunosuppressive factors further reduce their anti-tumor activity. Based on existing research and data, this paper discusses CD8+ T cell exhaustion, immune checkpoint regulation (PD-1/CTLA-4), and tumor microenvironment metabolism, and summarizes strategies to enhance the effect of immunotherapy. Studies have shown that by inhibiting T cell exhaustion, blocking immune checkpoint signaling pathways, and optimizing metabolism, CD8+ T cell function can be significantly enhanced and the overall therapeutic effect can be improved. However, while metabolic intervention appears promising, its clinical feasibility and safety require further validation. This study provides a theoretical basis for optimizing T cell immunotherapy and provides new ideas for clinical treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Gut-liver crosstalk plays an important role in alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) pathogenesis; but underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Objective We examined the regulation of intestinal and intrahepatic CD8+ T lymphocytes and their contribution to ALD. Design ALD patients were recruited for evaluation of intestinal and liver T cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) was performed to analyse intrahepatic and peripheral T cells in ALD. Wildtype, CD8-specific Bcl2 transgenic (Cd8Bcl-2), and Cd8−/− mice were subjected to chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding. Results In ALD patients, duodenal CD8+ T cells were selectively reduced and negatively correlated with liver injury and bacterial translocation markers, while intrahepatic CD8+ T cells were markedly increased. ScRNA seq analysis of ALD patient livers revealed several populations of CD8+ T cells expressing activation and survival genes (eg, Bcl2). Transcriptomics and functional studies revealed a key role of prosurvival BCL2 in this opposite regulation of CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding reduced CD8+ T cells specifically in the duodenum where ethanol levels are high. Inducing BCL2 in CD8+ T cells reversed ethanol-induced loss of duodenal CD8+ T cells, improved gut barrier function and ameliorated ALD, while CD8 deficiency was linked to enhanced neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the liver, exacerbating ALD in mice. Conclusions ALD is associated with loss of duodenal CD8+ T cells but elevation of intrahepatic CD8+ T cells, which aggravates and ameliorates ALD, respectively. Restoration of survival and functions of intestinal and intrahepatic CD8+ T cells may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for ALD patients.">

        <tr id="Malignant tumors represent a significant threat to human health. Among the various therapeutic strategies available, cancer immunotherapy—encompassing adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and immune checkpoint blockade therapy—has emerged as a particularly promising approach following surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and molecular targeted therapies. This form of treatment elicits substantial antigen-specific immune responses, enhances or restores anti-tumor immunity, thereby facilitating the control and destruction of tumor cells, and yielding durable responses across a range of cancers, which can lead to the eradication of tumor lesions and the prevention of recurrence. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), a subset of ACT, are characterized by their heterogeneity and are found within tumor tissues, where they play a crucial role in mediating host antigen-specific immune responses against tumors. This review aims to explore recent advancements in the understanding of TILs biology, their prognostic implications, and their predictive value in therapeutic contexts.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse is associated with poor prognosis. While natural killer (NK) cell therapy can induce leukemia remission, infused NK cells are prone to exhaustion. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms driving NK cell exhaustion in AML patients could provide critical insights for developing novel strategies to optimize NK cell-based immunotherapies. In this study, we systematically investigated NK cell exhaustion in relapsed AML patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) through phenotypic assessments, functional assays, and RNA sequencing analyses. Compared to NK cells from complete remission patients and healthy controls, NK cells from relapsed AML patients exhibited an exhausted phenotype, marked by reduced maturity, elevated expression of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, impaired cytotoxicity, and suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Notably, NKG2A expression levels on NK cells correlated with disease progression. Blockade or genetic knockout of NKG2A effectively reversed NK cell exhaustion both in vitro and in an AML mouse model. Furthermore, activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in exhausted NK cells. We found that excessive activation of the NKG2A/HLA-E axis was associated with PI3K-AKT pathway inhibition, and blocking the NKG2A/HLA-E interaction or knocking out NKG2A restored AKT phosphorylation in exhausted NK cells. In summary, AML cells drive NK cell exhaustion through overactivation of the NKG2A/HLA-E axis and suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Targeting the NKG2A/HLA-E axis represents a promising therapeutic approach to restore PI3K-AKT signaling and reverse NK cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC), a leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits profound molecular heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) features that limit therapeutic efficacy. This review elucidates the dual roles of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in GC progression. TLS, ectopic lymphoid organs formed under chronic inflammation, correlate with improved survival and immunotherapy sensitivity by fostering effector T/B cell interactions and antigen presentation. Conversely, immunosuppressive TME components like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) drive immune evasion via cytokine-mediated suppression and checkpoint activation (PD-1/PD-L1). CD8+ T cells exert context-dependent effects, with high infiltration reducing recurrence risk but paradoxically inducing exhaustion in PD-L1-rich microenvironments. Th17 and memory T cells further modulate disease through IL-17-driven angiogenesis and CD45RO+ immune memory dynamics. Multi-omics-based TLS scoring and combinatorial therapies emerge as promising strategies to overcome resistance.">

        <tr id="Microglia are resident innate immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that provides anti-microbial protection but also promote neuroinflammation. BRD4 is a chromatin reader that binds to acetylated histones and directs transcription of numerous genes. However, it is unknown whether and how BRD4 regulates microglia function. We addressed the role of microglia and BRD4 in a neuroinflammatory disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis. It was reported earlier that in EAE, upon initial T cell activation in the peripheral lymphoid organs, CD4+ T cells migrate to CNS and are reactivated by resident or migratory antigen presenting cells resulting in full manifestation of EAE (Rossi and Constantin, Front Immunol 7:506, 2016), (Plastini et al., Front Cell Neurosci 14:269, 2020). Using conditional deletion of Brd4 in CD4 T cells, we reveal that BRD4 regulates T helper cell differentiation and promotes T cell migration to CNS resulting in EAE. It remained unclear whether resident microglia are capable of reactivating migrating T cells to the CNS and if BRD4 plays a role in the process. To determine the role of microglial BRD4 in EAE, we constructed conditional knockout mice lacking Brd4 (Brd4cKO) in microglia. RNA-seq analysis showed that Brd4 deletion led to the downregulation of many microglia genes in both naive and EAE conditions. Consequently, Brd4cKO mice had markedly reduced EAE pathology, namely reduced paralysis, absence of axonal demyelination and inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines. In vehicle treated mice (vehicle) abundant number of T cells were found to be near microglia that may lead to T cell- microglia interaction and T cell reactivation. In contrast, the number of T cells detected in the CNS of Brd4cKO mice was much fewer. This may lead to reduced T cell- microglia interaction, failure of T cells to get reactivated and hence failed to achieve full manifestation of EAE. These results demonstrate that microglia are critically involved in EAE disease progression for which BRD4 is essential. In summary, BRD4 directs transcription of genes defining microglia function. By so doing BRD4 promotes demyelination and neuroinflammation to exacerbate EAE.

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has made important breakthroughs in cancer treatment, however, currently only parts of cancer patients benefit from ICB therapy. The suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) impedes the treatment response of immunotherapy, indicating the necessity to explore new treatment targets. Here, we reported a new potential immunotherapeutic target, Dickkopf-3 (DKK3), for cancer treatment. DKK3 expression is up-regulated in the tumors from multiple cancer types, and high DKK3 expression is associated with worse survival outcome across different cancers. We observed that DKK3 directly inhibits the activation of CD8+ T cells and the Th1 differentiation of CD4+ T cells ex vivo. Also, by establishing four different mouse cancer models, we found that DKK3 blockade triggers effective anti-tumor effects and improve the survival of tumor-bearing mice in vivo. DKK3 blockade also remodels the suppressive TIME of different cancer types, including the increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells, IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells, Th1 cells, and decreased infiltration of M2 macrophages and MDSCs in the TIME. Moreover, we found that combined blockade of DKK3 and PD-1 induces synergistic tumor-control effect in our mouse cancer model.

        <tr id="Upon activation, B cells undergo either the germinal center (GC) or extrafollicular (EF) response. While GC are known to generate high‐affinity memory B cells and long‐lived plasma cells, the role of the EF response is less well understood. Initially, it was thought to be limited to that of a source of fast but lower‐quality antibodies until the GC can form. However, recent evidence strongly supports the EF response as an important component of the humoral response to infection. EF responses are now also recognized as a source of pathogenic B cells in autoimmune diseases. The EF response itself is dynamic and regulated by pathways that are only recently being uncovered. We have identified that the cytokine IL‐12 acts as a molecular switch, enhancing the EF response and suppressing GC through multiple mechanisms. These include direct effects on both B cells themselves and the coordinated differentiation of helper CD4 T cells. Here, we explore this pathway in relation to other recent advancements in our understanding of the EF response's role and highlight areas for future research. A better understanding of how the EF response forms and is regulated is essential for advancing treatments for many disease states.">

 Multiple myeloma (MM) is defined by the uncontrolled clonal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). It is one of the most frequent hematological cancers, representing 10% of hematological malignancies in the US. Although recent advancements in therapies have led to improved outcomes, MM remains incurable. Disease development and progression are impacted by alterations in the local immune microenvironment, and dysfunction in both the innate and adaptive immune responses are characteristic of the MM BM microenvironment. With the increasing use of immunotherapeutic strategies to treat MM, there is a growing need to understand the existing immune landscape in these patients. We sought to gain a greater understanding of the immune cell diversity in MM by sampling BM from healthy and newly diagnosed cohorts. A combination of traditional flow cytometry, spectral flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with the addition of CITE-seq, enabled the high-resolution analysis of surface protein and targeted immune response-related transcriptomic changes within individual cells. In this study, we found a high degree of inter-patient heterogeneity within the aberrant plasma cell population. We report an expanded population of CD57+ effector memory expressing CD45-RA (TEMRA) cytotoxic T cells, and an overall reduction in T cell effector responses. Our scRNA-seq approach demonstrated a strong correlation of CITE-seq signal with key cell identifying markers. Investigation of the suppressive cell subsets found that overall, these cell frequencies were maintained across health and disease. However, we found altered TREG phenotypes with an increased frequency of a highly suppressive TREG subset in MM patients. In summary, our study provided insight into the significant differences observed in the frequency and functionality of the principal immune populations of the BM microenvironment. By combining flow cytometry with scRNA-seq and CITE-seq, the changes in the immune landscape in the BM of treatment naïve MM patients can be mapped more comprehensively, allowing correlation of surface marker expression with gene expression profiles.

 GBM (glioblastoma) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Despite advances in immunotherapy, current treatment modalities have only provided a modest benefit to GBM patients. We propose that enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy for GBM requires approaches that increase T cell infiltration and reprogram the myeloid cells to a more pro-inflammatory state. We previously reported that S100A4 is a critical regulator of immune suppressive myeloid and T cell phenotypes and also a major regulator of glioma stem cells in GBM. Our preliminary data show that targeting S100A4 in either glioma cells or stromal cells is sufficient to reprogram the tumor immune landscape and extend survival of glioma bearing mice, indicating that S100A4 is a promising therapeutic target. We recently developed a S100A4 blocking monoclonal antibody; however, this antibody does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) efficiently to confer significant therapeutic benefit in glioma bearing mice. To overcome this challenge, we generated a bispecific S100A4-TfR antibody (BsA) that allows robust BBB penetration and accumulation in the brain. We assessed efficacy of BsA treatment in a highly aggressive and therapy-resistant, syngeneic mouse model of GBM (SVP). Using ELISA, confocal immunofluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and bulk RNA sequencing, we report that BsA treatment accumulates in the gliomas and reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment to increase T cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory activation. Furthermore, BsA treatment in combination with αPD1 checkpoint blockade significantly extends survival in the SVP mouse glioma model. Combination treated tumors exhibit extensive CD8 T cell infiltration and increased tumor reactive CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to controls. In addition, the BsA is taken up intracellularly within GBM cells and depletes S100A4 and nuclear SOX2 protein. In vitro treatment of GBM stem cell cultures with the BsA reduced self-renewal, as measured by the secondary sphere formation assay. These results indicate that the BsA is a promising agent to reprogram the GBM immune landscape and target GBM cell stemness through inhibition of both extracellular and intracellular S100A4 protein. We are currently performing in vivo efficacy studies in additional murine glioma models, and deeper mechanistic studies using single cell RNA sequencing and functional assays.

The current standard treatment, which includes surgical resection followed by temozolomide and radiation, offers limited success. While immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have proven effective in other cancers, they have not demonstrated significant efficacy in GBM. Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in supporting tumor growth, fostering treatment resistance, and shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Preclinical studies show promising results for therapies targeting TAMs, suggesting potential in overcoming these barriers. TAMs consist of brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, both exhibiting diverse phenotypes and functions within the tumor microenvironment. This review delves into the origin, heterogeneity, and functional roles of TAMs in GBM, underscoring their dual roles in tumor promotion and suppression. It also summarizes recent progress in TAM-targeted therapies, which may, in combination with other treatments like immunotherapy, pave the way for more effective and personalized strategies against this aggressive malignancy.">

 Pancreatic cancer, an immunologically "cold" tumor, poorly responds to immunotherapy. TAMs, key immune cells in its microenvironment, drive tumor progression. Despite recent progress in macrophage-targeted therapies like CSF1R inhibitors, clinical results in pancreatic cancer are disappointing, with unclear mechanisms. Surufatinib, a CSF1R inhibitor, hinders macrophage differentiation into an immunosuppressive state. Surufatinib alters macrophage differentiation pathways, but resistance is mediated by the emergence of damage-associated macrophages. A subset of these macrophages, characterized by high GPR34 expression, is enriched in refractory pancreatic cancer patients. Through activation of the LysoPS-GPR34 axis, these macrophages enhance efferocytosis and subsequently downregulate MHC-I, leading to CD8+ T cell exhaustion.



 Tumor immune microenvironment alterations in pancreatic cancer patients after surufatinib treatment were analyzed via scRNA-seq. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry were performed on tumor tissue microarrays and fresh surgical specimens. GPR34 conditional knockout mice with orthotopic tumors were analyzed via flow cytometry. The mechanisms of CD8+ T cell exhaustion were investigated using in vitro co-culture systems of macrophages and CD8+ T cells. The efficacy of GPR34 antagonists in combination with immunotherapy and chemotherapy was evaluated in spontaneous tumor models.



 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on tumor specimens from patients enrolled in clinical trials receiving surufatinib plus chemotherapy. The analysis revealed changes in the tumor immune microenvironment, identifying a subset of damage-response macrophages characterized by high GPR34 expression. Notably, this macrophage population was significantly enriched in treatment-resistant patients. These high expression GPR34 macrophages activated damage-response signaling via the lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS)-GPR34 axis, promoting CD8+ T cell exhaustion through the release of chronic inflammatory factors and enhanced efferocytosis. Furthermore, efferocytosis further promotes the formation of autophagolysosomes in macrophages, leading to increased degradation of MHC-I, thereby suppressing the antigen-presenting function of macrophages. Targeting GPR34+ macrophages significantly improved the efficacy of both immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that expand aberrantly in cancer and exhibit potent immunosuppressive properties. They contribute to tumor progression through both immunological and nonimmunological mechanisms. Immunologically, MDSCs suppress antitumor responses by inhibiting effector cells such as T cells and NK cells, facilitating immune evasion. Nonimmunologically, they promote tumor growth and metastasis through processes such as the epithelial‒mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and premetastatic niche formation. MDSC accumulation is closely linked to accelerated tumor progression, including resistance to both immunotherapies and conventional treatments, making these cells critical therapeutic targets. Clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of MDSC‐targeted strategies to improve treatment efficacy. However, challenges remain in achieving specificity and effectiveness in MDSC‐targeted therapies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of their biology. This review summarizes the origin, classification, and biological characteristics of MDSCs, their dual roles in tumor progression, and their clinical significance. We also discuss recent advances in clinical and preclinical studies, including both traditional targeted therapies and emerging innovative strategies. By integrating current findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective on the role of MDSCs in cancer and valuable insights for advancing cancer treatment and drug development.">

        <tr id="In a recent study published in Nature , Breart et al. 1 untangled the controversy surrounding interleukin (IL)-27 ’ s role in regulating T cell differentiation and immune responses in cancer. Their ﬁ ndings reveal that IL-27 enhances the persistence and effector functions of tumor-in ﬁ ltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes (TILs), preventing exhaustion, sustaining T cell-dependent tumor control and immunotherapy ef ﬁ cacy without signi ﬁ cant systemic side effects. Effective immune control of cancer relies on the ability of T lymphocytes to in ﬁ ltrate tumors and exert their cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, surviving neoplastic cells promptly adapt to immune-patrolled environments and evolve under immune system pressure to progressively avoid immune clearance, establishing immune-privileged conditions that sustain limitless growth. These immune evasive strategies are deployed in 3 main routes: “ camou ﬂ age ” (reduced immunogenicity and immune exclusion), “ coercion ” (impaired local immune activation through the establishment of a highly immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment [TME]), “ cytoprotection ” (avoiding neoplastic cell killing through intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms). 2 Therapeutic approaches targeting immune checkpoints and aiming to restore cancer immune surveillance signi ﬁ cantly improved the survival and life quality of cancer patients, although their ef ﬁ cacy is restricted to a fraction of patients and tumor types.

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of malignant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) disorders characterized by cytopenia, ineffective hematopoiesis, as well as the potential to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The pathogenesis of MDS is influenced by intrinsic factors, such as genetic insults, and extrinsic factors, including altered bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) composition and architecture. BMM is reprogrammed in MDS, initially to prevent the development of the disease but eventually to provide a survival advantage to dysplastic cells. Recently, inflammation or age-related inflammation in the bone marrow has been identified as a key pathogenic mechanism for MDS. Inflammatory signals trigger stress hematopoiesis, causing HSPCs to emerge from quiescence and resulting in MDS development. A better understanding of the role of the BMM in the pathogenesis of MDS has opened up new avenues for improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the disease. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current knowledge regarding the significance of the BMM to MDS pathophysiology and highlights recent advances in developing innovative therapies.">

Thus, endothelial cell–specific targeted deletion of Raptor (RptorECKO), a unique component of the mTORC1 complex, significantly reduced metastatic tumor burden that was associated with improved markers of T cell cytotoxicity. Low-dose everolimus that selectively inhibited endothelial mTORC1 improves immune checkpoint responses in metastatic disease models. This work reveals the importance of transendothelial nutrient delivery to the TME, highlighting a future target for therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) play a crucial role in modulating tumor immune responses and influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, our current understanding of the microenvironment within these lymph nodes remains limited. Tumors not only impair the anti-tumor activity of CD8+ T cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment, but they also facilitate immune evasion and promote metastasis by altering the structure and function of TDLNs. Research has shown that tumor-specific memory CD8+ T cells (TTSM) within TDLNs are essential for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockers. Moreover, the abnormal structure of TDLNs, along with the presence of immunosuppressive cells—such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), and immunosuppressive dendritic cells (DCs)—contributes to tumor-mediated immune evasion. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the immune microenvironment within TDLNs is essential for improving the effectiveness of immunotherapies and developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review explores various TDLN-based therapeutic strategies, addressing the controversies surrounding lymph node dissection, the use of TDLNs as a source of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for therapy, targeting immunosuppressive cells within TDLNs, and methods to reverse the structural abnormalities of TDLNs. These strategies offer valuable insights and potential directions for advancing tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized cancer treatment by enabling durable responses. However, most patients showed resistance and limited efficacy. Elucidating mechanisms of resistance is imperative to extend the clinical utility of ICBs. Emerging evidence highlights cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), particularly TGFβ-activated myofibroblastic CAFs, as key orchestrators of immunosuppressive TMEs and ICBs resistance. These CAFs drive T-cell exclusion preventing intratumoral T cells from engaging cancer cells. This review explores the role of TGFβ signaling in CAFs in driving immune evasion and therapy resistance. While targeting TGFβ or CAFs directly has shown limited inconsistent results, downstream molecules in TGFβ-activated CAFs, including induced TGFβ (βig-h3), endocytic receptor 180 (Endo180), leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15), and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), emerge as promising therapeutic targets to counteract T-cell exclusion and restore immunotherapy sensitivity. Advancing research on CAF heterogeneity and pro-tumorigenic subsets may uncover innovative strategies to expand immunotherapy benefits.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic cell-based immunotherapies, particularly CAR-T cell therapy, represent a significant advancement in cancer treatment, offering scalable and consistent alternatives to autologous therapies. However, their widespread use is limited by the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). This review provides a comprehensive overview of GvHD in the context of allogeneic cell-based cancer immunotherapy and evaluates current strategies to mitigate its effects. Key strategies include genetic engineering approaches such as T cell receptor (TCR) knockout (KO) and T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) CAR knock-in. Alternative immune cell types like natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells offer potential solutions due to their lower alloreactivity. Additionally, stem cell technology, utilizing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), enables standardized and scalable production of engineered CAR-T cells. Clinical trials evaluating these strategies, such as UCART19 and CTX110, demonstrate promising results in preventing GvHD while maintaining anti-tumor efficacy. The review also addresses manufacturing considerations for allogeneic cell products and the challenges in translating preclinical findings into clinical success. By addressing these challenges, allogeneic cell-based immunotherapy continues to advance, paving the way for more accessible, scalable, and effective cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="As the second most common non-melanoma skin cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) has experienced a significant increase in incidence. Although clinical detection is relatively easy, a considerable number of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, featuring local tissue infiltration and distant metastasis. Cemiplimab, along with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, enhances T cell activation by blocking the PD-1 pathway, resulting in notable improvements in clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, approximately 50% of the patients with advanced cSCC remain unresponsive to this therapeutic approach. It emphasizes the importance of finding innovative therapeutic targets and strategies to boost the success of immunotherapy across a wider range of patients. Therefore, we focused on frequently neglected functions of innate immune cells. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immune cells exhibit considerable heterogeneity and plasticity, fundamentally contributing to tumor initiation and development. The identification and eradication of cancer cells, along with the modulation of adaptive immune responses, are essential roles of these cells. Consequently, targeting innate immune cells to activate anti-tumor immune responses presents significant potential for enhancing immunotherapeutic strategies in cSCC.">

        <tr id="Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation offers a cure for a variety of blood disorders, predominantly affecting the elderly; however, its application, especially in this demographic, is limited by treatment toxicity. In response, we employ a murine transplantation model based on low-intensity conditioning protocols using antibody-mediated HSC depletion. While aging presents a significant barrier to effective HSC engraftment, optimizing HSC doses and non-genotoxic targeting methods greatly enhance the long-term multilineage activity of the transplanted cells. We demonstrate that young HSCs, once effectively engrafted in aged hosts, improve hematopoietic output and ameliorate age-compromised lymphopoiesis. This culminated in a strategy that robustly mitigates disease progression in a genetic model of myelodysplastic syndrome. These results suggest that non-genotoxic HSC transplantation could fundamentally change the clinical management of age-associated hematological disorders, offering a prophylactic tool to delay or even prevent their onset in elderly patients.">

        <tr id="Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal bile duct cancer with high resistance and recurrence rates, with only one fifth of patients eligible for surgical treatment. The disease resists standard chemotherapy and often relapses. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promise for hematological malignancies but faces challenges in solid tumors due to resistance mechanisms like PD-L1 expression, which tumors use to evade the immune system. To address this challenge, we developed fifth-generation CAR T cells targeting integrin αvβ6 that also secrete anti-PD-L1 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to target both tumor cells and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. We examined integrin αvβ6 and PD-L1 expression in CCA cell lines and engineered T cells to express either fourth-generation CAR T cells targeting integrin αvβ6 (A20 CAR4 T cells) or fifth-generation CAR T cells with anti-PD-L1 scFv secretion (A20 CAR5 T cells). In vitro, A20 CAR5 T cells exhibited less exhaustion and superior long-term functionality compared to A20 CAR4 T cells. In 3D spheroid models of CCA, A20 CAR5 T cells demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity and better infiltration into the spheroid core. These findings suggest that A20 CAR5 T cells have significant potential and warrant further in vivo studies and clinical trials.

Conventional interventions including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy provide only modest survival benefits, underscoring an urgent need for more effective therapies. Although immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of several solid tumors, its clinical benefit in pancreatic cancer has so far been disappointing. Mounting evidence indicates that a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), dominated by tumor−associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid−derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), drives immune evasion, tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance through complex cytokine and chemokine networks.

        <tr id="Background Multiple myeloma (MM) is a biologically heterogeneous malignancy of clonal plasma cells, often progressing from MGUS or smoldering MM. It causes anemia, bone lesions, and immune dysfunction due to abnormal plasma cell expansion in the bone marrow. Neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors may influence MM progression by affecting immune cells and the bone marrow niche. Growing evidence points to a role for neuroimmune regulation in tumor immunity. Despite therapeutic progress, disease heterogeneity and resistance highlight the need for new strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment and neuroimmune axis. Methods This investigation exploited single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze MM and high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMMh) samples, identifying 11 distinct cell types. We examined their transcriptional signatures, stemness, proliferative properties, and metabolic pathways, with particular attention to neuroimmune interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Using trajectory inference tools such as CytoTRACE, Monocle2, and Slingshot, we traced the differentiation paths of MM cell subpopulations and identified key signaling pathways that may influence immune responses and tumor progression. Results The analysis identified four distinct subpopulations of myeloma cells, with the C0 IGLC3+ myeloma cells representing the least differentiated and most proliferative subset. These cells played a critical role in MM progression and may contribute to immune evasion mechanisms. Additionally, receptor-ligand interactions within the tumor microenvironment were identified, which may be influenced by neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors. These findings suggest that the nervous system and immune modulation significantly affect tumor biology, highlighting potential therapeutic targets that could be exploited to overcome resistance to conventional therapies. Conclusion This single-cell analysis provided new insights into the cellular diversity and differentiation trajectories in MM, offering a deeper understanding of the complex neuroimmune interactions that drive tumor progression and resistance. By incorporating the role of neuroinflammation and immune modulation, our study suggested novel therapeutic strategies targeting the neuroimmune axis in oncology, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective, personalized treatment approaches for MM.">

 We previously discovered that BM-derived Mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are migrating to the stroma of numerous cancers and their metastasis, forming TAFs and secrete proteins intra-tumorally. MSCs have not been used in cancer therapy because of their immune suppressive properties, limited replicative capacity, source dependent quality and controversial roles in cancer biology. Here, we report the characterization of novel MSCs (iMSCs), which were generated from adult skin fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). These iPSCs were generated via a unique, transient mRNA transfection technique and subsequently differentiated into iMSCs. Notably, iMSCs displayed contact inhibition and significantly enhanced proliferative capacity under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, outperforming bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) while fully retaining trilineage differentiation potential. Comprehensive molecular profiling, including RNA sequencing, single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF), and Luminex assays, revealed strong phenotypic and functional resemblance between iMSCs and BM-MSCs. Crucially, no sarcoma formation was detected in NSGS mice following intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intravenous administration of iMSCs, underscoring their safety profile. We further engineered a DNA cassette into these cells to enable IL-7 and IL-15 cytokine production, expressed as either individual molecules (P2A) or a single fused molecule (FUS). Both P2A and FUS cells demonstrated the capacity to drive T cell proliferation autonomously in co-culture. Cytokine secretion from these modified iMSCs enhanced tumor cell death in a triple co-culture system comprising iMSCs, the ovarian cancer cell line ID8, and human PBMCs. In a syngeneic mouse model of ovarian cancer (ID8 in C57BL/6 mice), administration of P2A or FUS MSCs resulted in reduced tumor growth and extended survival. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analyses revealed massive infiltration of T cells, macrophages, NK cells, and other immune cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME) in both FUS or P2A groups, but not in control, unmodified MSC, or PBS injected animals. Moreover, the TME in P2A- and FUS-treated mice showed enrichment in M1-type macrophages, with no detection of any of the T cell exhaustion markers tested, in contrast to the control groups (PBS or GFP-iMSC). In conclusion, our findings indicate that IL7-IL15-secreting iMSCs migrate into solid tumors, induce massive immune cell infiltration into the TME and enhance antitumor immunity in a syngeneic mouse model of cancer. These cytokine-producing iMSCs represent a promising therapeutic strategy for modulating the immune response against tumors and advancing anticancer immunotherapy by converting “cold” into “hot” tumor microenvironments.

        <tr id="Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy arising in the bone marrow. Despite advancements in therapies, this disease becomes refractory such that relapse and death is inevitable. Immune evasion and drug resistance are partly due to MM-osteoblast cell interactions in the bone marrow microenvironment (BME). We conducted complementary in-vitro and in-vivo studies, each providing insights that converge to a treatment-relevant hypothesis. Several human MM cell lines (MM.1S, U266, NCI-H929, L363) were co-cultured with osteoblasts for two days to assess proliferation in response to two proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, and carfilzomib. Osteoblasts, represented by the hFOB fetal osteoblast-derived cell line, markedly enhanced MM cell growth and conferred significant chemoresistance determined by a luciferase-based viability assay. We then performed RNA sequencing of FACS-sorted MM.1S and hFOB cells following 1 day of coculture. We found a significant upregulation of Type I Interferon (IFN) signaling pathway target genes (e.g. IRF7, ISG15, p<0.001) in co-cultured MM.1S cells compared to MM.1S cells alone. Two pro-inflammatory chemokines, CXCL1 and CXCL8, were markedly increased in hFOB co-cultured cells compared to hFOB monocultures. A 9-fold increase of CXCL1 (p<0.0001) and CXCL8 (p<0.0001) was validated by qPCR and both chemokines were elevated in co-culture supernatants in a cytokine array. Parallel studies in vivo, using the 5TGM1 MM immunocompetent mouse model, revealed that low-dose decitabine (DAC), a DNA hypomethylating agent known to induce a Type I IFN response significantly reduced MM burden (p<0.0001) and prolonged survival by 9 days (p<0.001), compared to MM-bearing mice treated with PBS vehicle. From these two lines of work, we hypothesize that low-level IFN signaling, mediated by MM cell cross-talk with osteoblasts, is supportive of MM cell proliferation and survival, while hyper-induction of the IFN pathway by DAC may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of this epigenetic-modifying agent, both alone and in combination with immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. This postulated biphasic response to Type I IFN signaling in MM cells is consistent with prior reports from other experimental systems. Our findings highlight the utility of epigenetic therapy in MM and suggest that hyper-induction of IFN signaling in MM cells, which already have low-level activation of this pathway from their interactions with osteoblasts, should be further investigated as a therapeutic mechanism.

        <tr id="Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a severe clinical syndrome characterized by high morbidity and mortality rates. Bacterial infection is a frequent precipitating factor and complication in ACLF patients, significantly worsening patient outcomes. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying bacterial infections and their impact on ACLF pathophysiology is crucial for developing effective therapies to reduce infection rates and mortality. Current research highlights that immune suppression in ACLF increases susceptibility to bacterial infections, which in turn exacerbate immune dysfunction. However, a comprehensive review summarizing the emerging mechanisms underlying this immunosuppression is currently lacking. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest research, focusing on alterations in the immune responses of innate immune cells—including monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils—as well as adaptive immune cells such as T and B lymphocytes during the onset and progression of bacterial infections in ACLF. In addition, recent advances in immunomodulatory therapies, including stem cell-based interventions, will also be discussed.">

 Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a key immune checkpoint molecule that regulates immune responses by binding to PD-1 on T cells, contributing to immune tolerance and suppression. PD-L1 expression in solid tumors has become an important biomarker for evaluating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy. Characterization of PD-L1 expression on immune cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, in patients with various solid tumors, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and breast cancer was performed using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear samples using flow cytometry. In addition to PD-L1, co-expression of markers of T cell activation (e.g., CD69, CD86, Ki67) and exhaustion (e.g., PD-1, LAG3) was analyzed to gain a comprehensive understanding of immune cell status. PD-L1 expression was highly variable across patients within solid tumor indications, with elevated expression found on CD8+ T cells, suggesting an upregulation in response to persistent tumor antigenic stimulation. Furthermore, PD-L1+ CD8+ T cells often co-expressed markers of exhaustion, such as PD-1 and LAG-3, indicating a potential role for PD-L1 in T cell dysfunction and immune evasion. These findings underscore the complexity of PD-L1 expression by immune cells and its role in shaping immune responses in solid tumor patients. Through integrating PD-L1 profiling with other markers of immune activation and exhaustion, this highlights the potential of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response and provides insights into the mechanisms of immune evasion in solid tumor cancers.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains resistant to immunotherapy due to a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Lahusen et al identify transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) as a critical tumor cell-intrinsic regulator of immune suppression in PDAC. TGM2 enhances the secretion of suppressive cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) via a microtubule-dependent pathway that secondarily impairs T-cell activation and cytotoxicity. Targeting TGM2, either genetically or with microtubule-disrupting agents, restores T cell function and promotes tumor control in preclinical PDAC models. These findings are discussed in the context of our recent work on vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling in PDAC, which independently drives immune evasion through VIP receptor (VPAC)-mediated induction of TGF-β1 secretion from tumor cells, upregulation of programmed death-ligand 1 on myeloid cells, and inhibition of effector T cells. Here, we have explored the mechanistic intersections between TGM2 and VIP signaling—including cytokine secretion, vesicle trafficking, and immune checkpoint regulation—and propose combination strategies that integrate TGM2 or VIP inhibition with checkpoint blockade. Together, these insights suggest a new framework for overcoming immune resistance in PDAC by targeting cancer cell-intrinsic secretory programs and offer a rationale for biomarker-guided, multimodal immunotherapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematologic cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). This leads to significant dysfunction and suppression of the immune system in affected patients. Myeloma cells employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate immune and non-immune cells, evading immune surveillance and enhancing their survival. One key factor in this evasion is the disruption of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune mechanisms. Extensive evidence indicates that in the presence of myeloma cells, DC numbers are notably reduced, and their phenotype and function are altered, impairing their ability to present antigens and activate robust T-cell responses effectively. Despite rapid advances in MM treatment, with promising strategies such as DC-based vaccines being already achieved, DC dysfunction remains a substantial hurdle, associated with or contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes, disease relapse, and MM’s persistence as an incurable disease. To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms through which myeloma cells transform DCs into their “accomplices,” undermining immune responses. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the role of DCs in MM. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of DCs in anti-MM immunotherapy, discussing persistent challenges and highlighting emerging perspectives that may lead to promising breakthroughs for improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological cancer. It remains incurable, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. In this study, we investigated a panel of peptides derived from a functional motif of Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family 1 (SLAMF1) with single amino acid substitutions and found that several of them exhibited potent anti-cancer activity by inducing MM cell death. The most potent peptide P7N4 significantly reduced the viability of both IL-6-dependent and -independent human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), proteasome inhibitor-resistant MM cells, and primary MM cells, while exerting minimal effects on healthy blood cells. Furthermore, P7N4 enhanced the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan. When combined with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, P7N4 potentiated the anti-cancer effect of bortezomib in a highly aggressive murine MM model. Mechanistically, P7N4 induced apoptosis in MM cells by disrupting key pro-survival pathways, leading to reduction in IRF4, MYC, and β-catenin levels, as well as inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in peptide-sensitive HMCL, P7N4 significantly altered the expression of IRF4-associated genes. These effects were likely mediated by direct interaction of peptide with IRF4, targeting this transcription factor for degradation. Overall, our findings established P7N4 as a promising therapeutic candidate for MM, warranting further optimization and in-depth mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Background Immune evasion is a crucial event in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The identification of new immunotherapeutic targets may provide a promising platform for advancing PDAC treatment. This study aims to investigate the role of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase-5 (B4GALT5) in immune evasion by pancreatic cancer cells and evaluate its potential as an immunotherapeutic target. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis using RNA sequencing data and tissue microarrays from patients with PDAC to investigate the association between B4GALT5 expression and patient prognosis. Using animal models, we further explored the impact of B4GALT5 on the quantity and activity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. RNA sequencing and co-immunoprecipitation were used to explore the mechanism by which B4GALT5 regulates major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) levels. Results Our study demonstrates that high expression of B4GALT5 in tumor cells is significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with PDAC and reduced cytotoxic activity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Specifically, B4GALT5 suppresses MHC-I expression in tumor cells through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway, enabling them to evade immune surveillance by CD8+ T cells. Conclusions B4GALT5 impairs CD8+ T-cell recognition of tumor cells by regulating MHC-I levels, thereby promoting immune evasion. This makes B4GALT5 a highly promising immunotherapeutic target for improving the poor prognosis of patients with PDAC.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vehicles (EVs) are reported to be involved in several processes relating to tumor progression, including angiogenesis, osteolysis, and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). However, the role of EVs in the immune-suppressive milieu of MM is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of MM-derived EVs on T cells, focusing on markers of T cell exhaustion. Using activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors, we observed immunosuppressive effects such as upregulated expression of immune checkpoint markers on CD8+ T cells treated with MM-derived EVs. Proteomic analysis identified several proteins, such as IL-8, SLC1A5, PIN2, and FSP1, associated with regulation of T cell exhaustion and chronic inflammation. Surprisingly, sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) was enriched in MM cell line-derived EVs, implicating SPHK1/S1P signaling in the immunosuppressive effect of MM EVs. Thus, MM-derived EVs may promote T cell exhaustion via upregulating the expression of immune checkpoint markers and thereby contribute to the formation of the immune-suppressive milieu of MM, resulting in impaired T cell activity.">

 Solid tumors consist of tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), a dynamic system comprising various immune cells, mesenchymal cells, cytokines, microvesicles, extracellular matrix, and vascular lymphatic networks. The recruitment of lymphocytes into tumors is essential for effective anti-tumor immunity and successful immunotherapy. The tumor stroma serves as the initial site for effector immune cell infiltration, and the mesenchymal network directly influences immune cell function. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the largest proportion of TME intrinsic stromal cells, with significant heterogeneity and multiple origins, and perform different biological functions. CAFs can not only induce PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, but also promote PD-L1 expression in TME immune cells through the release of cytokines and vesicles, thereby facilitating tumor immune escape. In this study, we found that in some breast cancer patients, PD-L1 in tumor stroma was abundantly expressed and associated with immunosuppression and poor prognosis, and the distribution of tumor stromal PD-L1 was also closely related to the activation status of CAFs. Furthermore, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing on PD-L1low and PD-L1high stroma cells, respectively. We found a CAF subset in high PD-L1 expression group, which was characterized by immune exhaustion and hyperactivation. Notably, Regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) pathways were significantly upregulated in this subset. Furthermore, we confirmed that RGS4 induces fibroblasts to adopt a PD-L1 immunodepleting phenotype and establishes an immune-exhaustive mesenchymal network that modulates anti-tumor immunity. In addition, we validated in humanized murine models that targeting RGS4 significantly enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy in animal models. The spatial heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression in TME is a primary factor contributing to the limited efficacy of PD-L1/PD-1 antibody therapies. Currently, numerous studies aim to enhance the immune response by inhibiting or degrading PD-L1. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing PD-L1's spatial distribution could fundamentally enhance its clinical application. This study explored the mechanism governing the spatial distribution difference of PD-L1, and provided more possibilities for the development of targeted intervention in CAFs.

 Immunotherapy is a powerful pillar of cancer therapy that still faces barriers due to cancer-mediated immunosuppression. Immunogenic cell death recruits and activates antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through engagement of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to pro-inflammatory Signal 3 cytokine production required for full activation of adaptive immune cells, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The Fes tyrosine kinase suppresses innate immune responses in APCs by inhibiting PRR signaling and regulating cytokine trafficking. In non-cancer contexts, Fes may guard against consequences of overactive innate immunity, such as endotoxic shock or autoimmunity. However, this inhibitory effect on APCs may serve as a checkpoint to suppress successful anti-cancer immunotherapy by obstructing efficient priming of cancer specific CTLs. We hypothesize that Fes inhibition in APCs will improve Signal 3 cytokine signaling, resulting in greater adaptive immunity and tumor control.



 Using bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from wildtype (WT) or Fes knockout (fes-/-) mice, we assessed LPS-induced PRR signalling by immunoblot analysis, production of key Signal 3 cytokines by multiplex ELISA, and the level of cell-associated cytokines by flow cytometry. The ability of BMDMs to prime CTLs was assessed in antigen cross-presentation co-cultures with OT-1 T cells. Using E0771 and B16F10 syngeneic orthotopic mouse engraftment models, we compared the efficacy of doxorubicin and anti-PD-1 to control tumor growth and prolong survival in WT and fes-/- mice. Tumors and spleen immune profiles were analyzed by flow cytometry. WT or fes-/- BMDMs were adoptively transferred into E0771 and B16F10 tumours to directly assess their relative ability to control tumour growth.



 fes-/- BMDMs displayed improved PRR signaling, increased IFNβ, IL-12, and TNFα secretion, and greater levels of internal and cell-surface IL-12 following LPS stimulation. In antigen cross-presentation assays, LPS stimulated fes-/- BMDMs had improved CTL priming. Tumor control and survival were greater in fes-/- mice in both the E0771 and B16F10 engraftment models. Doxorubicin and the combination of doxorubicin and anti-PD-1 were more effective in fes-/-. This was especially striking in the B16F10 model, which is known to be resistant to PD-1 therapy. Immune profiling of tumors showed increased CTL and NK cell activation and PD-1 positivity, and a shift from predominately M2- to M1-polarized tumor associated macrophages in fes-/- mice. Intratumorally injected M1-polarized fes-/- BMDMs were better able to control tumor growth in both E0771 and B16F10 models.



 Fes acts as an innate immune checkpoint whose inhibition may enhance anti-cancer immunotherapy. We believe this effect is due to an increase in inflammatory signalling, and improved signal 3 cytokine signalling in fes-/- APCs.

 The checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 have been clinically successful as therapeutics for melanoma due to their ability to reinvigorate the immune system. However, about half of patients do not benefit from these treatments, suggesting there are still barriers to CD8+ T cell activation or infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Additionally, while the combination therapy of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 (Ipilimumab-Nivolumab) improves response rate and overall survival compared to monotherapies, it also leads to increased toxicity and immune-related adverse events. Recent studies have demonstrated that CD8+ T cell co-stimulation through the 41BB axis is critical for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade efficacy in melanoma, yet those signals may be limited or unavailable to tumor-associated antigen-specific T cells within the TME. However, nontargeted 4-1BB signaling poses a risk of widespread peripheral immune activation and liver toxicity, as was the case for the 4-1BB agonist Urelumab. PF-08046049 (BB228) is a bispecific molecule comprised of a CD228-specific antibody and 4-1BB-directed Anticalin proteins. CD228 is highly expressed in several cancer indications but is low on normal tissues, thus BB228 targets 4-1BB co-stimulation to T cells within the TME. We tested the efficacy of BB228 as a monotherapy and in combination with the current melanoma standard of care (SOC) treatments, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4. In an IO-resistant LL2 model, neither BB228 nor anti-PD-1 monotherapy led to tumor control. However, in combination, BB228 synergized with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 to promote tumor clearance. We found that while anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 can target and expand stem-like CD8+ T cells in both the tumor-draining lymph node and TME, BB228 is able to drive the differentiation of those stem-like cells into effectors, resulting in tumor killing. These data illustrate that BB228 has a distinct and complementary mechanism of action from the current melanoma SOC treatments.

        <tr id="Background. Blockade of Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) significantly improves progression-free survival of individuals with cancers, including melanoma. In addition to unleashing antitumor immunity, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapies disrupt immune regulatory networks critical for maintaining homeostasis in various tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Despite growing reports of cancer- and ICI-related cognitive impairments among survivors, our understanding of the pathophysiology of ICI-related neurodegenerative effects is limited. Methods. In this study, using a murine model of melanoma, cognitive function tests, and neuroimmunological assays, we investigate the cellular mechanisms and impact of combinatorial blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 on brain function. Syngeneic melanoma was induced in a C57Bl6 mouse model using D4M-3A.UV2 melanoma cells. After confirmation of tumor growth, cancer-bearing and non-cancer mice received combinatorial treatment of anti-CTLA-4 (two doses per week) and anti-PD-1 (three doses per week) for three weeks. One month after completing ICI treatment, mice were administered learning, memory, and memory consolidation cognitive function tasks. Neuroinflammation, synaptic, and myelin integrity analyses and immune cell status in the brain were conducted to analyze neuroimmunological changes post-ICI treatment. Results. While tumor-related alterations in brain function were evident, combination ICI specifically disrupted synaptic integrity and reduced myelin levels independent of neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity in both cancer-bearing and non-cancer mice brains. Combination ICI selectively impaired hippocampal-dependent cognitive function. This is associated with two-fold increase in T cell numbers within the brain along with immune activation of myeloid cells, especially microglia. Furthermore, an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model revealed that combination ICI predisposes the CNS to exacerbated autoimmunity, highlighting neuroinflammation-related, and tumor-independent, neurodegenerative sequelae of combination ICI. Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that combinatorial blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 destabilizes neuroimmune-regulatory networks and activates microglia, contributing to long-term neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments. Therefore, selectively limiting microglial activation could be a potential avenue to preserve CNS functions while maintaining the therapeutic benefits of rapidly evolving ICIs and their combinations.">

 The effectiveness of current cancer immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), adoptive T cell therapy (ACT), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, is limited in solid tumors due to the scarcity of tumor-specific immunogenic targets, impaired tumor antigen processing, and immune cell dysfunction. Cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are the primary effectors in antitumor immunity, yet their dysfunctional or exhausted states present significant challenges to successful immunotherapy. Recent study of pre-infusion CAR T cells in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have identified polyfunctional T cell subsets that exhibit engagement of diverse immune programs, characterized by the production of various cytokines and chemokines (IFN-γ, GMZB, and MIP1a) which corroborated with enhanced patient survival. In our previous clinical study involving ACT in melanoma patients (NCT00665470), we observed engraftment of CD8+ T cell clones without objective antitumor responses (non-responders), while spontaneous complete responses were noted in two patients prior to ACT (responders). A comparative analysis of CD8+ T cell clones derived from responders versus non-responders identified Cytotoxic and Regulatory T cell Molecule (CRTAM) as a differentially expressed gene in activated CD8+ T cell clones from responders. We propose CRTAM as a predictive marker for a potent and durable CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor response and to explore its potential role in enhancing the antitumor efficacy of ACT and CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors. We have thus far established the role of CRTAM in defining enhanced effector functions of murine cytotoxic CD8+ T cells by examining antigen specific P - Mel CRTAMHi Vs CRTAMLo CD8+ T cell subsets with CRTAMHi T cells showing enhanced cytotoxic profile (perforin/ GMZB), cytokine production (IFN- γ), antitumor cytotoxicity, immunophenotype and gene profile using both in vitro and in vivo models. RNA sequencing analysis reveals that CRTAMHi P-Mel T cells exhibit a unique gene expression profile associated with cytokine activity, signal transduction, cell migration, and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, increased overall survival in patients with solid tumors exhibiting T cell infiltration and increased CRTAM expression was demonstrated by query of publicly available databases, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Therefore, CRTAM identifies a unique subset of CTL with enhanced effector functions, with deployment of diverse immune programs leading to improved antitumor activity. T cells engineering to knockout and express CRTAM is currently underway to evaluate the feasibility of enhancing antitumor responses in, in vivo murine models of ACT. Engineering CD8+ T cells for CRTAM may generate more effective and durable T cell products for ACT and CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors.

        <tr id="Lung tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) are critical for the local control of respiratory tract infections caused by influenza A viruses (IAV). Here we compare TRM populations induced by intranasal adenoviral vector vaccines encoding hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein (NP) with those induced by an H1N1 infection in BALB/c mice. While vaccine-induced TRM express high levels of CD103 and persist longer in the lung parenchyma, short-lived, H1N1-induced TRM have a transcriptome associated with higher cytotoxic potential and distinct transcriptional profile as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing. In both the vaccine and H1N1 groups, NP-specific CD8+ T cells expand during heterologous influenza virus infection and protect the mice from disease. Meanwhile, lung inflammation in response to an infection with unrelated respiratory syncytial virus do not influence the fate of pre-existing TRM. Our preclinical work thus confirms that inflammatory conditions in the tissue shape the phenotypic and functional characteristics of TRM to serve relevant informations for optimizing mucosal vaccines.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The therapeutic landscape for MS has evolved significantly since the 1990s, with the development of more than 20 different disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). These therapies effectively manage relapses and inflammation, but most have failed to meaningfully prevent disease progression. While classically understood as a T cell-mediated condition, the most effective DMTs in slowing progression also target B cells. Novel classes of MS therapies in development, including anti-CD40L monoclonal antibodies, CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors show greater capacity to target and eliminate B cells in the brain/CNS, as well as impacting T-cell and innate immune compartments. These approaches may help tackle the disease at its immunopathological core, addressing both peripheral and central immune responses that drive MS progression. Another emerging therapeutic strategy is to use bispecific antibodies, which have the potential for dual-targeting various disease aspects such as immune activation and neurodegeneration. As such, the next generation of MS therapies may be the first to reduce both inflammatory demyelination and disease progression in a clinically meaningful way. Their ability to target specific immune cell populations while minimizing broad immune suppression could also lead to better safety profiles. Here, we explore the biological rationale, advantages, limitations, and clinical progress of these emerging immunotherapies for relapsing–remitting and progressive forms of MS.">

        <tr id="In many cancers, the tumor microenvironment is enriched with cholesterol due to increased biosynthesis and uptake by cancer cells, resulting in the accumulation of cholesterol, cholesterol esters, oxysterols and other metabolites with various functions. These molecules serve as structural components, energy sources and intracellular signaling mediators, while their toxic by-products are secreted to suppress anti-tumor immune activity and prevent lipid peroxidation that could induce cancer cell apoptosis. Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment also contribute to cholesterol dynamics. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) release cholesterol to support tumor cell metabolism, while myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) also release cholesterol and consume essential metabolites such as L-arginine, which impairs T-cell proliferation and activation. Elevated cholesterol in dendritic cells impairs migration and tumor antigen presentation and, in lymphocytes, favors the development of a regulatory T cells (Treg) phenotype and inhibits the release of antitumor cytokines, further weakening the immune response. These findings suggest that targeting cholesterol metabolism is a promising strategy for cancer treatment, improving the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. In this manuscript, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of cholesterol on the tumor immune landscape are reviewed and the potential of cholesterol-lowering drugs to enhance antitumor immune responses is explored.">

 Cytokine therapies improve antigen priming, increase effector immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and enhance cytolytic activity. There is strong interest in the interleukin (IL) family to activate effector immune cells in the TIME. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is known for its pro-inflammatory effects, T-cell differentiation properties, regulation of natural killer (NK) cell responses, and production of interferon-gamma (IFNγ). The TIME in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) impairs tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte function, decreases the production of effector cytokines, and contains suppressive immunocytes. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in several solid cancers with similar mutation burden and immune infiltration as HNSCC. However, most HNSCC patients do not respond to treatment with single-agent immunotherapy, in large part due to the immunosuppressive TIME. Therefore developing strategies to mitigate the suppressive tumor immune microenvironment and elicit a robust anti-tumor immune response through combinatorial treatments is key. Herein, we combined anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (α-PD-1) with IL-12 to reverse exhausted phenotypes and activate effector immune cells in the HNSCC TIME. We hypothesize that the combination of IL-12 and α-PD-1 therapy will stimulate anti-tumor effector immunocytes to target immune-infiltrated and immune-excluded TIME in the preclinical oral cancer models, MOC1 and MOC2. Continuous treatments of intratumoral IL-12 and systemic α-PD-1 either as monotherapies or in combination were administered to MOC1 tumor-burdened mice. We observed tumor regression in the MOC1 tumor-burdened mice with IL-12 + α-PD-1 combinatorial treatments, IL-12, and α-PD-1 monotherapies. Mice that rejected the primary tumor challenge were rechallenged with MOC1 cells. We observed complete responses in IL-12 + α-PD-1 treatment groups and tumor regression in IL-12 monotherapy groups. Additionally, in the more aggressive HNSCC preclinical model, MOC2, IL-12 treatments led to prolonged survival. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of IL-12 + α-PD-1 combinatorial treatments in an immune-infiltrated HNSCC preclinical model. Future studies will include the addition of small molecules, such as Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) agonists, to enhance antigen presentation and activate anti-tumor effector cells to combat an aggressive TIME.

        <tr id="Effective co-stimulation of CD8 T cells is critical for maintenance of TCF-1+ stem-like CD8 T cells necessary for long-term tumor control. NKG2D co-stimulation of CD8 T cells via binding of stress ligands such as membrane-bound MIC enhances CD8 T cell effector functions and is important for promoting memory development. Cancer cells often shed MIC into a soluble form (sMIC) that inhibits CD8 T cell activation. TRAMP prostate tumor mice expressing human MICB (TRAMP/MICB) treated with anti-sMIC/MIC antibody elicited potent anti-tumor responses with re-invigorated CD8 T cell immunity. However, mechanisms of CD8 T cell reprogramming by NKG2D co-stimulation in the tumor microenvironment are poorly understood. In this study, we used scRNA-seq of CD8 TILs from TRAMP/MICB mice treated or untreated with the anti-sMIC/MIC antibody to investigate the hypothesis that anti-sMIC/MIC therapy reprograms CD8 T cells via NKG2D pathway co-stimulation, optimizing TCR-dependent effector and memory responses. Adult male TRAMP/MICB mice were treated with 200µg anti-sMIC/MIC antibody intraperitoneally twice per week for 4-6 weeks. Prostate tumors were collected, and CD45+ cells were flow sorted for scRNA-seq. scRNA-seq analyses were validated using flow cytometry. Tumors from mice treated with anti-sMIC/MIC therapy revealed enhanced functional heterogeneity of CD8 T cell subtypes. In contrast to tumors from untreated mice that were populated with primarily effector and/or exhausted CD8 T cells, tumors from treated mice were enriched in NKG2D+ TCF-1+ stem-like CD8 T cells. This effect of anti-sMIC/MIC therapy was then recapitulated in the syngeneic TRAMP-C2-MICB tumor model. TCF-1+ CD8 T cells expressed higher levels of NKG2D compared to TCF-1- CD8 T cells, and displayed differential utilization of PI3K/Akt signaling pathways as well as upregulation of epigenetic regulators of CD8 T cell function such as Kdm6b and Setd2. Antigen-specific CD8 T cells chronically stimulated ex vivo with anti-sMIC/MIC antibody in complex with sMICB maintained greater proportions of TCF-1+ stem-like CD8 T cells compared to antigen stimulation alone or in combination with sMICB. The results suggest that NKG2D co-stimulation via anti-MIC/sMIC therapy reprograms CD8 TILs to promote their development of TCF-1+ stem-like function necessary for persistence of the anti-tumor response, and provides proof-of-concept for the translational potential of NKG2D signaling modulation in CD8 T cells to treat cancer.

 Despite significant advancements in understanding the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor microenvironment (TME) through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and the development of novel therapeutic combinations, PDAC remains one of the deadliest cancers, with a five-year survival rate of ∼3%. Notably, survival outcomes are particularly worse in males compared to females. The limited efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies, in PDAC has been attributed to a profoundly immunosuppressive TME driven by M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Our translational studies demonstrated that dual blockade of PD-1 and VPAC stimulates CD8+ T cell activity and eradicates tumors in ∼50% of mice across various PDAC models. We hypothesized that a combinatorial ICI strategy is targeting TAM-driven immunosuppression in the TME and could enhance T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity in PDAC. To test this hypothesis, we performed in vivo tumor growth and survival experiments in syngeneic PDAC models. We also conducted RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) polarized to M1/M2 phenotypes to investigate immune checkpoint expressions, supplemented by scRNAseq analysis of TAM from PDAC patients using public datasets. Using VIP-knockout mice, we explored the mechanisms underlying VPAC blockade-mediated tumor control. As anticipated, syngeneic PDAC tumors (e.g., KPC-luc and MT5) grew significantly slower in VIP-knockout mice compared to wildtype controls. Notably, the anti-tumor response was markedly superior in female VIP-knockout mice compared to males. To dissect the cellular basis of this sexual dimorphism, we depleted specific immune subsets, including T cells and TAM. Phagocytic TAM depletion accelerated tumor growth in females but had no effect on males, while the depletion of other immune subsets increased tumor growth in both sexes. In vitro, androgen receptor (AR) inhibition (mimicking the female phenotype) reversed the suppressive state of BMDM, marked by reduced Arg1, CD206, and PD-L1 expression. In vivo, AR inhibition or PD-L1 loss significantly enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of VIP blockade in male mice. Mechanistically, RNAseq and Western blotting revealed increased VPAC1 expression on IC21 and BMDM cells following AR inhibition, reflecting the female-like phenotype. These findings suggest that androgen and VIP pathways mediate sexual dimorphism in TAM phagocytosis, which limits ICI efficacy in PDAC. VPAC1 and PD-L1 are identified as potential sex-specific phagocytosis checkpoints, providing promising therapeutic targets to overcome sex-based differences in PDAC immunotherapy outcomes.

        <tr id="The immune system plays a major role in pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a devastating lung disease with limited treatment options. Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immune cells with remarkable immunosuppressive functions. We hypothesized that their anti‐inflammatory activity may dampen PF by inhibiting inflammation and its transition to fibrosis. Here, we studied the emergence of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)‐ and monocytic (M)‐MDSCs in a murine model of PF. We assessed immunological, histopathological, and clinical changes at days 3, 7, 14, and 21 following bleomycin challenge. A comprehensive overview of the role of MDSCs during the acute lung injury and chronic phase of pulmonary fibrosis is provided, along with the effects of MDSCs adoptive transfer and depletion. Inflammation and fibrosis increased over a period of 21 days after bleomycin administration. In the lung, the number of PMN‐MDSCs increased, while M‐MDSCs decreased over the time following bleomycin challenge. Especially, M‐MDSCs showed enhanced suppressive activity on day 3 following bleomycin challenge. Adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs attenuated inflammation and fibrosis development. However, depletion of PMN‐MDSCs did not lead to an exacerbation of PF. Our results suggest that adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs can ameliorate the inflammatory responses and thus the development of fibrosis in a bleomycin‐induced pulmonary fibrosis model.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a survival rate under 13%. Treatments like immunotherapy and chemotherapy are ineffective in PDAC due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, in which tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are a major component. The immunosuppressive function of TANs has been shown to depend upon increased production of reactive oxygen species, with myeloperoxidase being a major source of it. We investigated the contribution of myeloperoxidase in mediating tumor-associated neutrophils immunosuppression using orthotopic PDAC models in wild-type and syngeneic myeloperoxidase-deficient mice. We observed a significant delay in tumor growth and improved clinical scores when myeloperoxidase was deficient. Additionally, treatment with the myeloperoxidase-specific inhibitor verdiperstat delayed tumor growth. Flow cytometry analysis of the tumor microenvironment revealed a significant increase in CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in MPO-deficient mice, accompanied by elevated granzyme B levels in both cell subsets. Additionally, MPO deficiency was associated with increased expression of activation and memory markers among both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Ex vivo studies with isolated TANs from tumor-bearing mice showed reduced CD8+ T cell and NK cell suppression, and reactive oxygen species level in the absence of myeloperoxidase. These data suggests that loss of myeloperoxidase in TANs results in decreased immunosuppressive functions and increased cytotoxic and activated T cells and NK cells within the tumor microenvironment. Depletion of NK cells in myeloperoxidase-deficient mice abolished the antitumor effects observed with myeloperoxidase loss, underscoring the critical role of NK cells as key mediators of the antitumor response in the absence of myeloperoxidase. Additionally, we observed an enhanced chemotherapy (Gemcitabine) and immunotherapy (anti-PD1 and ant-CTLA4) response with myeloperoxidase deficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate the contribution of myeloperoxidase in regulating PDAC tumor progression, TAN immunosuppression, treatment response and immune cell infiltration using an orthotopic PDAC model.

 Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but remains largely ineffective in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A hallmark of PDAC is local immunosuppression, driving cytotoxic T cell exclusion and deactivation, undermining immune-mediated tumor control. Better understanding of the cellular crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and identifying stromal and immune populations shaping this immunosuppressive landscape is critically needed. Oncogenic KRAS activation in PDAC cells promotes recruitment and proliferation of tumor-supporting stromal cells while excluding cancer-targeted cytotoxic T cells. Local immunosuppression is driven by interactions between subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and resident myeloid cells. Previous efforts to reverse immunosuppression by targeting individual stromal populations have largely failed, highlighting the complexity of stromal interactions in the TME. The stromal diversity of PDAC complicates investigating paracrine signaling involving multiple cell types. To address this, we use in vivo mouse models that recapitulate human disease, alongside a novel tumor explant system enabling short-term culture of intact human or murine PDAC tissue. These explants retain histopathological architecture and cellular diversity, providing a medium-throughput platform for testing drugs and mechanistic hypotheses in the native TME. Preliminary data show that Smoothened inhibition (SMOi) reduces myCAF proliferation and activity but drives CD11b-positive myeloid cell expansion in vivo. We hypothesize local immunosuppression in PDAC is sustained by a delicate balance between myCAFs and myeloid cells, collectively hindering T cell infiltration. Single-cell RNA sequencing of control vs. SMOi-treated murine PDAC identified stromal subpopulations maintaining immunosuppression and revealed specific myeloid subtypes emerging after SMOi. Strikingly, combining SMOi with anti-Gr1 or CCR1 inhibition (CCR1i) markedly increased cytotoxic T cell numbers—up to 20-fold—within the TME. We are now exploring whether these T cells’ activity can be further enhanced using additional immunomodulatory agents. Testing therapeutic combinations in the same TME allows us to identify synergistic effects that may inform future PDAC immunotherapy. Our work elucidates complex immunosuppressive mechanisms in PDAC, leveraging a novel tumor explant system and in vivo models. Our ultimate goal is to develop translatable regimens that neutralize local immunosuppression, enabling cytotoxic T cells to infiltrate, proliferate, and effectively attack cancer cells.

 CD19-targeted therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T or T-cell engagers (TCE), have been approved for the treatment of B cell malignancies. By depleting autoreactive B cells, CD19-targeted CAR-T have shown early yet promising efficacy in treating patients with B cell-driven autoimmune diseases. However, the clinical application of TCE continues to be greatly hindered by the unfavorable pharmacokinetics and toxicity associated with cytokine release syndrome. Here we developed a "2+1" CD19 x CD3 TCE, ATG-201, which effectively depletes B cells with minimal risk of CRS and IgG-like PK profile. It demonstrates potent anti-disease in vivo efficacy in mouse models for lymphoma and autoimmune diseases.



 ATG-201 was constructed by introducing a high affinity, novel conformational epitope-targeted anti-CD3 single chain fragment variable (scFv) to the hinge region of one of the heavy chains of a CD19 monoclonal antibody. It was evaluated in a series of in vitro studies for binding affinity, T cell dependent cytotoxicity (TDCC) cytokine release, and drug developability. The in vivo anti-lymphoma efficacy and pharmacodynamic effect were evaluated in Raji xenograft model. The tissue reside B cell depletion was assessed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells humanized NDG-hIL-15 mice. Pharmacokinetic parameters of ATG-201 was evaluated in normal Balb/c mice.



 ATG-201 showed limited CD3+ T cell binding before CD19-crosslinking. It activated T cells and only in the presence of CD19+ cells. It induced potent TDCC against CD19 positive cells with pM range IC50. ATG-201 demonstrated stronger naïve B cell depletion activity with much lower cytokine release compared to benchmark TCEs in vitro. ATG-201 showed potent anti-lymphoma activity in PBMC-humanized subcutaneous Raji xenograft model with significant augment of infiltrated CD8+ T cells in tumor microenvironment and limited proinflammatory cytokines detected in plasma. Single dose ATG-201 completely and deeply depleted B cells in blood, bone marrow and spleen of CD34+ cells humanized NDG-hIL-15 mice. ATG-201 exhibited a mAb-like pharmacokinetic profile in Balb/c mice with a T1/2 of ∼300h. ATG-201 was stable at high concentration (125mg/ml) and under stress conditions. The surrogate CD19xCD3 TCE demonstrated potent efficacy in mouse systemic lupus erythematosus model, inhibiting the lymph node swelling and auto-antibody producing.



 ATG-201 demonstrates CD19-dependent CD3 binding and activation, inducing effective B cell depletion in vitro and in vivo with low cytokine release, which provides potential for the treatment of B cell malignancies and B cell related autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has become standard of care in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Changes in immunophenotypes observed at first diagnosis predict therapy outcome but little is known about the resolution of these alterations in remission. Comprehensive characterization of immune changes from fresh, peripheral whole blood revealed a functionally relevant increase of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, reduced naïve T-cells, and an increase of activated and terminally differentiated T-cells before treatment which aggravated after therapy. Suggesting causal relation, injection of lymphoma in mice induced similar changes in the murine T cells. Distinct immune imprints were found in breast cancer and AML survivors. Identified alterations persisted beyond five years of ongoing complete remission and in DLBCL correlated with increased pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-6, B2M, or sCD14. The chronic inflammation was associated with functionally blunted T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides and reduced responses correlated with reduced Tn-cells. Persisting inflammation was confirmed by deep sequencing and by cytokine profiles, together pointing towards a compensatory activation of innate immunity. The persisting, lymphoma-induced immune alterations in remission may explain long-term complications, have implications for vaccine strategies, and are likely relevant for immunotherapies.">

 Tumor-associated factors released by cancer cells can promote immune suppression and tolerance to radiation or immune therapy. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) is a tumor-associated antigen released by cancer cells. In cervical cancer, elevated pre-treatment SCCA in the serum is seen in 28-88% of patients and these patients are more likely to experience treatment resistance and recurrence. The poor prognosis for patients with elevated SCCA shows the need for improve treatment strategies. Here, we aim to understand the mechanism of action of circulating SCCA to tumor progression and response to radiotherapy. Using sequencing analysis of paired pre- versus on-treatment biopsies, we found that patients with elevated serum SCCA had increased macrophages expressing immunosuppressive features and T-cell immune checkpoints, inversely correlated with inflammatory signaling and radiation-induced interferon-stimulated gene expression. The supplement of SCCA protein (rSCCA) to the media during in vitro macrophage differentiation promotes anti-inflammatory cytokines and gene expression. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice treated with intra-peritoneal rSCCA expressed high M2-associated markers and functional inhibition of T cell activation. Moreover, we found that mouse tumors engineered to express SCCA with a signal peptide promoting extracellular secretion displayed increased CSF1R+ TAM infiltration and decreased T cell activation, associated with reduced response to combined radiation and anti-PDL1 treatment. Giving the findings, we hypothesized that targeting TAMs in tumors with elevated SCCA is imperative. We further demonstrated that tumor-bearing mice showed improved response to radiation and immune checkpoint therapy when receiving concurrent CSF1R blockade, abolishing the protective effect of high circulating SCCA. Our results suggest that blockade of CSF1R signaling or other myeloid-targeting therapeutics will optimize response to radiation and PD-L1 blockade in cervical cancer, particularly those with high circulating SCCA.

        <tr id="With the advent of new therapeutic approaches, there is hope that anticancer treatment will eventually be possible without the use of chemotherapy. Efficient immunotherapeutic options have recently emerged in many cancers, offering a less aggressive approach, with overall better tolerance, making them also suitable for frail patients. Response to immunotherapy relies on the availability, functionality, and efficacy of the host’s immune effector mechanisms. One of the key factors determining the efficacy of immunotherapy is the tumor microenvironment, which encompasses various immune effectors, including macrophages, which play a crucial role in regulating immune responses through phagocytosis and antigen presentation. Macrophages are prototypically divided, according to their polarization, into either the pro-inflammatory M1 type or the anti-inflammatory M2 type. In the tumor microenvironment, M2-polarized macrophages, known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), are the predominant phenotype and are associated with tumor progression. The M1/M2 paradigm contributes to the understanding of tumor progression. Due to the variable microenvironment, the mechanisms regulating TAMs can vary across different cancers. Variations in TAM polarization may account for the different treatment responses in patients with similar diseases. This paper investigates the connection between TAMs, disease progression, and treatment responses in the most frequent solid hematologic cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by a dense tumor stroma and a five-year survival rate of less than 13%. Its poor prognosis arises from rapid progression, early metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Despite, advancements in chemotherapy and immunotherapy, outcomes remain dismal, largely due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Previous work in our lab demonstrated the efficacy of ivosidenib, an FDA-approved inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), also inhibits wild-type IDH1(wtIDH1) under conditions mimicking the PDAC TME. Here we show that targeting wtIDH1 suppresses cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and enhancing antitumor immune responses by reducing immunosuppressive immune cell populations. In vitro studies were conducted using Miapaca-2, Panc-1 and KPC cell lines. Cells were cultured in low glucose (2.5mM) and low magnesium (0.08mM) media to mimic the TME. Cell viability was assessed using Titer-Glow, Pico Green and colony formation assays. Cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels were determined via DCFDA and Mito-SOX assays using colorimetric and flow cytometry analysis. The therapeutic potential of ivosidenib, was evaluated through cell proliferation (Cell Trace assay), cell cycle arrest (BrdU) assay via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, and apoptosis detection (Annexin-V/PI staining). In vivo studies employed orthotopic and autochthonous murine models of PDAC to assess drug efficacy and its impact on immune cell infiltration in the TME. Our data revealed that targeting wtIDH1 suppress cell proliferation and DNA synthesis and elevated cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels leading to increased apoptosis. In orthotropic pancreatic murine models of pancreatic cancer, ivosidenib treatment significantly increased the infiltration of immune cells (CD45+), and CD4+ T cells in particular, including naïve T (CD45RA) and central memory T cells (CD45RO). Additionally CD127 expression was enhanced, promoting the survival and proliferation of naïve and memory T cells, potentially boosting anti-tumor immunity. Notably, treatment led to reduction of anti-inflammatory M2-like monocytes and adaptive immunity associated CD8+T cells, suggesting reshaped immune landscape favoring antitumor responses. Wild-type IDH1 plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer. Our data demonstrates that IDH1 inhibition not only reduces cancer cell proliferation in vitro but also remodels the TME in in vivo, enhancing immune responsiveness. Modulation of the TME via IDH1 inhibition offers a promising avenue to improve efficacy of existing therapies, including chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors as a part of combination treatment strategies.

However, the roles of different T-cell types, such as CD69+ and CD69− T cells, remain unclear, particularly in relation to their location within or outside the tumor. This study aims to clarify their functions and prognostic significance in HCC. We found that CD69− T cells within tumors are linked to better patient outcomes, likely due to reduced exhaustion, while CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cells in non-tumor liver tissues play a key role in immune surveillance. These findings suggest that analyzing immune cells based on their spatial distribution could improve immunotherapy strategies. Additionally, these T cells may serve as biomarkers for predicting cancer recurrence and treatment response, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatment approaches.">

        <tr id="In a recent study published in Cancer Cell , Braun et al. introduced extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) as a novel immunomodulatory approach to mitigate immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) without compromising anti-tumor immunity. 1 ECP suppressed Th1/Trm cell activation and neutrophil in ﬁ ltration while enhancing an anti-in ﬂ ammatory macrophage phenotype through adiponectin, facilitating the resolution of steroid-refractory irAEs. Given the increasing application of ICIs in cancer therapy, ECP might offer a promising alternative to glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive treatments that may diminish therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy. 2 ECP is an immunomodulatory therapy initially developed for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Its clinical applications have expanded to include conditions such as acute graft-versus-host disease and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. 3 The procedure involves leukapheresis, photoactivation, and reinfusion of treated cells. This article explores the mechanisms of action in immune regulation in the context of irAEs. Braun et al. investigated the impact of ECP vs. glucocorticoids on anti-PD-1 therapy in multiple cancer models. 1 Their ﬁ ndings revealed that glucocorticoids treatment led to reduced survival, increased tumor burden, and diminished in ﬁ ltration of tumor-speci ﬁ c T cells across various cancers, including melanoma, lung, colon, and renal cancers. Conversely, ECP preserved anti-PD-1 ef ﬁ cacy by maintaining tumor-speci ﬁ c T cell responses while also mitigating irAEs. The study also identi ﬁ ed recipient-derived adiponectin as">

        <tr id="Melanoma, being one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer, is characterized by its aggressive and metastatic nature, with the potential to develop resistance to various treatments. This resistance makes the disease challenging to treat, emphasizing the need for new treatment strategies. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), melanoma cells exploit metabolic shifts, particularly glycolysis, to create an immunosuppressive TME that prevents dendritic cells (DCs) from functioning properly. Essential metabolic alterations such as lactate and lipid accumulation, and lack of tryptophan disrupt DC maturation, antigen presentation, and T cell activation. In recent years, melanoma immunotherapy has increasingly focused on reprogramming the metabolism of DCs. This review paper aims to provide insights into the metabolic suppression of melanoma-associated DCs, allowing the design of therapeutic strategies based on metabolic interventions to promote or restore DC function. This contribution reviews the metabolic reprogramming of DCs as a new approach for melanoma immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background The immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) present significant hurdles in tumor therapy. The identification of therapeutic agents that can target both CSCs and the TME could be a potential approach to overcome treatment resistance. Methods We conducted an in vivo chemical screen to identify F1929-1458, which is capable of eliciting an organism-wide response to destroy stem cell tumors in Drosophila. We then performed functional validation using a mouse colorectal cancer graft tumor model established with the CT26 cell line characterized by its high content of CSCs. Single-cell sequencing was employed to analyze alterations in the TME. Small molecule pull-down mass spectrometry, cellular thermal shift assay, drug affinity experiment, and molecular docking were utilized to identify the target of F1929-1458. An in vitro co-culture system was applied to establish that the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by the tumor cells are accountable for the activation of dendritic cells (DCs). Results We demonstrated that F1929-1458 treatment enhanced T cell infiltration and T cell mediated tumor regression, its anti-tumor effect was nullified in nude mice and was abolished after anti-CD3 neutralizing antibody treatment. We found that F1929-1458 binds NFKB1 to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway in tumor cells. The activation further elicits cellular stress, causing tumor cells to release DAMPs (HMGB1-gDNA complex, ATP, and OxLDL). These DAMPs, in turn, stimulate the cGAS-STING and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in DCs, resulting in the generation of type I IFNs and IL-1β. These cytokines facilitate the maturation of DCs and antigen presentation, ultimately enhancing T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, we showed that the combination of F1929-1458 and the anti-PD-1 antibody exhibited a synergistic anti-tumor effect. Conclusion Our study identified a novel NFKB1 agonist that promotes anti-tumor immunity by remodeling the TME and activating DCs and that may provide a new way to overcome resistance to current anti-tumor immunotherapy in colorectal cancer.

Co-primary endpoints included 6-month complete metabolic response rate (94%) and 2-year progression-free survival (84%). Induction yielded a 46% major histopathologic response rate. Single-cell profiling revealed responders had higher baseline intratumoral CD8+ T cells with a tumor-reactive, tissue-resident memory (TRM) phenotype and a treatment-related decrease in effector regulatory T (eTreg) cells. The eTreg decrease correlated with CD8+ T-cell clonotype transitioning from TRM to effector memory and IFNG+ effector cells. In nonresponders, clonotypes transitioned to exhausted TRM and proliferating cells. Multivariable regression modeling determined the baseline feature most associated with reduction in tumor viability was the proportion of FCGR3A-expressing NK cells, which are capable of ipilimumab-dependent depletion of CTLA4high eTregs. eTreg depletion may be critical for major response to induction dual immune checkpoint blockade.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the dominant immune cell subset within the ovarian tumor microenvironment, which exhibits remarkable plasticity. They can readily undergo polarization toward an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype in response to various factors secreted by tumor cells, playing a pivotal role in ovarian cancer advancement and the development of resistance to chemotherapy. M2 TAMs promote the invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells and their resistance to therapeutic agents through the secretion of numerous tumor-promoting factors, including cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and exosomes. Furthermore, M2 TAMs significantly contribute to the peritoneal metastasis of cancer cells by aiding in the formation of spheroids and facilitating adhesion at metastatic sites. Concurrently, TAMs can suppress immune responses by interacting with lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, thereby fostering an immunosuppressive milieu. Extensive research has indicated that M2-like TAMs exert detrimental effects in ovarian tumors, with elevated levels correlating positively with diminished overall survival rates. This review seeks to summarize the existing knowledge regarding the mechanisms through which TAMs affect both the progression of ovarian cancer and the development of chemotherapy resistance, underscoring the necessity for innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting these cells within the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Hematological malignancies are a diverse group of cancers that originate in the blood and bone marrow and are characterized by the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Myeloid blasts, which are derived from normal myeloid progenitors, play a central role in these diseases by disrupting hematopoiesis and driving disease progression. In addition, other myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, adapt dynamically to the tumor microenvironment, where they can promote immune evasion and resistance to treatment. This review explores the unique characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of myeloid blasts, the immunosuppressive roles of myeloid cells, and their complex interactions within the TME. Furthermore, we highlight emerging therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells, focusing on strategies to reprogram their functions, inhibit their suppressive effects, or eliminate pathological populations altogether, as well as the latest preclinical and clinical trials advancing these approaches. By integrating insights from these studies, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of myeloid cells in hematological malignancies and their potential as therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Therapeutic innate immune stimulation within the tumor microenvironment can potentiate endogenous antitumor T cell immunity. Strategies for controlled activation of cGAS/STING signaling are currently under intense investigation. DNase 3'-repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is essential for cellular DNA disposal, which prevents autoimmunity ensuing from cGAS/STING activation by endogenous DNA. TREX1-deficient tumor cells elicit enhanced protective immunity in syngeneic models. Here, we showed that induced inactivation of the Trex1 gene in host (non-cancer) cells yields improved type I IFN- and T cell-dependent control of established TREX1-competent tumors. Host TREX1 deficiency was well tolerated and triggered selective immune cell infiltration into tumors but not into other tissues. Induced systemic loss of TREX1 in tumor-bearing mice resulted in enhanced intra-tumoral T cell proliferation and massive increase in numbers of effector and effector-like 'exhausted' cells, enabling complete rejection in combination with checkpoint inhibition. To conclude, systemic TREX1 inhibition is a promising approach to boost anti-tumor immunity and to overcome immune evasion mediated by cancer cell-intrinsic cGAS/STING inactivation.">

While sepsis survivors are often viewed as immunocompromised, recent studies suggest that some may acquire adaptive immune traits that enhance resistance to secondary infections.We employed a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model to study polymicrobial sepsis and subsequent immune responses. Listeria monocytogenes was used as a model intracellular pathogen to assess immune protection. We analyzed myeloid cell phenotypes using single-cell RNA sequencing and evaluated lipid metabolic changes through quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, serum cytokine assays, and plasma lipidomics.Sepsis-surviving mice showed enhanced resistance to Listeria infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed transcriptional reprogramming in splenic CD11b+Ly6Chigh myeloid cells, including downregulation of lipoprotein lipase and lipid efflux genes. CD11b+ myeloid cells exhibited increased lipid droplet accumulation, accompanied by elevated serum interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) levels. Plasma lipidomics identified systemic lipid remodeling, with increased phosphatidylserine and decreased phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol levels.Our findings suggest that sepsis survival induces lipid metabolic reprogramming in myeloid cells, contributing to enhanced immunity against intracellular pathogens. These insights reveal potential therapeutic targets within lipid metabolic pathways to improve host defense in sepsis survivors.">

The focus of xenotransplantation research now lies in delayed xenograft rejection. Dendritic cells (DC) are a specific subpopulation of professional antigen‐presenting cells (APC) that play a crucial role in the context of organ transplantation. DCs, originating from both the xenograft and the recipient, have the capacity to present xenoAgs to the recipient's immune system via their respective major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules leading to rejection. These processes are known as direct and indirect presentation, respectively. However, under certain microenvironmental conditions, DC develops into anti‐inflammatory regulatory cells that can induce immunological tolerance. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the general characteristics and functions of DC from species relevant to xenotransplantation, specifically humans, non‐human primates (NHP), and pigs. It will also cover the process of xenoAg presentation, different methods for generating DC with regulatory properties in vitro, and finally, discuss the current strategies for using regulatory DC to improve xenograft acceptance by inducing tolerance.">

In a recent first-in-class Phase I trial, the monoclonal IgE antibody MOv18, specific for the tumour-associated antigen Folate Receptor-α, was well-tolerated and preliminary anti-tumoural activity observed. Pre-clinical studies identified macrophages as mediators of tumour restriction and pro-inflammatory activation by IgE. However, the mechanisms of IgE-mediated modulation of macrophages and downstream tumour immunity in human cancer remain unclear. Here we study macrophages from patients with epithelial ovarian cancers naive to IgE therapy. High-dimensional flow cytometry and RNA-seq demonstrate immunosuppressive, FcεR-expressing macrophage phenotypes. Ex vivo co-cultures and RNA-seq interaction analyses reveal immunosuppressive associations between patient-derived macrophages and regulatory T (Treg) cells. MOv18 IgE-engaged patient-derived macrophages undergo pro-inflammatory repolarisation ex vivo and display induction of a hyperinflammatory, T cell-stimulatory subset. IgE reverses macrophage-promoted Treg cell induction to increase CD8+ T cell expansion, a signature associated with improved patient prognosis. On-treatment tumours from the MOv18 IgE Phase I trial show evidence of this IgE-driven immune signature, with increased CD68+ and CD3+ cell infiltration. We demonstrate that IgE induces hyperinflammatory repolarised states of patient-derived macrophages to inhibit Treg cell immunosuppression.

 mMDSCs (monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells) are recruited to solid tumors and serve as potent inhibitors of T-cell mediated antitumor immunity. Therapeutic depletion of mMDSCs presents an exciting opportunity to increase the frequency and durability of anti-tumor clinical responses achieved with immune checkpoint inhibition. Currently, no marketed or investigational agents function by specific mMDSC depletion and no specific markers for therapeutic targeting of these cells have been clinically validated. We demonstrate that mMDSCs express high and homogeneous levels of the chemokine receptor CCR2. Because of this, we have developed a CCR2 targeting Cytotoxicity Targeting Chimera, which potently binds CCR2 on cells, and when combined with the CyTAC platform antibody, eliminates target cells via enhanced effector mediated killing. We demonstrate that the CCR2 CyTAC can deplete CCR2+ monocytes and mMDSCs from the periphery and intratumorally both ex vivo and in vivo. In the MC38 syngeneic tumor model this depletion leads to T-cell dependent anti-tumor activity and increases the levels of CD8 T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. We show across multiple additional syngeneic tumor models that depletion of CCR2+ cells remodels the tumor microenvironment causing an increase in tumor infiltrating CD8 T-Cells and a decrease in regulatory T-cells and mMDSCs. These PD changes were observed in both responding and non-responding tumor models where response can be enhanced with anti-PD1.


 We have applied our CyTAC technology to specifically target CCR2 expressing cells and depletion of mMDSCs and demonstrate that this can lead to remodeling of the tumor microenvironment from a pro-tumor to pro-inflammatory phenotype. This agent has potential for treating tumors with high mMDSC content regardless of tumor type.

While chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation are standard treatments, their efficacy declines in relapsed or refractory cases, highlighting the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. CAR T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative technology, offering the potential to overcome these challenges and deliver durable remissions. CAR T-cell therapy demonstrates significant advantages, including targeting specific antigens, overcoming high-risk genetic mutations, and achieving sustained remissions in both pediatric and adult patients.

        <tr id="Human papillomavirus (HPV), a double-stranded DNA virus linked to various malignancies, poses a significant global public health challenge. In cervical cancer, persistent infection with high-risk HPV genotypes, particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18, initiates immune evasion mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment. The polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from M1 to M2 phenotypes promotes cervical carcinogenesis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance via establishing an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This review provides a comprehensive overview of HPV-induced immune evasion pathways, including MHC downregulation, T-cell impairment, regulatory T cell induction, and cGAS-STING pathway inhibition. Furthermore, describe the pivotal role of TAMs in cervical cancer progression, focusing on their phenotypic plasticity, pro-tumoral functions, and potential as therapeutic targets. By elucidating these cellular and molecular dynamics, this review aims to support advanced research. Targeting TAM polarization through immunotherapies and nanomedicine-based strategies represents a promising strategy for enhancing patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Sepsis associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe pulmonary inflammation. Previous research has suggested that allergic immune diseases are associated with a lower risk of sepsis. Therefore, we hypothesized that certain molecules involved in type 2 inflammation are beneficial for the outcome of sepsis associated ARDS. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is known to promote Th2 responses in allergic disease, however, its role in sepsis associated ARDS remains limited.To investigate the role of TSLP in sepsis associated lung injury, we administered exogenous recombinant TSLP to wild-type mice, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. At 24 hours post-treatment, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were collected for analysis. The ratio, number, phenotype, and function of immune cells and cytokine levels were measured. Additionally, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were prepared and stimulated with LPS and TSLP to further verify our findings experimentally. To explore the molecular mechanisms of TSLP’s effect, analysis of transcriptome sequencing and single-cell transcriptome sequencing and subsequent experiments were performed.In LPS-induced acute lung injury models, pretreatment with TSLP significantly alleviated lung injury, suppressed inflammatory cytokines secretion, and reduced macrophages and neutrophils infiltration. In addition, TSLP treatment significantly inhibited M1 macrophage polarization and promoted M2 macrophage differentiation. Transcriptome sequencing suggested IFN-γ as a potential target of TSLP, and single-cell transcriptome sequencing showed that innate like T cells are important source of IFN-γ. Consistently, flow cytometry showed that proportion of IFN-γ-producing iNKT cells was decreased by TSLP administration in the acute lung injury model. Intriguingly, Jα18−/− mice, which are completely deficient in invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, exhibited not only significantly less severe lung inflammation but also a notably higher degree of anti-inflammatory Arg1+ M2 macrophages infiltration when compared with their LPS-sensitized wild-type counterparts.These findings not only underscore the crucial role of TSLP in the regulation of sepsis-associated ARDS but also demonstrate its potential clinical value as both a predictive biomarker for early detection and a molecular target for therapeutic intervention.">

 Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are the main effectors of anti-tumor immunity, and their activation is dependent on carefully coordinated interactions between antigen presenting cells (APCs) and CD4+ T cells (Th). In a pivotal model, synchronized interaction between a dendritic cell (DC), Th, and CTL were posited as requisite for effective CTL responses. Recent studies have resurrected this hypothesis in the context of anti-tumor immunity and demonstrated the function of 3 cell type clusters in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response in murine tumors and human cancer. We hypothesized intratumoral 3-cell type clusters are present in an “immune excluded tumor”, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA), outside the context of immunotherapy. Analysis of single cell RNAseq and PDA tumors identified DC:Th:CTL clusters, defined as DC, Th, and CTL within 20µm radius, occurring with ∼15% of DCs. Analysis of multiplex proteomics data from fibrolamellar carcinoma, a rare stromal dominant liver tumor with poor immune infiltration, revealed the presence of DC:Th:CTL clusters. We sought to confirm our findings in a larger dataset using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) on a tissue microarray (TMA) of >500 patients with untreated resected PDA. Using automatic image analysis software, we identified cell types based on surface marker expression, specifically tumor cells, CTL, Th, macrophages, and non-macrophage APCs. 3-cell type clusters were found in 90% of tumor samples, occurred with ∼10% of APCs, located >50µm from tumor cells, and correlated strongly with APC:Th dyads. Weak correlation was found between 3-cell type clusters and isolated cell types, suggesting cluster formation is unlikely to be related to abundance of infiltrating immune cells. DC:Th:CTL clusters were also readily seen in scST of untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Analysis of PDA, NSCLC, and CRC scST datasets revealed that CTLs within triads were more likely to have an effector-like phenotype. Th within triads were enriched in CXCL13+-like Th phenotype, which previously has been associated with immune triads. Using associated clinical data in the PDA TMA, we found that patients with the highest tertile of APC:Th:CTL clusters had improved overall survival compared to patients with the lowest tertile (HR=0.70, p=0.005). Similar findings were found for patients with the top tertile of APC:Th dyads (HR=0.63, p=6.x10-4), but not APC:CTL or CTL:Th dyads (HR=0.76 and 0.77 and p=0.16 and 0.07, respectively). Overall, our findings demonstrate 3-cell type clusters are readily found in an “immune excluded” tumor like PDA without immunotherapy and are associated with improved patient outcomes. These data are strong evidence for the role of 3-cell type clusters in endogenous anti-tumor immune responses and point toward future opportunities for immunotherapeutic intervention.

 Immune based therapies for large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) have transformed our approach to this disease. Therapies such as CD3 bispecific T cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have diverse mechanisms of action, yet they all depend on activation of T cells to affect an anti-cancer response. While the often-dramatic responses seen to immune therapies have captured wide-spread attention, the majority of patients treated with immune based therapies for relapsed lymphoma will not achieve long term cure, and poor T cell function is a common mechanism for treatment failure. Several seminal studies have identified T-cell metabolic reprogramming as a key mechanism behind T-cell exhaustion. Mechanisms to reverse metabolic exhaustion and reinvigorate T-cells has been shown to lead to increased anti-tumor responses. Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) proteins regulate a variety of cellular processes in tumor and immune cells. Inhibitors of SUMOylation (SUMOi) have shown anti-tumor activity in a CD8 T-cell dependent manner, however, the mechanism behind this T-cell dependence is unknown.
 We show that a novel covalent SUMOi, SB-4826 leads to a robust anti-tumor response which is dependent on CD8+ T-cells in lymphoma. Using single cell metabolic studies, we demonstrate that SUMOi increases the metabolic rate, glycolytic dependency and proliferative capacity of tumor infiltrating PD1+ CD8+ T cells. We further show that SUMOylation is increased following T-cell activation, and exhausted CD8+ TILs have the highest levels of total SUMOylation of T-cell subsets. We validate these findings of increased SUMOylation in CD8+ TILs in human lymphoma samples. In a CD19 CAR T-cell model, we show that pulse treatment of CAR T-cells with SUMOi leads to enhanced anti-lymphoma activity in vitro.
 Using a mass-spectroscopy/immunoprecipitation approach, we identified more than 1, 000 proteins which are SUMOylated in T-cells. We found that multiple T-cell transcriptional regulators, including TBET, LEF1 and TCF1 are all SUMOylated either during a resting or activation state in CD8+ T-cells. Together, these findings suggest a novel role for SUMOylation in regulating T-cell effector activation and exhaustion, by modulating metabolic state likely through the regulation of key transcriptional T-cell programs.

CD24 negatively regulates the immune response by binding with danger‐associated molecular patterns, but the specific role of CD24 in modulating macrophage‐related inflammation during liver injury remains largely unexplored. Here, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms of macrophage CD24 in the development of liver injury. Our results show that CD24 expression is upregulated primarily in hepatic macrophages (HMs) during acute liver injury. CD24‐deficient mice exhibited more severe liver injury and showed a significantly higher frequency and number of HMs, particularly Ly6Chi monocyte‐derived macrophages. Mechanistically, the CD24‐Siglec‐G interaction plays a vital role in mitigating acute liver injury. CD24‐mediated inhibitory signaling in HMs primarily limits downstream NF‐κB and p38 MAPK activation through the recruitment of SHP1. Our work unveils the critical role of macrophage CD24 in negatively regulating innate immune responses and protecting against acute liver injury, thus providing potential therapeutic targets for liver‐associated diseases.">

        <tr id="Cell therapy in solid tumors faces significant challenges due to the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by hypoxia and high interstitial pressure. These conditions affect gene and protein expression, contributing to tumor metastasis and drug resistance. Hypoxia dampens the anti-tumor T cell response by altering immune cell activation and function by modulating metabolic activity and the presence of immune suppressive cytokines, growth factors, and immune checkpoint molecules. The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in treating several hematopoietic malignancies has been challenging to replicate in solid tumors, in part because of T cell exhaustion and eventual T cell dysfunction. T cell reprogramming to adapt to TME is likely to represent a novel and essential aspect of enhancing anti-tumor activity in the TME. We used the Avatar and Avatar AI incubators (Xcell Bio) to precisely control oxygen concentration and pressure to simulate TME conditions to reprogram the headless CAR T cells (hCART). Bispecific antibody armed (ahCART) or unarmed (hCARTs) headless CAR T cells were acclimated under normal environment (NE) or TME conditions before coculturing with target cells. The effect of NE or TME conditions was determined on T cell proliferation, phenotypic changes, and functional activity of hCARTs. Functional readouts were measured by real-time cytotoxicity assay and cytokine profiles under NE or TME-like conditions (1-5% O2 + 2-5 PSI pressure). The phenotypic changes of ATC and hCARTs showed no changes in co-stimulatory receptor expression (41BB, CD40L, GITR, HVEM, ICOS, NFATc1, and TBET) on CD4 or CD8 T cells and co-inhibitory receptors (LAG2, LAIR, PD1, TIGIT, CTLA-4, FOXP3, GATA3 and BTLA) on CD8 T cells, except for reduced expression of certain co-inhibitory receptors on CD4 T cells under TME condition compared to NE condition. Acclimation of hCARTs under TME showed a delayed, but 100% cytotoxicity prolonged up to 7 days at low effector to target ratios of 1:1 or 2:1; non-acclimated hCART showed 100% cytotoxicity initially but declined in long-term or serial killing assays. There was no effect of TME preconditioning on cytokine profile (IL-2, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6) compared to NE on hCART. These data suggest that TME reprogramming of hCARTs could be a promising approach to improve its effectiveness, especially in solid tumors. TME acclimation has the clinical potential to enhance the anti-tumor activity of cellular therapeutics.

        <tr id="This review discusses reprogramming the breast tumor immune microenvironment from an immunosuppressive cold state to an immunologically active hot state. A complex interplay is revealed, in which the accumulation of metabolic byproducts—such as lactate, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ammonia—is shown to impair T-cell function and promote tumor immune escape. It is demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), and IL-35. Notably, IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells and breast cancer cells. The conversion of conventional T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells, along with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. It is further demonstrated that key immune checkpoint molecules—such as PD-1, PDL1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT—are upregulated within the TME, leading to Tcell exhaustion and diminished immune responses. The blockade of these checkpoints is shown to restore T-cell functionality and is proposed as a strategy to convert cold tumors into hot ones with robust effector cell infiltration. The therapeutic potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy is also explored, and targeting specific tumor-associated antigens, such as glycoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, is highlighted. It is suggested that CART cell efficacy can be enhanced by combining these cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents, thereby overcoming the barriers imposed by the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, the role of the microbiome in regulating estrogen metabolism and systemic inflammation is reviewed. Alterations in the gut microbiota are shown to affect the TME, and microbiome-based interventions are proposed as an additional means to facilitate the cold-to-hot transition. It is concluded that by targeting the metabolic and immunological pathways that underpin immune suppression—through combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade, CART cell therapies, and microbiome modulation—the conversion of the breast TME from cold to hot can be achieved. This reprogramming is anticipated to enhance immune cell infiltration and function, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapies and leading to better clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients.

 A fundamental challenge in cancer biology is to understand why some people develop cancer and others do not despite similar genetic predispositions. Taking the blood system as an exemplar, we seek here to determine if the inflammatory milieu has distinct impact on the clonal fitness and selective advantage of mutant tissue stem cells at the expense of wildtype clones.
 Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an aging-associated phenomenon in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) acquire somatic mutations that result in clonal expansion of mutated blood cells and a 12-fold increased risk for myeloid neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, and other aging-associated diseases. Human lineage tracking studies have shown that pre-leukemic CH mutations often arising many decades before disease onset. Although CH has a prevalence as high as 1 in 3 in people over 60 years of age, only some individuals show a readily detectable clone size (≥2% and considered to have clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential). The mechanisms regulating CH clone size are poorly understood, but inflammation is elevated in individuals with CH. Extensive data from murine models also shows that inflammation reprograms HSCs to impair their function. This likely contributes to clonal selection in murine models of CH as acute inflammation also activates murine HSCs, skews them towards myeloid differentiation, and impairs their self-renewal. Some of these inflammatory responses include activation of target genes downstream of TNFα via NFkB, which is known to regulate HSC survival in both murine and human settings. Repeated inflammatory challenges have also been associated with sustained epigenetic changes and accelerated aging of murine HSCs, as well as expansion of clones bearing CH-associated mutations in Dnmt3a and Tet2, the two most frequently mutated genes in CH cases. However, we have shown extensive molecular and functional heterogeneity in the human HSC compartment at steady-state, and it is unclear whether all human HSC respond homogeneously to inflammation. If HSC respond heterogeneously, it is also unclear whether this would impact clonal selection such as during CH.
 To address these two questions, we developed inflammation-recovery xenograft models to determine the long-term molecular and cellular sequelae of repeated inflammatory challenge on human HSCs in an empirical fashion (Zeng, et al, in revision). No in vivo studies of inflammatory stress on human HSCs have been previously reported. In parallel, we generated a TARGET-seq+ data set of bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from nine DNMT3A or TET2-mutated CH donors and four age-matched controls with no detectable CH mutations (Jakobsen, et al, Cell Stem Cell, 2024). TARGET-seq+ combines simultaneous single cell profiling of transcriptome, genotype, and cell surface immunophenotype, enabling comparisons of mutant (CHMUT) and wild-type (CHWT) HSC obtained from individuals with CH to HSC from age-matched controls without CH. First, we established that human cord blood (CB) HSC in xenotransplantation models recapitulate phenotypes previously observed in the murine system following acute inflammatory activation for 16 hours using human TNFα or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, when we mimicked repeated inflammatory challenge through acute treatment with TNFα or LPS at 2w and 10w post-transplantation followed by analysis at 20w, we found a reduced human graft at 20w compared to PBS controls. Thus, repeated challenge resulted in a long-lasting functional HSC impairment long after the treatment. Single cell multiome analysis of human HSCs isolated from this model showed two bona fide HSC subsets: HSC-I showed few molecular changes in response to prior inflammatory stress. However, the second HSC subset, termed HSC inflammatory memory (HSC-iM) showed extensive chromatin accessibility and transcriptional changes 2.5 months after recovery from TNFα or LPS treatment. These changes are primarily in the AP-1 and NF-kB gene regulatory networks and while distinct, also bear striking similarity to epigenetic changes seen in murine epithelial stem cells following wounding. We found HSC-iM share core molecular programs with human memory T cells. Importantly, a transcriptional program reflecting HSC-iM was enriched in HSCs from recovered COVID-19 patients and in HSC from aged individuals and in HSC from individuals with CH from our TARGET-seq+ data set.
 To gain insight into the impact of the HSC-I and HSC-iM states on selective advantage in CH, we turned to our TARGET-seq+ data set. First, we directly identified both the HSC-I and HSC-iM populations in human CH cases (named HSC1 and HSC2 respectively) validating the relevance of the inflammation-recovery xenograft model established with CB HSC from which they were first identified and confirming that this is not a xenograft artifact. Second, when CHMUT and CHWT within a BM of a subject with CH are compared to each other, gene expression changes occur predominantly in HSC-iM and not HSC-I. Moreover, the presence of the CH mutation results in decreased enrichment of specific inflammatory pathways. Third, we confirmed that CHWT within HSC2-dominant hierarchies were stalled in differentiation, with reduced production of downstream progenitor populations compared to CHWT cells within HSC1-dominant hierarchies. By contrast, mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 were associated with increased progenitor abundance within HSC-iM-dominant hierarchies. Thus, HSC2/HSC-iM is inherently growth restricted, but CH mutations relieve this impairment leading to an increased HSC2/HSC-iM contribution to hematopoiesis and an overall clonal growth advantage. This lends further support to our conclusion that accumulation of HSC-iM underlies age-related hematopoietic dysfunction. We posit that HSC-iM is a “protective adaptation” to inflammation, representing a reserve pool of stem cells that requires a subsequently stronger inflammatory trigger for activation. Additionally, a key hypothesis our work is the notion that selective advantage of CHMUT HSC arises due to a decrease in differentiation output of CHWT HSC-iM. We are currently testing this hypothesis with CRISPR-mediated DNMT3A- and TET2-mutant CB HSC in our xenograft-inflammatory recovery models.
 We show that HSC-iM progeny monocytes are pro-inflammatory compared to those from HSC-I in our xenograft models, in the COVID patient recovery data, and in steady-state human BM data sets. To gain insight into whether HSC-I or HSC-iM have differing functional capacity or biases to generate downstream progeny, raw RNA sequencing data from the CD34+CD38-CD45RA- (HSC/Progenitor) scMultiome was combined with scRNA-seq data from CD33+ mature myeloid cells isolated from those same xenografts. This allowed us to examine the differentiation output of clonally defined HSC-I and HSC-iM. HSC-iM progeny, including monocytes and dendritic cells, retain transcriptional features of HSC-iM including inflammatory signaling pathways, while HSC-I do not. From a biological viewpoint, this is a step forward to addressing a conundrum in the field: many of the mature myeloid cells that respond to inflammation are extremely short-lived raising the question of how long-term inflammation can be sustained and drive the deleterious phenotypes associated with CH. Our data suggests that HSC-iM continuously produces inflammatory primed myeloid cells nominating HSC-iM as a novel cellular player in exacerbating systemic inflammation. In sum, the discovery of HSC-iM implicates the importance of the inflammatory milieu and provides a framework to address whether HSC-iM emerges as a ‘cost’ of adaptation to inflammation that modifies wildtype HSC fitness to drive selective advantage of CH-bearing HSC clones.

        <tr id="CD99 is a membrane protein critical for various immunological functions, including T-cell activation, protein trafficking, cell apoptosis, and leukocyte movement. It is also highly expressed in certain malignant tumors, contributing to the development, invasion, immune evasion, and adaptation of tumor cells to stress stimuli, including drug resistance. CD99 is crucial at the intersection of normal biological processes and pathological conditions like cancer. While research indicates that CD99 may interact homotypically, there is evidence of some heterotypic ligands that align with its roles. The development of multiple anti-CD99 antibodies has shed light on its functions, particularly regarding interactions between tumor cells that overexpress CD99 and immune cells expressing the same protein within the microenvironment. Anti-CD99 antibodies effectively eliminate tumors and attract immune cells to the tumor area. Additionally, CD99 influences the expression of specific immune checkpoint molecules, such as CD47, paving the way for potential combinations of anti-CD99 with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This review explores CD99’s role in normal physiology and cancer biology, focusing on how monoclonal antibodies affect CD99 expression and activity, thereby influencing cancer cells’ interactions with their microenvironment. It summarizes key findings about how these changes impact cancer cell behavior and the effectiveness of treatments.">

 Progenitor-exhausted T (Tpex) cells, marked by TCF1 and PD-1 expression, are essential for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like anti-PD-1 antibodies. These cells serve as precursors to intratumoral exhausted T (Tex) cells and may play a pivotal role in maintaining immune responses during cancer therapy. While Tpex cells are recognized for their importance, the detailed mechanisms by which ICIs influence their activation, proliferation, and migration remain unclear. Specifically, the dynamics of ICI-bound Tpex cells across lymph nodes (LNs) and tumors have not been fully characterized. To address this point, we investigated the spatial and functional behavior of Tpex cells in gastrointestinal cancer patients, focusing on how ICIs reprogram these cells to exert anti-tumor immunity.



 We collected tumor, lymph node (LN), and blood samples from gastrointestinal cancer patients treated with or without anti-PD-1 antibodies. Purified lymphocytes were analyzed with flowcytometry and sequencing analysis. To identify ICI-binding T cells, we developed a method using IgG4 detection, which allowed us to detect cells directly bound by therapeutic anti-PD-1 antibodies. We further used combined sequencing technique including single-cell RNA sequencing, T cell receptor sequencing and CITE-sequencing for IgG4 detection (scRNA/TCR/CITE-seq) to profile 29, 388 T cells across tissue compartments, including LNs, tumors, and blood.



 Our flowcytometry analysis revealed that CD8-Tpex cells were enriched in proximal LNs and exhibited significant proliferation following ICI treatment. Using IgG4 detection and sequencing, we confirmed that PD-1+ Tpex cells in LNs directly bound therapeutic anti-PD-1 antibodies and underwent clonal expansion. Notably, these ICI-bound Tpex cells shared TCR clonotypes with intratumoral Tex cells, suggesting that Tpex cells migrate from LNs to tumors after treatment.



 ICIs primarily target PD-1+ Tpex cells in proximal LNs, driving their proliferation and migration to tumors, where they differentiate into Tex cells and contribute to sustained tumor destruction. These results not only deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ICI therapy but also provide a robust methodological framework for tracking ICI-binding T cells across tissues.

Here, we demonstrated the role of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fes, abundantly expressed in immune cells, as an innate intracellular immune checkpoint. Host Fes-deficiency delayed tumor onset in a gene dose-dependent manner and improved tumor control, survival, doxorubicin efficacy, and anti-PD-1 therapy sensitization in murine triple-negative breast cancer and melanoma models. These effects were associated with a shift to an anti-tumorigenic immune microenvironment. Fes-deficient macrophages displayed increased Toll-like receptor signaling, proinflammatory cytokine production, antigen presentation to and activation of T cells, leading to increased cancer cell killing in vitro and tumor control in vivo.

 The combination of sitravatinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab offers a novel approach to enhance immunotherapy outcomes in advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). To explore the immunomodulatory and resistance mechanisms underlying this triplet therapy, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on tumor samples collected longitudinally from 12 patients across treatment timepoints. Transcriptomic data from 70,526 cells, including 58,331 tumor microenvironment (TME) cells, revealed dynamic shifts in cellular composition and transcriptional states during therapy. Analysis of TME cells identified eight major cell types, with notable increases in T cells and reductions in myeloid and endothelial cells post-treatment. Baseline T cell abundance correlated with improved clinical response, while fibroblast enrichment predicted resistance. Tumor cells were classified into ten transcriptionally distinct clusters, including a treatment-resistant population (C8) enriched in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, and glycolysis signatures. These signatures correlated with shorter progression-free survival in the trial cohort and worse survival outcomes in an external TCGA ccRCC dataset. T cell states showed a transition from cytotoxic to exhausted phenotypes in non-responders and end-of-treatment samples, suggesting a role for T cell dysfunction in resistance. Similarly, myeloid cells exhibited a shift toward immunosuppressive phenotypes, characterized by M2-like macrophages and inhibitory signaling pathways. These findings elucidate resistance mechanisms to the triplet therapy, highlighting EMT-driven tumor cell states and immunosuppressive TME dynamics as key contributors. The identification of a tumor-specific C8 signature provides a potential biomarker for predicting poor responses and tailoring therapeutic strategies. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed to optimize patient selection and therapeutic outcomes.

 Immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment, but such immunotherapy regimens fail in a subset of patients. Dendritic cells (DCs) are a heterogeneous group of professional antigen-presenting innate immune cells that activate adaptive immunity and determine the efficacy of immunotherapies. While they can also be hijacked by tumor-mediated factors to contribute to immune tolerance and tumor progression. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that drive the tolerance maturation of DCs in the tumor microenvironment (TME).



 We enrolled 85 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibiting varying response to immunotherapy, and profiled their tumor ecosystems using a single-cell transcriptomes sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) for 10 patients, and plasma protein level quantification, conducted both pre-treatment and post-treatment across all patients. We integrated our in-house data and 6 additional published scRNA-seq cohorts of 83 donors to generate a comprehensive landscape of cellular dynamics underlying different responses to immunotherapy. We verified the prognostic value in our in-house tumor microarray of 342 patients.



 UCHL1 overexpression nullifies anti-PD-L1 therapy by driving conventional DC transformation into mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecule (mregDC) via tolerogenic maturation and promoting mregDC and regulatory T (Treg) cell crosstalk, thereby restrains CD8+ T anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, UCHL1 enhances glycolysis by stabilizing HIF1α and lactate accumulation in TME, which further promotes SREBP2 activation and nuclear translocation in DCs. We verified the positive correlations of UCHL1 with HIF1α/VEGFα/LAMP3/FOXP3 in 342 patients with HCC. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of UCHL1 all reduce the mregDC and Treg accumulation, restore the immuno-surveillance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and safeguard anti-tumor immunity and efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in mouse models.



 UCHL1 hijacks tolerogenic DC maturation and promotes mregDC-Treg crosstalk to nullify anti-PD-L1 therapy. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of UCHL1 unleash the immuno-surveillance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and safeguard the anti-tumor immunity. Plasma level of UCHL1 predicts the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) represent a significant barrier to the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. A comprehensive understanding of TANs' regulatory mechanisms is therefore essential for predicting ICB efficacy and improving immunotherapy strategies. Our study reveals that MYO1F is selectively downregulated in neutrophils within both human cancers and murine tumor models, showing a negative correlation with ICB response. Mechanistically, MYO1F normally inhibits neutrophil immunosuppression and proliferation by restraining STAT3 activity. However, during tumorigenesis, tumor-derived TGF-β1 disrupts the binding of SPI1 to intron 8 of Myo1f via DNA methylation, thereby suppressing Myo1f transcription. The resultant decrease in MYO1F reprograms neutrophils into an immunosuppressive state through the STAT3-dependent signaling pathways. This immunosuppressive state further contributes to tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling by inducing CTL exhaustion. These findings establish MYO1F as a critical regulator within TANs, highlighting its significant role in modulating ICB therapy efficacy.">

        <tr id="T cell exhaustion is a critical obstacle for durable treatment response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Developing drugs that control tumor growth and simultaneously bolster immune function is of great significance. Although high-mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) has been reported to be crucial to HCC prognosis, its role in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. Here, we found HMGB2+ CD8+ T cells as being associated with immune exhaustion and resistance to anti–PD-1 treatment through single-cell RNA sequencing. Mechanistically, HMGB2 impaired the oxidative phosphorylation in CD8+ T cells and inactivated the interferon-γ response in tumor cells, reducing the antitumor effector function. Tannic acid, a specific inhibitor of HMGB2, synergized with PD-1 antibody to attenuate tumor growth and reverse T cell exhaustion. Our findings highlight the unique role of HMGB2 as an immune exhaustion associated molecule.

 Solid tumors often contain patches of hypoxic regions that yield aggressive, pro-metastatic phenotypes. Prevention and understanding of metastases is critical for the future of breast cancer research, as metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to manage and treat. Recent work in our lab has shown that long-term hypoxia suppresses type I interferon (IFN) signaling in breast cancer cells. Even upon reoxygenation, these gene expression changes are maintained, indicative of “hypoxic memory.” Breast cancer cells that have disseminated from the primary tumor as circulating tumor cells with this “post-hypoxic” memory phenotype show enhanced metastatic potential. IFNs typically boost and enhance immune cell activity through interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); thus, hypoxic suppression of IFN signaling yields an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. More research is needed to understand how ISGs are downregulated in hypoxia and how those changes in gene expression contribute to immunosuppressive ability of hypoxic and post-hypoxic cells. Interferon-inducible 44-like (IFI44L) is an ISG that has been associated with tumor-suppressive properties, and correlated with presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in other cancers, but its role in breast cancer has not been studied. We found that IFI44L is significantly suppressed in breast cancer cells in hypoxia and maintained after reoxygenation as a hypoxic memory. To try to understand possible mechanisms of hypoxic suppression, we overexpressed interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are positive regulators of the type I IFN pathway. However, this did not rescue hypoxic suppression and memory of IFI44L, suggesting that IRFs are not the sole regulator of IFN and ISG expression in hypoxia. Additional experiments are currently ongoing in the lab to address other possible mechanisms of hypoxic suppression and memory of IFN signaling. Additionally, co-culture experiments of breast cancer cells with knockdown or overexpression of IFI44L with different immune cell populations will shed light on the role of IFI44L in immune interactions in the tumor and in circulation. To better understand implications of maintained IFI44L suppression, we will also examine immune cell activity and metastatic potential using in vivo mouse studies. We expect to see less immune cell effect and enhanced metastasis with IFI44L knockdown and reversed phenotypes with overexpression of IFI44L. Understanding mechanisms of immune evasion mediated via IFI44L can lead to strategies for targeting hypoxia-mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis.

Here, by performing single-cell RNA, antigen receptor sequencing and spatial transcriptomics on tumor tissue from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients with different statuses of TLS, we observe that mTLS are enriched with stem-like T cells, and B cells at various maturation stages. Notably, progenitor exhausted CD4+ T cells, with features resembling follicular helper T cells, support these responses, by activating B cells to produce plasma cells in the germinal center, and interacting with DC-LAMP+ dendritic cells to support CD8+ T cell activation. Conversely, non-mTLS tumors do not promote local anti-tumor immunity which is abundant of immunosuppressive cells or a lack of stem-like B and T cells. Furthermore, patients with mTLS manifest improved overall survival and response to ICB compared to those with non-mTLS. Overall, our study provides insights into mechanisms underlying mTLS-mediated intra-tumoral immunity events against cancer.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases are characterized by irregular immune responses that disrupt self-tolerance. This research explores the effects of the immunomodulatory drug celecoxib on the expression of immune checkpoint receptors in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Key receptors, including CTLA-4, VISTA, BTLA, PDL-1, B7H7, and LAG3, play critical roles in initiating and regulating immune responses and maintaining self-tolerance. Previous studies have highlighted the significance of immune checkpoints in preventing autoimmune conditions, with animal research supporting their effectiveness in immunotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that the upregulation of immune checkpoint receptors can enhance the inhibitory functions of DCs, thereby promoting self-tolerance. As a result, tolerogenic DCs present a promising therapeutic avenue for treating autoimmune diseases. Although these results are promising, further trials are required to validate this approach before it can be applied clinically. This study underscores the potential of targeting immune checkpoint receptors as a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune disorders.">

        <tr id="Background Natural killer (NK) cells are among the first immune cell populations to recover after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT ), yet their dynamic function in pediatric patients remains understudied. Investigating NK cell recovery could improve understanding of post-autoHSCT immune reconstitution and optimize clinical outcomes. Methods We characterized NK cells in 13 children (male: 8; female: 5; age range: 3–11 years) with various tumors before and up to 6 months after autoHSCT. Multiparametric flow cytometry analyses and plasma cytokine level determinations were performed. In vitro experiments, including single-cell RNA sequencing, were conducted to elucidate post-autoHSCT changes in the NK cell repertoire using 8 adult healthy donors (male: 5; female: 3; age range: 25–62 years). Results Key findings highlight a transient decidual-like NK cell phenotype emerging early post-transplant. These cells are immature and activated, with increased inhibitory receptor expression and diminished activating receptor levels. This activated and decidual-like phenotype is characterized by elevated expression of CD56, CD9, CD49a, CD151, CD38, HLA-DR, and CD55. Plasma levels of several cytokines are associated with the observed changes in NK cells’ phenotype. In addition, in vitro experiments recapitulate the alterations observed in NK cells shortly after autoHSCT. Specifically, results demonstrate that the combination of IL-15 and TGF-β induces this distinctive phenotype on NK cells after autoHSCT. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between relapse and the percentage of CD56dim NK cells shortly after autoHSCT in our cohort of pediatric patients. Conclusions Altogether, our findings provide valuable insights into the physiopathology of NK cells during immune system reconstitution after autoHSCT and can potentially help in the management of cancer in children.">

        <tr id="
 Mature tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) characterized by the presence of germinal centers are strong predictors of response to immunotherapy. DCs play critical and decisive roles in determining the outcome of the immune responses in the TME and within TLS. Therefore, strategies to recruit and activate DC have the potential to induce TLS and enhance response to immunotherapy. Pepinemab, semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) blocking antibody, reversed myeloid suppression and promoted infiltration of activated DC and CD8+ T cells into the TME in preclinical and clinical studies. New data demonstrates the presence of mature TLS following pepinemab treatment in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in three separate clinical studies. KEYNOTE-B84 study (NCT04815720) evaluated the safety and efficacy of pepinemab in combination with pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment for immunotherapy-naïve patients with R/M HNSCC. Neoadjuvant studies in patients with surgically resectable metastatic melanoma (NCT03769155) and HNSCC (NCT03690986) received pepinemab treatment combined with nivolumab and/or ipilimumab. Screening and on-treatment tumor biopsies were evaluated using multiplex immunohistochemistry, RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics. TLS identified in biopsies of patients treated with pepinemab in combination with ICI were larger and more mature, containing high density of activated HLA-DR+ DCs, FDC, follicular B cells, and Tfh cells expressing CXCR5, characteristic of germinal centers. Importantly, comparison of matched biopsy pairs before and after treatment indicated that TLS were induced by the pepinemab combination treatment. Increased density and maturity of lymphoid aggregates, as well as significant changes in DC activation markers and the Flt3/Wnt pathway correlated with clinical benefit. We hypothesized that effects of pepinemab could be further enhanced by increasing the population of DC available in the TME. In preclinical studies, intra-tumoral vaccination with ex vivo expanded DC-1 enhanced effects of systemic treatment with SEMA4D-blocking antibody, resulting in improved DC trafficking to draining lymph nodes, and inducing tumor regression in both target and distant tumors. For in vivo expansion of DC, treatment with Flt3L improved anti-tumor activity when combined with SEMA4D-blocking antibody. Pepinemab represents a novel strategy to boost dendritic cell infiltration, activation, and organization of functional TLS to overcome limitations of immune checkpoint therapies. When combined with ICI, pepinemab induced de novo formation of TLS that correlated with clinical benefit, even in poorly immunogenic tumors that do not respond well to ICI, including HPV-negative and PD-L1 low HNSCC. When combined with modalities to further expand DC, SEMA4D blocking antibodies inhibited tumor growth in preclinical models, including in ICI-resistant models.

        <tr id="While the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIB has been shown to be upregulated on activated CD8+ T cells in both mice and humans, its effect on T cell fate during infection has not been fully elucidated. We identified an increase in FcγRIIB-expressing CD8+ T cells in patients with COVID-19 relative to healthy controls as well as in mouse models of viral infection. Despite its well-known role as an Fc receptor, FcγRIIB also ligates the immunosuppressive cytokine Fgl2, resulting in CD8+ T cell apoptosis. Both chronic LCMV infection in mice and COVID-19 in humans resulted in a significant increase in plasma Fgl2. Transfer of CD8+ T cells into a Fgl2-replete, but not Fgl2-devoid, environment resulted in elimination of FcγRIIB+, but not FcγRIIB–, CD8+ T cells. Similarly, plasma Fgl2 was directly proportional to CD8+ T cell lymphopenia in patients with COVID-19. RNA-Seq analysis demonstrated that Fgl2 was produced by murine virus–specific CD8+ T cells, with an increase in Fgl2 in CD8+ T cells elicited during chronic versus acute viral infection. Fgl2 was also upregulated in CD8+ T cells from patients with COVID-19 versus healthy controls. In summary, CD8+ T cell production of Fgl2 during viral infection underpinned an FcγRIIB-mediated loss of CD8+ T cell immunity in both mice and humans.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections such as influenza A virus. This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis, caused by M.tuberculosis (Mtb), remains an enduring global health challenge, especially given the limited efficacy of current therapeutic interventions. Much of existing research has focused on immune failure as a driver of tuberculosis. However, the crucial role of host macrophage biology in controlling the disease remains underappreciated. While we have gained deeper insights into how alveolar macrophages (AMs) interact with Mtb, the precise AM subsets that mediate protection and potentially prevent tuberculosis progression have yet to be identified. In this study, we employed multi-modal scRNA-seq analyses to evaluate the functional roles of diverse macrophage subpopulations across different infection timepoints, allowing us to delineate the dynamic landscape of controller and permissive AM populations during the course of infection. Our analyses at specific time-intervals post-Mtb challenge revealed macrophage populations transitioning between distinct anti- and pro-inflammatory states. Notably, early in Mtb infection, CD38− AMs showed a muted response. As infection progressed, we observed a phenotypic shift in AMs, with CD38+ monocyte-derived AMs (moAMs) and a subset of tissue-resident AMs (TR-AMs) emerging as significant controllers of bacterial growth. Furthermore, scATAC-seq analysis of naïve lungs demonstrated that CD38+ TR-AMs possessed a distinct chromatin signature prior to infection, indicative of epigenetic priming and predisposition to a pro-inflammatory response. BCG intranasal immunization increased the numbers of CD38+ macrophages, substantially enhancing their capability to restrict Mtb growth. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal, dynamic roles of different macrophage subsets in TB infection and reveal rational pathways for the development of improved vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="The severity of COVID-19 is linked to excessive inflammation. Neutrophils represent a critical arm of the innate immune response and are major mediators of inflammation, but their role in COVID-19 pathophysiology remains poorly understood. We conducted transcriptomic profiling of neutrophils obtained from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, as well as from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, in comparison to non-infected healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the inflammasome formation potential in neutrophils from patients and mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), consisting mainly of mature neutrophils, revealed a striking type I interferon (IFN-I) gene signature in severe COVID-19 patients, contrasting with mild COVID-19 and healthy controls. Notably, low-density granulocytes (LDGs) from severe COVID-19 patients exhibited an immature neutrophil phenotype and lacked this IFN-I signature. Moreover, PMNs from severe COVID-19 patients showed heightened nigericin-induced caspase1 activation, but reduced responsiveness to exogenous inflammasome priming. Furthermore, IFN-I emerged as a priming stimulus for neutrophil inflammasomes. These findings suggest a potential role for neutrophil inflammasomes in driving inflammation during severe COVID-19. Altogether, these findings open promising avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate the pathological processes associated with the disease.">

        <tr id="Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory large bowel disease characterized by immune cell infiltration and continuous erosion of intestinal crypts, causing severe ulceration and abdominal pain. In the etrolizumab Phase 3 studies, transcriptional analyses of colonic biopsies revealed reductions in genes associated with aEb7+ intraepithelial lymphocytes with etrolizumab but not adalimumab. Both treatments significantly reduced stromal and myeloid cell-associated genes, with changes associated with MCS remission status. Generation of a single-cell atlas from inflamed and uninflamed colonic biopsies from UC patients led to the identification of thirty-six discrete cell populations, including cells of the myeloid compartment. The UC atlas was used to generate cell-specific signatures, allowing for cellular deconvolution of the Phase 3 datasets. It revealed significant reductions in neutrophil subsets, monocyte-derived macrophages, and inflammatory fibroblasts, as well as increases in colonic epithelial cells common to both etrolizumab and adalimumab. Pseudo-time trajectory analyses identified four unique neutrophil subsets with unique cell phenotypes reflecting changes in cell state or differentiation from PADI4hi, OSMhi, MX1hi, and ultimately to CXCR4hi populations. PADI4hi and OSMhi neutrophils exhibited high levels of proteases (MMP9, LYZ), inflammatory cytokines (CXCL1, IL1B, OSM), and abundant cytokine or chemokine receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2). MX1 populations expressed markers indicating prior IFN exposure (MX1, IFIT1). In contrast, more differentiated or mature neutrophils exhibited high levels of CXCL2, TNF-a, and CXCR4, as well as angiogenic factors like VEGFA. PADI4hi and OSMhi neutrophils, we predict, have abundant cytokine and chemokine interactions with inflammatory fibroblasts within the inflamed colon, such as OSM: OSMR and IL1B: IL1R1 interactions. Changes in PADI4hi and OSMhi neutrophils were closely associated with MCS remission in both etrolizumab and adalimumab-treated patients. In contrast, only minor changes in CXCR4hi neutrophils were observed and not associated with clinical outcomes. Our results suggest that neutrophils are not only heterogeneous in phenotype but have abundant cell-cell interactions in inflamed colonic tissue that are likely implicated in maintaining chronic disease activity. We hypothesize that limiting the interactions between neutrophils and other myeloid cells with resident cells such as inflammatory fibroblasts may reduce the production of inflammatory mediators and limit activation and infiltration of neutrophils, which may be necessary for achieving greater rates of clinical remission in response to interventional agents.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.">

        <tr id="CD4 tissue-resident memory T (CD4 TRM) cells are crucial adaptive immune components involved in preventing influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Despite their importance, their physiological role in the upper respiratory tract, the first site of contact with IAV, remains unclear. Here, we find that, after IAV infection, antigen-specific CD4 TRM persist in the nasal tissue (NT) compartment and play a prime role in local viral clearance. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that NT CD4 TRM are heterogeneous and transcriptionally distinct as compared to their lung counterparts. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the CXCR6- CXCL16 axis is involved in CD4 TRM residency in the NT. Furthermore, we show that the NT of mice and humans contains a high frequency of IL-17-producing CD4 TRM that aid in local viral clearance and in reducing tissue damage. Collectively, our results support a robust physiological role for nasal tissue CD4 TRM in preventing IAV infection.">

        <tr id="Treatments available to prevent progression of virus-induced lung diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are of limited benefit once respiratory failure occurs. The efficacy of approved and emerging cytokine signaling-modulating antibodies is variable and is affected by disease course and patient-specific inflammation patterns. Therefore, understanding the role of inflammation on the viral infectious cycle is critical for effective use of cytokine-modulating agents. We investigated the role of the type 2 cytokine IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 binding/entry, replication, and host response in primary HAE cells in vitro and in a model of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. IL-13 protected airway epithelial cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro by decreasing the abundance of ACE2- expressing ciliated cells rather than by neutralization in the airway surface liquid or by interferon-mediated antiviral effects. In contrast, IL-13 worsened disease severity in mice; the effects were mediated by eicosanoid signaling and were abolished in mice deficient in the phospholipase A2 enzyme PLA2G2D. We conclude that IL-13-induced inflammation differentially affects multiple steps of COVID-19 pathogenesis. IL-13-induced inflammation may be protective against initial SARS-CoV-2 airway epithelial infection; however, it enhances disease progression in vivo. Blockade of IL-13 and/or eicosanoid signaling may be protective against progression to severe respiratory virus-induced lung disease. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT Evidence before this study Prior to this study, various pieces of evidence indicated the significant role of cytokines in the pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 cases were marked by cytokine storm syndrome, leading to immune activation and hyperinflammation. Treatments aimed at modulating cytokine signaling, such as IL-6 receptor antagonists, had shown moderate effects in managing severe COVID-19 cases. Studies also revealed an excessive production of type 2 cytokines, particularly IL-13 and IL-4, in the plasma and lungs of COVID-19 patients, which was associated with adverse outcomes. Treatment with anti-IL-13 monoclonal antibodies improved survival following SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that IL-13 plays a role in disease severity. Type 2 cytokines were observed to potentially suppress type 1 responses, essential for viral clearance, and imbalances between these cytokine types were linked to negative COVID-19 outcomes. These findings highlighted the complex interactions between cytokines and the immune response during viral infections, underscoring the importance of understanding IL-13’s role in COVID-19 and related lung diseases for developing effective therapeutic interventions. Added value of this study In this study, we explored the impact of IL-13-induced inflammation on various stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle using both murine (in vivo) and primary human airway epithelial (in vitro) culture models. Our findings indicated that IL-13 provided protection to airway epithelial cells against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, partly by reducing the number of ACE2- expressing ciliated cells. Conversely, IL-13 exacerbated the severity of SARS2-N501YMA30-induced disease in mice, primarily through Pla2g2d-mediated eicosanoid biosynthesis. Implications of the available evidence Current evidence indicates that PLA2G2D plays a crucial role in the IL-13-driven exacerbation of COVID-19 in mice, suggesting that targeting the IL-13-PLA2G2D axis could help protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These insights are important for clinical research, especially for studies focusing on drugs that modify IL-13 signaling or modulate eicosanoids in the treatment of asthma and respiratory virus-induced lung diseases.">

        <tr id="Immune cells from the adaptive and innate immune systems coexist in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) to mediate tumor cell immunosurveillance and prevent tumor relapse. Relapse-free survival after surgical resection is heterogeneous in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), the two major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. Yet, little is known about the composition and spatial organisation of the TME that could explain the different prognoses for lung cancer patients. Using spatial multi-omics analyses, we show that LUAD and LUSC have distinct TMEs and that neutrophil-enriched tumors are associated with worse survival, while the accumulation of myeloid-instructed CD14+ T cells in the tumor core was associated with prolonged patient survival. CD14+CD4+ T cells express prototypic markers of myeloid cells and were found to be clonally expanded tumor-specific activated T cells. TNFα signaling was activated in tumors with high infiltration of CD14+CD4+ T cells in the tumor core. Our results demonstrate that innate immune cells impact adaptive immune cell activity to support the deployment of discrete T cell populations with anti-tumor activity.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) presented clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Lack of ICI efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells that create the “cold” tumor microenvironment (TME) impeding infiltration and activation of effector T cells. We developed a designer RGD peptide that hindered glioma-instigated, integrin-mediated pro-tumoral reprogramming of myeloid cells and blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in co-cultures in vitro. Intratumorally-delivered RGD alone did not reduce glioma growth in syngeneic mice but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and led to peritumoral blood vessels normalization. Furthermore, combining RGD with immunotherapy using PD-1 blockade reduced tumor growth, led to upsurge of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depleted regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, consistently with the restored “hot” inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. RGD modified the phenotypes of myeloid cells in human gliomas in nude mice. Thus, combining the integrin blockade with ICI reinvigorates antitumor immunity and paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.">

        <tr id="The lung is constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and particles that can cause alveolar damage. Hence, appropriate repair responses are essential for gas exchange and life. Here, we deciphered the spatiotemporal trajectory and function of an atypical population of macrophages after lung injury. Post–influenza A virus (IAV) infection, short-lived monocyte-derived Ly6G-expressing macrophages (Ly6G+ Macs) were recruited to the alveoli of lung perilesional areas. Ly6G+ Macs engulfed immune cells, exhibited a high metabolic potential, and clustered with alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2s) in zones of active epithelial regeneration. Ly6G+ Macs were partially dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 receptor signaling and were essential for AT2-dependent alveolar regeneration. Similar macrophages were recruited in other models of injury and in the airspaces of lungs from patients with suspected pneumonia. This study identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G+ Macs as a spatially restricted, short-lived macrophage subset promoting epithelial regeneration postinjury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target for treating lung damage. Short-lived perilesional Ly6G+ macrophages license alveolar epithelial regeneration after viral-triggered lung injury. Editor’s summary Respiratory virus infections can cause long-lasting lung damage, but how specific lung myeloid cell populations contribute to postinfection recovery is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, Ruscitti et al. identified a distinct population of Ly6G+ monocyte-derived macrophages that emerges during the early recovery phase after viral-triggered lung injury. Ly6G+ lung macrophages were short lived and highly phagocytic and populated the alveoli within perilesional areas undergoing regeneration. Genetically engineered mice lacking lung Ly6G+ macrophages displayed impaired epithelial regeneration after influenza infection. Together, these findings identify a previously unappreciated population of reparative lung macrophages that could be targeted therapeutically to treat lung damage. —Claire Olingy">

We found that low-dose vaccinated infected mice had a 2-log reduction in lung viral burden, but increased immune cell infiltration in the lung parenchyma, characterized by monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and eosinophils. Single cell RNA-seq revealed viral RNA was highly associated with eosinophils that corresponded to a unique IFN-γ biased signature. Antibody-mediated depletion of eosinophils in vaccinated mice resulted in increased virus replication and dissemination in the lungs, demonstrating that eosinophils in the lungs are protective during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. These results highlight the critical role for the innate immune response in vaccine mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Epithelial and immune cells have long been appreciated for their contribution to the early immune response after injury; however, much less is known about the role of mesenchymal cells. Using single nuclei RNA-sequencing, we defined changes in gene expression associated with inflammation at 1-day post-wounding (dpw) in mouse skin. Compared to keratinocytes and myeloid cells, we detected enriched expression of pro-inflammatory genes in fibroblasts associated with deeper layers of the skin. In particular, SCA1+ fibroblasts were enriched for numerous chemokines, including CCL2, CCL7, and IL33 compared to SCA1-fibroblasts. Genetic deletion of Ccl2 in fibroblasts resulted in fewer wound bed macrophages and monocytes during injury-induced inflammation with reduced revascularization and re-epithelialization during the proliferation phase of healing. These findings highlight the important contribution of deep skin fibroblast-derived factors to injury-induced inflammation and the impact of immune cell dysregulation on subsequent tissue repair.">

        <tr id="Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) represent an urgent public health challenge and are estimated to affect more than 60 million individuals globally. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that dysregulated immune reactions may be linked with PASC symptoms, most investigations have primarily centered around blood-based studies, with few focusing on samples derived from affected tissues. Furthermore, clinical studies alone often provide correlative insights rather than causal mechanisms. Thus, it is essential to compare clinical samples with relevant animal models and conduct functional experiments to understand the etiology of PASC. In this study, we comprehensively compared bronchoalveolar lavage fluid single-cell RNA sequencing data derived from clinical PASC samples and a mouse model of PASC. This revealed a pro-fibrotic monocyte-derived macrophage response in respiratory PASC, as well as abnormal interactions between pulmonary macrophages and respiratory resident T cells, in both humans and mice. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) emerged as a key node mediating the immune anomalies in respiratory PASC. Neutralizing IFN-γ after the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced lung inflammation and tissue fibrosis in mice. Together, our study underscores the importance of performing comparative analysis to understand the cause of PASC and suggests that the IFN-γ signaling axis might represent a therapeutic target. Comparative scRNA-seq analysis, combined with functional experiments in an animal model, identified IFN-γ as a target for respiratory PASC. Editor’s summary The term “Long Covid” covers a myriad of symptoms that a person may experience after an acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is also referred to as postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). The specific drivers of these symptoms are unclear, complicating the development of therapeutics for those suffering from this condition. Here, Li et al. used comparative analysis to interrogate a potential driver of respiratory PASC, one of the most debilitating types of PASC. The authors found that humans with respiratory PASC had evidence of an enhanced monocyte-derived macrophage response in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A similar phenotype was observed in aged C57BL/6 mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. This phenotype in mice could be reduced by anti–interferon-γ (anti–IFN-γ) treatment initiated after the resolution of acute disease, suggesting that the IFN-γ signaling pathway may represent a potential therapeutic target for humans. —Courtney Malo">

Neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages recruited to pathogen-infected lungs, including SARS-CoV-2–infected lungs, express phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ), a signaling protein that coordinates both granulocyte and monocyte trafficking to diseased tissues and immune-suppressive, profibrotic transcription in myeloid cells. PI3Kγ deletion and inhibition with the clinical PI3Kγ inhibitor eganelisib promoted survival in models of infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 and MRSA, by suppressing inflammation, vascular leak, organ damage, and cytokine storm. These results demonstrate essential roles for PI3Kγ in inflammatory lung disease and support the potential use of PI3Kγ inhibitors to suppress inflammation in severe infectious diseases. PI3Kγ inhibition suppresses lethal inflammation associated with severe infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2. Editor’s summary Respiratory diseases caused by different infectious agents can look similar and can rely on similar therapeutic approaches to dampen inflammation. Here, Shepard et al. identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) as a protein that is up-regulated in innate immune cells in the lungs of individuals with COVID-19. They further showed that this was not a COVID-19–specific marker because PI3Kγ was up-regulated in mice infected with other pathogens and after sterile inflammation. PI3Kγ inhibition promoted survival across distinct mouse models of respiratory inflammation and reduced inflammation and vascular leak in the lungs of these animals. These data, which span across human and murine studies, suggest that PI3Kγ inhibition may be an effective host-directed therapy for lung inflammation. —Courtney Malo">

However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR1 has been implicated in maintaining self-tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and mediating antiviral immunity. Foreign viral double-stranded RNA triggers rapid interferon response and activates ADAR1 in the host immune system. Emerging data points to a role of ADAR1 A-to-I editing in the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19 disease. We identify A-to-I editing events within human whole transcriptome data from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, non-infected individuals, and individuals with other viral illnesses from nasopharyngeal swabs. High levels of RNA editing in host cells are associated with low SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p = 9.27 E-06), suggesting an inhibitory effect of ADAR1 on viral infection. Additionally, we find differentially expressed genes associated with RNA-modifications and interferon response. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected nasopharyngeal swabs reveals that cytotoxic CD8 T cells upregulate ADAR1 in COVID-19 positive samples (p = 0.0269). We further reveal ADAR1 expression increases with CD4 and CD8 T cell activation, and knockdown of ADAR1 leads to apoptosis and aberrant IL-2 secretion. Together, our data suggests A-to-I RNA editing is required to maintain healthy homeostasis of activated T cells to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

In contrast, IL-10 limits the duration of acute pulmonary lesions, serum markers of inflammation and the magnitude of virus-specific T cell expansion but does not impair viral clearance. We also show that IL-10 induces the subsequent differentiation of virus-specific effector T cells into CD69+CD103+ tissue resident memory cells (Trm) in the airways and maintains Trm cells in nasal mucosal surfaces, highlighting an unexpected role for IL-10 in promoting airway memory T cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection of macaques.">

To address this deficit, we employed a validated experimental NK cell depletion non-human primate (NHP) model with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant B.1.617.2 challenge. Viral loads (VL), NK cell numbers, activation, proliferation, and functional measures were evaluated in blood and tissues. In non-depleted (control) animals, infection rapidly induced NK cell expansion, activation, and increased tissue trafficking associated with VL. Strikingly, we report that experimental NK cell depletion leads to higher VL, longer duration of viral shedding, significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, and overt lung damage. Overall, we find the first significant and conclusive evidence for NK cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and disease pathology. These data indicate that adjunct therapies for infection could largely benefit from NK cell-targeted approaches.">

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) leads to progressive neurodegeneration and dementia. AD primarily affects older adults with neuropathological changes including amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. We have previously demonstrated that systemic treatment with combined stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (SCF+G-CSF) reduces the Aβ load, increases Aβ uptake by activated microglia and macrophages, reduces neuroinflammation, and restores dendrites and synapses in the brains of aged APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. However, the mechanisms underlying SCF+G-CSF-enhanced brain repair in aged APP/PS1 mice remain unclear. This study used a transcriptomic approach to identify the potential mechanisms by which SCF+G-CSF treatment modulates microglia and peripheral myeloid cells to mitigate AD pathology in the aged brain. After injections of SCF+G-CSF for 5 consecutive days, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on CD11b+ cells isolated from the brains of 28-month-old APP/PS1 mice. The vast majority of cell clusters aligned with transcriptional profiles of microglia in various activation states. However, SCF+G-CSF treatment dramatically increased a cell population showing upregulation of marker genes related to peripheral myeloid cells. Flow cytometry data also revealed an SCF+G-CSF-induced increase of cerebral CD45high/CD11b+ active phagocytes. SCF+G-CSF treatment robustly increased the transcription of genes implicated in immune cell activation, including gene sets that regulate inflammatory processes and cell migration. The expression of S100a8 and S100a9 was robustly enhanced following SCF+G-CSF treatment in all CD11b+ cell clusters. Moreover, the topmost genes differentially expressed with SCF+G-CSF treatment were largely upregulated in S100a8/9-positive cells, suggesting a well-conserved transcriptional profile related to SCF+G-CSF treatment in resident and peripherally derived CD11b+ immune cells. This S100a8/9-associated transcriptional profile contained notable genes related to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, neuroprotection, and Aβ plaque inhibition or clearance. Altogether, this study reveals the immunomodulatory effects of SCF+G-CSF treatment in the aged brain with AD pathology, which will guide future studies to further uncover the therapeutic mechanisms.">

We provide the first single cell sequencing characterisation of the human TST reaction, based on skin suction blisters induced at the site of the TST on day 2 in 31 individuals. Integrated single cell RNA and TCR sequencing showed the immune response to be dominated by T cells, with smaller populations of NK cells and myeloid cells. T cells comprised CD4, CD8, gamma/delta and NK T cells, with 50% of all T cells identified as cytotoxic and 14% as regulatory. Interferon gamma gene expression was strongest in CD8 T cells, and distinct CD4 T helper lineages could not unambiguously be identified at this time point. Amongst myeloid cells, 63% displayed antimicrobial gene expression and 28% were functionally polarised towards antigen presentation with higher levels of HLA class 2 expression. We derived and validated transcriptional signatures for cell types and cellular functions relevant to the immune landscape of the TST. These data help to improve our understanding of the immune response to Mtb and enable further exploration of bulk transcriptomic data through context-specific cellular deconvolution.">

Herein, we asked when and where TAMs arise from blood monocytes and how they evolve during tumor development. We initiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in inducible monocyte fate-mapping mice and combined single-cell transcriptomics and high-dimensional flow cytometry to profile the monocyte-to-TAM transition. We revealed that monocytes differentiate first into a transient intermediate population of TAMs that generates two longer-lived lineages of terminally differentiated TAMs with distinct gene expression profiles, phenotypes, and intratumoral localization. Transcriptome datasets and tumor samples from patients with PDAC evidenced parallel TAM populations in humans and their prognostic associations. These insights will support the design of new therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs in PDAC. Intermediate tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) emerge first and give rise to two more differentiated TAM populations in pancreatic cancer. Editor’s summary Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor growth and immune suppression, but how TAMs develop from circulating monocytes and local tissue-resident macrophages remains incompletely understood. Using a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in monocyte fate-mapping mice, Dunsmore et al. examined the dynamics of the monocyte-to-macrophage transition in tumors. A population of “intermediate” TAMs gave rise to two more differentiated TAM subsets, distinguishable by their distinct surface marker phenotype, dependence on the transcription factor Maf, migratory behavior, and localization in tumors. These findings provide a time- and space-resolved picture of TAM heterogeneity and development in PDAC, which could guide the future development of TAM-targeted therapeutic strategies. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="While immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated durable responses in various cancer types, a significant proportion of patients do not exhibit favourable responses to these interventions. To uncover potential factors associated with a positive response to immunotherapy, we established a bilateral tumor model using P815 mastocytoma implanted in DBA/2 mice. In this model, only a fraction of tumor-bearing mice responds favourably to anti-PD-1 treatment, thus providing a valuable model to explore the influence of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in determining the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based immunotherapies. Moreover, this model allows for the analysis of a pretreatment tumor and inference of its treatment outcome based on the response observed in the contralateral tumor. Here, we demonstrated that tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell clones expressing high levels of Tim-3 were associated to a positive anti-tumor response following anti-PD-1 administration. Our study also revealed distinct differentiation dynamics in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in responding and non-responding mice. An IFNγ-enriched TME appeared to promote the differentiation of monocytes into PD-L1pos MHC IIhigh cells in mice responding to immunotherapy. Monocytes present in the TME of non-responding mice failed to reach the same final stage of differentiation trajectory, suggesting that an altered monocyte to macrophage route may hamper the response to ICB. These insights will direct future research towards a temporal analysis of TAMs, aiming to identify factors responsible for transitions between differentiation states within the TME. This approach may potentially pave the way to novel strategies to enhance the efficacy of PD-1 blockade.">

        <tr id="Exhaustion represents a collection of programmed T cell differentiation states and an important mode of T cell dysfunction. T cell progression from progenitor to terminal exhaustion is associated with upregulation of the transcription factor TOX and expression of TIM3. Our understanding of factors regulating TOX expression and the transition from progenitor to terminal exhaustion, however, remains incomplete. We reveal here that T cell upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor type II (TNFR2) coincides with the gain of phenotypic markers and functions reflective of terminal exhaustion. Meanwhile, knocking out TNFR2 affords a novel population of T cells that express TIM3 but possess diminished TOX levels and functional characteristics of both progenitor and terminally exhausted cells. TIM3+ TNFR2 KO T cells exhibit reduced exhaustion transcriptional programs and enhanced AP1 pathway signatures. Finally, TNFR2 KO mice demonstrate improved T cell-dependent control of tumor and chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis viral (cLCMV) infection, while pharmacologic antagonism of TNFR2 licenses responses to checkpoint blockade in multiple tumor models.">

        <tr id="Secondary bacterial infection, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is one of the most frequent and severe complications of influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pneumonia. Phenotyping of the pulmonary innate immune landscape after IAV infection revealed a significant depletion of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophage (TR-AM) population at day 7, which was associated with increased susceptibility to Spn outgrowth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TR-AM depletion, and to define putative targets for treatment, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and cell-specific PCR profiling in an unbiased manner, using in vivo models of IAV infection and IAV/Spn co-infection. The TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) ligand-receptor axis was revealed as the driving force behind post-influenza TR-AM death during the early infection phase, enabling the transition to pneumococcal pneumonia, while intrapulmonary transfer of genetically modified TR-AMs and antibody-mediated neutralization of specific pathway components alleviated disease severity. With a mainly neutrophilic expression and a high abundance in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of patients with severe virus-induced ARDS, TNFSF14 emerged as a novel determinant of virus-driven lung injury. Targeting the TNFSF14-mediated intercellular communication network in the virus-infected lung can, therefore, improve host defense, minimizing the risk of subsequent bacterial pneumonia, and ameliorating disease outcome.">

        <tr id="Current rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatments do not restore immune tolerance. Investigating dendritic cell (DC) populations in human synovial tissue (ST) may reveal pathways to re-instate tolerance in RA. With single-cell and spatial-transcriptomics of synovial tissue biopsies, validated by micro co-culture systems, we identified condition and niche-specific myeloid DC clusters with distinct differentiation trajectories and functions. Healthy synovium contains a unique tolerogenic AXLpos DC2 cluster in the superficial sublining layer. In active RA, a macrophage-rich lining-layer niche becomes populated with inflammatory DC3 clusters that specifically activate memory CCL5pos TEM and CCL5posCXCL13pos TPH, promoting synovitis. In the sublining lymphoid niche, CCR7pos DC2 mReg specifically interact with naïve-T-cells, potentially driving the local expansion of new effector T-cells. Sustained remission sees the resolution of these niches but lacks the recovery of tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, indicating latent potential for disease flare. A human RA disease-flare model showed that the activation of blood predecessor of ST-DC3 clusters precedes the onset of inflammation in joints. Therapeutic strategies targeting pathogenic ST-DC3 clusters, or reinstating tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, may restore immune homeostasis in RA. In brief Deconstruction of human RA synovium, using single-cell spatial transcriptomics and micro-culture systems, reveals distinct neighbourhoods within the synovial architecture across health, and RA patients with active disease or sustained remission. Discrete niches are identified that contain distinct myeloid DC clusters that differ in frequency, differentiation trajectories, and effector functions. Highlights Human RA synovium exhibits condition and niche specific myeloid DC clusters that vary in their tissue differentiation trajectories and functions. ST-CD14pos DC3 (iDC3) support inflammatory CCL5pos TEM and CCL5pos TPH cell activation in the hyperplastic lining layer.

        <tr id="Age is a major risk factor for liver cancer, as is the case for most adult human cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. A better understanding of the role of aging in liver and other cancers can facilitate approaches for risk assessment, early detection and prevention. We hypothesize that age-driven changes render aged liver more sensitive to oncogenic stress and hence tumorigenesis. To investigate how the liver changes with age, we documented the immune profile, transcriptome and epigenome of healthy livers from both young and aged mice, revealing pronounced alterations with aging. Notably, in aged hepatocytes, we identified heightened interferon (IFN) signaling, as well as simultaneous tumor suppressor and oncogene signaling at both bulk and single cell level, suggestive of an aged liver that is poised for neoplasia. To challenge this seemingly poised state, we employed adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of a c-Myc oncogene in young and aged mouse liver hepatocytes in vivo. Analysis of aged hepatocytes expressing c-Myc revealed further elevated expression of IFN Stimulated Genes (ISGs). This ISG upregulation was evident in multiple models of oncogenic stress and transformation in older mice and also observed in aged humans with Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). We determined that Stat1 is both necessary and sufficient for the age specific elevated ISG expression in old wild type mice. Remarkably, inhibiting Jak/Stat signaling alongside ectopic c-Myc expression led to high-grade hepatocyte dysplasia and tumor formation, selectively in aged mice. Together, these results suggest that an aged liver is in a state of “precarious balance”, due to concurrent activation of oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways, but protected against neoplastic progression by IFN-signaling. Age-dependent activation of IFN signaling has been observed in many tissues and recent studies have demonstrated its detrimental consequences on aging, raising the question as to why IFN-signaling is activated during aging. We propose that aged tissues are intrinsically at higher risk of cancer and age-dependent activation of IFN-signaling is an adaptive process to protect from tumorigenesis, but one that also has maladaptive consequences.">

Although single-cell transcriptomics have revealed Trm heterogeneity in various diseases, the molecular mechanisms behind this diversity are unclear. To investigate this, we used Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection, which persists in the central nervous system (CNS) and is controlled by brain CD8+ Trm. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of brain CD8+ T cells from T. gondii-infected mice showed heterogeneous expression of the transcriptional regulator Id2, correlating with different functional states. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we found that Id2-deficiency in T cells caused parasite-specific Trm to develop an altered phenotype with diminished effector functions and reduced expression of CD49a. Furthermore, loss of Id2 in brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells led to the accumulation of exhausted PD1+Tox+CD8+ Trm cells, while Id2 overexpression repressed T cell exhaustion. Overall, our study shows that Id2 levels dictate the acquisition of effector vs. exhausted phenotypes in CD8+ Trm during chronic CNS infection.

        <tr id="Aims/hypothesis Immunotherapeutics targeting T cells are crucial for inhibiting autoimmune disease progression proximal to disease onset in type 1 diabetes. A growing number of T cell-directed therapeutics have demonstrated partial therapeutic efficacy, with anti-CD3 (α-CD3) representing the only regulatory agency-approved drug capable of slowing disease progression through a mechanism involving the induction of partial T cell exhaustion. There is an outstanding need to augment the durability and effectiveness of T cell targeting by directly restraining proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 1 cytotoxic CD8+ T cell (Tc1) subsets, while simultaneously augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Here, we present a novel strategy for reducing diabetes incidence in the NOD mouse model using a blocking monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 diabetes-risk associated T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD226. Methods Female NOD mice were treated with anti-CD226 between 7-8 weeks of age and then monitored for diabetes incidence and therapeutic mechanism of action. Results Compared to isotype-treated controls, anti-CD226 treated NOD mice showed reduced insulitis severity at 12 weeks and decreased disease incidence at 30 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis performed five weeks post-treatment demonstrated reduced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells in spleens of anti-CD226 treated mice. Phenotyping of pancreatic Tregs revealed increased CD25 expression and STAT5 phosphorylation following anti-CD226, with splenic Tregs displaying augmented suppression of CD4+ T cell responders in vitro. Anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited reduced frequencies of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein (IGRP)-reactive CD8+ T cells in the pancreas, using both ex vivo tetramer staining and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) approaches. 51Cr-release assays demonstrated reduced cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells by anti-CD226-treated autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Conclusions/interpretation CD226 blockade reduces T cell cytotoxicity and improves Treg function, representing a targeted and rational approach for restoring immune regulation in type 1 diabetes. Research in Context What is already known about this subject? The co-stimulatory receptor CD226 is upregulated upon activation and is highly expressed on NK cell subsets, myeloid cells, and effector T cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism in CD226 (rs763361; C>T) results in a Gly307Ser missense mutation linked to genetic susceptibility for type 1 diabetes. Global knockout of Cd226 and conditional Cd226 knockout in FoxP3+ Tregs reduced insulitis severity and diabetes incidence in NOD mice, indicating a crucial role for CD226 in disease pathogenesis. What is the key question? Can CD226 blockade reduce T cell cytotoxicity and improve Treg function to diminish diabetes incidence in NOD mice? What are the new findings? Anti-CD226 treatment reduced insulitis, decreased disease incidence, and inhibited splenic CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cell proliferation. Pancreatic Tregs from anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited increased CD25 expression; splenic Tregs displayed augmented STAT5 phosphorylation and suppressive capacity in vitro. Anti-CD226 treatment reduced IGRP-specific pancreatic CD8+ T cell frequencies, and reduced autoreactive CD8+ T cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells in vitro. How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? CD226 blockade could reduce autoreactive T cell cytotoxicity, enhance Treg function, and slow disease progression in high-risk or recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases.">

While NET targeting may improve clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, its impact on adaptive immunity, crucial for fighting the virus, remains unclear. Our study demonstrates that both recombinant human DNase (rhDNase), degrading NET structure, and GSK484, inhibiting NET formation, reduce lung NET concentration and improve clinical outcomes in infected mice, yet they differ in their influence on T cell responses. We show that rhDNase does not impact T cell responses, whereas GSK484 diminishes virus-specific T cell responses. In vitro, GSK484 decreases dendritic cell antigen presentation by impairing antigen uptake and reduces IL-2 signaling by affecting its production by T cells. In a model of lung inflammation, GSK484 diminishes antigen-specific T cell activation and proliferation, while rhDNase shows a potential to boost T cell responses via the presence of NET fragments that reduce T cell activation threshold. Our findings suggest that NET targeting with rhDNase or GSK484 holds therapeutic potential for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, while their distinct modes of action shape T cell responses during the infection.">

        <tr id="The cytokine interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a pivotal T cell-derived signal crucial for germinal center (GC) responses, but the precise mechanisms by which IL-21 influences B cell function remain elusive. Here, we investigated the B cell-intrinsic role of IL-21 signaling by employing a novel IL-21 receptor (Il21r) conditional knock-out mouse model and ex vivo culture systems and uncovered a surprising duality of IL-21 signaling in B cells. While IL-21 stimulation of naïve B cells led to Bim-dependent apoptosis, it promoted robust proliferation of pre-activated B cells, particularly class-switched IgG1+ B cells ex vivo. Consistent with this, B cell-specific deletion of Il21r led to a severe defect in IgG1 responses in vivo following immunization. Intriguingly, Il21r-deleted B cells are significantly impaired in their ability to transition from a pre-GC to a GC state following immunization. Although Il21r-deficiency did not affect the proportion of IgG1+ B cells among GC B cells, it greatly diminished the proportion of IgG1+ B cells among the plasmablast/plasma cell population. Collectively, our data suggest that IL-21 serves as a critical regulator of B cell fates, influencing B cell apoptosis and proliferation in a context-dependent manner.">

        <tr id="Background Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can reduce severity of subsequent LRTIs but have also been linked to respiratory allergy development and exacerbation. Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

        <tr id="Protection from pathogens relies on both humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular (T cell-mediated) responses. While infections robustly elicit both types of immunity, currently approved vaccine adjuvants largely fail to induce T cell responses on par with that instigated by infections. Our goal was to investigate the transcriptional programming that supports the formation of CD8+ T cells elicited by subunit vaccines compared to those elicited by infections. Our data show that vaccine-elicited T cells represent a transcriptionally unique subset of activated T cells with high proliferative capacity and a memory cell fate. This relies on IL-27 signaling, which stabilizes c-Myc and thereby supports the biomass acquisition necessary for clonal expansion. Collectively, our findings reveal that subunit vaccine-elicited T cells uniquely combine aspects of both memory and effector T cell subsets, and selectively utilize IL-27 signaling to sustain the clonal expansion of cells dedicated to a memory fate. One Sentence Summary In contrast to infection, subunit vaccines induce a distinct population of CD8+ T cells with memory fate characteristics which maintain their proliferative capacity during the expansion phase through IL-27 receptor signaling.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, exhibit altered gene expression in response to various neurological conditions. This study investigates the relationship between West Nile Virus infection and microglial senescence, focusing on the role of LGALS3BP, a protein implicated in both antiviral responses and aging. Using spatial transcriptomics, RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we characterized changes in microglial gene signatures in adult and aged mice following recovery from WNV encephalitis. Additionally, we analyzed Lgals3bp expression and generated Lgals3bp-deficient mice to assess the impact on neuroinflammation and microglial phenotypes. Our results show that WNV-activated microglia share transcriptional signatures with aged microglia, including upregulation of genes involved in interferon response and inflammation. Lgals3bp was broadly expressed in the CNS and robustly upregulated during WNV infection and aging. Lgals3bp-deficient mice exhibited reduced neuroinflammation, increased homeostatic microglial numbers, and altered T cell populations without differences in virologic control or survival. These data indicate that LGALS3BP has a role in regulating neuroinflammation and microglial activation and suggest that targeting LGALS3BP might provide a potential route for mitigating neuroinflammation-related cognitive decline in aging and post-viral infections.">

        <tr id="Local inflammation in the pancreas is transient but imprints a durable epigenetic memory on epithelial cells, making them more amenable to oncogenic transformation. However, it is unclear whether epithelial cell heterogeneity is impacted by acute pancreatitis (AP) or whether population dynamics during regeneration contributes to the establishment of inflammation memory. To tackle those questions, we deployed experimental pancreatitis in mice and performed paired sequencing of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles at single nucleus resolution. We documented cell type abundance but also applied integrative analyses to infer phenotypically-distinct clusters of mesenchymal and exocrine cells. We found that AP perturbs a subset of “idling” acinar cells, which separate from more canonical “secretory” acini based on a more diversified proteome, which include elevated expression of signal transduction receptors. We linked acinar cell heterogeneity to epigenetic differences that also endow idling cells with superior plasticity. These constitute about 40% of acinar cells but can proliferate and skew their phenotype in response to AP. This leads to a remarkable recovery of pancreas histology and function, but also to the dissemination of idling-like features across the exocrine parenchyma. Mechanistically, idling acinar cells are characterized by enhanced transcriptional activity and protein synthesis. After recovery from pancreatitis, acini show elevation of both and establishment of chronic Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). We finally demonstrated that AP-primed pancreata show signs of elevated UPR and that ER stress promotes acinar cell metaplasia. Our data interrogate phenotypical dynamics during tissue regeneration to identify cell states amenable to epigenetic imprinting. They also suggest that UPR-alleviating strategies might curtail the risk of developing pancreatic cancer for individuals who experiences AP.">

We employed the chronic VL model, and revealed an open niche established by KCs death and their migration outside of the sinusoids, resulting in their gradual replacement by monocyte-derived KCs (moKCs). While early granulomas were composed of resKCs, late granulomas were found outside of the sinusoids and contained resKC-derived macrophages, and monocyte-derived macrophages (momacs). ResKCs and moKCs within the sinusoids were identified as homeostatic/regulatory cells, while resKC-derived macrophages and momacs within late granulomas were pro-inflammatory. Despite the infection being largely confined to the resKC-derived macrophages, in the absence of monocyte recruitment, parasite control was strongly compromised. Macrophage heterogeneity, involving migration and reprogramming of resKCs, along with recruitment of monocyte-derived cells, is a hallmark of granuloma maturation and hepatic immunity in VL.">

Infected patients show strong systemic inflammation and immune cell activation. NK cells are highly activated in HFRS, suggesting that also other innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) might be responding to infection. Here, we characterized peripheral ILC responses, and measured plasma levels of soluble factors and plasma viral load, in 17 Puumala virus (PUUV)-infected HFRS patients. This revealed an increased frequency of ILC2 in patients, in particular the ILC2 lineage-committed c-Kitlo ILC2 subset. Patients’ ILCs showed an activated profile with increased proliferation and displayed altered expression of several homing markers. How ILCs are activated during viral infection is largely unknown. When analyzing PUUV-mediated activation of ILCs in vitro we observed that this was dependent on type I interferons, suggesting a role for type I interferons—produced in response to virus infection–in the activation of ILCs. Further, stimulation of naïve ILC2s with IFN-β affected ILC2 cytokine responses in vitro, causing decreased IL-5 and IL-13, and increased IL-10, CXCL10, and GM-CSF secretion. These results show that ILCs are activated in HFRS patients and suggest that the classical antiviral type I IFNs are involved in shaping ILC functions.">

        <tr id="Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which coexists as four genetically and immunologically distinct serotypes (DENV1-4). In secondary heterologous DENV infection, pre-existing immunity is believed to contribute to severe disease through antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). Although the elevated pathology observed in ADE conditions has been described, the cell intrinsic mechanisms governing this process remain unclear. Using scRNAseq, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages infected by DENV via ADE compared to conventional infection conditions. Unsupervised analysis of scRNAseq data enabled the identification and differentiation of infected and bystander/uninfected cells in a heterogeneous cell culture. Differential gene expression and Ingenuity Pathway analyses revealed a number of significantly up- and down-regulated genes and gene networks between cells infected by ADE compared to conventional infection. Specifically, these pathways indicated mechanisms such as suppressed interferon signaling and inflammatory chemokine transcription in cells infected via ADE. Further analysis revealed that transcriptomic changes were independent of viral RNA within infected cells, suggesting that the observed changes are reflective of cell-intrinsic responses and not simply a function of per-cell viral burden. Bystander cells in ADE conditions also demonstrated distinct profiles, indicating an immunologically activated phenotype enriched for the expression of gene networks involved with protein translation, cytokine production, and antigen presentation. Together, these findings support the concept that DENV infection via ADE induces a qualitatively different transcriptomic response in infected and bystander cells, contributing to our understanding of ADE as a mechanistic driver of disease and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen with a significant and growing global health burden. Although correlates of severe dengue disease are poorly understood, pre-existing immunity to DENV has been associated with severe disease risk and known to contribute to an alternative route of viral entry termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Using single cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct transcriptomic processes involved in antibody-mediated DENV entry compared to conventional receptor mediated entry. These data provide meaningful insight into the discrete processes contributing to DENV pathogenesis in ADE conditions.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

Senior populations have the greatest risk of severe COVID-19, and sexual dimorphism in clinical outcomes has been reported. Neurological symptoms are widely observed in COVID-19 patients, with many survivors exhibiting persistent neurological and cognitive impairment. The present study aims to investigate the impact of age and sex on the neuroinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection using a mouse model. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.351, a variant known to infect mice. Older male mice exhibited a significantly greater weight loss and higher viral loads in the lung at 3 days post infection. Notably, no viral RNA was detected in the brains of infected mice. Nevertheless, expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and CCL-2 in the lung and brain increased with viral infection. RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of brains showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused significant changes in gene expression profiles, implicating innate immunity, defense response to virus, and cerebrovascular and neuronal functions. These findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a neuroinflammatory response, despite the lack of detectable virus in the brain. Aberrant activation of innate immune response, disruption of blood-brain barrier and endothelial cell integrity, and suppression of neuronal activity and axonogenesis underlie the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain. Understanding the role of these affected pathways in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis helps identify appropriate points of therapeutic interventions to alleviate neurological dysfunction observed during COVID-19.">

The roles of T helper 2 (TH2) cells and regulatory immune responses in chronic infection are well documented, but less is known about human immune responses during acute infection. Here, we comprehensively map immune responses during controlled human Schistosoma mansoni infection using male or female cercariae. Immune responses to male or female parasite single-sex infection were comparable. An early TH1-biased inflammatory response was observed at week 4 after infection, which was particularly apparent in individuals experiencing symptoms of acute schistosomiasis. By week 8 after infection, inflammatory responses were followed by an expansion of TH2 and regulatory cell subsets. This study demonstrates the shift from TH1 to both TH2 and regulatory responses, typical of chronic schistosomiasis, in the absence of egg production and provides immunological insight into the clinical manifestations of acute schistosomiasis. Single-sex (egg-free) Schistosoma mansoni infection induces initial type 1 responses in symptomatic participants that mature to type 2. Editor’s summary Schistosomiasis infection causes more than 230 million infections worldwide, but immune responses during acute infection are not well understood. To better observe these responses, Houlder et al. used controlled human Schistosoma mansoni infections with either male or female cercaria-stage parasites. T helper 1 (TH1) cell–biased inflammatory responses dominated at early time points (4 weeks after infection), and male and female parasites induced similar responses. At 8 weeks after infection, TH2 and regulatory cell responses were more dominant and were consistent with responses seen during chronic infection. These results highlight the shift in immune responses occurring over the course of infection. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="Although vaccines have reduced the burden of COVID-19, their efficacy in helminth infection–endemic areas is not well characterized. We evaluated the impact of infection by Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb), a murine intestinal roundworm, on the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine targeting the Wuhan-1 spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in mice. Although immunization generated similar B cell responses in Hpb-infected and uninfected mice, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were markedly reduced in Hpb-infected mice. Hpb-infected and mRNA-vaccinated mice were protected against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1/2020, but control of lung infection was diminished against an Omicron variant compared with animals immunized without Hpb infection. Helminth-mediated suppression of spike protein–specific CD8+ T cell responses occurred independently of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling, whereas blockade of interleukin-10 (IL-10) rescued vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses. Together, these data show that, in mice, intestinal helminth infection impaired vaccine-induced T cell responses through an IL-10 pathway, which compromised protection against antigenically drifted SARS-CoV-2 variants. Intestinal helminth infection blunts T cell responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in mice. Editor’s summary Much of the global population lives in areas endemic to helminths, which are known to affect responses to vaccines. To discern how helminth infection affects responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, Desai et al. infected mice with the hookworm Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) during the course of a primary SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series. The authors found that Hpb infection compromised T cell, but not antibody, responses to SARS-CoV-2 in an IL-10–dependent manner. Although Hpb-infected K18-hACE2 mice were protected from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 challenge through their antibody responses, they were more susceptible to challenge with an Omicron variant, which can evade antibodies but is still susceptible to T cell responses. Together, these data highlight the need to keep helminth infections in mind during vaccine development and deployment. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="In chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), tissue-resident self-reactive T cells perpetuate disease. The specific tissue factors governing the persistence and continuous differentiation of these cells remain undefined but could represent attractive therapeutic targets. In a model of chronic CNS autoimmunity, we find that oligodendrocyte-derived interleukin-33 (IL-33), an alarmin, is key for locally regulating the pathogenicity of self-reactive CD8+ T cells. The selective ablation of IL-33 from neo-self-antigen-expressing oligodendrocytes mitigates CNS disease. In this context, fewer self-reactive CD8+ T cells persist in the inflamed CNS, and the remaining cells are largely locked into a stem-like precursor program, failing to form TCF-1low effector progeny. Importantly, interventional IL-33 blockade by locally administered somatic gene therapy reduces T cell infiltrates and improves the disease course. Our study identifies oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 as a druggable tissue factor regulating the differentiation and survival of self-reactive CD8+ T cell in the inflamed CNS. This finding introduces tissue factors as a novel category of immune targets for treating chronic CNS autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Neutrophils, underestimated in multiple sclerosis (MS), are gaining increased attention for their significant functions in patients with MS and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model. However, the precise role of neutrophils in cervical lymph nodes (CLNs), the primary CNS-draining lymph nodes where the autoimmune response is initiated during the progression of EAE, remains poorly understood. Methods Applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we constructed a comprehensive immune cell atlas of CLNs during development of EAE. Through this atlas, we concentrated on and uncovered the transcriptional landscape, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of neutrophils, and their crosstalk with immune cells within CLNs in the neuroinflammatory processes in EAE. Results Notably, we observed a substantial increase in the neutrophil population in EAE mice, with a particular emphasis on the significant rise within the CLNs. Neutrophils in CLNs were categorized into 3 subtypes, and we explored the specific roles and developmental trajectories of each distinct neutrophil subtype. Neutrophils were found to engage in extensive interactions with other immune cells, playing crucial roles in T-cell activation. Moreover, our findings highlighted the strong migratory ability of neutrophils to CLNs, partly regulated by triggering the receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1). Inhibiting TREM1 with LR12 prevents neutrophil migration both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, in patients with MS, we confirmed an increase in peripheral neutrophils with an upregulation of TREM-1. Discussion Our research provides a comprehensive and precise single-cell atlas of CLNs in EAE, highlighting the role of neutrophils in regulating the periphery immune response. In addition, TREM-1 emerged as an essential regulator of neutrophil migration to CLNs, holding promise as a potential therapeutic target in MS.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced cell death is a key contributor to COVID-19 pathology. Cell death induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well studied in myeloid cells but less in its primary host cell type, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing human airway epithelia (HAE). SARS-CoV-2 induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in HAE organotypic cultures. Single-cell and limiting-dilution analysis revealed that necroptosis is the primary cell death event in infected cells, whereas uninfected bystanders undergo apoptosis, and pyroptosis occurs later during infection. Mechanistically, necroptosis is induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA–binding protein 1 (ZBP1) in HAE and lung tissues from patients with COVID-19. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, which causes more severe disease than Omicron (B1.1.529) in humans, is associated with orders of magnitude–greater Z-RNA/ZBP1 interactions, necroptosis, and disease severity in animal models. Thus, Delta induces robust ZBP1-mediated necroptosis and more disease severity. Z-RNA/ZBP1–induced necroptosis is an initiating cell death event that occurs markedly more with Delta than Omicron infection. Editor’s summary SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers multiple cell death pathways that contribute to disease severity. Here, Liang et al. characterized cell death mechanisms in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing cells and primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in autopsied lungs from patients with COVID-19. Necroptosis was the primary form of cell death and was induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA binding protein-1 (ZBP-1). Infected and bystander cells underwent apoptosis, but limiting dilution analysis showed that apoptosis was a bystander effect. The Delta variant induced much greater Z-RNA/ZBP-1 interactions and necroptosis compared with Omicron, thus suggesting a mechanism associated with greater disease severity (see related Focus by Wong and Perlman). —Christiana N.

        <tr id="Abstract IκB kinase (IKK)α controls noncanonical NF-κB signaling required for lymphoid organ development. We showed previously that lymph node formation is ablated in IkkαLyve-1 mice constitutively lacking IKKα in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). We now reveal that loss of IKKα in LECs leads to the formation of BALT in the lung. Tertiary lymphoid structures appear only in the lungs of IkkαLyve-1 mice and are not present in any other tissues, and these highly organized BALT structures form after birth and in the absence of inflammation. Additionally, we show that IkkαLyve-1 mice challenged with influenza A virus (IAV) exhibit markedly improved survival and reduced weight loss compared with littermate controls. Importantly, we determine that the improved morbidity and mortality of IkkαLyve-1 mice is independent of viral load and rate of clearance because both mice control and clear IAV infection similarly. Instead, we show that IFN-γ levels are decreased, and infiltration of CD8 T cells and monocytes into IkkαLyve-1 lungs is reduced. We conclude that ablating IKKα in LECs promotes BALT formation and reduces the susceptibility of IkkαLyve-1 mice to IAV infection through a decrease in proinflammatory stimuli.">

        <tr id="Coxsackievirus B (CVB) infection has long been considered an environmental factor precipitating Type 1 diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disease marked by loss of insulin-producing β cells within pancreatic islets. Previous studies have shown CVB infection negatively impacts islet function and viability but do not report on how virus infection individually affects the multiple cell types present in human primary islets. Therefore, we hypothesized that the various islet cell populations have unique transcriptional responses to CVB infection. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on human cadaveric islets treated with either CVB or poly(I:C), a viral mimic, for 24 and 48 hours. Our global analysis reveals CVB differentially induces dynamic transcriptional changes associated with multiple cell processes and functions over time whereas poly(I:C) promotes an immune response that progressively increases with treatment duration. At the single-cell resolution, we find CVB infects all islet cell types at similar rates yet induces unique cell-type specific transcriptional responses with β, α, and ductal cells having the strongest response. Sequencing and functional data suggest that CVB negatively impacts mitochondrial respiration and morphology in distinct ways in β and α cells, while also promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species. We also observe an increase in the expression of the long-noncoding RNA MIR7-3HG in β cells with high viral titers and reveal its knockdown reduces gene expression of viral proteins as well as apoptosis in stem cell-derived islets. Together, these findings demonstrate a cell-specific transcriptional, temporal, and functional response to CVB infection and provide new insights into the relationship between CVB infection and T1D.">

Mice with a Treg-restricted CD71 deficiency spontaneously developed a scurfy-like disease, caused by impaired perinatal Treg expansion. CD71-null Tregs displayed decreased proliferation and tissue-Treg signature loss. In perinatal life, CD71 deficiency in Tregs triggered hepatic iron overload response, characterized by increased hepcidin transcription and iron accumulation in macrophages. Lower bacterial diversity, and reduction of beneficial species, were detected in the fecal microbiota of CD71 conditional knock-out neonates. Our findings indicate that CD71-mediated iron absorption is required for Treg perinatal expansion and related to systemic iron homeostasis and bacterial gut colonization. Therefore, we hypothesize that Tregs establish nutritional tolerance through competition for iron during bacterial colonization after birth.">

        <tr id="Actin-binding proteins (ABPs) have been established as important mediators of immune homeostasis, but their effects on lymphocytes are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that LSP1, an ABP, is a master regulator for innate immune responses in B lymphocytes. Lsp1 deficiency in B cells upregulated the expression of myeloid genes, including CD11b, CD11c, and myeloperoxidase, and bestowed myeloid morphology. Strikingly, Lsp1-deficient B cells exhibited dual functions, namely, strong phagocytic activity and high antibody (Ab) production, like ‘chimera’. The PKCβ-CEBPβ pathway was found to be required for such functional chimerism. Moreover, Lsp1 deficiency induced the myeloid B cell phenotype and autoantibody production in B cells and consequently accelerated the progression of experimental lupus in mice. These changes were abrogated by retinoic acid, which upregulated LSP1 expression. In lupus patients, LSP1 expression in B cells was downregulated and inversely correlated with myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression. Overall, this study reveals a new role of the ABP LSP1 in B lymphocytes and emphasizes its critical involvement in promoting autoimmune responses, particularly by generating functionally chimeric B cells.">

        <tr id="Muscle fatigue represents the most prevalent symptom of long-term COVID, with elusive pathogenic mechanisms. We performed a longitudinal study to characterize histopathological and transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle in a hamster model of respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared them with influenza A virus (IAV) and mock infections. Histopathological and bulk RNA sequencing analyses of leg muscles derived from infected animals at days 3, 30, and 60 post-infection showed no direct viral invasion but myofiber atrophy in the SARS-CoV-2 group, which was accompanied by persistent downregulation of the genes related to myofibers, ribosomal proteins, fatty acid β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes. While both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections induced acute and transient type I and II interferon responses in muscle, only the SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated TNF-α/NF-κB but not IL-6 signaling in muscle. Treatment of C2C12 myotubes, a skeletal muscle cell line, with combined IFN-γ and TNF-α but not with IFN-γ or TNF-α alone markedly impaired mitochondrial function. We conclude that a respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause myofiber atrophy and persistent energy metabolism suppression without direct viral invasion. The effects may be induced by the combined systemic interferon and TNF-α responses at the acute phase and may contribute to post-COVID-19 persistent muscle fatigue.">

        <tr id="Developing vaccines that promote CD8+ T cell memory is a challenge for infectious disease and cancer immunotherapy. TCF-1+ stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells are important determinants of long-lived memory. Yet, the developmental requirements for TSCM formation are unclear. Here, we identify the temporal window for type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR) blockade to drive TSCM cell generation. TSCM cells were transcriptionally distinct and emerged from a transitional precursor of exhausted (TPEX) cellular state concomitant with viral clearance. TSCM differentiation correlated with T cell retention within the lymph node paracortex, due to increased CXCR3 chemokine abundance which disrupted gradient formation. These affects were due a counterintuitive increase in IFNψ, which controlled cell location. Combining IFNAR inhibition with mRNA-LNP vaccination promoted specific TSCM differentiation and enhanced protection against chronic infection. These finding propose a new approach to vaccine design whereby modulation of inflammation promotes memory formation and function. HIGHLIGHTS Early, transient inhibition of the type I interferon (IFN) receptor (IFNAR) during acute viral infection promotes stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cell differentiation without establishing chronic infection. TSCM and precursor of exhausted (TPEX) cellular states are distinguished transcriptionally and by cell surface markers. Developmentally, TSCM cell differentiation occurs via a transition from a TPEX state coinciding with viral clearance. Transient IFNAR blockade increases IFNψ production to modulate the ligands of CXCR3 and couple TSCM differentiation to cell retention within the T cell paracortex of the lymph node. Specific promotion of TSCM cell differentiation with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccination elicits enhanced protection against chronic viral challenge.">

In this study, we report the novel finding that co-infection with influenza/A/X31 protects mice from death by Plasmodium berghei NK65-Edinburgh, a model of severe malarial pulmonary leak which underpins malaria-associated acute lung injury (MA-ALI) and malaria-associated acute respiratory distress (MA-ARDS). Co-infected mice exhibit equivalent parasitemia as mice with malaria only, suggesting that the survival phenotype is due to differences in immune kinetics. We demonstrated that the pulmonary leak typical of PbE is attenuated in co-infected mice without alteration in CD8 T cell activation and recruitment to the lung. Upon further examination of the immune response to influenza/A/X31 we identified a population of arginase 1-expressing alveolar macrophages that traffic to the lungs early during infection. In vitro these macrophages inhibit CD8 T cell activation and proliferation better than non-arginase expressing cells. Removal of arginase-1 expressing alveolar macrophages in vivo via administration of the antimetabolite gemcitabine removed the protective effects of influenza/A/X31co-infection on MA-ALI. This study opens a route to better understanding of how to modulate the immunopathology observed in pulmonary leak associated with severe malaria, which must be achieved to rationally design therapeutic interventions for MA-ARDS / MA-ALI.">

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which boosts the anti-tumor immune response by inhibiting negative regulators of T cell activation1–3, is remarkably successful in a subset of cancer patients, yet a significant proportion do not respond to treatment, emphasizing the need to understand factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy of ICB4–9. The gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a critical determinant of immune function and response to cancer immunotherapy, with multiple studies demonstrating association of microbiota composition with clinical response10–16. However, a mechanistic understanding of how gut commensal bacteria influence the efficacy of ICB remains elusive. Here we utilized a gut commensal microorganism, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induces an antigen-specific Th17 cell effector program17, to investigate how colonization with it affects the efficacy of ICB in restraining distal growth of tumors sharing antigen with SFB. We find that anti-PD-1 treatment effectively inhibits the growth of implanted SFB antigen-expressing melanoma only if mice are colonized with SFB. Through T cell receptor clonal lineage tracing, fate mapping, and peptide-MHC tetramer staining, we identify tumor-associated SFB-specific Th1-like cells derived from the homeostatic Th17 cells induced by SFB colonization in the small intestine lamina propria. These gut-educated ex-Th17 cells produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, and promote expansion and effector functions of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby controlling tumor growth. A better understanding of how distinct intestinal commensal microbes can promote T cell plasticity-dependent responses against antigen-sharing tumors may allow for the design of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Venous thromboembolism is common in individuals with chronic inflammatory diseases, but the pathogenic basis for this increased thrombotic risk remains poorly understood. Myeloid cell ‘trained immunity’ describes persistent innate immune cell memory arising from prior exposure to an inflammatory stimulus, leading to an enhanced immune response to subsequent unrelated stimuli. We identify enhanced myeloid cell prothrombotic activity as a novel maladaptive consequence of trained immunity. LPS stimulation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages trained previously with either β-glucan or free haem exhibited significantly enhanced procoagulant and antifibrinolytic gene expression and activity compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone. The β-glucan training-mediated increase in activated myeloid cell procoagulant activity was mediated by enhanced acid sphingomyelinase-mediated tissue factor (TF) functional decryption. Furthermore, pre-treatment with methyltransferase and acetyltransferase inhibitors to erase epigenetic marks associated with innate immune memory diminished trained macrophage TF gene expression in β-glucan-trained macrophages. Functional analysis of splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan-trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Remarkably, monocyte procoagulant activity increased proportionately with time since β-glucan administration, before plateauing at 4 weeks. Furthermore, haematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid isolated from β-glucan-trained mice possessed enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice. Trained immunity and associated metabolic perturbations may therefore represent novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in immunothrombotic disease development, opening new avenues for targeted intervention.">

Adverse outcomes associated with BV include an increased risk of sexually acquired Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), yet the immunological mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood. To investigate BV driven changes to cervicovaginal tract (CVT) and circulating T cell phenotypes, participants with or without BV provided vaginal tract (VT) and ectocervical (CX) tissue biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Immunofluorescence analysis of genital mucosal tissues revealed a reduced density of CD3+CD4+CCR5+ cells in the VT lamina propria of individuals with compared to those without BV (median 243.8 cells/mm2 BV-vs 106.9 cells/mm2 BV+, p=0.043).

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a pandemic and contributes to long-lasting morbidity. Several studies have investigated immediate cellular and humoral immune responses during acute infection. However, little is known about long-term effects of COVID-19 on the immune system.


METHODS
We performed a longitudinal investigation of cellular and humoral immune parameters in 106 non-vaccinated subjects ten weeks (10 w) and ten months (10 m) after their first SARS-CoV-2 infection. Peripheral blood immune cells were analyzed by multiparametric flow cytometry, serum cytokines were examined by multiplex technology. Antibodies specific for the Spike protein (S), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the nucleocapsid protein (NC) were determined. All parameters measured 10 w and 10 m after infection were compared with those of a matched, noninfected control group (n = 98).


RESULTS
Whole blood flow cytometric analyses revealed that 10 m after COVID-19, convalescent patients compared to controls had reduced absolute granulocyte, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts, involving T, B, and NK cells, in particular CD3+CD45RA+CD62L+CD31+ recent thymic emigrant T cells and non-class-switched CD19+IgD+CD27+ memory B cells. Cellular changes were associated with a reversal from Th1- to Th2-dominated serum cytokine patterns. Strong declines of NC- and S-specific antibody levels were associated with younger age (by 10.3 years, p < .01) and fewer CD3-CD56+ NK and CD19+CD27+ B memory cells. Changes of T-cell subsets at 10 m such as normalization of effector and Treg numbers, decline of RTE, and increase of central memory T cell numbers were independent of antibody decline pattern.


CONCLUSIONS
COVID-19 causes long-term reduction of innate and adaptive immune cells which is associated with a Th2 serum cytokine profile. This may provide an immunological mechanism for long-term sequelae after COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Due to the historical dogma, that host defense against intracellular pathogens is mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence suggests a more complex and multifaceted role for B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. They accumulate at the side of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity continue to be unraveled. Apart from antibodies, B cells produce a wide range of cytokines, which can influence the local immune response. Here we addressed the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10) secreting B cells in long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Our research highlights the previously unknown role of B cell-derived IL-10 as a negative regulator of protective immunity in TB. For the first time, we demonstrate that mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 show increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, as evidenced by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was accompanied by male-specific immune alterations, indicating a previously unknown sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key effectors in co-ordinating inflammatory and immune responses to threats to the host. How macrophages decipher diverse danger signals to tailor inflammatory responses remains an unanswered question. Cell volume control is critical for normal cellular function. Disturbances in extracellular and intracellular homeostasis induce changes in cell volume, but the impact of disruptions in cell volume in controlling macrophage inflammatory responses is poorly understood. Here, we discover that macrophages use cell volume control as a bona fide danger sensing mechanism to promote and augment inflammatory responses. Using macrophages deficient in the volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), which lack cell volume control under hypo-osmotic conditions, we show that disruptions in cell volume are sensed by macrophages to drive a large transcriptomic response and induction of inflammation. Cell volume disruption, particularly loss of cell volume control, induces type I interferon signalling through a DNA– and STING-dependent mechanism, but independent of cGAS and 2’3’cGAMP transport. Further, we found that cell volume changes synergise with diverse pathogen-mediated signalling to augment type I interferon responses and exacerbate the cytokine storm in a mouse model of hyperinflammation. Our findings highlight cell volume as an important regulator in shaping inflammatory responses, adding to our understanding of how macrophages sense complex danger signals and threats.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) causes Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease and has been clinically associated with neurological complications. However, there is a lack of relevant models to elucidate the neuropathology of EV-A71 and its mechanism, as the current models mainly utilize animal models or immortalized cell lines. In this study, we established a human motor neuron model for EV-A71 infection. Single cell transcriptomics of a mixed neuronal population reveal higher viral RNA load in motor neurons, suggesting higher infectivity and replication of EV-A71 in motor neurons. The elevated RNA load in motor neurons correlates with the downregulation of ferritin-encoding genes. Subsequent analysis confirms that neurons infected with EV-A71 undergo ferroptosis, as evidenced by increased levels of labile Fe2+ and peroxidated lipids. Notably, the Fe2+ chelator Deferoxamine improves mitochondrial function and promotes survival of motor neurons by 40% after EV-A71 infection. These findings deepen understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of EV-A71 infection, providing insights which suggest that improving mitochondrial respiration and inhibition of ferroptosis can mitigate the impact of EV-A71 infection in the central nervous system.">

        <tr id="The ability of an organism to overcome infectious diseases has traditionally been linked to killing invading pathogens. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that, apart from restricting pathogen loads, organismal survival is coupled to an additional yet poorly understood mechanism called disease tolerance. Here we report that p16High immune cells play a key role in establishing disease tolerance. We found that the FDA-approved BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a potent and rapid inducer of p16High immune subsets both in mice and humans. In turn, p16High immune cells were indispensable for counteracting different lethal conditions, including LPS-induced sepsis, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and ionizing irradiation. Mechanistically, we propose that activation of TLR7 or a low physiological activity of STING is sufficient to induce p16High immune subset that, in turn, establishes a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance. Furthermore, containing these signals within a beneficial range by deleting MDA5 that appeared sufficient to maintain a low activity of STING, induces p16High immune cells and delays organ deterioration upon aging with improved healthspan.

        <tr id="The effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain rapidly wanes over time. Growing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that influenza vaccination is associated with a reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we investigate the cross-reactive immune responses of influenza vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides based on in vitro study. Our data indicate enhanced activation-induced-marker (AIM) expression on CD4+ T cells in influenza-vaccination (IV)-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon stimulation with spike-protein-peptide pools. The fractions of other immune cell subtypes, including CD8+ T cells, monocytes, NK cells, and antigen-presenting cells, were not changed between IV-treated and control PBMCs following ex vivo spike-protein-peptide stimulation. However, the classical antiviral (IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory (IL-1RA) cytokine responses to spike-protein-peptide stimulation were still enhanced in PBMCs from both IV-immunized adult and aged mice. Decreased expression of proinflammatory IL-1β, IL-12p40, and TNF-α is associated with inhibited levels of histone acetylation in PBMCs from IV-treated mice. Remarkably, prior immunity to SARS-CoV-2 does not result in modification of histone acetylation or hemagglutinin-protein-induced cytokine responses. This response is antibody-independent but can be mediated by manipulating the histone acetylation of PBMCs. These data experimentally support that influenza vaccination could induce modification of histone acetylation in immune cells and reveal the existence of potential cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which may provide insights for the adjuvant of influenza vaccine to limit COVID-19-related inflammatory responses.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β cells and involves an interplay between β cells and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), an enzyme implicated in inflammatory pathways in β cells and macrophages, using a mouse model in which the endogenous mouse Alox15 gene is replaced by the human ALOX12 gene. Our findings demonstrate that VLX-1005, a potent 12-LOX inhibitor, effectively delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes in human gene replacement non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. By spatial proteomics analysis, VLX-1005 treatment resulted in marked reductions in infiltrating T and B cells and macrophages with accompanying increases in immune checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and PD-1, suggesting a shift towards an immune-suppressive microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of isolated islets from inhibitor-treated mice revealed significant alteration of cytokine-responsive pathways. RNA sequencing of polarized proinflammatory macrophages showed that VLX-1005 significantly reduced the interferon response. Our studies demonstrate that the ALOX12 human replacement gene mouse provides a platform for the preclinical evaluation of LOX inhibitors and supports VLX-1005 as an inhibitor of human 12-LOX that engages the enzymatic target and alters the inflammatory phenotypes of islets and macrophages to promote the delay of autoimmune diabetes.">

        <tr id="T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells can counteract the B cell helper activity of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and hinder the production of antibodies against self-antigens or allergens. A mechanistic understanding of the cytokines initiating the differentiation of human regulatory T (Treg) cells into Tfr cells is still missing. Herein, we report that low doses of the pro-Tfh cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) drive the induction of a Tfr cell program on activated human Treg cells while also preserving their regulatory function. Mechanistically, we found that IL-12 led to STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) phosphorylation and binding to IL-12–driven follicular signature genes. Patients with inborn errors of immunity in the IL12RB1 gene presented with a strong decrease in circulating Tfr cells and produced higher levels of anti-actin autoantibodies in vivo. Overall, this study unveils IL-12 as an inducer of Tfr cell differentiation in vivo and provides an approach for the in vitro generation of human Tfr-like cells. IL-12 promotes the acquisition of a follicular program in human regulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells balance the activity of T follicular helper cells and suppress B cell responses to self-antigens and allergens. However, the key signals involved in Tfr cell differentiation, particularly in humans, remain incompletely understood. By screening the effects of multiple cytokines on human regulatory T cells, Castaño et al. identified interleukin-12 (IL-12) as the most potent inducer of Tfr cell differentiation in vitro. IL-12 promoted the acquisition of a follicular gene expression program and STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) binding at signature follicular loci. In addition, patients bearing mutations in the IL12RB1 gene displayed a strong decrease in circulating Tfr cells. Together, these findings identify IL-12 as a driver of human Tfr cell differentiation, thus enabling their in vitro generation. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective Unique metabolic requirements accompany the development and functional fates of immune cells. How cellular metabolism is important in natural killer (NK) cells and their memory‐like differentiation in bacterial infections remains elusive. Methods Here, we utilise our established NK cell memory assay to investigate the metabolic requirement for memory‐like NK cell formation and function in response to the Gram‐negative intracellular bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP), the causative agent of melioidosis. Results We demonstrate that CD160+ memory‐like NK cells upon BP stimulation upregulate glucose and amino acid transporters in a cohort of recovered melioidosis patients which is maintained at least 3‐month post‐hospital admission. Using an in vitro assay, human BP‐specific CD160+ memory‐like NK cells show metabolic priming including increased expression of glucose and amino acid transporters with elevated glucose uptake, increased mTOR activation and mitochondrial membrane potential upon BP re‐stimulation. Antigen‐specific and cytokine‐induced IFN‐γ production of this memory‐like NK cell subset are highly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) with some dependency on glycolysis, whereas the formation of CD160+ memory‐like NK cells in vitro is dependent on fatty acid oxidation and OXPHOS and further increased by metformin. Conclusion This study reveals the link between metabolism and cellular function of memory‐like NK cells, which can be exploited for vaccine design and for monitoring protection against Gram‐negative bacterial infection.">

However, no single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies have characterized the properties and networks of individual immune cells in T2D. Here, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from non-diabetes and T2D patients by scRNA-seq. We found that CD14 monocytes in T2D patients were in a pro-inflammatory state and intermediate monocytes expressed more MHC class II genes. In T2D patients, cytotoxic CD4 T cells, effector memory CD8 T cells, and γδ T cells have increased cytotoxicity and clonal expansion. B cells were characterized by increased differentiation into intermediate B cells, plasma cells, and isotype class switching with increased expression of soluble antibody genes. These results suggest that monocytes, T cells, and B cells could interact to induce chronic inflammation in T2D patients with pro-inflammatory characteristics.">

        <tr id="One possible determinant of COVID-19 severity is immune imprinting (IP) by Common Cold Coronavirus (CCCV). As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns. Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.">

        <tr id="Abstract Functional cure for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains challenging due to the lack of direct intervention methods for hepatic inflammation. Multi‐omics research offers a promising approach to understand hepatic inflammation mechanisms in CHB. A Bayesian linear model linked gene expression with clinical parameters, and population‐specific expression analysis (PSEA) refined bulk gene expression into specific cell types across different clinical phases. These models were integrated into our analysis of key factors like inflammatory cells, immune activation, T cell exhaustion, chemokines, receptors, and interferon‐stimulated genes (ISGs). Validation through multi‐immune staining in liver specimens from CHB patients bolstered our findings. In CHB patients, increased gene expression related to immune cell activation and migration was noted. Marker genes of macrophages, T cells, immune‐negative regulators, chemokines, and ISGs showed a positive correlation with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels but not hepatitis B virus DNA levels. The PSEA model confirmed T cells as the source of exhausted regulators, while macrophages primarily contributed to chemokine expression. Upregulated ISGs (ISG20, IFI16, TAP2, GBP1, PSMB9) in the hepatitis phase were associated with T cell and macrophage infiltration and positively correlated with ALT levels. Conversely, another set of ISGs (IFI44, ISG15, IFI44L, IFI6, MX1) mainly expressed by hepatocytes and B cells showed no correlation with ALT levels. Our study presents a multi‐omics analysis integrating bulk transcriptomic, single‐cell sequencing data, and clinical data from CHB patients to decipher the cause of intrahepatic inflammation in CHB. The findings confirm that macrophages secrete chemokines like CCL20, recruiting exhausted T cells into liver tissue; concurrently, hepatocyte innate immunity is suppressed, hindering the antiviral effects of ISGs.">

        <tr id="Stem-like progenitors are a critical subset of cytotoxic T cells that self-renew and give rise to expanded populations of effector cells critical for successful checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Emerging evidence suggests that the tumor-draining lymph nodes can support the continuous generation of these stem-like cells that replenish the tumor sites and act as a critical source of expanded effector populations, underlining the importance of understanding what factors promote and maintain activated T cells in the stem-like state. Using advanced 3D multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, here we identified antigen-presentation niches in tumor-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance, and affinity evolution of a unique population of TCF-1+PD-1+SLAMF6hi stem-like CD8+ T cells. Our results show that contrary to the prevailing view that persistent TCR signaling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement well beyond the initial priming phase sustained the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway plays a central role in this process by mediating the fine-tuning of TCR and co-stimulatory signal input that enables selective expansion of high affinity TCR stem-like clones, enabling them to act as a renewable source of high affinity effector cells. PD-1 checkpoint blockade disrupts this fine tuning of input signaling, leading to terminal differentiation to the effector state or death of the most avid anti-tumor stem-like cells. Our results thus reveal an unexpected relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative feedback regulatory loop, and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumor effect that comes at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high affinity stem-like precursors.">

Plasma levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed in people with HIV (PWH) with effective cART. There were no significant differences in any of the tested cytokines between COVID-19 severity in PWH, while most of them were significantly higher in individuals with severe disease in HIV-uninfected individuals, suggesting that excess cytokines release by hyper-inflammatory responses does not occur in severe COVID-19 with HIV infection. The strong associations between the cytokines observed in HIV-uninfected individuals, especially between IFN-α/TNF-α and other cytokines, were lost in PWH. The steady state plasma levels of IP-10, ICAM-1, and CD62E were significantly higher in PWH, indicating that PWH are in an enhanced inflammatory state. Loss of the several inter-cytokine correlations were observed in in vitro LPS stimuli-driven cytokines production in PWH. These data suggest that inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection in PWH are distinct from those in HIV-uninfected individuals, partially due to the underlying inflammatory state and/or impairment of innate immune cells.">

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key and understudied factor impacting CD19 CAR‐T therapy outcomes. Using NanoString nCounter transcriptome profiling (n = 24) and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC, n = 15), we studied the TME in pretreatment biopsies from patients with LBCL undergoing CD19 CAR‐T therapy. Patients who achieved complete response (CR) after CAR‐T therapy demonstrated higher expression of genes associated with T‐cell trafficking and function, whereas those who did not achieve CR had higher expression of genes associated with macrophages and T‐cell dysfunction. Distinct patterns of immune infiltration and fibrosis in the TME were associated with CAR‐T therapy outcomes, and these findings were corroborated using artificial intelligence‐assisted image analyses. Patients who achieved CR had a lower proportion of the biopsy occupied by an interspersed immune infiltrate and a higher proportion of hypocellular/fibrotic regions. Furthermore, mIHC revealed lower density of CD4+ T cells and higher densities of both macrophages and tumor cells expressing PD‐L1 in non‐CR patients. Spatial analysis revealed that PD‐1+ T cells were in close proximity to PD‐L1+ macrophages or PD‐L1+ tumor cells in patients who did not compared to those who did achieve CR after CAR‐T therapy. These findings suggest that morphologic patterns in the TME and engagement of the PD‐1/PD‐L1 axis in pretreatment biopsies may impact CD19 CAR‐T immunotherapy response in patients with LBCL.">

        <tr id="The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to foreign antigens in food and commensal microbes with potential to induce adaptive immune responses. Peripherally induced T regulatory (pTreg) cells are essential for mitigating inflammatory responses to these agents1–4. While RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells (RORγt-APCs) were shown to program gut microbiota-specific pTregs5–7, understanding of their characteristics remains incomplete, and the APC subset responsible for food tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that RORγt-APCs are similarly required for differentiation of food antigen-specific pTregs and establishment of oral tolerance. The ability of these cells to direct both food and microbiota-specific pTreg cell differentiation is contingent on expression of RORγt and on a unique cis-regulatory element within the Rorc gene locus (Rorc(t) +7kb). Absent this +7kb element, there was a notable increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 (Th2) cells in lieu of pTregs, leading to compromised tolerance in a mouse asthma model. By employing single-cell analyses across these models, as well as freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, we identified a rare subset of evolutionarily conserved APCs that are dependent on RORγt, uniquely express the Prdm16 transcription factor, and are endowed with essential mediators for inducing pTreg cell differentiation. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of how RORγt-APCs develop and how they regulate T cell responses to food and microbial antigens could offer new insights into developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as organ transplant tolerance.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) show signs of low-grade inflammation, which is related to the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the underlying triggers remain unknown. The gut microbiota is a plausible source as it comprises pro-inflammatory bacteria, bacterial metabolites and viruses, including (bacterio)phages. These prokaryotic viruses have been shown to mediate inflammatory responses in gastrointestinal disease. Given the differences in phage populations in healthy individuals versus those with cardiometabolic diseases such as T2D, we here questioned whether phages from T2D individuals would have increased immunogenic potential. To address this, we isolated intestinal phages from a fresh stool sample of healthy controls and individuals with newly diagnosed, treatment-naive T2D. Phages were purified using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation and incubated with healthy donor dendritic cells (DCs) and autologous T cells. Donors with T2D had slightly higher free viral particle numbers compared to healthy controls (p = .1972), which has been previously associated with disease states. Further, phages from T2D induced a higher inflammatory response in DCs and T cells than phages from HC. For example, the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on DCs (p < .001) and interferon-y secretion from T cells (p < .01) were increased when comparing the two groups. These results suggest that phages might play a role in low-grade inflammation in T2D individuals.">

        <tr id="Background CD24 plays a crucial role not only in promoting tumor progression and metastasis but also in modulating macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity. However, the impact of tumor CD24 on the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains poorly explored. Here, we investigated the role of CD24a, murine CD24 gene, in the progression and immune dynamics of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods: We employed Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology to perform a gene knockout of Cd24a in 4T1 cells. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the distribution and number of immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and macrophages, within tumors, spleens, and bone marrow. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to detect these immune cells in tumor sections. Additionally, ANDOR Dragonfly High-Speed Confocal was used to perform three-dimensional (3D) mapping of mouse tumors. Results Our study showed that knocking out CD24a significantly impeded tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. Flow cytometry and IF analysis revealed that the loss of CD24a transformed tumor microenvironment from cold to hot by promoting the infiltration of M1 macrophages, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and CD49b+ natural killer (NK) cells while reducing the recruitment and expansion of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) in the TME. Additionally, the 3D mapping of TME further validated the “hot state” of CD24a knockout tumors. Conclusions Our study provides the first evidence that targeting CD24a could effectively reprogram the TME, enhancing its immunogenicity, and transforming immune cold tumors into hot tumors. This strategy may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing the immune response against poorly immunogenic tumors.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath, leading to irreversible and progressive functional deficits in patients. Pre-clinical studies involving the use of neural stem cells (NSCs) have already demonstrated their potential in neuronal regeneration and remyelination. However, the exclusive application of cell therapy has not proved sufficient to achieve satisfactory therapeutic levels. Recognizing these limitations, there is a need to combine cell therapy with other adjuvant protocols. In this context, extracellular vesicles (EVs) can contribute to intercellular communication, stimulating the production of proteins and lipids associated with remyelination and providing trophic support to axons. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of NSCs and EVs derived from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. OPCs were differentiated from NSCs and had their identity confirmed by gene expression analysis and immunocytochemistry. Exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and characterized by Western, transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Experimental therapy of C57BL/6 mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were grouped in control, treated with NSCs, treated with OPC-derived EVs and treated with a combination of both. The treatments were evaluated clinically using scores and body weight, microscopically using immunohistochemistry and immunological profile by flow cytometry. The animals showed significant clinical improvement and weight gain with the treatments. However, only the treatments involving EVs led to immune modulation, changing the profile from Th1 to Th2 lymphocytes. Fifteen days after treatment revealed a reduction in reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in the groups treated with EVs. However, there was no reduction in demyelination. The results indicate the potential therapeutic use of OPC-derived EVs to attenuate inflammation and promote recovery in EAE, especially when combined with cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Differential antiviral T cell immunity in early life impacts the clinical outcome of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we found delayed enrichment of early-life murine CMV-specific CD8 T cells due to a general deficiency of αβ T cells. Adoptive transfer of naïve adult T cells into neonates did not protect due to a blockade of CD8 but not of CD4 effector T cell differentiation. Early-life deficiency of critical signal 3 cytokines during T cell priming resulted in the appearance of non-cytotoxic CD8 effector T cells whereas the effector phase of adult-primed T cells was not disrupted in neonates. Accordingly, we found an overall low number of antiviral human CD8 T cells in newborns with congenital CMV. Together, this study suggests defective CD8 T cell immunity as an important factor explaining the higher risk for CMV disease in the early-life phase.">

        <tr id="KLRG1+ CD8 T cells persist for months after clearance of acute infections and maintain high levels of effector molecules, contributing protective immunity against systemic pathogens. Upon secondary infection, these long-lived effector cells (LLECs) are incapable of forming other circulating KLRG1− memory subsets such as central and effector memory T cells. Thus, KLRG1+ memory T cells are frequently referred to as a terminally differentiated population that is relatively short lived. Here, we show that after viral infection of mice, effector cells derived from LLECs rapidly enter nonlymphoid tissues and reduce pathogen burden but are largely dependent on receiving antigen cues from vascular endothelial cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that secondary memory cells in nonlymphoid tissues arising from either KLRG1+ or KLRG1− memory precursors develop a similar resident memory transcriptional signature. Thus, although LLECs cannot differentiate into other circulating memory populations, they still retain the flexibility to enter tissues and establish residency. Circulating KLRG1+ memory T cells rapidly enter nonlymphoid tissues after viral infection and differentiate into resident memory. Editor’s summary Long-lived effector cells (LLECs) are a subset of memory CD8 T cells considered to be terminally differentiated that maintain KLRG1 expression and show distinct trafficking patterns, functions, and proliferative potential compared with other memory T cell subsets. Lucas et al. find in mice that LLECs can migrate from the circulation to nonlymphoid tissues after secondary viral infection in a process that requires the presentation of antigen by blood endothelial cells. Once in tissues, LLECs then acquire a transcriptional program akin to resident memory T (TRM) cells, Thus, LLECs exhibit a previously unappreciated plasticity that allows them to potentially contribute to the tissue-resident memory pool. —Seth Thomas Scanlon">

This study investigates, in offspring mice, the effect of maternal COVID-19 vaccination on postnatal physical development, behavior and neurogenesis. After inoculation with inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cell) at gestational day 14.5, antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were detected in serum of both dams and pups. At one month of age, pups born to vaccinated dams, but not the offspring of non-vaccinated dams, exhibited greater working memory and more neural cell proliferation, neuroblast formation, neuronal stem cell activity and larger numbers of mature neurons within the dentate gyrus (DG). Luminex multiplex assay revealed elevated levels of hippocampal cytokines/chemokines critical to neurogenesis and memory function, namely interferon-γ [IFN-γ] and CX3C motif chemokine ligand 1 [CX3CL1]. Conditional knockout technology implicated microglial IFN-γ receptor 1 (IFNγR1) and CX3C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) as crucial intercellular participants in the neuronal developmental process, via regulating microglial activation and chemotaxis, respectively. We propose that, rather than posing risk for neurodevelopmental abnormalities, maternal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination transiently enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and working memory in offspring.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can increase the risk of neuroinflammation, and subsequent neurodegenerative diseases. Certain IAV strains, such as avian H7N7 subtype, possess neurotropic properties, enabling them to directly invade the brain parenchyma and infect neurons and glia cells. Host sex significantly influences the severity of IAV infections. Studies indicate that females of the reproductive age exhibit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses to IAVs compared to males. This heightened immune response correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, and potential neuronal damage in females. Understanding the sex-specific neurotropism of IAV and associated mechanisms leading to adverse neurological outcomes is essential. Our study reveals that primary hippocampal cultures from female mice show heightened interferon-β and pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion following neurotropic IAV infection. We observed sex-specific differences in microglia activation: both sexes showed a transition into a hyper-ramified state, but only male-derived microglia exhibited an increase in amoeboid-shaped cells. These disparities extended to alterations in neuronal morphology. Neurons derived from female mice displayed increased spine density within 24 h post-infection, while no significant change was observed in male cultures. This aligns with sex-specific differences in microglial synaptic pruning. Data suggest that amoeboid-shaped microglia preferentially target postsynaptic terminals, potentially reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. Conversely, hyper-ramified microglia may focus on presynaptic terminals, potentially limiting viral spread. In conclusion, our findings underscore the utility of primary hippocampal cultures, incorporating microglia, as an effective model to study sex-specific, virus-induced effects on brain-resident cells.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant aggravating factor in individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for TB, and HIV-1 target macrophages. Understanding how Mtb subverts these cells may facilitate the identification of new druggable targets. Here, we explored how TB can induce macrophages to form tunneling nanotubes (TNT), promoting HIV-1 spread. We found that TB triggers metabolic rewiring of macrophages, increasing their glycolytic ATP production. Using pharmacological inhibitors and glucose deprivation, we discovered that disrupting aerobic glycolysis significantly reduces HIV-1 exacerbation in these macrophages. Glycolysis is essential for tunneling nanotubes (TNT) formation, which facilitates viral transfer and cell-to-cell fusion and induces the expression of the sialoadhesin Siglec-1, enhancing both HIV-1 binding and TNT stabilization. Glycolysis did not exacerbate HIV-1 infection when TNT formation was pharmacologically prevented, indicating that higher metabolic activity is not sufficient per se to make macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1. Overall, these data might facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting glycolytic activity in TB-induced immunomodulatory macrophages to ultimately halt HIV-1 dissemination in co-infected patients.">

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) markedly affects the lung microbiome corresponding with a high incidence of post-HCT pulmonary complications. In a preclinical mouse model of HCT, we observed a reduction in Lactobacillus johnsonii within the lung microbiome following transplantation. Intranasal administration of live or heat-killed (HK) L. johnsonii at low doses reduced gammaherpesvirus-induced pulmonary fibrosis in HCT mice, in which IL-17A plays an essential role. HK L. johnsonii treatment of HCT mice suppressed inflammatory cytokine production by lung macrophages and decreased Il17a expression in T helper 17 (Th17) cells. HK L. johnsonii increased PD-L1 expression on the surface of type II conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in HCT mice and in vitro in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). HK L. johnsonii-exposed BMDCs also inhibited IL-17A secretion from co-cultured Th17 cells in a PD-1-dependent manner. Notably, when HK L. johnsonii was administered to HCT mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells from PD-1 knockout (KO) mice, which lack a PD-L1 mediated response, HK L. johnsonii-mediated reduction of pulmonary fibrosis was negated. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that HK L. johnsonii mitigates herpesvirus-induced pulmonary fibrosis in HCT mice by modulating cDC2 surface expression of PD-L1, which subsequently suppresses Il17a expression in Th17 cells, pointing towards a potential postbiotic-based strategy for immunomodulation to address pulmonary complications of HCT.">

        <tr id="Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potential cancer therapeutic that induces apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing the non-malignant cells in preclinical models. However, its efficacy in clinical trials has been limited, suggesting unknown modulatory mechanisms responsible for the lack of TRAIL activity in patients. Here, we hypothesized that TRAIL treatment elicits transcriptional changes in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells that alter the immune milieu. To test this, we performed an RNAseq analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with TRAIL, followed by validation in additional TNBC cell lines. TRAIL significantly induces expression of multiple cytokines such as CXCLs 1, 2, 3, 8,11 and IL-6, which are known to modify neutrophil function. Mechanistically, the induction of these cytokines was predominantly mediated by death receptor 5, caspase 8 (but not caspase 8 enzymatic activity), and the non-canonical NFKB2 pathway. The cytokines produced by the TRAIL-treated TNBC cells enhanced chemotaxis of healthy human donor isolated neutrophils. In vivo, TRAIL treated TNBC murine xenograft tumors showed activation of the NFKB2 pathway, elevated production of CXCLs and IL-6, and increased neutrophil recruitment into the tumors. Moreover, donor isolated neutrophils preincubated in supernatants from TRAIL-treated TNBC cells exhibited impaired cytotoxic effect against TNBC cells. Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils incubated with either TRAIL alone or supernatant of TRAIL-treated TNBC cells revealed increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, immune modulatory genes, immune checkpoint genes, and genes implicated in delayed neutrophil apoptosis. Functional studies with these neutrophils confirmed their suppressive effect on T cell proliferation and an increase in Treg suppressive phenotype. Collectively, our study demonstrates a novel role of TRAIL-induced NFKB2-dependent cytokine production that promotes neutrophil chemotaxis and immune suppression.">

Here, using a 40-colour antibody panel we advance our knowledge of innate and innate-like T cells by investigating chemokine receptors, activation and maturation markers not usually assessed on these populations and examine age-related effects to these immune cell subsets. We characterised phenotypic changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in three age groups: newborn (cord blood), adults aged 20-30 years, and adults aged 70-80 years, focusing on innate-like T cells and innate cells, including MAIT cells, NKT cells, γδ T cells, ILCs, and Natural Killer (NK) cells. We identify subsets of double-negative (DN) T cells (CD4- CD8-) and CD161+ T cells that increase in an age-related manner and exhibit a phenotype similar to innate-like T cells, MAIT cells and γδ T cells. Innate-like T cell subsets express similar patterns of the chemokine receptors and maturation markers CCR4, CCR6, CD27, CD38, CD57 and CD45RA, and resemble memory subsets of conventional CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. We could detect ILCs in all age ranges, although the frequency of ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 subsets decreased with age. Notably, we identify the NK maturation marker, CD57, as a universal marker that defines ageing populations of innate and adaptive immune cells. This study enhances our understanding of the ontogeny of human immune cells, highlighting significant age-related changes in the frequency and phenotype of immune cells.">

        <tr id="Background Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) are pivotal in B cell responses. Activation of the purinergic receptor P2X7 on Tfh cells regulates their activity. We investigated the ATP-P2X7R axis in circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells during Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. Methods We analyzed two cohorts: children with RSV infection (moderate, n=30; severe, n=21) and healthy children (n=23). We utilized ELISA to quantify the levels of PreF RSV protein-specific IgG antibodies, IL-21 cytokine, and soluble P2X7R (sP2X7R) in both plasma and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Additionally, luminometry was employed to determine ATP levels in plasma, NPA and supernatant culture. The frequency of cTfh cells, P2X7R expression, and plasmablasts were assessed by flow cytometry. To evaluate apoptosis, proliferation, and IL-21 production by cTfh cells, we cultured PBMCs in the presence of Bz-ATP and/or P2X7R antagonist (KN-62) and a flow cytometry analysis was performed. Results In children with severe RSV disease, we observed diminished titers of neutralizing anti-PreF IgG antibodies. Additionally, severe infections, compared to moderate cases, were associated with fewer cTfh cells and reduced plasma levels of IL-21. Our investigation revealed dysregulation in the ATP-P2X7R pathway during RSV infection. This was characterized by elevated ATP levels in both plasma and NPA samples, increased expression of P2X7R on cTfh cells, lower levels of sP2X7R, and heightened ATP release from PBMCs upon stimulation, particularly evident in severe cases. Importantly, ATP exposure decreased cTfh proliferative response and IL-21 production, while promoting their apoptosis. The P2X7R antagonist KN-62 mitigated these effects. Furthermore, disease severity positively correlated with ATP levels in plasma and NPA samples and inversely correlated with cTfh frequency. Conclusion Our findings indicate that activation of the ATP-P2X7R pathway during RSV infection may contribute to limiting the cTfh cell compartment by promoting cell death and dysfunction, ultimately leading to increased disease severity.">

        <tr id="NKT cells are innate-like T cells, recruited to the skin during viral infection, yet their contributions to long-term immune memory to viruses are unclear. We identified granzyme K, a product made by cytotoxic cells including NKT cells, is linked to induction of Th1-associated antibodies during primary dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. We examined the role of NKT cells in vivo using DENV-infected mice lacking CD1d-dependent (CD1ddep) NKT cells. In CD1d-KO mice, Th1-polarized immunity and infection resolution were impaired, which was dependent on intrinsic NKT cell production of IFN-γ, since it was restored by adoptive transfer of WT but not IFN-γ-KO NKT cells. Furthermore, NKT cell deficiency triggered immune bias, resulting in higher levels of Th2-associated IgG1 than Th1-associated IgG2a, which failed to protect against a homologous DENV re-challenge and promoted antibody-dependent enhanced disease during secondary heterologous infections. Similarly, Th2-immunity, typified by a higher IgG4:IgG3 ratio, was associated with worsened human disease severity during secondary infections. Thus, CD1ddep NKT cells establish Th1 polarity during the early innate response to DENV, which promotes infection resolution, memory formation and long-term protection from secondary homologous and heterologous infections. These observations illustrate how early innate immune responses during primary infections can influence secondary infection outcomes.">

        <tr id="Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is a severe complication of influenza infection that occurs in critically ill patients and results in higher mortality compared to influenza infection alone. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) and the Type 17 immune signaling pathway cytokine family are recognized for their pivotal role in fostering protective immunity against various pathogens. In this study, we investigate the role of IL-17 and Type 17 immune signaling components during IAPA. Wild-type mice were challenged with influenza A H1N1 (Flu) and then exposed to Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC42202 resting conidia on day 6 post-influenza infection, followed by the quantification of cytokines and chemokines at 48 hours post-fungal infection. Gene and protein expression levels revealed that IL-17 and Type 17 immune cytokines and antimicrobial peptides are downregulated during IAPA compared to mice singularly infected solely with A. fumigatus. Restoration of Type 17 immunity was not sufficient to provide protection against the increased fungal burden observed during IAPA. These findings contrast those observed during post-influenza bacterial super-infection, in which restoration of Type 17 immune signaling protects against exacerbation seen during super-infection. Our study highlights the need for future studies to understand the immune mechanisms that increase susceptibility to fungal infection. Importance IAPA significantly elevates the risk of mortality in patients with severe influenza. Type-17 immunity is critical to host defense during fungal infections and, therefore, vital to understand its role during IAPA. The observations in this study reveal that Type 17 immunity is impaired during IAPA, potentially increasing susceptibility to secondary infection with Aspergillus fumigatus. However, restoration of IL-17 signaling alone is not sufficient to reduce fungal burden in our murine IAPA model. These observations differ from those observed in post-influenza bacterial super-infections, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying viral-fungal super-infection are different than those that underly viral-bacterial super-infection. By elucidating the complex interactions between the host immune system, influenza, and A. fumigatus, these findings are vital for developing strategies to enhance immune responses and improve survival rates during IAPA.">

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging flavivirus, is associated with devasting developmental and neurological disease outcomes particularly in infants infected in utero. Towards understanding the molecular underpinnings of the unique ZIKV disease pathologies, numerous transcriptome-wide studies have been undertaken. Notably, these studies have overlooked the assimilation of RNA-seq analysis from ZIKV-infected patients with cell culture model systems. In this study we find that ZIKV-infection of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, mirrored both the transcriptional and alternative splicing profiles from previously published RNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from pediatric patients during early acute, late acute, and convalescent phases of ZIKV infection. Our analyses show that ZIKV infection in cultured cells correlates with transcriptional changes in patients, while the overlap in alternative splicing profiles was not as extensive. Overall, our data indicate that cell culture model systems support dissection of select molecular changes detected in patients and establishes the groundwork for future studies elucidating the biological implications of alternative splicing during ZIKV infection.">

        <tr id="Immune-surveillance depends in part on the recognition of peptide variants by T cell antigen receptors. Given that both normal B cells and malignant B cells accumulate mutations we chose a murine model of multiple myeloma to test conditions to induce cell-mediated immunity targeting malignant plasma cell (PC) clones but sparing of normal PCs. Revealing a novel function for intracellular C3d, we discovered that C3d engaged T cell responses against malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow of mice that had developed multiple myeloma spontaneously. Our results show that C3d internalized by cells augments immune surveillance by several mechanisms. In one, C3d induces a master transcription regulator, E2f1, to increase the expression of long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, to generate peptides for MHC-I presentation and increase MHC-I expression. In another, C3d increases expression of RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins linked to processing of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) that arise from non-canonical translation and known to promote immunosurveillance. Cancer cells are uniquely susceptible to increased expression and presentation of mutant peptides given the extent of protein misfolding and accumulation of somatic mutations. Accordingly, although C3d can be internalized by any cell, C3d preferentially targets malignant clones by evoking specific T cell mediated immunity (CMI) and sparing most non-transformed polyclonal B cells and plasma cells with lower mutation loads. Malignant plasma cell deletion was blocked by cyclosporin or by CD8 depletion confirming that endogenous T cells mediated malignant clone clearance. Besides the potential for therapeutic application our results highlight how intracellular C3d modifies cellular metabolism to augment immune surveillance. One Sentence Summary We show that intracellular soluble fragment 3d of complement (C3d) induces regression of spontaneous multiple myeloma in mice reducing tumor burden by 10 fold, after 8 weeks. C3d enables cell-mediated immunity to target multiple myeloma clones sparing non-transformed polyclonal B cells and plasma cells with lower mutation loads. We show that C3d increases the expression of ribosomal subunits associated with the translation of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). C3d also decreases expression of protein arginine methyl transferase (PRMT) 5 which in turn relieves E2f1 repression increasing the expression of Lnc RNAs and derived peptides that evoke anti-tumor cellular immunity. The approach increases MHC-I expression by tumor cells and generates a CMI response that overcomes tumor immune-evasion strategies. Significance Tumors are immunogenic in part because of somatic mutations that originate novel peptides that once presented on MHC engage cell-mediated immunity (CMI). However, in spite of the higher mutation load most tumors evade immunity. We discovered that a component of the complement system (C3d) overcomes tumor immune evasion by augmenting expression of ribosomal proteins and lncRNAs linked to the presentation of novel peptides by tumor cells. C3d induced CMI targets cancer cells sparing non transformed cells uncovering a novel function for complement in immune surveillance.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is highly heterogeneous in terms of disease severity and tissue damage extent. Improving myelin restoration is essential to prevent neurodegeneration and the associated disability in MS patients. However, remyelinating therapies are failing in clinical trials, in part, due to the absence of classifying biomarkers of different endogenous regenerative capacities amongst enrolled patients. We previously reported that circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) at the onset of the murine model of MS experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are associated with milder disease courses and less degree of demyelination and axonal damage in spinal cord lesions, while at peak are indicative of a better symptom recovery. Moreover, M-MDSCs are able to promote in vitro oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation towards mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) through the release of the soluble factor osteopontin. Results Here, we show a relationship between disease severity and a gradient of OPCs between the rim and the core in mixed active-inactive lesions of MS patients, along with a positive correlation between M-MDSC density and OPC abundance in the same lesions. We also show that EAE disease severity negatively influences the density of total and newly generated OPCs found associated to the demyelinated lesions of the spinal cord at the peak of the disease. In addition, disease severity also impacts the abundance of newly generated OLs originated either during the effector phase or during the early recovery phase. We also demonstrate the positive association between infiltrated M-MDSCs and the abundance of OPCs in the periplaque of demyelinating lesions at the peak of EAE. Interestingly, circulating M-MDSCs at EAE onset and peak of the disease are directly associated to a higher density of newly generated OLs in the plaque and periplaque, respectively. Conclusion Disease severity clearly impacts oligodendrocyte generation during a neuroinflammatory insult like EAE. Our results set the basis for further studies on M-MDSCs as a promising new biomarker that identify a CNS prone to the generation of new OLs that may contribute to restore myelin.">

        <tr id="Aberrant activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway causes autoimmunity in humans and mice; however, the exact mechanism by which the cGAS-STING pathway initiates adaptive immunity and tissue pathology is still not fully understood. Here, we used a cGAS knockin (KI) mouse model that develops systemic autoimmunity. In the lungs of cGAS-KI mice, blood vessels were enclosed by organized lymphoid tissues that resemble tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). Cell-intrinsic cGAS induction promoted up-regulation of CCR5 in CD8+ T cells and led to CCL5 production in vascular endothelial cells. Peripheral CD8+ T cells were recruited to the lungs and produced CXCL13 and interferon-γ. The latter triggered endothelial cell death, potentiated CCL5 production, and was essential for TLS establishment. Blocking CCL5 or CCR5, or depleting CD8+ T cells, impaired TLS formation. cGAS-mediated TLS formation also enhanced humoral and antitumor responses. These data demonstrate that cGAS signaling drives a specialized lymphoid structure that underlies autoimmune tissue pathology. cGAS initiates pulmonary TLS formation, which is dependent on the CCL5-CCR5 axis between endothelial cells and T cells. Editor’s summary Overactivation of the innate immune sensing cGAS-STING pathway can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. To investigate how cGAS hyperactivation drives lung inflammation, Zhao et al. generated a cGAS conditional knockin mouse model. Hyperactivation of cGAS resulted in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the lung, which enhanced antibody responses and antitumor immunity. CCL5-producing endothelial cells in the lung promoted CD8+ T cell recruitment to TLSs via CCR5 signaling, which was induced by T cell–intrinsic cGAS expression. Blocking CCR5/CCL5 impaired TLS formation, suggesting that CCR5/CCL5 could be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity or to enhance antitumor immunity. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus and the leading cause of infectious disease related birth defects worldwide. How the immune response modulates the risk of intrauterine transmission of HCMV after maternal infection remains poorly understood. Maternal T cells likely play a critical role in preventing infection at the maternal-fetal interface and limiting spread across the placenta, but concerns exist that immune responses to infection may also cause placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a guinea pig model of primary cytomegalovirus infection. Monoclonal antibodies specific to guinea pig CD4 and CD8 were used to deplete T cells in non- pregnant and in pregnant guinea pigs after mid-gestation. CD4+ T cell depletion increased the severity of illness, caused significantly elevated viral loads, and increased the rate of congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection relative to animals treated with control antibody. CD8+ T cell depletion was comparably well tolerated and did not significantly affect the weight of infected guinea pigs or viral loads in their blood or tissue. However, significantly more viral genomes and transcripts were detected in the placenta and decidua of CD8+ T cell depleted dams post-infection. This study corroborates earlier findings made in nonhuman primates that maternal CD4+ T cells play a critical role in limiting the severity of primary CMV infection during pregnancy while also revealing that other innate and adaptive immune responses can compensate for an absent CD8+ T cell response in α-CD8-treated guinea pigs. Author Summary Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is a leading cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes and preventable disability in children. Using guinea pigs, a well-established small animal model of congenital infection and intrauterine development, this study tested how depleting T cells affects the course of primary cytomegalovirus infections. Severe illness and high rates of congenital infection were observed when helper CD4+ T cells were depleted. The depletion of killer CD8+ T cells did not affect the severity of disease or the rate of congenital infection but did increase the amount of virus that was detected in the placenta. A greater understanding how an immune response can prevent the infection of the placenta and developing offspring is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic development. This study not only describes a new reagent that can be used to study the guinea pig immune system but also sheds new light in how adaptive immunity regulates congenital viral infection.">

We show that the differentiation of dormancy-inducing CD8+ T cells requires CD4+ T cell help, and that IFNγ directly induces dormancy in DCCs. The maintenance of metastatic dormancy, however, is independent of T cells. Instead, awakening from dormancy requires an inflammatory signal, and we identified CD4+ T cell-derived IL- 17A as an essential wake-up signal for dormant DCCs in the lungs. Thus, the induction and awakening from metastatic dormancy require an external stimulus, while the maintenance of dormancy does not rely on the continuous surveillance by lymphocytes.">

        <tr id="Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) represent the ectopic aggregations of immune cells arising during chronic inflammation or tumor progression. In cancer, TLS are often associated with beneficial clinical outcomes in patients undergoing immunotherapy, underscoring their prognostic and predictive significance. Mature TLS, characterized by germinal centers and areas of T-cell and B-cell aggregation, are considered primary locations for activating and maintaining both humoral and cellular anti-tumor immune effects. Despite their recognized importance, the mechanisms driving the formation of mature TLS in cancer and their influence on the immune response within tumors remain insufficiently understood. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively explore the structural composition, development mechanisms, maturity impact factors, immunological function, and innovative therapeutic strategies of mature TLS within the tumor microenvironment. The research summarized herein offers novel insights and considerations for therapeutic approaches to promote TLS generation and maturation in patients with cancer, representing a promising avenue for future cancer therapies.">

MAIT cell activation plays an immunoprotective role against several pathogens, however the functional capacity of MAIT cells following direct infection or exposure to infectious agents remains poorly defined. We investigated the impact of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) on blood-derived MAIT cells and report virus-mediated impairment of activation, cytokine production, and altered transcription factor expression by VZV infected (antigen+) and VZV exposed (antigen-) MAIT cells in response to TCR-dependent and -independent stimulation. Furthermore, we reveal that suppression of VZV exposed (antigen-) MAIT cells is not mediated by a soluble factor from neighbouring VZV infected (antigen+) MAIT cells. Finally, we demonstrate that VZV impairs the cytolytic potential of MAIT cells in response to riboflavin synthesising bacteria. In summary, we report a virus-mediated immune-evasion strategy that disarms MAIT cell responses.">

It undergoes development during fetal stages and continuously learns from each encounter with pathogens, allowing it to develop immunological memory and provide a wide range of immune protection. Over time, after numerous encounters and years of functioning, the immune system can begin to show signs of erosion, which is commonly named immunosenescence. In this review, we aim to explore how the immune system responds to initial encounters with antigens and how it handles persistent stimulations throughout a person’s lifetime. Our understanding of the immune system has greatly benefited from advanced technologies like flow cytometry. In this context, we will discuss the valuable contribution of flow cytometry in enhancing our knowledge of the immune system behavior in aging, with a specific focus on T-cells. Moreover, we will expand our discussion to the flow cytometry-based assessment of extracellular vesicles, a recently discovered communication channel in biology, and their implications for immune system functioning.">

EOMES+type-1 regulatory (EOMES+Tr1-like) T-cells had a dysregulated homeostasis in multiple sclerosis (MS), which was related to their activation in the central nervous system (CNS). EOMES+Tr1-like cells were strongly enriched in patient’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and were the main IL-10-producing T-cells in the CSF. IL-10+EOMES+Tr1-like were present in MS brain lesions, and some were found close to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-infected B-cells. EOMES+Tr1-like cells and FOXP3+Tregs produced IL-10 with EBV-derived antigens, but not with major myelin antigens. EOMES+Tr1-like cells responded selectively to the latency-associated antigen EBNA1, whereas FOXP3+Tregs responded also to lytic antigens. EBNA1-specific EOMES+Tr1-like cells were associated with anti-EBNA1 IgG, disappeared upon therapeutic B-cell depletion and were relatively abundant in patients with the HLA-DRB1*15 risk haplotype. The aberrant anti-viral specificities of Tregs in MS could undermine their protective functions and anti-EBV immune surveillance.">

        <tr id="The circulation of seasonal influenza A viruses (IAVs) in humans relies on effective evasion and subversion of the host immune response. While the evolution of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to avoid humoral immunity is well characterized, relatively little is known about the evolution of innate immune antagonism phenotypes in these viruses. Numerous studies have established that only a small subset of infected cells is responsible for initiating the type I and type III interferon (IFN) response during IAV infection, emphasizing the importance of single cell studies to accurately characterize the IFN response during infection. We developed a flow cytometry-based method to examine transcriptional changes in IFN and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression at the single cell level. We observed that NS segments derived from seasonal H3N2 viruses are more efficient at antagonizing IFN signaling but less effective at suppressing IFN induction, compared to the pdm2009 H1N1 lineage. We compared a collection of NS segments spanning the natural history of the current seasonal IAV lineages and demonstrate long periods of stability in IFN antagonism potential, punctuated by occasional phenotypic shifts. Altogether, our data reveal significant differences in how seasonal and pandemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses antagonize the human IFN response at the single cell level.">

        <tr id="Native banana lectin (BanLec) is antiviral but highly mitogenic, which limits its therapeutic value. In contrast, the genetically engineered H84T BanLec (H84T) is not mitogenic but remains effective against influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mouse models. However, the potency and effect of H84T on human immune cells and IAV-specific immune responses is undetermined. We found that H84T efficiently inhibited IAV replication in human dendritic cells (DCs) from blood and tonsils, which preserved DC viability and allowed acquisition and presentation of viral antigen. Consequently, H84T-treated DCs initiated effective expansion of IAV-specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, H84T preserved the capacity of IAV-exposed DCs to present a second non-IAV antigen and induce robust CD8 T cell expansion. This supports H84T as a potent antiviral in humans as it effectively inhibits IAV infection without disrupting DC function, and preserves induction of antigen-specific adaptive immune responses against diverse antigens, which likely is clinically beneficial.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains an international health problem caused by the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of May 2024, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 775 million cases and over 7 million deaths globally. Despite current vaccination programs, infections are still rapidly increasing, mainly due to the appearance and spread of new variants, variations in immunization rates, and limitations of current vaccines in preventing transmission. This underscores the need for pan-variant antivirals and treatments. The interferon (IFN) system is a critical element of the innate immune response and serves as a frontline defense against viruses. It induces a generalized antiviral state by transiently upregulating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To gain a deeper comprehension of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, its connection to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and the potential therapeutic implications, this review provides a detailed overview of fundamental aspects of the diverse ISGs identified for their antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. It emphasizes the importance of these proteins in controlling viral replication and spread. Furthermore, we explore methodological approaches for the identification of ISGs and conduct a comparative analysis with other viruses. Deciphering the roles of ISGs and their interactions with viral pathogens can help identify novel targets for antiviral therapies and enhance our preparedness to confront current and future viral threats.">

        <tr id="Concurrent KRAS LKB1 (STK11, KL) mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC) is particularly difficult to treat and does not respond well to current immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This is due to numerous mechanisms including low antigen presentation limiting T cell mediated killing. To activate anti-tumor immunity, we targeted tumor cell – natural killer (NK) cell interactions. We tested whether a novel antibody based therapeutic strategy that predominantly activates natural killer (NK) cells demonstrates efficacy in pre-clinical mouse models of KL NSCLC. NK cells rely on binding of ligands, such as Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I-related chain A or B (MICA/B), to the activating receptor NKG2D. Importantly MICA and MICB are widely expressed in elevated levels across NSCLC subtypes including KL lung cancers. Proteases with the tumor microenvironment (TME) can cleave these proteins rendering tumor cells less visible to NK cells. We therefore developed a MICA monoclonal antibody, AHA-1031, which utilizes two NK cell activating receptors. AHA1031 prevents ligand shedding without interfering with binding to NKG2D while targeting cancer cells to antibody mediated cell dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our therapeutic novel antibody has significant monotherapy activity in KL cancer models including xenografts of human cell lines and patient derived xenografts. Activating NK cells through MICA/B stabilization and inducing ADCC offers an alternative and potent therapy option in KL tumors. MICA/B are shed across different tumors making this therapeutic strategy universally applicable.">

L-phenylalanine also restrains memory CD4+T proliferation in an IL4I1-dependent manner and inhibits Th2 cell proliferation and differentiation. RNA-sequencing, metabolomics, flow cytometry and proteomics, validated in vitro and across patients’ cohorts, revealed an impairment in LAT1-dependent transport of L-phenylalanine into Th2 cells in allergy with an increase in its intracellular processing, accompanied by an expansion of pathogenic Th2 cells. Thus, our study identifies L-phenylalanine as a checkpoint in the development, energy metabolism and function of Th2 cells.">

        <tr id="Type I interferons (IFN-I) are cytokines with potent antiviral and inflammatory capacities. IFN-I signaling drives the expression of hundreds of IFN-I stimulated genes (ISGs), whose aggregate function results in the control of viral infection. A few of these ISGs are tasked with negatively regulating the IFN-I response to prevent overt inflammation. ISG15 is a negative regulator whose absence leads to persistent, low-grade elevation of ISG expression and concurrent, self-resolving mild autoinflammation. The limited breadth and low-grade persistence of ISGs expressed in ISG15 deficiency are sufficient to confer broad-spectrum antiviral resistance. Inspired by ISG15 deficiency, we have identified a nominal collection of 10 ISGs that recapitulate the broad antiviral potential of the IFN-I system. The expression of the 10 ISG collection in an IFN-I non-responsive cell line increased cellular resistance to Zika, Vesicular Stomatitis, Influenza A (IAV), and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. A deliverable prophylactic formulation of this syndicate of 10 ISGs significantly inhibited IAV PR8 replication in vivo in mice and protected hamsters against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, suggesting its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral against many current and future emerging viral pathogens.

        <tr id="Introduction Herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) is a blinding disease caused by corneal infection of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Effective clearance of HSV-1 from the infected cornea is crucial for HSK management. Macrophages play an important part in the innate immune defense against viral infections. This study investigates the immunomodulatory role of NLRP12 in macrophage immune response during HSV-1 infection. Methods NLRP12 expression post-infection was assessed in various macrophage cell lines. Overexpression of NLRP12 was achieved by lentiviral transfection, and its effect on HSV-1 replication and immune responses were examined. Mechanistic insights into the role of NLRP12 were explored using immunofluorescence and Western Blot. For in vivo studies, ocular adoptive transfer of NLRP12-overexpressing bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) was performed. HSV-1 viral loads, HSK symptoms, and macrophage-mediated immune responses were investigated. Results A significant decrease in NLRP12 expression post-infection was observed in various macrophage cell lines. Overexpression of NLRP12 in macrophages reduced HSV-1 replication. Mechanistically, overexpression of NLRP12 triggered early and robust pyroptosis in response to HSV-1 infection, inducing interleukin (IL)-18 production and activating downstream antiviral responses through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In vivo, ocular adoptive transfer of NLRP12-overexpressing BMDMs to mouse corneas alleviated HSK damage and reduced HSV-1 viral loads. NLRP12-overexpressing BMDMs improved antiviral responses in the cornea and promoted the maturation of corneal-infiltrating macrophages and dendritic cells. Additionally, NLRP12-overexpressing BMDMs amplified the adaptive immune response in the submandibular draining lymph nodes. Discussion These findings highlight the role of NLRP12 in macrophage-mediated immune response against HSV-1 infection and suggest its potential for possible immunotherapy for HSK.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer of stem cells originating in the bone marrow. Increasing evidence suggests that AML survival and relapse are controlled by genetic alterations, as well as a functional interaction between the tumor and the immune system. In this review, we will discuss the biology of immune evasion in AML and explore the current landscape of immune-based therapies. We argue that a better understanding of the immune microenvironment in AML could help predict responses to immunotherapy and guide decisions for future treatment. Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex hematopoietic clonal disorder with limited curative options beyond stem cell transplantation. The success of transplant is intimately linked with the graft versus leukemia effect from the alloreactive donor immune cells including, T and NK cells. The immune system plays a dynamic role in leukemia survival and resistance. Despite our growing understanding of the immune microenvironment, responses to immune-based therapies differ greatly between patients. Herein, we review the biology of immune evasion mechanisms in AML, discuss the current landscape of immunotherapeutic strategies, and discuss the implications of therapeutic targets. This review focuses on T and NK cell-based therapy, including modified and non-modified NK cells, CAR-T and CAR-NK cells, antibodies, and checkpoint blockades. Understanding the complex interchange between immune tolerance and the emergence of tumor resistance will improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects a wide range of cell types in the body, including a variety of epithelial cell types. Despite the significance of epithelial cells during infection, HCMV has been difficult to study in epithelial cells. In this study, we examined HCMV infection in mammary and prostate epithelial cell lines, finding that the virus establishes a semi-permissive, biosynthetically abortive state. Building on previous work, we hypothesized that shifting epithelial cells to a mesenchymal cell state would restore HCMV biosynthesis and progeny production. To test this hypothesis, we induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using TGF-β and the EMT-transcription factor (EMT-TF) SNAIL. We found that shifting strongly epithelial cell lines to a mesenchymal cell state shifted HCMV infection from a semi-permissive to fully permissive state. This effect appeared to involve two distinct mechanisms: EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral entry and EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral mRNA translation. Although the precise mechanisms remain elusive, our findings identify the epithelial-mesenchymal cell state axis as an important regulator of HCMV infection and provide new insights into how cellular differentiation states influence viral replication. They also raise the possibility that the EMT pathway, a fundamental pathway involved in development and cancer metastasis, could regulate HCMV infection in-vivo, potentially contributing to viral persistence or pathogenesis in epithelial tissues.">

        <tr id="Nearly six million people worldwide have died from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although COVID-19 vaccines are largely successful in reducing the severity of the disease and deaths, the decline in vaccine-induced immunity over time and the continuing emergence of new viral variants or mutations underscore the need for an alternative strategy for developing broad-spectrum host-mediated therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. A key feature of severe COVID-19 is dysregulated innate immune signaling, culminating in a high expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and a lack of antiviral interferons (IFNs), particularly type I (alpha and beta) and type III (lambda). As a natural host defense, the myeloid differentiation primary response protein, MyD88, plays pivotal roles in innate and acquired immune responses via the signal transduction pathways of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a type of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). However, recent studies have highlighted that infection with viruses upregulates MyD88 expression and impairs the host antiviral response by negatively regulating type I IFN. Galectin-3 (Gal3), another key player in viral infections, has been shown to modulate the host immune response by regulating viral entry and activating TLRs, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and NF-κB, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributing to the overall inflammatory response, the so-called “cytokine storm”. These studies suggest that the specific inhibition of MyD88 and Gal3 could be a promising therapy for COVID-19. This review presents future directions for MyD88- and Gal3-targeted antiviral drug discovery, highlighting the potential to restore host immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

The activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses, involving microglia, macrophages, and T and B cells, while required for efficient viral control within the CNS, is also associated with neuropathology. Under pathological events, such as CNS viral infection, microglia/macrophage undergo a reactive response, leading to the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery into the brain, disrupting CNS homeostasis and contributing to the pathogenesis of disease.

This murine model made significant contributions to our understanding of the pathophysiology of MS following subsequent to infection. Microglia/macrophages could be activated into two different states, classic activated state (M1 state) and alternative activated state (M2 state) during TMEV infection. M1 possesses the capacity to initiate inflammatory response and secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines, and M2-liked microglia/macrophages are anti-inflammatory characterized by the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT There are no licensed vaccines for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and current antiviral drugs that target viral proteins are toxic and prone to resistance. Targeting host pathways essential for virus replication provides an alternate strategy that may reduce opportunities for drug resistance to occur. Oxidative stress is triggered by numerous viruses including HCMV. Peroxynitrite is a reactive nitrogen species that is formed during oxidative stress. Herein, we identified that HCMV rapidly induces the generation of intracellular peroxynitrite upon infection in a manner partially dependent upon xanthine oxidase generation. Peroxynitrite promoted HCMV infection in both cell-free and cell-associated infection systems in multiple cell types. Inhibiting peroxynitrite within the first 24 hours of infection prevented HCMV replication and peroxynitrite promoted cell entry and pp65 translocation into the host cell nuclei. Furthermore, using the murine cytomegalovirus model, we demonstrated that antagonizing peroxynitrite significantly reduces cytomegalovirus replication and pathogenesis in vivo. Overall, our study highlights a proviral role for peroxynitrite in CMV infection and implies that RNS and/or the mechanisms that induce their production could be targeted as a novel strategy to inhibit HCMV infection. IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes significant disease in individuals with impaired or immature immune systems, such as transplant patients and after congenital infection. Antiviral drugs that target the virus directly are toxic and are susceptible to antiviral drug resistance due to virus mutations. An alternate strategy is to target processes within host cells that are required by the virus for replication. Herein, we show that HCMV infection triggers a highly reactive molecule, peroxynitrite, during the initial stages of infection. Peroxynitrite was required for the initial entry of the virus into the cell and promotes virus replication in multiple cell types, suggesting a broad pro-viral function. Importantly, targeting peroxynitrite dramatically inhibited cytomegalovirus replication in cells in the laboratory and in mice, suggesting that therapeutic targeting of this molecule and/or the cellular functions it regulates could represent a novel strategy to inhibit HCMV infection.

        <tr id="Cell plasticity (CP), describing a dynamic cell state, plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis during organ morphogenesis, regeneration and damage-to-repair biological process. Single-cell-omics datasets provide unprecedented resource to empowers analysis on CP. Hematopoiesis offers fertile opportunities to develop quantitative methods for understanding CP with rich supports from experimental ground-truths. In this study we generated high-quality lineage-negative (Lin−) single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets under various conditions and introduced a working pipeline named Snapdragon to interrogate naïve and disturbed plasticity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with mutational or environmental challenges. Utilizing embedding methods UMAP or FA, a continuum of hematopoietic development is visually observed in wildtype where the pipeline confirms a very low Proportion of hybrid-cells (Phc, with bias range: 0.4-0.6) on a transition trajectory. Upon Tet2 mutation, a driver of leukemia, or treatment of DSS, an inducer of colitis, Phc is increased and plasticity of HSPCs was enhanced. Quantitative analysis indicates that Tet2 mutation enhances HSC self-renewal capability while DSS treatment results in an enhanced myeloid-skewing trajectory, suggesting their similar but different consequences. We prioritized several transcription factors (i.e the EGR family) and signaling pathways (i.e. receptors IL1R1 and ADRB, inflammation and sympathy-sensing respectively) which are responsible for Phc alterations. CellOracle-based simulation suggests that knocking-out EGR regulons or pathways of IL1R1 and ADRB partially reverses Phc promoted by Tet2 mutation and inflammation. In conclusion, the study provides high-quality datasets with single-cell transcriptomic matrices for diversified hematopoietic simulations and a computational pipeline Snapdragon for quantifying disturbed Phc and CP.

Factors such as PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation burden, and a ‘hot’ tumor microenvironment with heightened effector T cell infiltration have consistently been associated with positive responses. In contrast, the predictive role of the abundantly present tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell (TIMs) fraction remains somewhat uncertain, partly explained by their towering variety in terms of ontogeny, phenotype, location, and function. Nevertheless, numerous preclinical and clinical studies established a clear link between lung cancer progression and alterations in intra- and extramedullary hematopoiesis, leading to emergency myelopoiesis at the expense of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lymphoid differentiation. These observations affirm that a continuous crosstalk between solid cancers such as lung cancer and the bone marrow niche (BMN) must take place. However, the BMN, encompassing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, differentiated immune and stromal cells, remains inadequately explored in solid cancer patients. Subsequently, no clear consensus has been reached on the exact breadth of tumor installed hematopoiesis perturbing cues nor their predictive power for immunotherapy. As the current era of single-cell omics is reshaping our understanding of the hematopoietic process and the subcluster landscape of lung TIMs, we aim to present an updated overview of the hierarchical differentiation process of TIMs within the BMN of solid cancer bearing subjects. Our comprehensive overview underscores that lung cancer should be regarded as a systemic disease in which the cues governing the lung tumor-BMN crosstalk might bolster the definition of new biomarkers and druggable targets, potentially mitigating the high attrition rate of leading immunotherapies for NSCLC.">

Nonetheless, a significant demographic, comprising around 20% to 30% of the adult population, remains unimmunized due to diverse factors. Furthermore, alongside those recovered from the infection, there is a subset of the population experiencing persistent symptoms referred to as Long COVID. This condition is more prevalent among individuals with underlying health conditions and immune system impairments. Some Long COVID pathologies stem from direct damage inflicted by the viral infection, whereas others arise from inadequate immune system control over the infection or suboptimal immunoregulation. There are differences in the serum cytokines and miRNA profiles between infected individuals who develop severe COVID-19 or Long COVID and those who control adequately the infection. This review delves into the advantages and constraints associated with employing imiquimod in human subjects to enhance the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 immunization. Restoration of the immune system can modify it towards a profile of non-susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. An adequate immune system has the potential to curb viral propagation, mitigate symptoms, and ameliorate the severe consequences of the infection.">

        <tr id="Background Gamma-delta (γδ) T cells are a major immune cell subset in pigs. Approximately 50% of circulating T cells are γδ T cells in young pigs and up to 30% in adult sows. Despite this abundance, the functions of porcine γδ T cells are mostly unidentified. In humans and mice, activated γδ T cells exhibit broad innate cytotoxic activity against a wide variety of stressed, infected, and cancerous cells through death receptor/ligand-dependent and perforin/granzyme-dependent pathways. However, so far, it is unknown whether porcine γδ T cells have the ability to perform cytotoxic functions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of porcine γδ T cells isolated from blood, lung, and nasal mucosa. To further analyze the cytolytic potential of γδ T cells, in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed using purified γδ T cells as effector cells and virus-exposed or mock-treated primary porcine alveolar macrophages as target cells. Results Our results show that only CD2+ γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers (CD16, NKp46, perforin) with higher perforin and NKp46 expression in γδ T cells isolated from lung and nasal mucosa. Moreover, we found that γδ T cells can exhibit cytotoxic functions in a cell-cell contact and degranulation-dependent manner. However, porcine γδ T cells did not seem to specifically target Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus or swine Influenza A Virus-infected macrophages, which may be due to viral escape mechanisms. Conclusion Porcine γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers and can exhibit cytotoxic activity in vitro. The specific mechanisms by which porcine γδ T cells recognize target cells are not fully understood but may involve the detection of cellular stress signals.">

Forty-five PLWH who had received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for more than two years and 29 healthy controls (HCs) at Beijing Youan Hospital were enrolled to assess the dynamic changes in T-cell responses between the day before the third vaccine dose (week 0) and 4 or 12 weeks (week 4 or week 12) after receiving the third dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot), and multiplex cytokines profiling were used to assess T-cell responses at the three timepoints in this study.


RESULTS
The results of the ELISpot and activation-induced marker (AIM) assays showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were increased in both PLWH and HCs after the third dose of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and a similar magnitude of immune response was induced against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant compared to the wild-type strain. In detail, spike-specific T-cell responses (measured by the ELISpot assay for interferon γ [IFN-γ] release) in both PLWH and HCs significantly increased in week 4, and the spike-specific T-cell responses in HCs were significantly stronger than those in PLWH 4 weeks after the third vaccination. In the AIM assay, spike-specific CD4+ T-cell responses peaked in both PLWH and HCs in week 12. Additionally, significantly higher spike-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were induced in PLWH than in HCs in week 12. In PLWH, the release of the cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-22 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that were stimulated with spike peptides increased in week 12. In addition, the levels of IL-4 and IL-5 were higher in PLWH than in HCs in week 12. Interestingly, the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses in PLWH was negatively associated with the extent of CD8+ T-cell activation and exhaustion. In addition, positive correlations were observed between the magnitude of spike-specific T-cell responses (determined by measuring IFN-γ release by ELISpot) and the amounts of IL-4, IL-5, IL-2 and IL-17F.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses could be enhanced by the booster dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines and further illustrate the importance of additional vaccination for PLWH.">

        <tr id="CD36 expression in both immune and non-immune cells is known to be directly involved in cancer metastasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by malignant melanocytes play a vital role in developing tumor-promoting microenvironments, but it is unclear whether this is mediated through CD36. To understand the role of CD36 in melanoma, we first analyzed the SKCM dataset for clinical prognosis, evaluated the percentage of CD36 in lymphatic fluid-derived EVs (LEVs), and tested whether melanoma-derived EVs increase CD36 expression and induce M2-macrophage-like characteristics. Furthermore, we performed a multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) imaging analysis to evaluate the CD36 expression and its colocalization with various other cells in the lymph node (LN) of patients and control subjects. Our findings show that cutaneous melanoma patients have a worse clinical prognosis with high CD36 levels, and a higher percentage of CD36 in total LEVs were found at baseline in melanoma patients compared to control. We also found that monocytic and endothelial cells treated with melanoma EVs expressed more CD36 than untreated cells. Furthermore, melanoma-derived EVs can regulate immunosuppressive macrophage-like characteristics by upregulating CD36. The spatial imaging data show that cells in tumor-involved sentinel LNs exhibit a higher probability of CD36 expression than cells from control LNs, but this was not statistically significant. Conclusively, our findings demonstrated that CD36 plays a vital role in controlling the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the LN, which can promote the formation of a protumorigenic niche.">

Severe sepsis could incite an uncontrollable surge of inflammatory cytokines, and the host immune system's immunosuppression could respond to counter excessive inflammatory responses, characterized by the accumulated anti-inflammatory cytokines, impaired function of immune cells, over-proliferation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, depletion of immune effector cells by different means of death, etc. In this review, we delve into the underlying pathological mechanisms of sepsis, emphasizing both the hyperinflammatory phase and the associated immunosuppression. We offer an in-depth exploration of the critical mechanisms underlying sepsis, spanning from individual immune cells to a holistic organ perspective, and further down to the epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, we outline the strengths of artificial intelligence in analyzing extensive datasets pertaining to septic patients, showcasing how classifiers trained on various clinical data sources can identify distinct sepsis phenotypes and thus to guide personalized therapy strategies for the management of sepsis. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive summary of recent, reliable biomarkers for hyperinflammatory and immunosuppressive states, facilitating more precise and expedited diagnosis of sepsis.">

        <tr id="Innate immune cells play a key role in inflammation as a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it remains unclear how innate immunity-mediated inflammation is fine-tuned to minimize tissue damage and assure the host’s survival at the early phase of systemic inflammation. The results of this study with mouse models demonstrate that the supply of monocytes is restricted depending on the magnitude of inflammation. During the acute phase of severe inflammation, monocytes, but not neutrophils, were substantially reduced by apoptosis and the remaining monocytes were dysfunctional in the bone marrow. Monocyte-specific ablation of Casp3/7 prevented monocyte apoptosis but promoted monocyte necrosis in the bone marrow, leading to elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the increased mortality of mice during systemic inflammation. Importantly, the limitation of monocyte supply was dependent on pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo. Consistently, a reduction of monocytes was observed in the peripheral blood during cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) patients, a pathogen-unrelated systemic inflammation induced by chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T cell) therapy. Thus, monocytes act as a safety valve to alleviate tissue damage caused by inflammation and ensure host survival, which may be responsible for a primitive immune-control mechanism that does not require intervention by acquired immunity.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells are central mediators of protective immunity to blood-stage malaria, particularly for their capacity in orchestrating germinal center reaction and generating parasite-specific high-affinity antibodies. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are predominant CD4+ effector T cell subset implicated in these processes, yet the factors and detailed mechanisms that assist Tfh cell development and function during Plasmodium infection are largely undefined. Here we provide evidence that receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), an adaptor protein of various intracellular signals, is not only important for CD4+ T cell expansion as previously implied but also plays a prominent role in Tfh cell differentiation and function during blood-stage Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL infection. Consequently, RACK1 in CD4+ T cells contributes significantly to germinal center formation, parasite-specific IgG production, and host resistance to the infection. Mechanistic exploration detects specific interaction of RACK1 with STAT3 in P. yoelii 17XNL-responsive CD4+ T cells, ablation of RACK1 leads to defective STAT3 phosphorylation, accompanied by substantially lower amount of STAT3 protein in CD4+ T cells, whereas retroviral overexpression of RACK1 or STAT3 in RACK1-deficient CD4+ T cells greatly restores STAT3 activity and Bcl-6 expression under the Tfh polarization condition. Further analyses suggest RACK1 positively regulates STAT3 stability by inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation process, thus promoting optimal STAT3 activity and Bcl-6 induction during Tfh cell differentiation. These findings uncover a novel mechanism by which RACK1 participates in posttranslational regulation of STAT3, Tfh cell differentiation, and subsequent development of anti-Plasmodium humoral immunity.">

        <tr id="Diabetes significantly impacts the immune system; however, its role in worsening sepsis prognosis remains poorly understood. This study investigated the effect of hyperferritinemia on immune modulation in septic diabetic patients. A cohort study at Kyungpook National University Hospital stratified sepsis patients by diabetes status and followed them for 28 days. Additionally, CD4+ T cells from mice were analyzed for proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolic changes under ferritin treatment. Results from the clinical study showed higher ferritin levels in diabetic patients, and those with lower lymphocyte counts had increased mortality. In the mice study, ferritin inhibited T cell activation and proliferation by shifting metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation without increasing cell death. These findings suggest that the suppression of T cell proliferation due to elevated ferritin levels contributes to an immunosuppressive environment, leading to worse outcomes. In conclusion, hyperferritinemia is a biomarker for sepsis severity, particularly in diabetic patients, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies targeting ferritin levels or glycolytic pathways.">

Individuals infected with Mtb who acquire HIV are approximately 16 times more likely to develop active tuberculosis. T cells play an important role as both targets for HIV infection and mediators of the immune response against both pathogens. This review aims to synthesize the current literature and provide insights into the effects of HIV/Mtb coinfection on T cell populations and their contributions to immunity. Evidence from multiple in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that T helper responses are severely compromised during coinfection, leading to impaired cytotoxic responses. Moreover, HIV’s targeting of Mtb-specific cells, including those within granulomas, offers an explanation for the severe progression of the disease. Herein, we discuss the patterns of differentiation, exhaustion, and transcriptomic changes in T cells during coinfection, as well as the metabolic adaptations that are necessary for T cell maintenance and functionality. This review highlights the interconnectedness of the immune response and the pathogenesis of HIV/Mtb coinfection.">

        <tr id="Background The emergence of the hypermutated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) BA.2.86 variant raises significant concerns due to its potential to evade pre-existing immunity. Methods We measured cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses to BA.2.86 in 52 previously exposed participants and investigated clinic-demographic and viral genetic determinants affecting T-cell responses. Findings We found that despite notable escape from neutralizing antibodies, T-cell responses remained generally preserved, albeit with a significant but small loss in T-cell cross-recognition (7.5 %, 14.2 % and 10.8 % average loss for IFN-g, IL-2 and IFN-g + IL-2, respectively, p < 0.05). This is consistent with the prediction of 6 out of 10 immunodominant T-cell epitopes (TCEs) altered by BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutations to have reduced peptide presentation. This effect is expected to be mitigated due to total TCEs across the genome. Remarkably, T-cell responses and cross-recognition were 3.5 (IFN-g), 2 (IL-2) and 2.4 (IFN-g + IL-2) times higher when first induced by natural infection rather than vaccination three years before, by increasing number of infections, and by ancestral/Delta than Omicron infections. Interpretation Our findings underscore the critical role and the factors influencing T-cell immunity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as first antigen encounter (vaccination or infection), which is essential for developing effective control strategies against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

        <tr id="Background and Aims Accumulating evidence suggests the microbiota is a key factor in disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), by affecting host immune and neural systems. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive due to their complexity and clinical heterogeneity of patients with DGBIs. We aimed to identify neuroimmune pathways that are critical in microbiota-gut-brain communication during de novo gut colonization. Methods We employed a combination of gnotobiotic and state-of-the-art microbial tools, behavioral analysis, immune and pharmacological approaches. Germ-free wild type, MyD88−/− Ticam1−/− and SCID mice were studied before and after colonization with specific pathogen-free microbiota, Altered Schaedler Flora, E. coli or S. typhimurium (permanent or transient colonizers). TLR agonists and antagonists, CCR7 antagonist or immunomodulators were used to study immune pathways. We assessed brain c-Fos, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and dendritic and glial cells by immunofluorescence, expression of neuroimmune genes by NanoString and performed brain proteomics. Results Bacterial monocolonization, conventionalization or administration of microbial products to germ-free mice altered mouse behavior similarly, acting through Toll-like receptor or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain signaling. The process required CD11b+CD11c+CD103+ cell activation and migration into the brain. The change in behavior did not require the continued presence of bacteria and was associated with activation of multiple neuro-immune networks in the gut and the brain. Conclusions Changes in neural plasticity occur rapidly upon initial gut microbial colonization and involve innate immune signaling to the brain, mediated by CD11b+CD11c+CD103+ cell migration. The results identify a new target with therapeutic potential for DGBIs developing in context of increased gut and blood-brain barrier permeability.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite the considerable progress in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment, relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is still frequent and associated with a poor prognosis. Relapse has been shown to be correlated with an incomplete eradication of CD34+ leukemic stem cells prior to HSCT. Previously, we have shown that a novel CD34-directed, bispecific T-cell engager (BTE) can efficiently redirect the T-cell effector function toward cancer cells, thus eliminating leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. However, its impact on γδ T-cells is still unclear. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the CD34-specific BTE using in vitro expanded γδ T-cells as effectors. We showed that the BTEs bind to γδ T-cells and CD34+ leukemic cell lines and induce target cell killing in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, γδ T-cell mediated killing was found to be superior to αβ T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we observed that only in the presence of BTE the γδ T-cells induced primary AML blast killing in vitro. Importantly, our results show that γδ T-cells did not target the healthy CD34intermediate endothelial blood–brain barrier cell line (hCMEC/D3) nor lysed CD34+ HSCs from healthy bone marrow samples.">

        <tr id="Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is the causative agent of the majority of Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC). The virus has limited coding capacity, with its early viral proteins, large T (LT) and small T (sT), being multifunctional and contributing to infection and transformation. A fundamental difference in early viral gene expression between infection and MCPyV-driven tumorigenesis is the expression of a truncated LT (LTtr) in the tumor. In contrast, sT is expressed in both conditions and contributes significantly to oncogenesis. Here, we identified novel functions of early viral proteins by performing genome-wide transcriptome and chromatin studies in primary human fibroblasts. Due to current limitations in infection and tumorigenesis models, we mimic these conditions by ectopically expressing sT, LT or LTtr, individually or in combination, at different time points. In addition to its known function in cell cycle and inflammation modulation, we reveal a fundamentally new function of sT. We show that sT regulates the type I interferon (IFN) response downstream of the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) by interfering with the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3)-induced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) response. Expression of sT leads to a reduction in the expression of interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) which is a central component of the ISGF3 complex. We further show that this function of sT is conserved in BKPyV. We provide a first mechanistic understanding of which early viral proteins trigger and control the type I IFN response, which may influence MCPyV infection, persistence and, during MCC progression, regulation of the tumor microenvironment. Author Summary Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is the only human polyomavirus that causes cancer in humans. As with all human polyomaviruses, the available infection models are limited. Thus, many processes such as the host response to infection and its regulation by the virus to establish infection and persistence are poorly understood. To better understand this interplay of viral MCPyV proteins, we performed genome-wide transcriptome and chromatin studies in primary human fibroblasts and simulated infection and tumorigenesis conditions by ectopically expressing the early viral proteins individually or in combination at different time points. This allowed us to uncover a novel, previously undescribed function of polyomavirus sT, namely the reduction of the ISG response by affecting the ISGF3 complex, specifically by reducing IRF9 protein levels. This work sheds light on how early viral proteins influence the type I IFN response and how their interplay may affect MCPyV infection, persistence, and MCC progression.">

Growing evidence demonstrates the crucial role of innate immunity in tumor initiation and progression. Several studies support the idea that innate immunity, through the release of pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines and tumor growth factors, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM). Cutaneous melanoma is the most common skin cancer, with an incidence that rapidly increased in recent decades. Melanoma is a highly immunogenic tumor, due to its high mutational burden. The metastatic form retains a high mortality. The advent of immunotherapy revolutionized the therapeutic approach to this tumor and significantly ameliorated the patients’ clinical outcome. In this review, we will recapitulate the multiple roles of innate immune cells in melanoma and the related implications for immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Influenza infections result in a significant number of severe illnesses annually, many of which are complicated by secondary bacterial super-infection. Primary influenza infection has been shown to increase susceptibility to secondary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection by altering the host immune response, leading to significant immunopathology. Type III interferons (IFNs), or IFNλs, have gained traction as potential antiviral therapeutics due to their restriction of viral replication without damaging inflammation. The role of IFNλ in regulating epithelial biology in super-infection has recently been established; however, the impact of IFNλ on immune cells is less defined. In this study, we infected wild-type and IFNLR1-/- mice with influenza A/PR/8/34 followed by S. aureus USA300. We demonstrated that global IFNLR1-/- mice have enhanced bacterial clearance through increased uptake by phagocytes, which was shown to be cell-intrinsic specifically in myeloid cells in mixed bone marrow chimeras. We also showed that depletion of IFNLR1 on CX3CR1 expressing myeloid immune cells, but not neutrophils, was sufficient to significantly reduce bacterial burden compared to mice with intact IFNLR1. These findings provide insight into how IFNλ in an influenza-infected lung impedes bacterial clearance during super-infection and show a direct cell intrinsic role for IFNλ signaling on myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract Type I interferons (IFN) are immune-stimulatory cytokines involved in antiviral and antitumor immune responses. They enhance the efficacy of immunogenic anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy by activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Macrophages are one of the most abundant innate immune cells in the immune microenvironment of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) and can exert potent immune-suppressive functions. Here, we investigate the potential of tumoral type I IFNs to repolarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in two murine MBM models and assess the effects of radiotherapy-induced type I IFN on TAMs in a transcriptomic MBM patient dataset. In mice, we describe a proinflammatory M1-like TAM phenotype induced by tumoral IFNβ and identify a myeloid type I IFN-response signature associated with a high M1/M2-like TAM ratio. Following irradiation, patients with MBM displaying a myeloid type I IFN-response signature showed increased overall survival, providing evidence that tumoral IFNβ supports an effective antitumor immune response by re-educating immune-regulatory TAM. These findings uncover type I IFN–inducing therapies as a potential macrophage-targeting therapeutic approach and provide a rationale for combining radiotherapy with concomitant immunotherapy to improve treatment response in patients with MBM. Significance: Our study shows that re-education of tumor-associated macrophages by tumoral IFNβ translates into improved clinical outcome in patients with melanoma brain metastases, providing pathomechanistic insights into synergistic type I interferon–inducing therapies with immunotherapies and warranting investigation of IFNβ as a predictive biomarker for combined radioimmunotherapy.">

        <tr id="This study aimed at defining the role of the B-cell adaptor protein BANK1 in the appearance of age-associated B cells (ABCs) in two SLE mouse models (TLR7.tg6 and Imiquimod-induced mice), crossed with Bank1-/- mice. The absence of Bank1 led to a significant reduction in ABC levels, also affecting other B cell populations. To gain deeper insights into their differentiation pathway and the impact of Bank1 on B cell populations, a single-cell transcriptome assay was performed. In the TLR7.tg6 model, we identified 10 clusters within B cells, including an ABC-specific cluster which was decreased in Bank1-deficient mice. In its absence, ABCs exhibited an anti-inflammatory gene expression profile, while being pro-inflammatory in Bank1-sufficient lupus mice. Trajectory analyses revealed that ABCs originated from marginal zone and memory-like B cells, ultimately acquiring transcriptional characteristics associated with atypical memory cells and long-lived plasma cells. Also, Bank1 deficiency normalized the presence of naïve B cells, which were nearly absent in lupus mice. Interestingly, Bank1 deficiency significantly reduced a distinct cluster containing IFN-responsive genes. These findings underscore the critical role of Bank1 in ABC development, impacting early B cell stages towards ABC differentiation, and the presence of IFN-stimulated gene-containing B cells, both populations determinant for autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most healthy individuals recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas a remarkable number continues to suffer from unexplained symptoms, known as Long COVID or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). It is therefore imperative that methods for preventing and treating the onset of PASC be investigated with the utmost urgency. Methods A mathematical model of the immune response to vaccination and viral infection with SARS-CoV-2, incorporating immune memory cells, was developed. Results and discussion Similar to our previous model, persistent infection was observed by the residual virus in the host, implying the possibility of chronic inflammation and delayed recovery from tissue injury. Pre-infectious vaccination and antiviral medication administered during onset can reduce the acute viral load; however, they show no beneficial effects in preventing persistent infection. Therefore, the impact of these treatments on the PASC, which has been clinically observed, is mainly attributed to their role in preventing severe tissue damage caused by acute viral infections. For PASC patients with persistent infection, vaccination was observed to cause an immediate rapid increase in viral load, followed by a temporary decrease over approximately one year. The former was effectively suppressed by the coadministration of antiviral medications, indicating that this combination is a promising treatment for PASC.">

        <tr id="Cytokine storm is usually described as one of the main reasons behind COVID-associated mortality. Cytokines are essential protein molecules engaged in immune responses; they play a critical role in protection against infections. However, they also contribute to inflammatory reactions and tissue damage, becoming a double-edged sword in the context of COVID-19. Recent studies have suggested various cytokines and chemokines that play a crucial role in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. One such cytokine is interleukin 27 (IL-27), which has been found to be elevated in the blood plasma of patients with COVID-19. Within this study, we will explore the role of IL-27 in immune responses and analyze both the existing literature and our own prior research findings on this cytokine in the context of COVID-19. It affects a wide variety of immune cells. Regardless of the pathological process it is involved in, IL-27 is critical for upholding the necessary balance between tissue damage and cytotoxicity against infectious agents and/or tumors. In COVID-19, it is involved in multiple processes, including antiviral cytotoxicity via CD8+ cells, IgG subclass switching, and even the activation of Tregs.">

This review examines current knowledge on viral-host interactions and immune responses in HIV-infected infants, focusing on immune development, viral dynamics, and therapeutic implications. The immune system of infants undergoes rapid maturation during early life, influencing their susceptibility to HIV infection and responses to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Key aspects include thymic function, cytokine profiles, and the establishment of immune memory, which collectively shape immune responses against HIV. Viral dynamics in HIV-infected infants differ markedly from those in adults, characterized by high viral loads, diverse viral subtypes, and the early establishment of viral reservoirs within immune cells. These reservoirs, particularly in sanctuary sites like the central nervous system, pose challenges for achieving viral eradication and long-term remission. Effective management requires strategies to characterize and target these reservoirs, alongside early intervention to mitigate viral replication and preserve immune function. Advances in viral monitoring technologies and treatment regimens are essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing the global burden of pediatric HIV infection.

Activation of lung fibroblasts and differentiation to myofibroblasts are the principal effectors of disease pathology, but damage and senescence of alveolar epithelial cells, specifically type II (ATII) cells, has recently been identified as a potential trigger event for the progressive disease cycle. Targeting ATII senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is an attractive therapeutic strategy; however, translatable primary human cell models that enable mechanistic studies and drug development are lacking. Here, we describe a novel system of conditioned medium (CM) transfer from bleomycin-induced senescent primary alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) onto normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) that demonstrates an enhanced fibrotic transcriptional and secretory phenotype compared to non-senescent AEC CM treatment or direct bleomycin damage of the NHLFs. In this system, the bleomycin-treated AECs exhibit classical hallmarks of cellular senescence, including SASP and a gene expression profile that resembles aberrant epithelial cells of the IPF lung. Fibroblast activation by CM transfer is attenuated by pre-treatment of senescent AECs with the senolytic Navitoclax and AD80, but not with the standard of care agent Nintedanib or senomorphic JAK-targeting drugs (e.g., ABT-317, ruxolitinib). This model provides a relevant human system for profiling novel senescence-targeting therapeutics for IPF drug development.">

        <tr id="The human polyomavirus JCPyV is an opportunistic pathogen that infects greater than 60% of the world’s population. The virus establishes a persistent and asymptomatic infection in the urogenital system but can cause a fatal demyelinating disease in immunosuppressed or immunomodulated patients following invasion of the CNS. The mechanisms responsible for JCPyV invasion into CNS tissues are not known but direct invasion from the blood to the cerebral spinal fluid via the choroid plexus has been hypothesized. To study the potential of the choroid plexus as a site of neuroinvasion, we used an adult human choroid plexus epithelial cell line to model the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (B-CSF) barrier in a transwell system. We found that these cells formed a highly restrictive barrier to virus penetration either as free virus or as virus associated with extracellular vesicles (EVJC+). The restriction was not absolute and small amounts of virus or EVJC+ penetrated and were able to establish foci of infection in primary astrocytes. Disruption of the barrier with capsaicin did not increase virus or EVJC+ penetration leading us to hypothesize that virus and EVJC+ were highly cell-associated and crossed the barrier by an active process. An inhibitor of macropinocytosis increased virus penetration from the basolateral (blood side) to the apical side (CSF side). In contrast, inhibitors of clathrin and raft dependent transcytosis reduced virus transport from the basolateral to the apical side of the barrier. None of the drugs inhibited apical to basolateral transport suggesting directionality. Pretreatment with cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of P-gp, MRP2 and BCRP multidrug resistance transporters, restored viral penetration in cells treated with raft and clathrin dependent transcytosis inhibitors. Because choroid plexus epithelial cells are known to be susceptible to JCPyV infection both in vitro and in vivo we also examined the release of infectious virus from the barrier. We found that virus was preferentially released from the cells into the apical (CSF) chamber. These data show clearly that there are two mechanisms of penetration, direct transcytosis which is capable of seeding the CSF with small amounts of virus, and infection followed by directional release of infectious virions into the CSF compartment.">

        <tr id="Virus-associated chronic inflammation may contribute to autoimmunity in a number of diseases. In the brain, autoimmune encephalitis appears related to fluctuating reactivation states of neurotropic viruses. In addition, viral miRNAs and proteins can be transmitted via exosomes, which constitute novel but highly relevant mediators of cellular communication. The current study questioned the role of HSV-1-encoded and host-derived miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived exosomes, enriched from stress-induced neuroinflammatory diseases, mainly subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), psychiatric disorders (AF and SZ), and various other neuroinflammatory diseases. The results were compared with CSF exosomes from control donors devoid of any neuroinflammatory pathology. Serology proved positive, but variable immunity against herpesviruses in the majority of patients, except controls. Selective ultrastructural examinations identified distinct, herpesvirus-like particles in CSF-derived lymphocytes and monocytes. The likely release of extracellular vesicles and exosomes was most frequently observed from CSF monocytes. The exosomes released were structurally similar to highly purified stem-cell-derived exosomes. Exosomal RNA was quantified for HSV-1-derived miR-H2-3p, miR-H3-3p, miR-H4-3p, miR-H4-5p, miR-H6-3p, miR-H27 and host-derived miR-21-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-138-5p and correlated with the oxidative stress chemokine IL-8 and the axonal damage marker neurofilament light chain (NfL). Replication-associated miR-H27 correlated with neuronal damage marker NfL, and cell-derived miR-155-5p correlated with oxidative stress marker IL-8. Elevated miR-138-5p targeting HSV-1 latency-associated ICP0 inversely correlated with lower HSV-1 antibodies in CSF. In summary, miR-H27 and miR-155-5p may constitute neuroinflammatory markers for delineating frequent and fluctuating HSV-1 replication and NfL-related axonal damage in addition to the oxidative stress cytokine IL-8 in the brain. Tentatively, HSV-1 remains a relevant pathogen conditioning autoimmune processes and a psychiatric clinical phenotype.">

        <tr id="Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a rare, yet potentially fatal disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) enterotoxins, known as superantigens, which trigger an intense immune response. Our previous study demonstrated the protective effect of tofacitinib against murine toxin-induced shock and a beneficial effect against S. aureus sepsis. In the current study, we examined the effects of tofacitinib on T-cell response in peripheral blood using a mouse model of enterotoxin-induced shock. Our data revealed that tofacitinib suppresses the activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. Furthermore, both gene and protein levels of Th1 cytokines were downregulated by tofacitinib treatment in mice with enterotoxin-induced shock. Importantly, we demonstrated that CD4+ cells, but not CD8+ cells, are pathogenic in mice with enterotoxin-induced shock. In conclusion, our findings suggest that tofacitinib treatment suppresses CD4+ T-cell activation and Th1 response, thereby aiding in protection against staphylococcal toxic shock in mice. This insight may guide the future development of novel therapies for STSS.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has caused a global health crisis, necessitating a deeper understanding of its pathophysiology. In this study, we explored the immune and hematological dynamics in COVID-19 patients to gain insights into disease severity and prognosis. Our findings revealed distinct cytokine profiles in moderate and severe cases. IL12A was significantly upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from moderate cases, suggesting a potential role in initiating an effective immune response. Conversely, severe cases exhibited downregulation of key pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL23A, TNFalpha, IL1B, and IFNG) alongside an upregulation of the immunosuppressive IL10, indicative of a dysregulated immune environment. Serum analysis showed elevated IL6 and IL10 levels in both moderate and severe cases, emphasizing their potential as markers for disease severity. Notably, no significant differences in serum cytokines were found between recovery and lethal cases. In lethal cases of COVID-19, elevated D-dimer, urea, and creatinine correlated with IL6 and IL10. This study contributes valuable information to the ongoing efforts to understand and manage the dysregulated immune responses underlying COVID-19 pathology.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Powassan virus (POWV) is an emergent tick-borne flavivirus that causes fatal encephalitis in the elderly and long-term neurologic sequelae in survivors. How age contributes to severe POWV encephalitis remains an enigma, and no animal models have assessed age-dependent POWV neuropathology. Inoculating C57BL/6 mice with a POWV strain (LI9) currently circulating in Ixodes ticks resulted in age-dependent POWV lethality 10–20 dpi. POWV infection of 50-week-old mice was 82% fatal with lethality sequentially reduced by age to 7.1% in 10-week-old mice. POWV LI9 was neuroinvasive in mice of all ages, causing acute spongiform CNS pathology and reactive gliosis 5–15 dpi that persisted in survivors 30 dpi. High CNS viral loads were found in all mice 10 dpi. However, by 15 dpi, viral loads decreased by 2–4 logs in 10- to 40-week-old mice, while remaining at high levels in 50-week-old mice. Age-dependent differences in CNS viral loads 15 dpi occurred concomitantly with striking changes in CNS cytokine responses. In the CNS of 50-week-old mice, POWV induced Th1-type cytokines (IFNγ, IL-2, IL-12, IL-4, TNFα, IL-6), suggesting a neurodegenerative pro-inflammatory M1 microglial program. By contrast, in 10-week-old mice, POWV-induced Th2-type cytokines (IL-10, TGFβ, IL-4) were consistent with a neuroprotective M2 microglial phenotype. These findings correlate age-dependent CNS cytokine responses and viral loads with POWV lethality and suggest potential neuroinflammatory therapeutic targets. Our results establish the age-dependent lethality of POWV in a murine model that mirrors human POWV severity and long-term CNS pathology in the elderly. IMPORTANCE Powassan virus is an emerging tick-borne flavivirus causing lethal encephalitis in aged individuals. We reveal an age-dependent POWV murine model that mirrors human POWV encephalitis and long-term CNS damage in the elderly. We found that POWV is neuroinvasive and directs reactive gliosis in all age mice, but at acute stages selectively induces pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine responses in 50-week-old mice and neuroprotective Th2 cytokine responses in 10-week-old mice. Our findings associate CNS viral loads and divergent cytokine responses with age-dependent POWV lethality and survival outcomes. Responses of young mice suggest potential therapeutic targets and approaches for preventing severe POWV encephalitis that may be broadly applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases. Our age-dependent murine POWV model permits analysis of vaccines that prevent POWV lethality, and therapeutics that resolve severe POWV encephalitis.">

        <tr id="Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) represents endogenous mechanisms of negative immunoregulation. While the modulation of effector functions has been the major focus of PD-1 research, quick PD-1 upregulation in naïve T cells starting 1 h after priming raised a possibility that PD-1 also affects the development of effector T cells. The role of PD-1 in functional differentiation into Th1 and Th2 has been unclear. In murine naïve CD4+ T cell activation, we found that PD-1 stimulation during the early stage of T cell activation strongly impaired Th2 cell development, while Th1 cell induction was relatively resistant to this immunosuppressive signaling. The steep decline in Th2 cell induction suggested the significance of PD-1 in allergic inflammation. Treatment with anti-human PD-1 agonist antibody inhibited allergic inflammation in human PD-1-knock-in mice as shown by the reduction of Th2 cells, IgE levels and eosinophilic infiltration. This study shows that PD-1 regulates not only the intensity but also the quality of immune response by deviating Th differentiation. PD-1 stimulators are projected to be valuable in suppressing various forms of inflammatory activities, but the efficacy against Th2-dominant immune response may be particularly high.">

        <tr id="Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has converted HIV from a lethal disease to a chronic condition, yet co-morbidities persist. Incomplete immune recovery and chronic immune activation, especially in the gut mucosa, contribute to these complications. Inflammasomes, multi-protein complexes activated by innate immune receptors, appear to play a role in these inflammatory responses. In particular, preliminary data indicate the involvement of IFI16 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in chronic HIV infection. This study explores inflammasome function in monocytes from people with HIV (PWH); 22 ART-treated with suppressed viremia and 17 untreated PWH were compared to 33 HIV-negative donors. Monocytes were primed with LPS and inflammasomes activated with ATP in vitro. IFI16 and NLRP3 mRNA expression were examined in a subset of donors. IFI16 and NLRP3 expression in unstimulated monocytes correlated negatively with CD4 T cell counts in untreated PWH. For IFI16, there was also a positive correlation with viral load. Monocytes from untreated PWH exhibit increased release of IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF compared to treated PWH and HIV-negative donors. However, circulating monocytes in PWH are not pre-primed for inflammasome activation in vivo. The findings suggest a link between IFI16, NLRP3, and HIV progression, emphasizing their potential role in comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. The study provides insights into inflammasome regulation in HIV pathogenesis and its implications for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Viral infection is frequently assayed by ongoing expression of viral genes. These assays fail to identify cells that have been exposed to the virus but limit or inhibit viral replication. To address this limitation, we used a dual-labeling vesicular stomatitis virus (DL-VSV), which has a deletion of the viral glycoprotein gene, to allow evaluation of primary infection outcomes. This virus encodes Cre, which can stably mark any cell with even a minimal level of viral gene expression. Additionally, the virus encodes GFP, which distinguishes cells with higher levels of viral gene expression, typically due to genome replication. Stereotactic injections of DL-VSV into the murine brain showed that different cell types had very different responses to the virus. Almost all neurons hosted high levels of viral gene expression, while glial cells varied in their responses. Astrocytes (Sox9+) were predominantly productively infected, while oligodendrocytes (Sox10+) were largely abortively infected. Microglial cells (Iba1+) were primarily uninfected. Furthermore, we monitored the early innate immune response to viral infection and identified unique patterns of interferon (IFN) induction. Shortly after infection, microglia were the main producers of IFNb, whereas later, oligodendrocytes were the main producers. IFNb+ cells were primarily abortively infected regardless of cell type. Last, we investigated whether IFN signaling had any impact on the outcome of primary infection and did not observe significant changes, suggesting that intrinsic factors are likely responsible for determining the outcome of primary infection.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis and AIDS remain two of the most relevant human infectious diseases. The pathogens that cause them, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV, individually elicit an immune response that treads the line between beneficial and detrimental to the host. Co-infection further complexifies this response since the different cytokines acting on one infection might facilitate the dissemination of the other. In these responses, the role of type I interferons is often associated with antiviral mechanisms, while for bacteria such as Mtb, their importance and clinical relevance as a suitable target for manipulation are more controversial. In this article, we review the recent knowledge on how these interferons play distinct roles and sometimes have opposite consequences depending on the stage of the pathogenesis. We highlight the dichotomy between the acute and chronic infections displayed by both infections and how type I interferons contribute to an initial control of each infection individually, while their chronic induction, particularly during HIV infection, might facilitate Mtb primo-infection and progression to disease. We expect that further findings and their systematization will allow the definition of windows of opportunity for interferon manipulation according to the stage of infection, contributing to pathogen clearance and control of immunopathology.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Glioblastoma (GBM) has a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), largely mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we utilized a retroviral replicating vector (RRV) to deliver Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8), a master regulator of type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) development, in a syngeneic murine GBM model. We hypothesized that RRV-mediated delivery of IRF8 could "reprogram" intratumoral MDSCs into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby restore T-cell responses.


METHODS
Effects of RRV-IRF8 on survival and tumor growth kinetics were examined in the SB28 murine GBM model. Immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression assays. We assayed functional immunosuppression and antigen presentation by ex vivo T-cell-myeloid co-culture.


RESULTS
Intratumoral injection of RRV-IRF8 in mice bearing intracerebral SB28 glioma significantly suppressed the tumor growth and prolonged survival. RRV-IRF8 treated tumors exhibited significant enrichment of cDC1s and CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, myeloid cells derived from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed decreased expression of the immunosuppressive markers Arg1 and IDO1 and demonstrated reduced suppression of naïve T-cell proliferation in ex vivo co-culture, compared to controls. Furthermore, DCs from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed increased antigen presentation compared to those from control tumors. In vivo treatment with azidothymidine (AZT), a viral replication inhibitor, showed that IRF8 transduction in both tumor and non-tumor cells is necessary for survival benefit, associated with a reprogrammed, cDC1- and CD8 T-cell-enriched TIME.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that reprogramming of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells by in vivo expression of IRF8 may reduce immunosuppression and enhance antigen presentation, achieving improved tumor control.">

Although studies have shown olfactory and hematogenous invasion into the CNS, coinciding with neuroinflammation, little attention has been paid to susceptibility of the PNS to infection or to its contribution to CNS invasion. Here we show that sensory and autonomic neurons in the PNS are susceptible to productive infection with SARS-CoV-2 and outline physiological and molecular mechanisms mediating neuroinvasion. Our infection of K18-hACE2 mice, wild-type mice, and golden Syrian hamsters, as well as primary peripheral sensory and autonomic neuronal cultures, show viral RNA, proteins, and infectious virus in PNS neurons, satellite glial cells, and functionally connected CNS tissues. Additionally, we demonstrate, in vitro, that neuropilin-1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 neuronal entry. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly invades the PNS prior to viremia, establishes a productive infection in peripheral neurons, and results in sensory symptoms often reported by COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma IDH-wildtype is highly immune suppressive and is characterized by a strong component of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). To interfere with the immune suppressive functions of MDSCs, a comprehensive understanding on how MDSCs acquire their suppressive phenotype is essential. Previously, we and others have shown a distinct Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptor expression profile for MDSCs in glioblastoma. Siglec receptors can transmit inhibitory signals comparable to PD-1 and are suggested to act as glyco-immune checkpoints. Here, we investigated how glioma specific Siglec-sialic acid interactions influence myeloid immune suppressive functions. Co-culturing monocytes with glioblastoma cells induced CD163 expression on the monocytes. Upon desialylation of the glioblastoma cells, this induction of CD163 was hampered, and furthermore, the monocytes were now able to secrete higher amounts of IL-6 and TNFα compared to fully sialylated glioblastoma cells. Additionally, Siglec-specific triggering using anti-Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 antibodies displayed a decreased TNFα secretion by the monocytes, validating the role of the Siglec–Sialic axis in the co-culture experiments. Together, our results demonstrate that glioblastoma cells induce a myeloid immune-suppressive phenotype that could be partly rescued by lowering the glioblastoma-associated sialic acid levels. This manuscript supports further research of the Siglec–Sialic acid axis in the context of glioblastoma and its potential to improve clinical outcome.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Evidence suggests that COVID-19 predisposes to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). While monocytes/macrophages play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of atherosclerosis, less is known about their immunopathogenic mechanisms that lead to CVDs during COVID-19. Natural killer (NK) cells, which play an intermediary role during pathologies like atherosclerosis, are dysregulated during COVID-19. Here, we sought to investigate altered immune cells and their associations with CVD risk during severe COVID-19.


METHODS
We measured plasma biomarkers of CVDs and determined phenotypes of circulating immune subsets using spectral flow cytometry. We compared these between patients with severe COVID-19 (severe, n=31), those who recovered from severe COVID-19 (recovered, n=29), and SARS-CoV-2-uninfected controls (controls, n=17). In vivo observations were supported using in vitro assays to highlight possible mechanistic links between dysregulated immune subsets and biomarkers during and after COVID-19. We performed multidimensional analyses of published single-cell transcriptome data of monocytes and NK cells during severe COVID-19 to substantiate in vivo findings.


RESULTS
During severe COVID-19, we observed alterations in cardiometabolic biomarkers including oxidized-low-density lipoprotein, which showed decreased levels in severe and recovered groups. Severe patients exhibited dysregulated monocyte subsets, including increased frequencies of proinflammatory intermediate monocytes (also observed in the recovered) and decreased nonclassical monocytes. All identified NK-cell subsets in the severe COVID-19 group displayed increased expression of activation and tissue-resident markers, such as CD69. We observed significant correlations between altered immune subsets and plasma oxidized-low-density lipoprotein levels. In vitro assays revealed increased uptake of oxidized-low-density lipoprotein into monocyte-derived macrophages in the presence of NK cells activated by plasma of patients with severe COVID-19. Transcriptome analyses confirmed enriched proinflammatory responses and lipid dysregulation associated with epigenetic modifications in monocytes and NK cells during severe COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides new insights into the involvement of monocytes and NK cells in the increased CVD risk observed during and after COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Abstract The late 2019 emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, caused profound and unprecedented disruption to the global socio-economic structure, negatively affecting millions of lives worldwide. A typical hallmark of severe COVID-19 is hyper inflammation due to aberrant cytokine release (cytokine storm) by innate immune cells. Recent studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2, through its spike (S) protein, can activate the body’s innate immune cells via Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), particularly TLR4. In silico studies have demonstrated that the S protein binds with high affinity to TLR4, triggering downstream signaling processes that result in pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Compared to other TLRs, such as TLR2, TLR4 plays a more significant role in initiating and sustaining the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, interactions between the virus and target cells can enhance the cellular expression of TLR4, making cells more susceptible to viral interactions and subsequent inflammation. This increased expression of TLR4 upon viral entry creates a feedback loop, where heightened TLR4 levels lead to amplified inflammatory responses, contributing to the severity of the disease. Additionally, TLR4’s potent activation of inflammatory pathways sets it apart from other TLRs, underscoring its pivotal role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this review, we thoroughly explore the multitude of regulatory signaling pathways that SARS-CoV-2 employs to incite inflammation. We specifically focus on the critical impact of TLR4 activation compared to other TLRs, highlighting how TLR4’s interactions with the viral S protein can exacerbate the severity of COVID-19. By delving into the mechanisms of TLR4-mediated inflammation, we aim to shed light on potential therapeutic targets that could mitigate the inflammatory damage caused by severe COVID-19. Understanding the unique role of TLR4 in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection could pave the way for novel treatment strategies that specifically inhibit this receptor’s activity, thereby reducing the overall disease burden and improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The recent pandemic was caused by the emergence of a new human pathogen, SARS-CoV-2. While the rapid development of many vaccines provided an end to the immediate crisis, there remains an urgent need to understand more about this new virus and what constitutes a beneficial immune response in terms of successful resolution of infection. Indeed, this is key for development of vaccines that provide long lasting protective immunity. The interferon lambda (IFNL) family of cytokines are produced early in response to infection and are generally considered anti-viral and beneficial. However, data regarding production of IFNL cytokines in COVID-19 patients is highly variable, and generally from underpowered studies. In this study, we measured all three IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3 cytokines in plasma from a well characterised, large COVID-19 cohort (n=399) that included good representation from patients with a more indolent disease progression, and hence a beneficial immune response. While all three cytokines were produced, they differed in both the frequency of expression in patients, and the levels produced. IFNL3 was produced in almost all patients but neither protein level nor IFNL3/IFNL4 SNPs were associated with clinical outcome. In contrast, both IFNL1 and IFNL2 levels were significantly lower, or absent, in plasma of patients that had a more severe disease outcome. These data are consistent with the concept that early IFNL1 and IFNL2 cytokine production is protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Many COVID-19 patients suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms and impaired intestinal barrier function is thought to play a key role in Long COVID. Despite its importance, the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on intestinal epithelia is poorly understood. To address this, we established an intestinal barrier model integrating epithelial Caco-2 cells, mucus-secreting HT29 cells and Raji cells. This gut epithelial model allows efficient differentiation of Caco-2 cells into microfold-like cells, faithfully mimics intestinal barrier function, and is highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early strains of SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta variant replicated with high efficiency, severely disrupted barrier function, and depleted tight junction proteins, such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1. In comparison, Omicron subvariants also depleted ZO-1 from tight junctions but had fewer damaging effects on mucosal integrity and barrier function. Remdesivir, the fusion inhibitor EK1 and the transmembrane serine protease 2 inhibitor Camostat inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication and thus epithelial barrier damage, while the Cathepsin inhibitor E64d was ineffective. Our results support that SARS-CoV-2 disrupts intestinal barrier function but further suggest that circulating Omicron variants are less damaging than earlier viral strains.">

        <tr id="Innate inflammation promotes tumor development, although the role of innate inflammatory cytokines in established human tumors is unclear. Here we report clinical and translational results from a phase Ib trial testing whether IL-1β blockade in human pancreatic cancer would alleviate myeloid immunosuppression and reveal antitumor T-cell responses to PD-1 blockade. Patients with treatment-naïve advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n=10) were treated with canakinumab, a high-affinity monoclonal human anti-interleukin-1β (IL-1β), the PD-1 blocking antibody spartalizumab, and gemcitabine/n(ab)paclitaxel. Analysis of paired peripheral blood from patients in the trial versus patients receiving multiagent chemotherapy showed a modest increase in HLA-DR+CD38+ activated CD8+ T cells and a decrease in circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) by flow cytometry for patients in the trial, but not in controls. Similarly, we used patient serum to differentiate monocytic MDSCs in vitro and showed that functional inhibition of T-cell proliferation was reduced when using on-treatment serum samples from patients in the trial but not when using serum from patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Within the tumor we observed few changes in suppressive myeloid-cell populations or activated T cells as assessed by single-cell transcriptional profiling or multiplex immunofluorescence, although increases in CD8+ T cells suggest that improvements in the tumor immune microenvironment might be revealed by a larger study. Overall, the data indicate that exposure to PD-1 and IL-1β blockade induced a modest reactivation of peripheral CD8+ T cells and decreased circulating monocytic MDSCs; however, these changes did not lead to similarly uniform alterations in the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Solid gastrointestinal tumors often respond poorly to immunotherapy for the complex tumor microenvironment (TME), which is exacerbated by immune system alterations. Immunosenescence is the process of increased diversification of immune genes due to aging and other factors, leading to a decrease in the recognition function of the immune system. This process involves immune organs, immune cells, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The most fundamental change is DNA damage, resulting in TME remodeling. The main manifestations are worsening inflammation, increased immunosuppressive SASP production, decreased immune cell antitumor activity, and the accumulation of tumor-associated fibroblasts and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, making antitumor therapy less effective. Senotherapy strategies to remove senescent cells and block key senescence processes can have synergistic effects with other treatments. This review focuses on immunoenescence and its impact on the solid TME. We characterize the immunosenescent TME and discuss future directions for antitumor therapies targeting senescence.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against β-coronaviruses (β-CoVs), a family of viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2. Viral sensing via pattern recognition receptors triggers inflammation and cell death, which are essential components of the innate immune response that facilitate viral clearance. However, excessive activation of the innate immune system and inflammatory cell death can result in uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in cytokine storm and pathology. PANoptosis, innate immune, inflammatory cell death initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes, has been implicated in the pathology of viral infections. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PANoptosis in response to β-CoV infection is critical for identifying new therapeutic targets that can mitigate disease severity. In the current study, we analyzed findings from a cell death-based CRISPR screen with archetypal β-CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as the trigger to characterize host molecules required for inflammatory cell death. As a result, we identified SMARCA4, a chromatin regulator, as a putative host factor required for PANoptosis in response to MHV. Furthermore, we observed that gRNA-mediated deletion of Smarca4 inhibited MHV-induced PANoptotic cell death in macrophages. These findings have potential translational and clinical implications for the advancement of treatment strategies for β-CoVs and other infections.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, is a promising treatment modality in oncology that involves augmenting the tumor-attacking capabilities of the immune system. Several preclinical and clinical studies have underscored the transformative potential of ICBs in the context of malignancies. 1 However, the efficacy of ICB therapy is often impeded by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in solid tumors, which are commonly due to a paucity of tumor neoantigens, checkpoint targets, and the inflammatory presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is profoundly immunosuppressive, which is the key reason for the limited clinical efficacy of ICB therapy. Within this milieu, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant myeloid cell subset, and their high infiltration levels have been implicated in mediating resistance to ICB therapy, thereby correlating with adverse prognosis across a spectrum of cancers. 3 Recent advances reported in Nature Cancer have shed light on specific TAM subpopulations that are instrumental in facilitating tumor immune evasion and resistance to ICB therapy.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. The role of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in pediatric COVID-19 patients remains unclear.


METHODS
We isolated EVs from healthy controls (n = 13) and pediatric COVID-19 patients (n = 104) with varying severity during acute and convalescent phases using serial ultracentrifugation. EV effects on healthy PBMCs, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocytes were assessed through in vitro assays, flow cytometry, and ELISA.


RESULTS
Our findings indicate that COVID-19 severity correlates with diverse immune responses. Severe acute cases exhibited increased cytokine levels, decreased IFNγ levels, and lower CD4+ T cell and monocyte counts, suggesting immunosuppression. EVs from severe acute patients stimulated healthy cells to express higher PDL1, increased Th2 and Treg cells, reduced IFNγ secretion, and altered Th1/Th17 ratios. Patient-derived EVs significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (p < .001 for mild, p = .0025 for severe cases) and decreased CD4+ T cell (p = .043) and monocyte (p = .033) populations in stimulated healthy PBMCs.


CONCLUSION
This study reveals the complex relationship between immunological responses and EV-mediated effects, emphasizing the impact of COVID-19 severity. We highlight the potential role of plasma-derived EVs in early-stage immunosuppression in severe COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The PD-1-PD-L1 immune checkpoint helps to maintain self-tolerance and prevent the development of autoimmune diseases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are successful immunotherapeutics for several cancers, but responding patients can develop immune-mediated adverse events. It is well established that PD-1 regulates CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, but its role in controlling the activation of pathogenic γδ T cells is less clear. Here we examined the role of PD-1 in regulating γδ T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. We found that PD-1 was highly expressed on CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells in the lymph node (LN) and CNS of mice with EAE. Treatment of mice with anti-PD-1 significantly augmented IL-17A-producing CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells in the LN and CNS and enhanced the severity of EAE. The exacerbating effect of anti-PD-1 on EAE was lost in Tcrd-/- mice. Conversely, ligation of PD-1 suppressed Il17a and Rorc gene expression and IL-17A production by purified Vγ4 γδ T cells stimulated via the TCR, but not with IL-1β and IL-23. Our study demonstrates that PD-1 regulates TCR-activated CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells, but that cytokine-activated IL-17A producing γδ T cells escape the regulatory effects of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Melioidosis is a tropical infection caused by the intracellular pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, an underreported and emerging global threat. As melioidosis-associated mortality is frequently high despite antibiotics, novel management strategies are critically needed. Therefore, we sought to determine whether functional changes in the host innate and adaptive immune responses are induced during acute melioidosis and are associated with outcome. Using a unique whole blood stimulation assay developed for use in resource-limited settings, we examined induced cellular functional and phenotypic changes in a cohort of patients with bacteremic melioidosis prospectively enrolled within 24 h of positive blood culture and followed for 28 days. Compared to healthy controls, melioidosis survivors generated an IL-17 response mediated by Th17 cells and terminally-differentiated effector memory CD8+ T cells (P < .05, both), persisting to 28 days after enrolment. Furthermore, melioidosis survivors developed polyfunctional cytokine production in CD8+ T cells (P < .01). Conversely, a reduction in CCR6+ CD4+ T cells was associated with higher mortality, even after adjustments for severity of illness (P = 0.004). Acute melioidosis was also associated with a profound acute impairment in monocyte function as stimulated cytokine responses were reduced in classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes. Impaired monocyte cytokine function improved by 28-days after enrolment. These data suggest that IL-17 mediated cellular responses may be contributors to host defense during acute melioidosis, and that innate immune function may be impaired. These insights could provide novel targets for the development of therapies and vaccine targets in this frequently lethal disease.">

        <tr id="Since late 2019, the world has been devastated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with more than 760 million people affected and ∼seven million deaths reported. Although effective treatments for COVID-19 are currently limited, there has been a strong focus on developing new therapeutic approaches to address the morbidity and mortality linked to this disease. An approach that is currently being investigated is the use of exosome-based therapies. Exosomes are small, extracellular vesicles that play a role in many clinical diseases, including viral infections, infected cells release exosomes that can transmit viral components, such as miRNAs and proteins, and can also include receptors for viruses that facilitate viral entry into recipient cells. SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to impact the formation, secretion, and release of exosomes, thereby potentially facilitating or intensifying the transmission of the virus among cells, tissues and individuals. Therefore, designing synthetic exosomes that carry immunomodulatory cargo and antiviral compounds are proposed to be a promising strategy for the treatment of COVID-19 and other viral diseases. Moreover, exosomes generated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) might be employed as cell-free therapeutic agents, as MSC-derived exosomes can diminish the cytokine storm and reverse the suppression of host anti-viral defences associated with COVID-19, and boost the repair of lung damage linked to mitochondrial activity. The present article discusses the significance and roles of exosomes in COVID-19, and explores potential future applications of exosomes in combating this disease. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, exosome-based therapies could represent a promising avenue for improving patient outcomes and reducing the impact of this disease.">

        <tr id="Antigen presentation is a crucial mechanism that drives the T cell-mediated immune response and the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Genetic alterations within the highly variable Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II (MHC II) have been proven to result in significant changes in the molecular basis of antigen presentation and the clinical course of patients with both Adult-Onset MS (AOMS) and Pediatric-Onset MS (POMS). Among the numerous polymorphisms of the Human Leucocyte Antigens (HLA), within MHC II complex, HLA-DRB1*15:01 has been labeled, in Caucasian ethnic groups, as a high-risk allele for MS due to the ability of its structure to increase affinity to Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) epitopes. This characteristic, among others, in the context of the trimolecular complex or immunological synapsis, provides the foundation for autoimmunity triggered by environmental or endogenous factors. As with all professional antigen presenting cells, macrophages are characterized by the expression of MHC II and are often implicated in the formation of MS lesions. Increased presence of M1 macrophages in MS patients has been associated both with progression and onset of the disease, each involving separate but similar mechanisms. In this critical narrative review, we focus on macrophages, discussing how HLA genetic alterations can promote dysregulation of this population’s homeostasis in the periphery and the Central Nervous System (CNS). We also explore the potential interconnection in observed pathological macrophage mechanisms and the function of the diverse structure of HLA alleles in neurodegenerative CNS, seen in MS, by comparing available clinical with molecular data through the prism of HLA-immunogenetics. Finally, we discuss available and experimental pharmacological approaches for MS targeting the trimolecular complex that are based on cell phenotype modulation and HLA genotype involvement and try to reveal fertile ground for the potential development of novel drugs.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes are mediators of homeostasis but contribute to neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mounting evidence suggests involvement of peripheral immune cells in PD pathogenesis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the potential role of peripheral immune secreted cytokines in modulating midbrain astrocyte reactivity. Human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes were exposed to 5% and 10% CD4+ T cell conditioned media (CD4CM) for 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days to assess chronic exposure. Additionally, astrocytes were exposed to the Th17 cell cytokine, IL-17A (10 ng/mL), alone and in combination with TNF-α (0.3 ng/mL) to assess potential synergistic effects of both cytokines at 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days. CD4CM induced acute and chronic alterations in midbrain astrocytes. Increased NFκB translocation to the nucleus, increased expression of the pro-inflammatory genes, IL-1β, CXCL10 at 24 h, C3, LCN2, IL-6 at 24 and 48 h, as well as an increase in their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CXCL10 at both these time points were observed. A synergistic response to the combination of IL-17A and TNF-α on increasing inflammatory gene expression and cytokine release occurred. IL-17A and TNF-α increased intensity of S100β at 24 h, decreased nuclear area and increased circularity of astrocytes at 72 h. A synergistic effect on γH2AX intensity at 72 h and an increase in LDH release at 7 days was observed. Our results demonstrate that IL-17A and TNF-α act synergistically, enhancing midbrain astrocyte reactivity to a similar degree as CD4CM. This highlights the importance of the peripheral immune secreted cytokines in increasing the reactivity status of midbrain astrocytes, implicating their role in PD.">

        <tr id="The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in sepsis is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. However, the molecular pathogenesis underlying sepsis-induced ARDS remains elusive. Neutrophil heterogeneity and dysfunction contribute to uncontrolled inflammation in patients with ARDS. A specific subset of neutrophils undergoing reverse transendothelial migration (rTEM), which is characterized by an activated phenotype, is implicated in the systemic dissemination of inflammation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it identified functionally activated neutrophils exhibiting the rTEM phenotype in the lung of a sepsis mouse model using cecal ligation and puncture. The prevalence of neutrophils with the rTEM phenotype is elevated in the blood of patients with sepsis-associated ARDS and is positively correlated with disease severity. Mechanically, scRNA-seq and proteomic analys revealed that inflamed endothelial cell (EC) released extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched in karyopherin subunit beta-1 (KPNB1), promoting abluminal-to-luminal neutrophil rTEM. Additionally, EC-derived EVs are elevated and positively correlated with the proportion of rTEM neutrophils in clinical sepsis. Collectively, EC-derived EV is identified as a critical regulator of neutrophil rTEM, providing insights into the contribution of rTEM neutrophils to sepsis-associated lung injury.">

While the crucial role of macrophages and cytokines, like TNF-α and IFN-γ, in managing the host’s immune response to M. tb is examined, the emphasis is on the changes that occur as a result of HIV coinfection. With the progression of HIV infection, the primary source of IFN-γ changes from CD4+ to CD8+ T cells, especially when latent TB advances to an active state. This study sheds light on the necessity of developing new preventative measures such as vaccines and new treatment approaches to TB, especially for immunocompromised patients, who are at a higher risk of life-threatening complications due to TB-HIV coinfection.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a complex condition of inflammatory and immune dysregulation, triggered by severe infection. In survivors, chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation linger, facilitating the emergence of infections. CD8 dysfunction contributes to immunosuppression in sepsis survivors. We devised an animal model that enabled us to identify and analyze CD8-intrinsic defects induced by sepsis. We adoptively transferred CD45.1 CD8 OT-I T cells into CD45.2 congenic mice and subjected them to cecal ligature and puncture, to induce abdominal sepsis. One month later, we isolated the transferred CD8 cells. Surface marker expression confirmed they had not been activated through the TCR. CD8 OT-I T cells isolated from septic (or sham-operated) mice were transferred to second recipients, which were challenged with OVA-expressing Listeria monocytogenes. We compared effector capacities between OT-I cells exposed to sepsis and control cells. Naive mice that received OT-I cells exposed to sepsis had higher bacterial burden and a shorter survival when challenged with OVA-expressing L. monocytogenes. OT-I cells isolated from septic mice produced less IFN-γ but had conserved activation, expansion potential, and cytotoxic function. We observed lower transcript levels of IFN-γ and of the long noncoding RNA Ifng-as1, a local regulator of the epigenetic landscape, in cells exposed to sepsis. Accordingly, local abundance of a histone modification characteristic of active promoter regions was reduced in sepsis-exposed CD8 T cells. Our results identify a mechanism through which inflammation in the context of sepsis affects CD8 T cell function intrinsically.">

The ability of vertebrate T and B lymphocytes to exhibit classic recall responses has long been regarded as a distinguishing characteristic. However, natural killer (NK) cells have been found to acquire immunological memory in a manner akin to T and B cells. The fundamental principles derived from the investigation of NK cell memory offer novel insights into innate immunity and have the potential to pave the way for innovative strategies to enhance therapeutic interventions against multiple diseases including cancer. Here, we reviewed the fundamental characteristics, memory development and regulatory mechanism of NK cell memory. Moreover, we will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the accomplishments, obstacles, and future direction pertaining to the utilization of NK cell memory in the field of cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Foxp3+ Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a subset of CD4+ T cells that play critical functions in maintaining tolerance to self antigens and suppressing autoimmunity, regulating immune responses to pathogens and have a role in the pathophysiology of anti-tumoural immunity. Treg ontogeny is complex since they are generated following recognition of self antigens in the thymus during normal T cell development (thymic Treg), but are also induced from mature conventional T cells when activated by foreign antigen with appropriate additional cues (inducible Treg). How these distinct ontogenic pathways contribute to the maintenance and function of the mature Treg compartment in health and disease remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of fate mapping approaches in mice to map the ontogeny of Treg subsets throughout life and estimate rates of production, loss and self-renewal. We find that naive and effector/memory (EM) Treg subsets exhibit distinct dynamics but are both continuously replenished by de novo generation throughout life. Using an inducible Foxp3-dependent Cre fate reporter system, we show that naive Treg and not conventional T cells, are the predominant precursors of EM Treg in adults. Tonic development of new EM Treg is not influenced by foreign antigens from commensals, rather suggesting a role for self recognition. To investigate the ontogeny of Treg development in malignant disease, we used the same fate reporter systems to characterise the Treg infiltrate of three different model tumours. In all three cases, we found that Treg derived from pre-existing, EM Treg. Together, these results reveal a predominantly linear pathway of Treg development from thymic origin to EM Treg associated with pathophysiology of malignant disease, that is driven by self antigen recognition throughout.">

        <tr id="Inflammation is a key factor in both influenza and radiation-induced lung pathophysiology. This implies a commonality of response to pulmonary damage from these insults and suggests exacerbated pathology may occur after combined exposure. We therefore tested the hypothesis that past inflammation from viral infection alters the lung microenvironment and lowers tolerance for radiation injury. Mice were inoculated with influenza A virus (IAV) and three weeks later, after virus clearance, mice received total-body irradiation (TBI). Survival as well as systemic and local lung inflammation were assessed, and strategies to mitigate pulmonary injury were investigated. After IAV infection alone, body condition recovered within 3 weeks, however inflammatory pathways remained active for 15 weeks. IAV infection exacerbated subsequent TBI responses, evident by increased lethality, enhanced histologically evident lung injury and an altered lung macrophage phenotype. To mitigate this enhanced sensitivity, captopril [an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)] was administered to limit tissue inflammation, or inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophage recruitment was blocked with a C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) inhibitor. Both treatments abrogated the changes in circulating immune cells observed 4 weeks after TBI, and attenuated pro-inflammatory phenotypes in lung alveolar macrophages, appearing to shift immune cell dynamics towards recovery. Histologically apparent lung injury was not improved by either treatment. We show that latent lung injury from viral infection exacerbates radiation morbidity and mortality. Although strategies that attenuate proinflammatory immune cell phenotypes can normalize macrophage dynamics, this does not fully mitigate lung injury. Recognizing that past viral infections can enhance lung radiosensitivity is of critical importance for patients receiving TBI, as it could increase the incidence of adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="The re-emergence of the Mpox (formerly monkeypox) in 2022 in non-endemic countries has raised many concerns for global health due to its high transmissibility and mortality rate. A major challenge in fighting Mpox is its ability to evade the host's innate immune system, which is the first line of defense against viral infections. Mpox encodes various proteins that interfere with key antiviral pathways and mechanisms, such as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, cytokine production, complement and inflammasome activation, and chemokine binding. These proteins modulate the expression and function of innate immune mediators, such as interferons, interleukins, and toll-like receptors, and impair the recruitment and activation of innate immune cells, such as natural killer cells. By suppressing or altering these innate immune responses, Mpox enhances its replication and infection in the host tissues and organs, leading to systemic inflammation, tissue damage, and organ failure. This study reveals new insights into the molecular and cellular interactions between Mpox and the host's innate immunity and identifies potential targets and strategies for antiviral interventions.">

        <tr id="Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains an important global public health problem. About 40 million people are infected with HIV, and this infection caused about 630,000 deaths in 2022. The hallmark of HIV infection is the depletion of CD4+ T helper lymphocytes (Th cells). There are at least seven different Th subtypes, and not all are the main targets of HIV. Moreover, the effect of the virus in a specific subtype can be completely different from that of the others. Although the most compromised Th subtype in HIV infection is Th17, HIV can induce important dysregulations in other subtypes, such as follicular Th (Tfh) cells and regulatory Th cells (Treg cells or Tregs). Several studies have shown that HIV can induce an increase in the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs without causing a significant reduction in their numbers, at least in the early phase of infection. The increased activity of this Th subtype seems to play an important role in determining the immunodeficiency status of HIV-infected patients, and Tregs may represent a new target for innovative anti-HIV therapies, including the so-called “Kick and Kill” therapeutic method whose goal is the complete elimination of the virus and the healing of HIV infection. In this review, we report the most important findings on the effects of HIV on different CD4+ T cell subtypes, the molecular mechanisms by which the virus impairs the functions of these cells, and the implications for new anti-HIV therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor microenvironment (TME) represents the key factor inducing leukemia development. As stromal cells within the leukemia microenvironment, Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BM-MSCs) can trigger leukemia progression under certain conditions. As a critical transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid related factor 2 (Nrf2) can modulate antioxidant response and antioxidant enzyme gene expression, and prevent various oxidative changes. We previously identified a novel mechanism by which Nrf2 promotes leukemia resistance, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of drug-resistant/refractory leukemias. However, the role of Nrf2 in BM-MSCs from B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients has not been clearly reported. The present work focused on investigating the effect of Nrf2 overexpression within MSCs on leukemia cell invasion, extramedullary infiltration and proliferation as well as its downstream pathway. Methods Through clinical sample detection, in vitro cell experiments and in vivo animal experiments, the role of Nrf2 within MSCs within adult B-ALL cell migration and invasion and its potential molecular mechanism was explored through transcriptome sequencing analysis, RT-PCR, Western blot, cell migration, cell invasion, lentivirus transfection and other experiments. Results Nrf2 was highly expressed in BM-MSCs from patients with B-ALL as well as in BM-MSCs co-cultured with leukemia cells. Overexpression of Nrf2 within MSCs significantly promoted leukemia cell migration, invasion and proliferation. The extramedullary organ infiltration rate in B-ALL model mice receiving the combined infusion of both cell types dramatically increased relative to that of leukemia cells alone, accompanied by the significantly shortened survival time. Mechanism study found that Nrf2 overexpression within MSCs promoted PI3K-AKT/ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the downstream pathway by activating SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, ultimately leading to extramedullary infiltration of leukemia cells. Conclusion High Nrf2 expression with in MSCs enhances leukemia cell invasion and migration, which then accelerates infiltration in leukemic extramedullary organs. Targeting Nrf2 or inhibiting its downstream signal molecules may be the effective interventions for B-ALL patients treatment.">

        <tr id="The skin, as the first physical barrier for invading pathogens, also serves as an immunologically active organ. Breaching the skin barrier is thus essential for pathogens to enter the body. The skin contains various immune responsive cells that initiate both the innate and adaptive immune response upon invasion. Activated immune cells help to regulate cytokine response and their differentiation to promote or suppress the crucial immune response against invading pathogens. Human herpes simplex viruses (HHSVs) are the oldest pathogen that can escape immune surveillance of the human host by a well-developed escape mechanism within ganglia, as their evolutionary strategy. In primary infection, a non-specific defense of the host initiates the response against the invading virion. The initial direct antiviral action of the host is regulated by activated macrophages, via the release of cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and type-1 interferon (IFN-1). The host-derived cytokines including IFN-12, TNF, and IFN-1 in turn induce natural killer (NK) cells to release IFN-γ. Their positive feedback with synergistic interactions collectively releases nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) against the invading virus. Simultaneously, the combination of cytokines, macrophages, and other cells activates the immune system to eliminate the pathogen. However, the virus has also evolved various mechanisms to counter the host defense strategies. This review will highlight virus-mediated skin infections, especially by HSV, and portray a detailed role of virus-induced cytokines in host-immunity to challenge the invading virion during mucocutaneous HSV infection. Further, this review will discuss the viral-interference on host defense to provide a simplistic overview of the complications of cutaneous HSV infection.">

This was revealed both by detailed analysis of their phenotypical features and gene expression profile and by functional explorations comparing capacity of purified B cells and PCs to suppress T cell proliferation and IFN{gamma} secretion ex vivo. Sepsis-induced regulatory PCs exerted their suppressive function on T cells through IL-10 production and increased PD-L1 expression independently of regulatory T cells.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from patients with SIA (n = 16) or MIAs (n = 6) were analyzed using high-dimensional mass cytometry to evaluate the frequency and phenotype of immune cell subtypes. A total of 25 cell clusters were identified, revealing that the immune signature of MIAs included cluster changes.

They also had reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells and their subgroups CD8+ Te and CD8+ Tem cells, as well as reduced numbers of the CD4+ T-cell subgroup CD27-CD4+ Tem cells. Furthermore, compared to SIA, MIAs were associated with enhanced T-cell immune activation, with elevated expression levels of CD3, CD25, CD27, CCR7, GP130, and interleukin 10. This study provides insights into the circulating immune cell profiles in patients with MIAs, highlighting the similarities and differences between patients with SIA and those with MIAs.

Interferons (IFNs) represent a first-line defense against viruses and other pathogens. It has been shown that an impaired and uncontrolled release of these glycoproteins can result in tissue damage and explain severe progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, their potential role in Long-COVID syndrome (LC) remains debateable.


OBJECTIVES
The objective of the present study is to shed further light on the possible role of IFNs (and related genes) gene expression patterns in the progression of COVID-19 and LC patients.


METHODS
We carried out a multi-cohort study by analyzing the IFN gene expression patterns (using different IFN gene signatures) in five cohorts of acute COVID-19 (n = 541 samples) and LC patients (n = 188), and compared them to patterns observed in three autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematous [n = 242], systemic sclerosis [n = 91], and Sjögren's syndrome [n = 282]).


RESULTS
The data show that, while the interferon signatures are strongly upregulated in severe COVID-19 patients and autoimmune diseases, it decays with the time from symptoms onset and in LC patients. Differential pathway analysis of IFN-related terms indicates an over activation in autoimmune diseases (IFN-I/II) and severe COVID-19 (IFN-I/II/III), while these pathways are mostly inactivated or downregulated in LC (IFN-I/III). By analyzing six proteomic LC datasets, we did not find evidence of a role of IFNs in this condition.


CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest a potential role of cytokine exhaustion mediated by IFN gene expression inactivation as a possible driver of LC.">

        <tr id="Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer. CRC has no apparent symptoms in the early stages of disease, and most patients receive a confirmed diagnosis in the middle or late disease stages. The incidence of CRC continues to increase, and the affected population tends to be younger. Therefore, determining how to achieve an early CRC diagnosis and treatment has become a top priority for prolonging patient survival. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a group of bone marrow-derived immuno-negative regulatory cells that are divided into two subpopulations, polymorphonuclear-MDSCs and monocytic-MDSCs, based on their phenotypic similarities to neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. These cells can inhibit the immune response and promote cancer cell metastasis in the tumour microenvironment (TME). A large aggregation of MDSCs in the TME is often a marker of cancer and a poor prognosis in inflammatory diseases of the intestine (such as colonic adenoma and ulcerative colitis). In the present review, the phenotypic classification of MDSCs in the CRC microenvironment are first discussed. Then, the amplification, role and metastatic mechanism of MDSCs in the CRC TME are described, focusing on genes, gene modifications, proteins and the intestinal micro-environment. Finally, the progress in CRC-targeted therapies that aim to modulate the quantity, function and structure of MDSCs are summarized in the hope of identifying potential screening markers for CRC and improving CRC prognosis and therapeutic options.">

Noteworthy, type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) have been recently acknowledged as an important class of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the context of host–microorganism interactions shaping the adaptive immune response in the intestinal mucosa. Although a broad range of mouse models has led to significant progress in untangling the role of ILC3s as APCs, the outcome of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent ILC-T cell crosstalk in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains underexplored in human. Moreover, expression of MHCII is confined to ILC3 subset, endowed with lymphoid tissue-inducing properties, that adopts tissue-specific fates and functions. Intestinal microbiota could dictate the plasticity of antigen-presenting ILC3s and we here summarize our current understanding of the functions of these cells in both mouse and human CRC discussing the role of microbiota as a key modulator of their tumor-suppressive activity.">

Apart from other organs, presence of specific receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) and corresponding proteases such as transmembrane serine protease 2, basigin and cysteine protease cathepsin L make follicular somatic cells as well as oocyte as potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The SARS-CoV-2 causes inflammation and hypoxia that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in critically ill patients. In addition, a large number of casualties and insecurity of life due to repeated waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection generate psychological stress and cortisol resulting in the further generation of ROS. The excess levels of ROS under physiological range cause meiotic instability, while high levels result in oxidative stress that trigger various death pathways and affect number as well as quality of follicular oocytes. Although, emerging evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 utilises cellular machinery of ovarian follicular cells, generates ROS and impairs quality of follicular oocytes, the underlying mechanism of viral entry into host cell and its negative impact on the follicular oocyte remains poorly understood. Therefore, this review summarises emerging evidence on the presence of cellular machinery for SARS-CoV-2 in ovarian follicles and the potential negative impact of viral infection on the follicular oocytes that affect ovarian functions in critically ill and stressed women.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is a major global health concern, particularly affecting those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly. CD4+ T cell response is crucial for immunity against M.tb, but chronic infections and aging can lead to T cell exhaustion and senescence, worsening TB disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction, prevalent in aging and chronic diseases, disrupts cellular metabolism, increases oxidative stress, and impairs T-cell functions. This study investigates the effect of mitochondrial transplantation (mito-transfer) on CD4+ T cell differentiation and function in aged mouse models and human CD4+ T cells from elderly individuals. Mito-transfer in naïve CD4+ T cells is found to promote protective effector and memory T cell generation during M.tb infection in mice. Additionally, it improves elderly human T cell function by increasing mitochondrial mass and altering cytokine production, thereby reducing markers of exhaustion and senescence. These findings suggest mito-transfer as a novel approach to enhance aged CD4+ T cell functionality, potentially benefiting immune responses in the elderly and chronic TB patients. This has broader implications for diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to T-cell exhaustion and senescence.">

Tumor-associated macrophages are one of the main immune cell types in the TME and their increased density is related to poor prognosis in prostate cancer. Here, we investigated the influence of pro-inflammatory (M1) and immunosuppressive (M2) macrophages on prostate cancer lineage plasticity. Our findings reveal that M1 macrophage secreted factors upregulate genes related to stemness while downregulating genes associated with androgen response in prostate cancer cells. The expression of cancer stem cell (CSC) plasticity markers NANOG, KLF4, SOX2, OCT4, and CD44 was stimulated by the secreted factors from M1 macrophages. Moreover, AR and its target gene PSA were observed to be suppressed in LNCaP cells treated with secreted factors from M1 macrophages. Inhibition of NFκB signaling using the IKK16 inhibitor resulted in downregulation of NANOG, SOX2, and CD44 and CSC plasticity. Our study highlights that the secreted factors from M1 macrophages drive prostate cancer cell plasticity by upregulating the expression of CSC plasticity markers through NFκB signaling pathway.">

        <tr id="Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are a group of diseases in humans that typically present as increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmunity, hyperinflammation, allergy, and in some cases malignancy. Among newly identified genes linked to IEIs include 3 independent reports of 9 individuals from 7 independent kindreds with severe primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) and autoimmunity due to loss-of-function mutations in the NCKAP1L gene encoding Hematopoietic protein 1 (HEM1). HEM1 is a hematopoietic cell specific component of the WASp family verprolin homologous (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), which acts downstream of multiple immune receptors to stimulate actin nucleation and polymerization of filamentous actin (F-actin). The polymerization and branching of F-actin is critical for creating force-generating cytoskeletal structures which drive most active cellular processes including migration, adhesion, immune synapse formation, and phagocytosis. Branched actin networks at the cell cortex have also been implicated in acting as a barrier to regulate inappropriate vesicle (e.g. cytokine) secretion and spontaneous antigen receptor crosslinking. Given the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in most or all hematopoietic cells, it is not surprising that HEM1 deficient children present with a complex clinical picture that involves overlapping features of immunodeficiency and autoimmunity. In this review, we will provide an overview of what is known about the molecular and cellular functions of HEM1 and the WRC in immune and other cells. We will describe the common clinicopathological features and immunophenotypes of HEM1 deficiency in humans and provide detailed comparative descriptions of what has been learned about Hem1 disruption using constitutive and immune cell-specific mouse knockout models. Finally, we discuss future perspectives and important areas for investigation regarding HEM1 and the WRC.">

In non-responders, tumors show evidence of increased tumor proliferation, neuronal stem cell markers, and IL-1. Responders have increased type I/II interferons and pre-existing tissue resident (Trm) CD8 or Vd1 gd T cells that functionally converge with overlapping antigen-specific transcriptional programs and clonal expansion of public TCRs. Spatial transcriptomics demonstrated co-localization of T cells with B and dendritic cells, which supply chemokines and co-stimulation.

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) possess unique immunosuppressive activity among CD4-positive T cells. Tregs are ubiquitously present in mammals and function to calm excessive immune responses, thereby suppressing allergies or autoimmune diseases.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a multicellular system composed of many cell types, including tumor cells, infiltrating immune cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Within this environment, Tregs are recruited by chemokines and metabolic factors and impede effective anti-tumor responses. However, in some cases, their presence can also improve patient’s survival rates. Their functional consequences may vary across tumor types, locations, and stages. An in-depth understanding of the precise roles and mechanisms of actions of Treg is crucial for developing effective treatments, emphasizing the need for further investigation and validation. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the complex and multifaceted roles of Tregs within the TME, elucidating cellular communications, signaling pathways, and their impacts on tumor progression and highlighting their potential anti-tumor mechanisms through interactions with functional molecules.">

 Seasonal flu, primarily caused by influenza H1N1 and H3N2 subtype viruses or influenza B viruses, is the most prevalent respiratory tract infection globally and leads to substantial morbidity and mortality annually. Despite the influenza virus being initially recognized as a respiratory pathogen with well-characterized transmission through respiratory droplets, its impact on ocular epithelium and associated gene expression remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional profiles of immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-S) and A549 human lung epithelial cells infected with H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus. In comparison with A549 cells, a reduced number of differentially expressed genes was observed in HCE-S upon influenza virus infection. Specifically, there was a significant upregulation of the genes IFI44L and OAS1, along with lower release of CCL5/RANTES protein. Notably, our findings revealed uniquely upregulated LGALS9 (encoding galectin-9) in HCE-S following infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Furthermore, targeted knockdown of LGALS9 in these cells resulted in a measurable decrease in viral infection, highlighting its role in the cellular responses to influenza virus and suggesting a novel avenue for antiviral therapy. Overall, our findings provide insight into the distinct mechanisms of influenza virus interactions with different epithelial cells and underscore the importance of studying the ocular surface in understanding influenza pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists induce inflammatory responses that promote the killing of infectious micro-organisms, cancer cells and develop adaptive immune responses. Their ability as immunomodulators to enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) in treating liver tumors is limited in part by the distinctive biology of intrahepatic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and challenges with tumor-specific therapeutic delivery. We have shown that the regional delivery of type C TLR9 agonist via pressure-enabled drug delivery (PEDD) system improves delivery to the tumor, enhances depletion of MDSCs and overall, stimulates the immune system in combination with or without CPI. Currently, CPIs are delivered intravenously, although there is a growing interest in its subcutaneous (SQ) administration. We compared nelitolimod formerly known as SD-101 administered using PEDD in combination with systemic (Sys) or SQ CPI in murine liver metastases (LM).


METHODS
The LM model was developed by injecting MC38-Luc cells via the spleen of 8-12 week old male C57/BL6 mice followed by splenectomy. After a week, fluorescently labeled nelitolimod (10 µg/mouse) was delivered via PEDD and co-administered anti-programmed cell death-1 (α-PD-1) either via Sys or SQ. Tumor burden was monitored by in vivo imaging system. Serum cytokine levels were analyzed by Luminex. Tissues were harvested on Day 3 (D3) or Day 10 (D10) post-PEDD to enrich CD45+ cells and were analyzed via NanoString targeted transcriptomics (D3) or flow cytometry (FC, D10) to interrogate immune cell populations (D10). For NanoString analysis, the innate immune panels were selected, and for FC, MDSCs (CD11b+Gr1+), B cells (B220+), dendritic cells (DC, CD11c+), T (CD3+) cells, and M1-like macrophages (F4/80+CD38+Egr2-) were quantified.


RESULTS
Nelitolimod delivered via PEDD resulted in changes in innate and adaptive immune cells within LM, including depletion of liver MDSC and increased M1-like macrophages in the liver, which are supportive of antitumor immunity. While CPI monotherapy failed to control tumor progression, nelitolimod and CPI combination improved LM control, survival and antitumor immunity beyond the nelitolimod monotherapy effect, irrespective of CPI delivery route.


CONCLUSION
The SQ route of CPI delivery was equivalent to Sys in combination with nelitolimod, suggesting SQ-CPI may be a rational choice in combination with PEDD of nelitolimod for liver tumor treatment.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare type of T-lymphocyte malignancy strongly calling for novel therapies. Virotherapy by means of oncolytic viruses that are able to kill cancer cells, while sparing healthy cells, is a promising innovative form of anticancer immunotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of an oncolytic parvovirus, H-1PV, to induce selective killing (oncolysis) of CTCL cells and suppress the growth of CTCL spheroids. We demonstrated that H-1PV treatment led to oncolysis in tumor, but not in control normal cells. Oncolysis ensued despite pro-survival protein overexpression and was associated with the release of danger-signaling molecules. In heterotypic CTCL spheroids, H-1PV induced spheroid growth suppression and, upon co-culturing with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, spheroid infiltration with immune cells. In summary, we gathered the first preclinical data showing that H-1PV holds significant potential to become a novel viroimmunotherapeutic agent against CTCL. Abstract The rat protoparvovirus H-1 (H-1PV) is an oncolytic virus known for its anticancer properties in laboratory models of various human tumors, including non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) of B-cell origin. However, H-1PV therapeutic potential against hematological malignancies of T-cell origin remains underexplored. The aim of the present study was to conduct a pilot preclinical investigation of H-1PV-mediated oncolytic effects in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a type of NHL that is urgently calling for innovative therapies. We demonstrated H-1PV productive infection and induction of oncolysis in both classically grown CTCL suspension cultures and in a novel, in vivo-relevant, heterotypic spheroid model, but not in healthy donor controls, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). H-1PV-mediated oncolysis of CTCL cells was not prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression and was accompanied by increased extracellular ATP release. In CTCL spheroid co-cultures with PBMCs, increased spheroid infiltration with immune cells was detected upon co-culture treatment with the virus. In conclusion, our preclinical data show that H-1PV may hold significant potential as an ingenious viroimmunotherapeutic drug candidate against CTCL.">

        <tr id="Bone metastases, a common and debilitating consequence of advanced cancers, involve a complex interplay between malignant cells and the bone microenvironment. Central to this interaction are interleukins (ILs), a group of cytokines with critical roles in immune modulation and inflammation. This review explores the dualistic nature of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory interleukins in bone metastases, emphasizing their molecular mechanisms, pathological impacts, and therapeutic potential. Pro-inflammatory interleukins, such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, have been identified as key drivers in promoting osteoclastogenesis, tumor proliferation, and angiogenesis. These cytokines create a favorable environment for cancer cell survival and bone degradation, contributing to the progression of metastatic lesions. Conversely, anti-inflammatory interleukins, including IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, exhibit protective roles by modulating immune responses and inhibiting osteoclast activity. Understanding these opposing effects is crucial for developing targeted therapies aimed at disrupting the pathological processes in bone metastases. Key signaling pathways, including NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and MAPK, mediate the actions of these interleukins, influencing tumor cell survival, immune cell recruitment, and bone remodeling. Targeting these pathways presents promising therapeutic avenues. Current treatment strategies, such as the use of denosumab, tocilizumab, and emerging agents like bimekizumab and ANV419, highlight the potential of interleukin-targeted therapies in mitigating bone metastases. However, challenges such as therapeutic resistance, side effects, and long-term efficacy remain significant hurdles. This review also addresses the potential of interleukins as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, offering insights into patient stratification and personalized treatment approaches. Interleukins have multifaceted roles that depend on the context, including the environment, cell types, and cellular interactions. Despite substantial progress, gaps in research persist, particularly regarding the precise mechanisms by which interleukins influence the bone metastatic niche and their broader clinical implications. While not exhaustive, this overview underscores the critical roles of interleukins in bone metastases and highlights the need for continued research to fully elucidate their complex interactions and therapeutic potential. Addressing these gaps will be essential for advancing our understanding and treatment of bone metastases in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Autoimmunity refers to an organism’s immune response against its own healthy cells, tissues, or components, potentially leading to irreversible damage to vital organs. Central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms play crucial roles in preventing autoimmunity by eliminating self-reactive T and B cells. The disruption of immunological tolerance, characterized by the failure of these mechanisms, results in the aberrant activation of autoreactive lymphocytes that target self-tissues, culminating in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. Genetic predispositions, environmental exposures, and immunoregulatory disturbances synergistically contribute to the susceptibility and initiation of autoimmune pathologies. Within the realm of immune therapies for autoimmune diseases, cytokine therapies have emerged as a specialized strategy, targeting cytokine-mediated regulatory pathways to rectify immunological imbalances. Proinflammatory cytokines are key players in inducing and propagating autoimmune inflammation, highlighting the potential of cytokine therapies in managing autoimmune conditions.

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a prominent role in utero tolerating non-inherited maternal antigens and in regulating immune responses against pathogens at birth. This study investigates Treg immunity in newborns in West Africa, where sepsis remains a major public health problem. Treg phenotypes on neonates subgroups with early-onset sepsis (EOS), presumed sepsis, and healthy newborn with and without prenatal risk factors were evaluated. Treg phenotypes varied according to prenatal conditions, with increase in Treg frequency and Foxp3 expression in healthy newborns with prenatal risk factors compared to those with none risk. Compared to healthy newborns with prenatal risk factors, EOS neonates had a significantly reduced frequency of Treg and Foxp3 expression. In the Treg pool, higher frequency of activated Treg was observed in EOS neonates, suggesting an in-utero activation upstream of the sepsis onset. Their migration to the infection site may explain the reduced frequency of circulating Integrin α4β1+ Treg suggestive of homing to the endothelial tissue. EOS neonates show increases expression of CTLA-4, PD-1 and CD39 on Treg, which negatively regulate the activation of effector T cells (Teff) corroborating by the lower frequency of Teff in EOS neonates. The higher frequency of CD39+ Treg and the lower frequency of integrinα4β1+ Treg in EOS non-survivor suggests that Treg exhaustement and endothelial homing are associated with outcome severity. Neonates developing EOS are born with an altered Treg phenotypic profile. Treg expression of CTLA-4, PD-1, CD39, and integrinα4β1 cell markers can be considered as early warning or diagnostic markers of EOS.">

        <tr id="Inflammation and tissue damage associated with pancreatitis can precede or occur concurrently with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that in PDAC coupled with pancreatitis (ptPDAC), antigen-presenting type I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are specifically activated. Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (iCBT) leads to cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activation and elimination of ptPDAC with restoration of life span even upon PDAC rechallenge. Using PDAC antigen-loaded cDC1s as a vaccine, immunotherapy-resistant PDAC was rendered sensitive to iCBT with elimination of tumors. cDC1 vaccination coupled with iCBT identified specific CDR3 sequences in the tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells with potential therapeutic importance. This study identifies a fundamental difference in the immune microenvironment in PDAC concurrent with, or without, pancreatitis and provides a rationale for combining cDC1 vaccination with iCBT as a potential treatment option. Editor’s summary Inflammation of the pancreas, known as pancreatitis, can influence the emergence and progression of pancreatic cancer. How the body’s immune system responds to pancreatitis versus pancreatic cancer remains unclear. Mahadevan et al. report that pancreatitis leads to the recruitment of a class of immune cells called conventional dendritic cells that can help to protect tissue from self-destruction by T lymphocytes. They found that the coexistence of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer resulted in an aggressive disease in which conventional dendritic cells influenced a suppressive T cell subset to override the action of T cells that usually destroy cancer. Blocking the suppressor T cells with immunotherapy reduced the growth of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, engineered cancer-specific conventional dendritic cells along with immunotherapy may provide a mechanism to intervene in pancreatic cancer. —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Sites of chronic tissue injury and inflammation demonstrate an increased propensity to develop cancers. Tissue damage associated with chronic pancreatitis increases the risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Chronic pancreatitis can precede the development of PDAC or occur concurrently during cancer progression due to bile or pancreatic duct involvement. However, the impact of pancreatitis on the immune microenvironment in PDAC remains unknown. In this study, we identify fundamental differences in the immune infiltrate of PDAC concurrent with and without pancreatitis. Pancreatitis enables recruitment of antigen-presenting dendritic cells and alters adaptive immunity associated with PDAC. Unexpectedly, this profile of immune microenvironment primes immunotherapy with elimination of pancreatic cancer. RATIONALE Resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (iCBT) has been attributed to a paucity of dendritic cells (DCs) and suppressive T cell response in PDAC. We evaluated whether parenchymal tissue injury and inflammation occurring in the background of cancer exhibit a different immune microenvironment and alter efficacy of iCBT. RESULTS Pancreatitis resulted in the recruitment of myeloid infiltrates into pancreas, accompanied by a suppression of T cells. Specifically, type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) recruited in this setting presented self-antigens, which led to suppression of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltrates to temper autoimmune tissue destruction. Mice depleted of cDC1s (XCR1 knockout mice) demonstrated elevated pancreatic acinar damage due to an increase in CD4+ Foxp3- effector T cells. In PDAC associated with pancreatitis (ptPDAC), acceleration of tumor progression with an increase in activated cDC1s were observed. However, unlike in pancreatitis, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell suppression was not observed in ptPDAC. Activated CD11c+ DCs induced a tolerogenic CD4+ T cell response to accelerate tumor initiation in ptPDAC. Specific depletion of CD4+ T cells in ptPDAC resulted in robust CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses and suppressed tumor initiation. Further, depletion of the CD11c+ DCs and CD4+ T cells together restored tumor initiation in ptPDAC, highlighting the importance of DCs in mediating CD8+ T cell responses in this context. The cDC1s recruited in ptPDAC opened a therapeutic window and rendered tumors sensitive to iCBT. Ex vivo engineered cDC1s stimulated with tumor antigens sensitized PDAC to iCBT, with increased survival of PDAC-bearing mice. Further, the cDC1 vaccine with iCBT resulted in a functional CD8+ T cell memory response, and tumor rechallenge failed to induce PDAC. CONCLUSION We discovered an inherent difference in the immune microenvironment between PDAC and ptPDAC. Although ptPDAC accelerated disease progression, it is associated with a conducive immune profile that primes effective immunotherapy. Our data suggest that ptPDAC could benefit from iCBT and provides a proof of concept for the development of cDC1 vaccine for the treatment of PDAC in combination with iCBT. Tissue injury and inflammation inform cDC1 vaccine priming of immunotherapy. Pancreatitis recruits activated cDC1s into the pancreas, resulting in T cell suppression (top left). PDAC is characterized by myeloid infiltration, lack of antigen-presenting DCs, and paucity of effector T cells (top right). Pancreatitis associated with PDAC (middle left) and antigen-specific cDC1 vaccine administration (middle right) resulted in effector and memory T cell response in combination with iCBT and eliminated PDAC (bottom).">

Here, we reviewed the current understanding of memory inflated CD8+ T cells in their distinct phenotypic features that different from exhausted subsets; the intrinsic and extrinsic roles in regulating the formation of memory inflation; and the key proteins in maintaining the expansion and proliferation of inflationary populations.

        <tr id="The innate immune system is the first line of host defense. Innate immune activation utilizes pattern recognition receptors to detect pathogens, pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs), and homeostatic alterations and drives inflammatory signaling pathways and regulated cell death. Cell death activation is critical to eliminate pathogens and aberrant or damaged cells, while excess activation can be linked to inflammation, tissue damage, and disease. Therefore, there is increasing interest in studying cell death mechanisms to understand the underlying biology and identify therapeutic strategies. However, there are significant technical challenges, as many cell death pathways share key molecules with each other, and genetic models where these cell death molecules are deleted remain the gold standard for evaluation. Furthermore, extensive crosstalk has been identified between the cell death pathways pyroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, and the more recently characterized PANoptosis, which is defined as a prominent, unique innate immune, lytic, and inflammatory cell death pathway initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosomes. PANoptosomes are multi-protein complexes assembled by innate immune sensor(s) in response to pathogens, PAMPs, DAMPs, cytokines, and homeostatic changes that drive PANoptosis. In this article, we provide methods for molecularly defining distinct cell death pathways, including PANoptosis, using both genetic and chemical approaches through western blot, LDH assay, and microscopy readouts. This procedure allows for the assessment of cell death on the cell population and single-cell levels even without access to genetic models. Having this comprehensive workflow that is more accessible to all labs will improve our ability as a scientific community to accelerate discovery. Using these protocols will help identify new innate immune sensors that drive PANoptosis and define the molecular mechanisms and regulators involved to establish new targets for clinical translation. © 2024 The Author(s).

        <tr id="Although many cytokine pathways are important for dendritic cell (DC) development, it is less clear what cytokine signals promote the function of mature dendritic cells. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) promotes protective immunity and autoimmunity downstream of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and IL-23. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), Stat4-/- mice are resistant to the development of inflammation and paralysis. To define whether STAT4 is required for intrinsic signaling in mature DC function, we used conditional mutant mice in the EAE model. Deficiency of STAT4 in CD11c-expressing cells resulted in decreased T cell priming and inflammation in the central nervous system. EAE susceptibility was recovered following adoptive transfer of wild-type bone marrow-derived DCs to mice with STAT4-deficient DCs, but not adoptive transfer of STAT4- or IL-23R-deficient DCs. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) identified STAT4-dependent genes in DC subsets that paralleled a signature in MS patient DCs. Together, these data define an IL-23-STAT4 pathway in DCs that is key to DC function during inflammatory disease.">

        <tr id="Myeloproliferative neoplasms represent a group of clonal hematopoietic disorders of which myelofibrosis (MF) is the most aggressive. In the context of myeloid neoplasms, there is a growing recognition of the dysregulation of immune response and T-cell function as significant contributors to disease progression and immune evasion. We investigated cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion in MF to restore immune response against malignant cells. Increased expression of inhibitory receptors like CTLA-4 was observed on cytotoxic T cells from MF patients together with a reduced secretion of IFNɣ and TNFɑ. CTLA-4 ligands CD80 and CD86 were increased on MF granulocytes and monocytes highlighting a possible role for myeloid cells in suppressing T-cell activation in MF patients. Unlike healthy donors, the activation of cytotoxic T cells from MF patients was attenuated in the presence of myeloid cells and restored when T cells were cultured alone or treated with anti-CTLA-4. Moreover, anti-CTLA-4 treatment promoted elimination of neoplastic monocytes and granulocytes in a co-culture system with cytotoxic T cells. To test CTLA-4 inhibition in vivo, patient-derived xenografts were generated by transplanting MF CD34+ cells and by infusing homologous T cells in NSGS mice. CTLA-4 blockade reduced human myeloid chimerism and led to T-cell expansion in spleen and bone marrow. Overall, these findings shed light on T-cell dysfunction in MF and suggest that CTLA-4 blockade can boost the cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells.">

        <tr id="Like TNFα, IL-6 is upregulated in Crohn’s disease (CD) especially in patients associated with Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) infection, and both cytokines have been targeted as a therapeutic option for the treatment of the disease despite the accepted partial response in some patients. Limited response to anti-IL-6 receptor-neutralizing antibodies therapy may be related to the homeostatic dual role of IL-6. In this study, we investigated the effects and the signaling mechanism of IL-6 involved in intestinal epithelial integrity and function during MAP infection using an in vitro model that consists of THP-1, HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines. Clinically, we determined that plasma samples from MAP-infected CD patients have higher IL-6 levels compared to controls (P-value < 0.001). In CD-like macrophages, MAP infection has significantly upregulated the secretion of IL-6 and the shedding of (IL-6R) from THP-1 macrophages, P-value < 0.05. Intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and HT-29) were treated with the supernatant of MAP-infected THP-1 macrophages with or without a neutralizing anti-IL-6R antibody. Treating intestinal Caco-2 cells with supernatant of MAP-infected macrophages resulted in significant upregulation of intestinal damage markers including claudin-2 and SERPINE1/PAI-1. Interestingly, blocking IL-6 signaling exacerbated that damage and further increased the levels of the damage markers. In HT-29 cells, MAP infection upregulated MUC2 expression, a protective response that was reversed when IL-6R was neutralized. More importantly, blocking IL-6 signaling during MAP infection rescued damaged Caco-2 cells from MAP-induced apoptosis. The data clearly supports a protective role of IL-6 in intestinal epithelia integrity and function especially in CD patients associated with MAP infection. The findings may explain the ineffective response to anti-IL6 based therapy and strongly support a therapeutic option that restores the physiologic level of IL-6 in patient’s plasma. A new treatment strategy based on attenuation of IL-6 expression and secretion in inflammatory diseases should be considered.">

        <tr id="Abstract Immune evasion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) facilitates intracellular bacterial growth. The mechanisms of immune evasion, however, are still not fully understood. In this study, we reveal that tristetraprolin (TTP), one of the best characterized RNA‐binding proteins controlling the stability of targeted mRNAs, mediates innate immune evasion of mycobacteria. We found that TTP knockout mice displayed reduced bacterial burden in the early stage after Mtb aerosol challenge. Macrophages deficient in TTP also showed an inhibition in intracellular mycobacterial growth. Live mycobacteria induced TTP protein expression in macrophages, which was blocked by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Rapamycin and AZD8055 specifically blocked 4EBP1 phosphorylation in infected macrophages and suppressed intracellular BCG growth. Rapamycin promoted TTP protein degradation through the ubiquitination pathway, whereas the proteasome inhibitor MG‐132 blocked rapamycin function and thus stabilized TTP protein. TTP induction suppressed the expression of iNOS/TNF‐α/IL‐12/IL‐23, and weakened protective immune responses in macrophages, whereas rapamycin enhanced the bactericidal effects through TTP inhibition. Moreover, blocking TTP binding increased the expression of TNF‐α and iNOS and suppressed intracellular mycobacterial growth. Overall, our study reveals a novel role for RNA‐binding protein TTP in Mtb immune evasion mechanisms and provides a potential target for host‐directed therapy against tuberculosis (TB).">

The virus enters host cells by binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is then facilitated by the protease activity of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). It triggers a cytokine storm that eventually leads to cell apoptosis, tissue damage, and organ failure. Therefore, any organs in the human body that have both receptors are highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection, potentially resulting in multiple-organ failure. The prostate has been reported to express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. While there are limited studies regarding the association between COVID-19 and prostatitis, the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could cause prostatitis cannot be denied. Thus, through this review, a better insight into the associations of SAR-CoV-2 can be provided.">

        <tr id="Metabolic reprogramming is a k`ey hallmark of tumors, developed in response to hypoxia and nutrient deficiency during tumor progression. In both cancer and immune cells, there is a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, which then leads to lactate acidification, increased lipid synthesis, and glutaminolysis. This reprogramming facilitates tumor immune evasion and, within the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer and immune cells collaborate to create a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The growing interest in the metabolic reprogramming of the TME, particularly its significance in colorectal cancer (CRC)—one of the most prevalent cancers—has prompted us to explore this topic. CRC exhibits abnormal glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and increased lipid synthesis. Acidosis in CRC cells hampers the activity of anti-tumor immune cells and inhibits the phagocytosis of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), while nutrient deficiency promotes the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages. In CRC cells, activation of G-protein coupled receptor 81 (GPR81) signaling leads to overexpression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and reduces the antigen presentation capability of dendritic cells. Moreover, the genetic and epigenetic cell phenotype, along with the microbiota, significantly influence CRC metabolic reprogramming. Activating RAS mutations and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) occur in approximately 50% and 80% of patients, respectively, stimulating glycolysis and increasing levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and MYC proteins. Certain bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which activate CD8+ cells and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, while other mechanisms support pro-tumor activities. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in selected CRC patients has shown promise, and the combination of these with drugs that inhibit aerobic glycolysis is currently being intensively researched to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.">

In response to aggressive pro-angiogenic stimulus, blood vessels form rapidly and are dysfunctional, resulting in poor perfusion, tissue hypoxia, and leakiness, which leads to increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). Decreased perfusion and high IFP significantly inhibit the uptake of therapies into the tumor. Within the TME, there are numerous inhibitor cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor association macrophages (TAMs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that secrete high numbers of immunosuppressive cytokines. This immunosuppressive environment is thought to contribute to the lack of success of immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. This review discusses the components of the TME in OC, how these characteristics impede therapeutic efficacy, and some strategies to alleviate this inhibition.">

Perplexingly, innate cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-12, are also associated with rejection of organ transplants. However, the pathways of innate immune activation in allogeneic transplantation are unclear. While the role of microbial and cell death products has been previously described, we identified alloreactive memory CD4 T cells as the primary triggers of innate inflammation. Memory CD4 T cells engaged MHC II-mismatched dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the production of innate inflammatory cytokines. This innate inflammation was independent of several pattern recognition receptors and was primarily driven by TNF superfamily ligands expressed by alloreactive memory CD4 T cells. Blocking of CD40L and TNFα resulted in dampened inflammation, and mice genetically deficient in these molecules exhibited prolonged survival of cardiac allografts. Furthermore, myeloid cell and CD8 T cell infiltration into cardiac transplants was compromised in both CD40L- and TNFα-deficient recipients. Strikingly, we found that priming of naive alloreactive CD8 T cells was dependent on licensing of DCs by memory CD4 T cells. This study unravels the key mechanisms by which alloreactive memory CD4 T cells contribute to destructive pathology and transplant rejection.">

This review delves into the intricate mechanisms by which RIPK1 orchestrates necroptosis in CD4+ T cells during HIV infection. We explore the structural intricacies of RIPK1, its interactions with other signaling molecules, and the downstream events that culminate in necroptotic cell death. Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting RIPK1 to mitigate CD4+ T cell loss and control HIV disease progression. Understanding the multifaceted role of RIPK1 in HIV-induced necroptosis may pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions to combat this devastating disease.">

Spleen pathology begins at the marginal zone (MZ), apparent by 2 d postinfection (dpi), and progresses throughout the red pulp by 4 dpi. To better understand how M.R2k/b mice respond to infection and how Cmv5s contributes to tissue damage in the spleen, we assessed the regulation of myeloid cells and inflammation during acute MCMV infection in MA/My and M.R2k/b mice. We found that Cmv5s drove increased neutrophil accumulation and cell death at the MZ, which corresponded with evidence of localized oxidative stress and increased overall spleen IL-6 and TGF-β1 early during infection. Further assessment of MCMV infection dynamics at the early MZ revealed infected SIGNR1+ MZ macrophages as the first apparent cell type lost during infection in these mice and the likely target of early neutrophil recruitment. Spleen macrophages were also identified as the mediators of differential spleen IL-6 and TGF-β1 between MA/My and M.R2k/b mice. Interrogation of MCMV progression past 2 dpi revealed substantial M.R2k/b F480+ red pulp macrophage loss along with buildup of oxidative stress and MZ macrophage debris that was not neutrophil dependent. Together we identify Cmv5s-driven macrophage loss and inflammation during acute MCMV infection corresponding with the spatial and temporal development of spleen tissue damage.">

Fully elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the immune response against viral infections is crucial for epidemic prevention and control. The innate immune response, the host's primary defense against viral infection, plays a pivotal role and has become a breakthrough in research mechanisms. A component of the innate immune system, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are involved in inducing inflammatory responses to viral infections. Numerous DAMPs are released from virally infected cells, activating downstream signaling pathways via internal and external receptors on immune cells. This activation triggers immune responses and helps regulate viral host invasion. This review examines the immune regulatory mechanisms of various DAMPs, such as the S100 protein family, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and heat shock proteins, in various viral infections to provide a theoretical basis for designing novel antiviral drugs.">

        <tr id="Cytokine storms are an excessive immune response triggered by severe viral infections, such as SARS-CoV2. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) is a key player in these storms. Secondary and co-infections can exacerbate the immune response, leading to amplified cytokine release and potentially severe disease outcomes. This review aims to evaluate the expression of TLR-4 in fungal and bacterial infections that are associated with and secondary to SARS-CoV2. The study collected specimens from 70 patients admitted to a Baghdad hospital’s ICUs and 35 healthy controls, aged 15-80 years, from June 2022 to April 2023. Re¬al-time RT-PCR was used for infection detection, while conventional methods were used to isolate patho¬genic microorganisms and the Vitec 2 system. The findings of this study suggest that TLR-4 may play a crucial role in secondary and co-infections in individuals with severe SARS-CoV2. The study implies that increased TLR-4 expression might contribute to the development of bacterial secondary and co-infections. When TLR-4 detects bacterial components, it triggers immune responses aimed at eliminating the bacte¬ria. However, an overactive TLR-4 response may lead to an excessive release of cytokines, resulting in a cytokine storm. This excessive immune response can cause tissue damage and exacerbate the severity of SARS-CoV2. Furthermore, the TLR-4 expression may not significantly contribute to the immune response against co-fungal infections with SARS-CoV-2, despite its role in antiviral responses and bacterial defense.">

        <tr id="Infection by bacteria leads to tissue damage and inflammation, which need to be tightly controlled by host mechanisms to avoid deleterious consequences. It is previously reported that TMEM16F, a calcium-activated lipid scramblase expressed in various immune cell types including T cells and neutrophils, is critical for the control of infection by bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) in vivo. This function correlated with the capacity of TMEM16F to repair the plasma membrane (PM) damage induced in T cells in vitro, by the Lm toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). However, whether the protective effect of TMEM16F on Lm infection in vivo is mediated by an impact in T cells, or in other cell types, is not determined. Herein, the immune cell types and mechanisms implicated in the protective effect of TMEM16F against Lm in vivo are elucidated. Cellular protective effects of TMEM16F correlated with its capacity of lipid scrambling and augment PM fluidity. Using cell type-specific TMEM16F-deficient mice, the indication is obtained that TMEM16F expressed in liver Kupffer cells (KCs), but not in T cells or B cells, is key for protection against Listeria in vivo. In the absence of TMEM16F, Listeria induced PM rupture and fragmentation of KCs in vivo. KC death associated with greater liver damage, inflammatory changes, and dysregulated liver metabolism. Overall, the results uncovered that TMEM16F expressed in Kupffer cells is crucial to protect the host against Listeria infection. This influence is associated with the capacity of Kupffer cell-expressed TMEM16F to prevent excessive inflammation and abnormal liver metabolism.">

        <tr id="Gut mucosal immunity in infants exposed to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) presents a complex interplay of developmental processes, viral dynamics, and therapeutic interventions that significantly impact clinical outcomes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms, clinical implications, and therapeutic strategies concerning gut mucosal immunity in HIV-exposed infants. The gut mucosa serves as a critical site for immune maturation and defense against pathogens, but HIV infection disrupts this delicate balance, leading to compromised immune function and increased susceptibility to infections.  Infants born to HIV-positive mothers experience unique challenges in gut mucosal immunity due to vertical transmission of the virus and exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV infection disrupts gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), resulting in early depletion of CD4+ T cells and compromised mucosal barrier function. These alterations contribute to microbial translocation, chronic inflammation, and immune dysregulation, impacting overall immune competence and increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Despite advances in ART, persistent immune activation and residual gut mucosal damage pose ongoing challenges in achieving optimal immune reconstitution and preventing long-term complications in HIV-exposed infants. Clinical implications of compromised gut mucosal immunity in HIV-exposed infants extend beyond gastrointestinal health to encompass systemic immune dysfunction and increased risks of non-AIDS comorbidities. Impaired gut barrier function exacerbates microbial translocation, leading to systemic inflammation that may contribute to neurodevelopmental abnormalities and metabolic disorders.

        <tr id="To investigate how host and pathogen diversity govern immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), we performed a large-scale screen of vaccine-mediated protection against aerosol Mtb infection using three inbred mouse strains [C57BL/6 (B6), C3HeB/FeJ (C3H), Balb/c x 129/SvJ (C129F1)] and three Mtb strains (H37Rv, CDC1551, SA161) representing two lineages and distinct virulence properties. We compared three protective modalities, all of which involve inoculation with live mycobacteria: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the only approved TB vaccine, delivered either subcutaneously or intravenously, and concomitant Mtb infection (CoMtb), a model of pre-existing immunity in which a low-level Mtb infection is established in the cervical lymph node following intradermal inoculation. We examined lung bacterial burdens at early (Day 28) and late (Day 98) time points after aerosol Mtb challenge and histopathology at Day 98. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the reduction of bacterial load afforded by these modalities at Day 28 across the combinations and noted a strong positive correlation between bacterial burden in unvaccinated mice and the degree of protection afforded by vaccination. Although we observed variation in the degree of reduction in bacterial burdens across the nine mouse/bacterium strain combinations, virtually all protective modalities performed similarly for a given strain-strain combination. We also noted dramatic variation in histopathology changes driven by both host and bacterial genetic backgrounds. Vaccination improved pathology scores for all infections except CDC1551. However, the most dramatic impact of vaccination on lesion development occurred for the C3H-SA161 combination, where vaccination entirely abrogated the development of the large necrotic lesions that arise in unvaccinated mice. In conclusion, we find that substantial TB heterogeneity can be recapitulated by introducing variability in both host and bacterial genetics, resulting in changes in vaccine-mediated protection as measured both by bacterial burden as well as histopathology. These differences can be harnessed in future studies to identify immune correlates of vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="Chronic viral infections cause thymic involution yet the potential for broader, longer-term impact on thymic composition remains unexplored. Here we show that chronic, but not acute, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection promotes a unique population of immature B cells in the thymus. We show that chronic viral infection promotes signals within the thymus, including the expression of B-cell activating factor (BAFF), that favor the maturation of this population as these cells acquire expression of CD19 and immunoglobulin M. Mechanistically, type I interferon (IFN-I), predominantly IFNβ, signals to thymic hematopoietic cells, strongly delaying T-cell development at the earliest precursor stage. Furthermore, IFN-I signaling to the nonhematopoietic compartment provides a second signal essential to favor B-cell differentiation and maturation within the thymus. Importantly, chronic infection yields changes in the B-cell population for at least 50 days following infection, long after thymic atrophy has subsided. Thus, the inflammatory milieu induced by chronic viral infection has a profound, and long-lasting, effect on thymic composition leading to the generation of a novel population of thymic B cells.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Dendritic cells are important mediators in the activation of the innate and adoptive immune response. The generation of DC/DCleu was comparable under physiological hypoxic and normoxic culture conditions, with no significant differences in frequencies of generated DC/DCleu from leukemic cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear as well as whole blood cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, the composition of immune cells and anti-leukemic immune activity after T cell enriched mixed lymphocyte culture with patients’ blood pretreated vs not pretreated with defined response modifiers (Kits) was improved, particularly under hypoxic conditions. These data show that the generation of DC/DCleu as well as the induction of anti-leukemic immune activating functionality is possible under standard normoxic as well as physiological hypoxic culture conditions ex vivo. Abstract Hypoxia can modulate the immune system by affecting the function and activity of immune cells, potentially leading to altered immune responses. This study investigated the generation of leukemia-derived dendritic cells (DCleu) from leukemic blasts and their impact on immune cell activation under hypoxic (5–10% O2) compared to normoxic (21% O2) conditions using various immunomodulatory Kits. The results revealed that DC/DCleu-generation was similar under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, with no significant differences observed in frequencies of generated DC/DCleu. Furthermore, the study showed that the activation of immune cells and their anti-leukemic activity improved when T cell-enriched immunoreactive cells were co-cultured with DC/DCleu which were generated with Kit I and M compared to the control after mixed lymphocyte cultures. The anti-leukemic activity was improved under hypoxic compared to normoxic conditions after MLCWB-DC Kit M. These findings suggest that DC/DCleu-cultures of leukemic whole blood with Kits under hypoxic conditions yield comparable frequencies of DC/DCleu and can even increase the anti-leukemic activity compared to normoxic conditions. Overall, this research highlights the potential of utilizing DC/DCleu (potentially induced in vivo with Kits) as a promising approach to enhance immune response in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.">

This knowledge gap has hindered the development of therapeutic strategies to overcome tumor immune resistance induced by hypoxia.

A hypoxic microenvironment promotes binding of HIF-1α complex is demonstrated to the ALCAM promoter therefore increasing its expression in macrophages, and the ALCAMhigh macrophages co-localize with exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor spatial microenvironment and promote T cell exhaustion. Preclinically, HIF-1ɑ inhibition reduces ALCAM expression in macrophages and exhausted CD8+ T cells and potentiates T cell antitumor function to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.

        <tr id="Introduction Granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) show fast recovery following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) constituting the major part of peripheral blood in the early phase. Although G-MDSCs mediate immune suppression through multiple mechanisms, they may also promote inflammation under specific conditions. Methods G-MDSCs were isolated from 82 patients following allo-HSCT within 90 days after allo-HSCT, and their interactions with autologous CD3+ T-cells were examined. T-cell proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry following CFSE staining, while differentiation and interferon-γ secretion were characterized using chemokine receptor profiling and ELISpot assays, respectively. NK cell cytotoxicity was evaluated through co-culture with K562 cells. An aGVHD xenogeneic model in humanized mice was employed to study the in vivo effects of human leukocytes. Furthermore, transcriptional alterations in G-MDSCs were analyzed via RNA sequencing to investigate functional transitions. Results G-MDSCs promoted inflammation in the early-stage, by facilitating cytokine secretion and proliferation of T cells, as well as their differentiation into pro-inflammatory T helper subsets. At day 28, patients with a higher number of G-MDSCs exhibited an increased risk of developing grades II-IV aGvHD. Besides, adoptive transfer of G-MDSCs from patients at day 28 into humanized mice exacerbated aGvHD. However, at day 90, G-MDSCs led to immunosuppression, characterized by upregulated expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase gene and interleukin-10 secretion, coupled with the inhibition of T cell proliferation. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis of G-MDSCs at day 28 and day 90 revealed that 1445 genes were differentially expressed. These genes were associated with various pathways, revealing the molecular signatures of early post-transplant differentiation in G-MDSCs. In addition, genes linked to the endoplasmic reticulum stress were upregulated in patients without aGvHD. The acquisition of immunosuppressive function by G-MDSCs may depend on the activation of CXCL2 and DERL1 genes. Conclusion Our findings revealed the alteration in the immune characteristics of G-MDSCs within the first 90 days post-allo-HSCT. Moreover, the quantity of G-MDSCs at day 28 may serve as a predictive indicator for the development of aGvHD.">

        <tr id="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an orphan neurodegenerative disease. Immune system dysregulation plays an essential role in ALS onset and progression. Our preclinical studies have shown that the administration of exogenous allogeneic B cells improves outcomes in murine models of skin and brain injury through a process termed pligodraxis, in which B cells adopt an immunoregulatory and neuroprotective phenotype in an injured environment. Here, we investigated the effects of B-cell therapy in the SOD1G93A mouse preclinical model of ALS and in a person living with ALS. Purified splenic mature naïve B cells from haploidentical donor mice were administered intravenously in SOD1G93A mice for a total of 10 weekly doses. For the clinical study in a person with advanced ALS, IgA gammopathy of unclear significance, and B lymphopenia, CD19+ B cells were positively selected from a healthy haploidentical donor and infused intravenously twice, at a 60-day interval. Repeated intravenous B-cell administration was safe and significantly delayed disease onset, extended survival, reduced cellular apoptosis, and decreased astrogliosis in SOD1G93A mice. Repeated B-cell infusion in a person with ALS was safe and did not appear to generate a clinically evident inflammatory response. An improvement of 5 points on the ALSFRS-R scale was observed after the first infusion. Levels of inflammatory markers showed persistent reduction post-infusion. This represents a first demonstration of the efficacy of haploidentical B-cell infusion in the SOD1G93A mouse and the safety and feasibility of using purified haploidentical B lymphocytes as a cell-based therapeutic strategy for a person with ALS.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background This article explored the possibility that the Mpox virus (MPXV) may initiate or stimulate the consequences of vascular inflammation. In 1970, it was discovered that Macaca cynomolgus primates infected with MPXV also infected humans in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Discussion The study demonstrates that MPXV invades host cells via viral proteins and surface receptors, initiating the release of diverse inflammatory mediators such as IL‐1, IL‐6, TNF‐α, CCL2, CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, and so forth probably through endothelial dysfunction by reactive oxygen species production. In general, these mediators have been found to contribute to vascular inflammation and the formation of atherosclerotic plaque at a later stage, which may contribute to the onset of vascular inflammation. Conclusion The discussed association between vascular inflammation and Mpox has the potential to be an important finding in the field of vascular biology research.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which consist of chromatin DNA studded with granule proteins, are released by neutrophils in response to both infectious and sterile inflammation. Beyond the canonical role in defense against pathogens, the extrusion of NETs also contributes to the initiation, metastasis, and therapeutic response of malignant diseases. Recently, NETs have been implicated in the development and therapeutic responses of various types of tumors. Although extensive work regarding inflammation in tumors has been reported, a comprehensive summary of how these web‐like extracellular structures initiate and propagate tumor progression under the specific microenvironment is lacking. In this review, we demonstrate the initiators and related signaling pathways that trigger NETs formation in cancers. Additionally, this review will outline the current molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of NETs during dormant cancer cells awakening, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) extravasation, and metastatic recurrence of cancer. This is followed by a perspective on the current and potential clinical potential of NETs as therapeutic targets in the treatment of both local and metastatic disease, including the improvement of the efficacy of existing therapies.">

        <tr id="While many studies have associated HIV prevalence with socio-economic status, few have explored the host's immunity status prior to HIV infection. High HIV prevalence in Africa may in part be contributed by a high prevalence of other persistent infections that modulate the host immunity towards phenotypes that promote HIV acquisition. In this narrative review, we examined how four most prevalent pathogens in Africa (human papillomavirus, herpesviruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and helminth infections) modulate immunity to favor their survival and in turn, also influence HIV acquisition. We have described how these pathogens expand the number of memory and activated T cells, increase the expression of HIV entry receptors leading to an increased HIV susceptibility, and show how these pathogens' immunoevasive strategies may favor HIV persistence. A better understanding of the association between immunomodulation caused by other prevalent infections and HIV/AIDS prevalence may improve HIV/AIDS preventive strategies in Africa. We suggest intensifying efforts to control these chronic infections by making drugs or vaccines available in endemic regions. This may act as another indirect strategy to complement current HIV/AIDS interventions in Africa. We also call for more research to understand better the relationship between immunomodulation by other prevalent infections and HIV incidence.

Each cell type infected by ZIKV—neuronal cells (radial glial cells, neuronal progenitor cells, astrocytes, microglia cells, and glioblastoma stem cells) and non-neuronal cells (primary fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, and Sertoli cells)—displays its own characteristic changes to their cell physiology and has various impacts on disease. Here, we provide an in-depth review of the ZIKV life cycle and its cellular targets, and discuss the current knowledge of how infections cause neuropathologies, as well as what approaches researchers are currently taking to further advance such knowledge. A key aspect of ZIKV neuropathogenesis is virus-induced neuronal apoptosis via numerous mechanisms including cell cycle dysregulation, mitochondrial fragmentation, ER stress, and the unfolded protein response. These, in turn, result in the activation of p53-mediated intrinsic cell death pathways. A full spectrum of infection models including stem cells and co-cultures, transwells to simulate blood–tissue barriers, brain-region-specific organoids, and animal models have been developed for ZIKV research.">

        <tr id="The recent outbreak of monkeypox virus (MPXV) was unprecedented in its size and distribution. Those living with uncontrolled HIV and low CD4 T cell counts might develop a fulminant clinical mpox course with increased mortality, secondary infections, and necrotizing lesions. Fatal cases display a high and widespread MPXV tissue burden. The underlying pathomechanisms are not fully understood. We report here the pathological findings of an MPXV-driven abscess in gastrocnemius muscle requiring surgery in an immunocompromised patient with severe mpox. Presence of virus particles and infectivity were confirmed by electron microscopy, expansion microscopy, and virus culture, respectively. MPXV tissue distribution by immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed a necrotic core with infection of different cell types. In contrast, at the lesion rim fibroblasts were mainly infected. Immune cells were almost absent in the necrotic core, but were abundant at the infection rim and predominantly macrophages. Further, we detected high amounts of alternatively activated GPNMB+-macrophages at the lesion border. Of note, macrophages only rarely colocalized with virus-infected cells. Insufficient clearance of infected cells and infection of lesion-associated fibroblasts sustained by the abundance of profibrotic macrophages might lead to the coalescing of lesions and the severe and persistent clinical mpox course observed in immunocompromised patients.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immature cells that expand in the circulation of patients with cancer, sepsis or chronic inflammation, modulate the immune response against cancer (favoring tumor onset and progression) and promote neoangiogenesis. These premises suggest that MDSCs could be involved in the pathogenesis of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by chronic inflammation and extensive neoangiogenesis in bone marrow and spleen). In this paper, we found that (1) MDSCs are increased both in the circulation and in the spleen of PMF patients and strongly correlate with disease progression; and (2) reduced CXCR4 expression on MDSCs along with increased plasmatic SDF-1α can be involved in their mobilization. These findings suggest that circulating MDSCs can be considered a parameter of disease severity and set MDSCs as potential new targets for cancer therapy. Abstract Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a chronic inflammatory state that plays a relevant role in the disease pathogenesis (as proven by high levels of inflammatory cytokines with prognostic significance and by a persistent oxidative stress) and by extensive neoangiogenesis in bone marrow (BM) and spleen. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immature cells that expand in patients with cancer, sepsis or chronic inflammation, favoring tumor onset and progression mainly through the decrease in immune surveillance and the promotion of neoangiogenesis. In this paper, we evaluated the presence of circulating MDSCs in PMF patients, the plasmatic factors involved in their mobilization/expansion and the correlations with laboratory, genetic and clinical parameters. The data indicated that MDSCs could have a relevant role in PMF as a new pathogenic mechanism contributing to explaining the phenotypic diversity observed during the clinical course of the disease, or a potential new target for personalized treatment.">

        <tr id="Chronic inflammatory milieu in the tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to the recruitment and differentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs, which are phenotypically and morphologically defined as a subset of neutrophils, cause major immune suppression in the TME, posing a significant challenge in the development of effective immunotherapies. Despite recent advances in our understanding of PMN-MDSC functions, the mechanism that gives rise to immunosuppressive neutrophils within the TME remains elusive. Both in vivo and in vitro, newly recruited neutrophils into the tumor sites remained activated and highly motile for several days and developed immunosuppressive phenotypes, as indicated by increased arginase 1 (Arg1) and dcTrail-R1 expression and suppressed anticancer CD8 T cell cytotoxicity. The strong suppressive function was successfully recapitulated by incubating naive neutrophils with cancer cell culture supernatant in vitro. Cancer metabolite secretome analyses of the culture supernatant revealed that both murine and human cancers released lipid mediators to induce the differentiation of immunosuppressive neutrophils. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) lipidomic analysis identified platelet-activation factor (PAF; 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) as a common tumor-derived lipid mediator that induces neutrophil differentiation. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPCAT2), the PAF biosynthetic enzyme, is up-regulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and shows an unfavorable correlation with patient survival across multiple cancer types. Our study identifies PAF as a lipid-driven mechanism of MDSC differentiation in the TME, providing a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium representing one of the leading causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The development of pneumonia results from a complex interplay between pathogens and pulmonary innate mucosal immunity. Therefore, the knowledge of the host immune responses is pivotal for the development of effective therapeutics to treat A. baumannii infections. Previous studies were conducted using cell lines and animal models, but a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between A. baumannii and primary human immune cells is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we investigated the response of primary monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells to the A. baumannii-type strain and an epidemic clinical isolate. We found that all immune cells trigger different responses when interacting with A. baumannii. In particular, macrophages and monocytes mediate bacterial clearance, whereas monocytes and dendritic cells activate a late response through the production of cytokines, chemokines, and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules. The epidemic strain induces lower expression of interleukin-10 and CD80 compared with the type strain, potentially constituting two immune evasion strategies.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has achieved important clinical advances in several types of tumors, particularly via targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. However, existing therapeutic strategies that suppress the PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway usually experience low treatment efficacy and the risk of causing autoimmune diseases. Herein, we report a cancer cell-targeted molecularly imprinted lysosomal nanodegrader (MILND) for boosting immune checkpoint blockade therapy against tumors. The MILND, imprinted with the N-terminal epitope of PD-L1 as an imprinting template, could specifically target the PD-L1 on tumor cells to promote cellular uptake. This process further induces the transport of PD-L1 into lysosomes for degradation, ultimately resulting in the downregulation of PD-L1 expression levels on tumor cells. As a result, a T cell-mediated immune response in the body was activated via the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway, which triggered a durable antitumor efficacy. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the MILND could effectively accumulate in tumor sites and exhibit strong tumor growth suppression efficacy in a xenograft tumor model without obvious side effects. Therefore, the MILND provides not only a promising strategy for boosting cancer immunotherapy but also insights for developing molecular imprinting-empowered nanomedicines.">

Clinical applications targeting DCs summarized in this report aim to improve immune infiltration and enhance the biological function of DCs to modulate the TME to prevent cancer cells from evading the immune system. Herein, factors in the TME that induce DC dysfunction, such as cytokines, hypoxic environment, tumor exosomes and metabolites, and co-inhibitory molecules, have been described. Furthermore, several key signaling pathways involved in DC dysfunction and signal-relevant drugs evaluated in clinical trials were identified. Finally, this review provides an overview of current clinical immunotherapies targeting DCs, especially therapies with proven clinical outcomes, and explores future developments in DC immunotherapies.">

In this study, we identified a novel dual role for peripheral and tissue-resident Vδ1 T cells within the gastrointestinal mucosa of virally suppressed people with HIV. Phenotypic analyses identified an increased frequency of highly differentiated, cytotoxic effector Vδ1 T cells that exerted potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vitro coinciding with direct increases in cytolytic function. Conversely, we detected an enrichment of HIV-1 DNA in tissue-resident CD4+Vδ1 T cells in situ. Despite low CD4 expression, we found circulating Vδ1 T cells also contained HIV-1 DNA which was replication-competent. We show that TCR-mediated activation of peripheral Vδ1 T cells induced de novo upregulation of CD4 providing a plausible mechanism for increased permissibility to infection. These findings highlight juxtaposing roles for Vδ1 T cells in HIV-1 persistence including significant contribution to tissue reservoirs.">

        <tr id="Background The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between expression level of CTLA-4 on CD4+ T cells and sepsis-associated immunosuppression (SAI), and to elucidate the possible mechanism of mTOR pathway mediated autophagic-lysosomal disorder in regulating CTLA-4 expression. Methods We enrolled 63 sepsis patients admitted to our ICU between January 1 and June 30, 2023. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the patients within 24 hours of recruitment. Expression levels of mTOR, P62, LC3II, and CTLA-4 on circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes were quantitated using flow cytometry. The association of these markers and relationship between CTLA-4 expression and the incidence of SAI and 28-day mortality were comprehensively analyzed. Results Compared with non-immunosuppressed patients with sepsis, patients with SAI had a higher 28-day mortality rate (37.5% vs 13.0%, P=0.039) and higher CTLA-4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on CD4+ T cells (328.7 versus 78.7, P<0.0001). CTLA-4 MFI on CD4+ cells was independently associated with the occurrence of SAI (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.14, P=0.044). In patients with sepsis and SAI, non-survivors had higher CTLA-4 expression than survivors (sepsis: 427.5 versus 130.6, P=0.002; and SAI: 506.7 versus 225.2, P<0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of CTLA-4 MFI at predicting 28-day mortality in patients with SAI was 100% and 80% respectively with the cutoff value of 328.7 and the area under the curve of 0.949. The MFI of mTOR, P62, and LC3II on CD4+ T cells were statistically higher in patients with SAI than in non-immunosuppressed patients (267.2 versus 115.9, P<0.0001; 314.8 versus 173.7, P<0.0001; and 184.7 versus 1123.5, P=0.012, respectively); P62 and LC3II were markedly higher in non-survivors than in survivors of sepsis (302.9 versus 208.9, P=0.039; and 244.3 versus 122.8, P<0.0001 respectively). The expression of CTLA-4 statistically correlated with that of LC3II in patients with sepsis, patients with SAI, and patients with SAI who did not survive (correlation coefficient: 0.69, 0.68, and 0.73, respectively, P<0.0001). Conclusions CTLA-4 overexpression on CD4+ T cells was markedly associated with the incidence of SAI and had great relevance to 28-day mortality. mTOR pathway mediated autophagic-lysosomal disorder showed significant association with CTLA-4 expression.">

        <tr id="Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating infection of the immunosuppressed brain, mediated by the gliotropic polyomavirus JCV. JCV replicates in human glial progenitor cells and astrocytes, which undergo viral T antigen-triggered mitosis, enabling viral replication. We asked if JCV spread might therefore be accelerated by glial proliferation. Using both in vitro analysis and a human glial chimeric mouse model of JCV infection, we found that dividing human astrocytes supported JCV propagation to a substantially greater degree than did mitotically quiescent cells. Accordingly, bulk and single cell RNA-sequence analysis revealed that JCV-infected glia differentially manifested cell cycle-linked disruption of both DNA damage response and transcriptional regulatory pathways. In vivo, JCV infection of humanized glial chimeras was greatly accentuated by cuprizone-induced demyelination and its associated mobilization of GPCs. Importantly, in vivo infection triggered the death of uninfected as well as infected glia, reflecting significant bystander death. Together, these data suggest that JCV propagation in PML may be accelerated by glial cell division. As such, the accentuated glial proliferation attending disease-associated demyelination may provide an especially favorable environment for JCV propagation, thus potentiating oligodendrocytic bystander death and further accelerating demyelination in susceptible hosts.">

        <tr id="Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite approximately infecting one-third of the world population and can cause serious public health problems. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of the attenuated vaccine Pru:Δcdpk2 against acute toxoplasmosis and explored the underlying immune mechanisms of the protection in pigs. The systemic T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell responses were analyzed, including kinetics, phenotype, and multifunctionality (interferon [IFN]-γ, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α), and the IFN-γ levels were analyzed in PBMCs. Our results showed that T. gondii-specific antibodies were induced by Pru:Δcdpk2. After challenging with RH, the antibodies were able to respond quickly in the immunized group, and the expression level was significantly higher than that in the unimmunized group. The expression level of IFN-γ significantly increased after vaccination, and the CD3+ γδ-, NK, and CD3+ γδ+ cell subsets also significantly increased. At the same time, functional analysis indicated that these cells were polarized toward a Th1 phenotype, showing the ability to secrete IFN-γ and TNF-α. The CD4+CD8α-T cell population exhibited a higher frequency of IFN-γ+ producing cells compared with the CD4-CD8α+ and CD4+CD8α+ cell populations during the early days of vaccination. Our results indicated that the attenuated vaccine could induce the expression of NK, γδ, and CD3αβ cells in pigs, and IFN-γ and TNF-α secreted by these cells are important for resistance to T. gondii infection.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is defined by granulomas— immune aggregates that either contain or support bacterial replication. Macrophages, fundamental components of these lesions, are crucial to TB pathogenesis, yet their phenotypic and functional diversity is incompletely understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence to profile macrophages in lung tissue and granulomas from a nonhuman primate model of early TB. We identified distinct subsets, including embryonic-origin tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived alveolar and interstitial macrophages, with distinct spatial localization in granulomas. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and a subset undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition accounted for the highest frequency of Mtb-infected cells. Infected cells exhibited differential expression of immune- and migration-associated genes compared to uninfected counterparts, suggesting Mtb either induces or exploits these pathways as a survival strategy.

        <tr id="Sensitization of the immune-suppressed tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer by histone deacetylase inhibition shows promise, but the mechanisms of sensitization are unknown. We investigated the TME of breast-to-lung metastases by combining experimental and clinical data with theory. Knowledge-guided subclustering of single-cell RNA-sequencing data and cell circuits analysis identified 39 cell states and salient interactions, of which myeloid, T cell and B cell subpopulations were most affected by treatment. Using functional immunologic assays, we verified that inhibition of the ICAM pathway partially recapitulated treatment effects. Mathematical modeling of tumor-immune dynamics confirmed that tumor reduction required simultaneous modulation of multiple TME interactions. We found evidence that treatment affected anti-tumor antibody production. Analysis of patient biopsies via spatial proteomics corroborated preclinical findings: in responders we observed increased B cell activation, mature tertiary lymphoid structures, and increased CD8+ T cell—macrophage distances with treatment. Overall, this study provides a framework for the discovery of cell-cell interactions that govern responses in complex TMEs. Statement of significance This study provides a framework for the discovery of cell-cell interactions that control responses in complex TMEs. We not only identify impactful tumor immunologic interactions that facilitate sensitization of the metastatic TME but also demonstrate how interdisciplinary data integration fuels cancer systems immunology to accelerate discovery of mechanisms of successful immunotherapeutic response in breast cancers and other previously unresponsive solid tumor types.">

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Abstract Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, are marked by systemic inflammation, T-cell exhaustion, lymphopenia, and chronic immune dysfunction, with limited therapeutic options for recovery. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a naturally occurring feline coronavirus infection, mirrors these immune pathologies, providing a valuable translational model. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapy combined with antiviral treatment in cats with effusive FIP. Hematologic, virologic, and immunologic analyses were conducted over 12 weeks. Antiviral therapy reduced cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion by downregulating inhibitory receptors PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3. MSC-treated cats demonstrated enhanced immune recovery, evidenced by reduced expression of exhaustion-related transcription factors (IKZF2, ZEB2, PRDM1) and increased regulatory T-cell populations, promoting immune homeostasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of mesenteric lymph nodes revealed transcriptomic shifts indicative of immune rejuvenation, including elevated memory T-cell markers (IKZF1, GZMK, IL7R) and reduced hyperproliferative lymphocyte subsets. Serum cytokine analysis revealed 3 distinct inflammatory mediator patterns using principal component analysis. Both treatment groups showed transitions toward cytokine profiles resembling those of healthy controls. Notably, residual cytokine elevations persisted at the study’s end, mirroring features of chronic immune dysregulation. PDGF-bb, a marker of tissue repair, was uniquely associated with higher lymphocyte counts, suggesting its role in lymphoid recovery. This study highlights the potential of MSC therapy to modulate immune dysfunction and support durable immune recovery. The findings underscore its translational relevance for addressing severe viral diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, advancing both veterinary and human medicine.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and associated receptors remains poorly characterized. We applied a single-cell multi-omics approach (CITE-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy donors, before and after in vitro TNF stimulation. Using integrated analysis of surface protein expression and transcriptomic data, we focused on phenotypic and transcriptional changes in dendritic cell populations. DCs from RA patients exhibited elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, indicative of an inflammatory phenotype, and showed marked responsiveness to TNF. Upon stimulation, RA-derived DCs upregulated genes involved in antigen presentation (CD83, LAMP3), lymph node migration (CCR7, ADAM19), and inflammation (TRAF1, IL24) whereas such activation was absent in healthy controls. Our data reveal a TNF-responsive, pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in dendritic cells from RA patients and underscore the relevance of the TNF receptor profile in shaping DC function. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of RA and identify dendritic cells as potential targets for personalized immunomodulatory therapy.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (TINs) are highly heterogeneous and mostly immunosuppressive in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Current biomarkers of TINs and treatment strategies targeting TINs have not yielded optimal responses in patients across cancer types. Here, we separated human and mouse neutrophils into three developmental stages, including promyelocyte (PM), myelocyte & metamyelocyte (MC & MM), and banded & segmented (BD & SC) neutrophils. Based on this separation, we observed the predominance of human but not mouse MC & MM-stage neutrophils in bone marrow (BM), which exhibit potent immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting properties. MCs & MMs also occupy the majority of TINs among patients with 17 cancer types. Moreover, through the creation of a NCG-Gfi1-/- human immune system (HIS) mouse model, which supports efficient reconstitution of human TIN, we found a significant increase of BM MCs & MMs in tumor-bearing mice. By comparing the scRNA-seq analysis results of human neutrophils from both BM and tumors, we found CD63 and Galectin-3 distinguish MC & MM from neutrophil populations in cancer patients. Furthermore, we proposed a strategy with Flt3L to specifically induce the trans-differentiation of MCs & MMs into monocytic cells, and trigger tumor control in NCG-Gfi1-/- HIS mice. Thus, our findings establish an essential role of human MC & MM-stage neutrophils in promoting cancer progression, and suggest their potential as targets for developing potential biomarkers and immunotherapies for cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a critical therapeutic strategy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, relapse remains a major challenge, with limited effective options for managing post-transplant recurrence. Tumor cells escape immune surveillance by establishing a complex, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a central role in immune evasion and disease relapse. Understanding the TME’s impact on immune cells and their functional alterations is therefore of significant clinical importance. Methods Utilizing a non-irradiated AML mouse model and bioinformatic analysis, we systematically analyzed T-cell dynamics during AML progression and identified abnormal metabolic activation in CD8+ T cells at early disease stages, which correlated with leukemia cell immune evasion. Result We found that when major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on AML cells were haplomatched with immune cells, CD8+ T cells exhibited robust cytokine and cytotoxic activation, retaining immune profiles similar to those of normal T cells. However, under the same tumor burden, T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, showed dramatic metabolic gene activation in MHC-matched leukemic mice. This metabolic activation led to rapid exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, accelerating leukemia progression. Based on these activated metabolic genes, we established a metabolism-associated genes (MAGs) scoring system. Validation using public datasets revealed that a high MAG score is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Conclusions Our findings provide molecular evidence supporting the stronger graft-versus-leukemia effects observed in HLA haploidentical HSCT. Moreover, they highlight that abnormal metabolic activation in CD8+ T cells during early AML progression contributes to rapid disease advancement and poor prognosis.

We identify a subset of EGR1+ CD14+ monocytes in patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). This subset activates NF-kB signaling and differentiates into tissue-damaging macrophages, which accumulate at sites of tissue injury. Furthermore, we identify a CD8+ T cell subset with type II interferon signature in the peripheral blood and the lung tissue of patients with progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD), suggesting that chemokine-driven migration of these cells contributes to ILD progression.

        <tr id="A major obstacle to identifying effective therapies for the aggressive brain tumor glioblastoma is the lack of human-specific, immunocompetent models that reflect the human tumor microenvironment. To address this, we developed the immune-Human Organoid Tumor Transplantation (iHOTT) model. This is an autologous co-culture platform that integrates patient-derived tumor cells and matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) within human cortical organoids, enabling the study of the patient-specific immune response to the tumor and tumor-immune interactions. This platform preserves tumor and immune populations, immune signaling, and cell-cell interactions observed in patient tumors. Treatment of iHOTT with pembrolizumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, mirrored cell type shifts and cell interactions observed in patients. TCR sequencing further revealed pembrolizumab-driven expansion of stem-like CD4-T-cell clonotypes exhibiting patient-specific repertoires. These findings establish iHOTT as a physiologically relevant platform for exploring autologous tumor–immune interactions and underscore the critical need for antigen-targeted strategies to enhance immunotherapy in glioblastoma.">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside in the lower airways and play a crucial role in lung health and response to sterile inflammation and infections. AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-Glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of central trained immunity by reprogramming haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan in mice induces peripheral trained immunity by reprogramming AMs in the lungs, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (lipopolysaccharide) or viral (polyI:C) challenges via a neutrophil/IFN-γ-dependent manner. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.">

        <tr id="Patients with lymphoma are at increased risk of severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, due to immune suppression. Using multidimensional spectral flow cytometry and serology, we characterized in-depth immune responses in 50 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated lymphoma patients across12 lymphoma subtypes, treated with anti-CD20 antibody (aCD20) ± chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. Compared to healthy control, aCD20±CT-treated patients exhibited distinct immune alterations, including elevated late-stage effector memory (EM3) CD4+, and terminally differentiated (EMRA) CD8+ T cells, reduced circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, and increased dysfunctional DN3 B cells. While B cell depletion was expected with aCD20 therapy, our data reveals broader immune dysregulation beyond B cell loss. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, aCD20±CT treated patients showed impaired vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses. In contrast, CT-only Hodgkin lymphoma patients maintained antibody responses comparable to healthy controls. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in aCD20±CT treated patients displayed fewer regulatory T cells, increased Th1 population, and more EMRA CD8+ T cells, suggesting a compensatory T-cell mediated immunity. Antibody response correlated positively with naïve T cell frequencies and transitional, classical memory, and DN2 B cell subsets. These findings inform the tailored development of vaccine strategies for immunocompromised patients to enhance protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral pathogens.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a dense extracellular matrix (ECM) that sustains an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While this protective niche has been described, the molecular determinants orchestrating its formation and dictating its immune interactions are not well defined. Using Perturb-map, we determine how dozens of different gene perturbations shape the growth and cellular environments of PDAC clones through space and time. Our study reveals dynamic, gene-specific adaptations of immune neighborhoods during clonal selection. We identified Serpinb2 (PAI2) and Serpine1 (PAI1) as key cancer-derived mediators of TME remodeling and immune evasion. These factors promote the deposition of a fibrin-rich ECM that shapes immune cell composition, locally retains and polarizes immunosuppressive macrophages and excludes cytotoxic T cells. Deletion of either Serpinb2 or Serpine1 greatly enhanced tumor response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in an aggressive PDAC model. Transcriptomic analysis further linked their expression to distinct PDAC subtypes and poor patient survival. Our findings demonstrate that Serpinb2 and Serpine1 establish a permissive niche for tumor progression and show how PDAC cells exploit components of the fibrinolysis pathway to remodel the ECM, alter macrophage composition, and protect themselves from immune editing, ultimately reinforcing the role of extracellular factors in shaping an immune-privileged tumor niche.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple mechanisms of immunity must be coordinated to defend against a comprehensive range of pathogens; however, the mechanisms by which broad-spectrum antipathogens act remain largely elusive. Here, we employed systems biology approaches to understand the organization of human immune cells at the single-cell level, as well as their reorganization in response to K21, a silane derivative effective against viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. K21 induced pro-inflammatory pathways in M1 and M2c macrophages without altering cytokine secretion, decreased a specific subtype of M1 macrophages and CXCL4-induced M2-like macrophages, and improved mitochondrial health by enhancing mitochondrial recycling via mitophagy. Similar treatment of the in vivo model organism C. elegans induced mitophagy and extended lifespan, suggesting evolutionary conservation of mechanism. Our work demonstrates that a drug that remodels mitochondria and metabolism can shape the immune cell repertoire, which could aid the development of more effective antimicrobials and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens.">

        <tr id="Introduction End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing worldwide, and although kidney transplantation improves survival, long-term graft loss–driven mainly by immune-mediated rejection–remains common. We aimed to delineate immune mechanisms that distinguish recipients with stable versus impaired graft function. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from kidney-transplant recipients with normal (n = 10) or impaired (n = 10) renal function were profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing. Fourteen immune populations were identified; CD4+ T-cell “stemness” was quantified using mRNAsi and EREG_mRNAsi indices, lineage trajectories were reconstructed with Monocle, and ligand–receptor communication was inferred with iTalk. Findings were validated in an independent bulk RNA-seq cohort (n = 192) using differential expression and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Results Recipients with graft dysfunction exhibited (i) expansion of Th17 cells and contraction of Treg cells, (ii) significant loss of CD4+ T-cell stem-like features (lower mRNAsi/EREG_mRNAsi, p < 0.001), and (iii) pseudotime trajectories skewed toward Th17 differentiation. iTalk revealed enhanced S100A8/A9-TLR4 signalling from myeloid cells to neutrophils, consistent with reduced circulating neutrophils and presumptive intragraft accumulation. Bulk validation confirmed the stemness deficit and identified eight hub genes (API5, CAPRIN1, CCT2, DLG1, NMD3, RDX, SENP7, S100A4) that correlated with both low stemness and poor clinical outcome. Pathway enrichment implicated cell-morphogenesis, tight-junction, and metabolic-homeostasis pathways in graft injury. Discussion Integrative single-cell and bulk analyses link diminished CD4+ T-cell stemness, Th17-dominant polarization, and S100A4-mediated neutrophil recruitment to graft dysfunction. These signatures nominate stemness indices, Th17/Treg balance, and the S100-TLR4 axis as candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets to preserve allograft integrity and prolong transplant survival.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by multilayered dysregulation of immune cell homeostasis, spanning B cell effector dysfunction, T follicular helper (Tfh) cell hyperactivity, and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) tolerance breakdown. Advances in high-parameter immunophenotyping, single-cell multiomics profiling, and spatial multiomics have redefined SLE pathogenesis, revealing stage-specific immune network perturbations. These discoveries have propelled mechanism-driven therapeutic strategies, including CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy for B cell depletion, disruption of T–B cell synaptic signaling (CD40L inhibitors), and restoration of pDC tolerance (anti-BDCA2 antibodies). While patient heterogeneity poses challenges for universal therapeutic efficacy, emerging strategies integrating molecular endotyping and cellular biomarkers hold promise for overcoming these limitations. By aligning targeted therapies with the immunophenotypic signatures of individual patients, precision medicine approaches are expected to optimize treatment efficacy, minimize off-target effects, and ultimately enhance long-term clinical outcomes in SLE. This review synthesizes current insights into how immune cell perturbations contribute to SLE pathogenesis, modulate disease flares, and determine therapeutic refractoriness, with a critical synthesis of recent clinical trial outcomes.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are central orchestrators of antitumor immunity, bridging innate sensing with adaptive T‐cell responses. This review dissects the developmental pathways and functional specializations of diverse DC subsets—including cDC1, cDC2, pDCs, DC3s, tDCs, moDCs, and emerging RORγt+ antigen‐presenting cells (APCs)—and explores how the tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamically reprograms these cells. Immunosuppressive cytokines, metabolic stress, hypoxia, and altered lipid metabolism can induce tolerogenic phenotypes such as mregDCs and ISG+ DCs, dampening antigen presentation and T‐cell activation. We detail how specific DC subsets interact with the TME—either reinforcing immune evasion or promoting antitumor immunity—depending on their transcriptional states and spatial organization. Emphasis is placed on recent findings from spatial transcriptomics and single‐cell studies that reveal key DC–T cell niches critical for immune control. Furthermore, we evaluate current and emerging therapeutic strategies that aim to restore DC functionality or exploit their antigen‐presenting capabilities, including mRNA vaccines, receptor‐targeted delivery, CD40 agonists, and in situ cellular reprogramming. By integrating mechanistic insights with clinical advances, this review underscores the potential of context‐aware, subset‐specific DC interventions to overcome immune suppression and enhance cancer immunotherapy. Impact statement By dissecting the complexity and plasticity of dendritic cell subsets in cancer, our work offers novel insights into their reprogramming by the tumor microenvironment and therapeutic exploitation, paving the way for next‐generation, context‐aware immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract CD45 plays a central role in immune signal regulation by controlling the spatial dynamics of phosphatase activity through steric segregation of its bulky rigid extracellular domain. To modulate CD45 activity, here we develop and characterize protein engineering approaches to induce multivalent clustering of CD45, effectively mimicking the endogenous local receptor sequestration during immune synapse formation. In doing so, we engineer a biologic that enables precise, tunable control over CD45 surface localization and activity. CD45 sequestration exhibited striking synergy when administered in combination with intratumorally anchored IL-12 therapy, markedly delaying tumor progression and extending survival in syngeneic murine melanoma and carcinoma models. Immune profiling revealed that CD8⁺ T cells are essential mediators of this synergistic antitumor response. Mechanistically, IL-12 initiates a wave of antigen generation and T cell priming, while CD45 sequestration subsequently enhances tumor-specific CD8⁺ T cell activation, expansion, and functional states within the tumor-draining lymph node. These findings suggest that CD45 sequestration lowers the activation threshold of T cells, broadens the tumor-reactive T cell repertoire, and therefore promotes more robust tumor-specific T cell responses. Altogether, we establish CD45 as a promising novel target for cancer immunotherapy, capable of potentiating strong anticancer immune responses.">

        <tr id="Viral and bacterial lung infections place a significant burden on public health. Versican, an extracellular matrix (ECM) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, coordinates the innate immune response in multiple experimental models. Versican’s potential as an immunomodulatory molecule makes it a promising therapeutic target for controlling the host’s immune response to lung infection. However, versican’s contribution to lung inflammation, injury, and immune cell activity during influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a critical knowledge gap. To address our central hypothesis that mesenchymal-derived versican is pro-inflammatory and enhances the innate immune response to IAV infection, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse deficient in mesenchymal-derived versican (B6. Col1a2-CreERT+/−/Vcantm1.1Cwf, Col1a2/Vcan−/−). We report that mesenchymal-derived versican plays a critical role in neutrophil, monocyte, and dendritic cell migration into the lungs and airways early in IAV infection. Intriguingly, mesenchymal-derived versican deficiency had the most substantial negative impact on neutrophil emigration into the lungs. We found that neutrophils were less adhesive to the ECM of Col1a2/Vcan−/− mouse lung fibroblasts (mLFs), which had a significant decrease in versican compared to wild-type mLFs. Additionally, Col1a2/Vcan−/− mLFs treated with poly(I:C) in vitro have reduced cell-associated hyaluronan. These findings suggest that fibroblast-derived versican is necessary for adhesion to lung fibroblasts by neutrophils as they transit into the lung interstitium and airways from the pulmonary vasculature. Our findings demonstrate that mesenchymal-derived versican is a key regulator of the early host immune responses to IAV.">

        <tr id="Background This study aims to explore the common mechanisms between aging and the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods A total of 87 patients with AS and matched controls were analyzed via multidimensional flow cytometry to examine the peripheral blood immune signature. Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to characterize T-cell subsets. The infiltration of Ly49h + cells (the murine homolog of NKG2C) was observed in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model, and functional experiments were conducted to validate the cytotoxicity of NKG2C + CD8 + T cells. The mechanisms were further confirmed via the use of HLA-B27 transgenic mice and RNA-sequencing. Results The peripheral blood immune signature of AS patients exhibited dysregulation similar to that observed during aging. NKG2C + CD8 + T cells activated the PI3K‒Akt signaling pathway and increased phagocytosis in AS patients. HLA-B27 stimulation significantly increased the cytotoxicity of this subset, an effect that could be reversed by NKG2C blockade. In HLA-B27 transgenic mice, Ly49h + T cells exhibited significantly enhanced degranulation ability. RNA sequencing validated the activation of the PI3K‒Akt pathway in NKG2C + CD8 + T cells by HLA-B27. Conclusions HLA-B27 drives the cytotoxicity of aging-related NKG2C + CD8 + T cells via activation of the PI3K‒Akt signaling pathway. Targeting NKG2C inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for AS. This study elucidates the association between immune aging and the pathogenesis of AS, providing theoretical evidence for clinical intervention.

Using single-cell technology, we analyzed infected pig spleens and found macrophages—a type of immune cell—to be the virus’s primary target. Infection depletes disease-fighting cells while favoring virus-supportive conditions. We identified four macrophage subtypes, including one highly susceptible to infection and another with antiviral properties that is rapidly destroyed. The viral E165R gene was essential for ASFV replication while disrupting host defense signals. By tracking cellular changes, we revealed how macrophages drive ASFV progression. Our findings offer insights for future therapies against this global threat.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a debilitating neglected tropical disease characterized by lesions that can range from self-healing to permanent disfigurations. A predominant Th1 response, which stimulates IFN-γ production, is crucial for parasite control during self-healing CL. While IFN-γ primarily activates macrophages to produce nitric oxide via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) leading to parasite control, IFN-γ also activates other downstream pathways involved in cell autonomous immunity. One such pathway is the activation of guanylate binding proteins (GBPs), a class of interferon inducible GTPases. However, the role of GBPs during CL has been minimally explored. Utilizing RNA-Seq we found that Leishmania major infection leads to the upregulation of several GBPs in C57Bl/6 mice. In vitro studies using GBPChr3 knockout (KO), and C57Bl/6 control mice reveal that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from KO mice exhibit higher parasite burdens following IFN-γ treatment, independent of GBP localization to the parasite. Single-cell RNA-Seq identifies macrophages as the primary expressers of GBPs during L. major infection in vivo. In vivo, GBPChr3 KO mice display increased disease severity and parasite load. GBPChr3 KO macrophages and monocytes show elevated ARG-1 and reduced iNOS expression, indicating a shift toward a parasite-permissive environment that supports parasite growth. These findings highlight a critical role for GBPs in immune-mediated control of CL.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neonates have increased vulnerability to life-threatening infections due to the distinct immune landscape. Interleukin (IL)-27 is a key component of this immune profile that we have previously shown to be elevated in both newborn humans and mice. IL-27 continues to increase in the serum and tissues consistent with poor outcomes during gram-negative neonatal bacterial sepsis. Presently, we dissected the IL-27 producer profile at a single-cell level using IL-27p28eGFP reporter mice in our previously established model of neonatal sepsis with luciferase-expressing K1-encapsulated Escherichia coli. Whole animal imaging regionally highlighted the spleen, liver, and lungs as key infection sites by bacterial luminescence. Flow cytometry showed that IL-27 producers increased significantly in the liver with infection and were predominantly F4/80+ and CD11b+ with subpopulations that emerged expressing additional markers. This information paired with single-cell RNA sequencing further identified the most robust populations as monocytes, monocyte-derived cells, and Kupffer cells followed by smaller populations of dendritic cells and neutrophils. The transcriptome demonstrated a diverse range of functionality amongst populations that included differential expression of genes implicated in bactericidal, metabolic, and inflammatory changes. Collectively, the transcriptome of IL-27 producers from the livers of infected animals suggests an uncoordinated mix of inflammatory and suppressive activity that may contribute to immune dysregulation characteristic of sepsis. Together, this work provides previously undescribed insight into the details of IL-27 producers during early-life infection. This further provides essential information needed to support IL-27 as a therapeutic target for neonatal bacterial sepsis.">

        <tr id="Introduction Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is an effective treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, yet the mechanisms underlying immune reset and sustained remission remain incompletely understood. This study provides a longitudinal immune profiling of patients undergoing AHSCT, with a specific focus on immune reconstitution at two years post-AHSCT. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 22 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients at baseline and multiple time points post-AHSCT. Immune reconstitution was characterized using high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry to assess phenotypic changes in B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells. Results AHSCT led to profound alterations in immune cell populations. B-cell recovery was marked by a rapid expansion of naïve B cells, while memory B cells and plasmablasts remained depleted. Notably, patients with evidence of inflammatory disease activity (EIDA) post-AHSCT exhibited higher pre-transplant frequencies of non-switched IgD+IgM+ memory B cells, raising the possibility of a potential biomarker for treatment response. Myeloid-cell reconstitution showed a decline in classical monocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, potentially shifting the immune balance toward a more tolerogenic state. CD4 T-cell reconstitution demonstrated a shift from central memory (Tcm) to effector memory (Tem) phenotypes, with a selective depletion of polyfunctional Th1/Th17cells lacking PD-1 expression. Clusters enriched for PD-1+ Tem CD4 T cells appeared to differ between patients with and without EIDA. Furthermore, an increase in atypical naïve CCR7⁻CD62L⁻ CD4 T cells was observed in EIDA patients, raising questions about their role in the pathophysiology of MS. CD8 T-cell reconstitution followed a similar pattern, with a shift from a naïve/Tcm-dominant to a Tem-skewed population, albeit with substantial interpatient variability. Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells showed a sustained decrease, possibly reflecting microbiota alterations post-transplant. Conclusions Taken together, these findings provide an exploratory characterization of immune reconstitution following AHSCT, highlighting candidate biomarkers and mechanisms that warrant validation in larger cohorts to guide patient stratification and monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Astrocytes provide physical and metabolic support for neurons, regulate the blood–brain barrier, and react to injury, infection, and disease. When astrocytes become reactive, maintenance of the inflammatory state and its functional implications throughout chronic neuroinflammation are all poorly understood. Several models of acute inflammation have revealed astrocyte subpopulations that go beyond a two‐activation state model, instead encompassing distinct functional subsets. However, how reactive astrocyte (RA) subsets evolve over time during chronic inflammatory disease or infection has been difficult to address. Here we use a prolific human pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, that causes lifelong infection in the brain alongside a Lcn2CreERT2 reporter mouse line to examine reactive astrocyte subsets during chronic neuroinflammation. Single‐cell RNA sequencing revealed diverse astrocyte populations including transcriptionally unique Lcn2CreERT2+ RAs which change over the course of infection in a subset‐dependent manner. In addition to an immune‐regulating Lcn2CreERT2+ astrocyte population enriched with gene transcripts encoding chemokines CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and receptors CCR7 and IL7R, a specific subset of Lcn2CreERT2+ astrocytes highly expressed transthyretin (Ttr), a secreted carrier protein involved in glycolytic enzyme activation and potential vasculature regulation and angiogenesis. These findings provide novel information about the evolution and diversity of reactive astrocyte subtypes and functional signatures at different stages of infection, revealing an undocumented role for transthyretin‐expressing astrocytes in immune regulation at the central nervous system (CNS) vasculature.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT NK cells are critical for immunosurveillance, yet become dysfunctional when chronically stimulated by virally infected or cancerous cells. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less characterized, limiting therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, with remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3‐expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating, and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="By balancing immunity and tolerance, dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of immune responses. Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of these cells in connective tissue diseases. Conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) exhibit distinct contributions to disease progression. In systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, pDCs primarily drive pathogenesis via excessive type I interferon production, whereas in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cDCs play a major role in promoting autoreactive T cell activation. Emerging DC subsets, such as inflammatory DC3s and LAMP3+ DCs, have been implicated in RA synovitis. In vasculitis, tissue-resident vascular DCs appear to regulate localized inflammation. Despite advances in single-cell analysis, the functional roles of specific DC subsets remain underexplored in several autoimmune conditions. Understanding DC heterogeneity and function in disease-specific contexts may lead to novel therapeutic strategies targeting DC-mediated immune dysregulation.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms by which Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) infection leads to acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a severe neurological condition characterized by sudden muscle weakness and paralysis, remain poorly understood. To investigate the cellular tropism and infection dynamics of EV-D68, we profiled naive and EV-D68-infected human spinal cord organoids (hSCOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Examining the cellular composition of healthy hSCOs, we found that hSCOs comprise diverse cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and multipotent glial progenitor cells (mGPCs). Upon infection with two EV-D68 strains, US/IL/14-18952 (a B2 strain) and US/MA/18-23089 (a B3 strain), we observed distinct viral tropism and host transcriptional responses. Notably, US/IL/14-18952 showed a significant preference for neurons, while US/MA/18-23089 exhibited higher rates of infection in cycling astrocytes and OPCs. These findings provide novel insights into the host cell tropism of EV-D68 in the spinal cord, offering insight into the potential mechanisms underlying AFM pathogenesis. Understanding the dynamics of infection at single-cell resolution will inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the neurological impact of enteroviral infections.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) significantly contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and targeted inhibition of MDSCs is a potential therapeutic strategy against cancer. Here, we identify macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as a critical regulator of MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression in breast cancer. The present study demonstrates that MARCO is expressed on MDSCs, and breast tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) enriched with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promote MDSC differentiation and amplify immunosuppressive activity by up-regulating MARCO. Genetic ablation of MARCO in a murine breast cancer model attenuated tumor growth, accompanied by reduced monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) and total tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), along with enhanced infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Furthermore, we developed a specific MARCO down-regulation-promoting monoclonal antibody that impeded TDE-induced MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression. In vivo, MARCO down-regulating antibody suppressed tumor growth and reprogrammed the TME by diminishing immunosuppressive MDSCs and TAMs and revitalizing CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Strikingly, combining the MARCO down-regulating antibody with PD-1 blockade synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. This work establishes MARCO as a key regulator of MDSC-mediated immunosuppression and presents a compelling case for the inclusion of MARCO as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.">

The immature DCs (imDCs) and regulatory DCs (DCregs) participate in the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that play adverse role in tumor progression. However, the characteristics of DCs in leukemia microenvironment have not been well established. Here, we identified a novel CD11c+MHCIIlo DC population (T-DC) accumulated in the mouse splenic T-ALL microenvironment. T-DCs exhibited an immature phenotype as they were characterized by low expression of MHCII molecules and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD86, CD83 and CD40. Database analysis revealed that low level expression of DC maturation-associated genes correlated with poor prognosis in leukemia patients. Furthermore, T-DCs promoted T-ALL progression contributed by their attenuated phagocytosis and CD4+ T cell activation potential. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that T-DCs expressed low level of genes related to maturation and antigen processing. T-DCs showed similar expression pattern with DCregs and expressed high levels of immunosuppressive genes. In addition, single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated the heterogeneity of T-DCs, showing that they are mainly compose of cDC1s, cDC2s and macrophage-like DCs. Therefore, our findings uncover the critical role of a novel imDC subset in promoting leukemia progression through the suppression of T-cell immunity. These results may have significant implications for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies aiming at reversing immune evasion in leukemia and improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="B cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). As a receptor of prostaglandin D2, chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells (CRTH2) is known to be involved in Th2 cell activation, but its function in B lymphocytes is unclear. Here, we show that CRTH2 is critical for an IL-1β-producing B cell subset. Mice with B-cell-specific deletion of Crth2 exhibit reduced numbers of IL-1β-producing B cells, resulting in amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal animal model of MS. Compared to wild-type B cells, adoptive transfer of Crth2-deficient B cells attenuates EAE disease severity in B-cell-deficient recipient mice. The IL-1β-producing B cell subpopulation was mainly transitional type 2 B cells identified by flow cytometry and single cell sequencing. Mechanically, CRTH2 promotes IL-1β production in B cells through p38 signaling, and pharmacological inhibition of p38 attenuates EAE disease severity in DK-PGD2-treated mice. Taken together, our results reveal a key function of CRTH2 in driving IL-1β expression in B cells and in controlling their pathogenic activity in autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Objective Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by infection, characterized by high clinical heterogeneity and complex immunopathological mechanisms. Immune dysregulation plays a central role in its progression. This study aims to investigate the compositional changes of immune cells, characteristics of intercellular communication, and potential regulatory mechanisms of N⁶-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in sepsis, with a particular focus on the functional remodeling of platelets. Methods This study integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE167363 dataset) from sepsis patients with m6A methylation sequencing data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Through systematic analysis, we compared the differences in immune cell composition, developmental trajectories, intercellular communication, and m6A modifications among healthy controls, survivors, and non-survivors, and further screened for key m6A-regulated target genes. Results The analysis revealed that platelets gradually accumulated during the progression of sepsis, while B cells, T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) exhibited a trend toward platelet-like phenotypic remodeling. Cell–cell communication analysis showed a marked decline in communication strength among immune cells as the disease worsened, particularly a significant weakening of the APP–CD74 signaling pathway between platelets and B cells, indicating impaired immune network synergy. m⁶A methylation sequencing revealed distinct remodeling of m⁶A peaks and dysregulation of related regulatory factors in non-survivors. Further integrative analysis identified RPA1 as a key m⁶A-regulated target gene, whose expression was closely associated with APP and co-regulated by multiple m6A-modifying factors. Conclusion This study reveals disruptions in immune cell interactions and an m6A-dependent mechanism of platelet functional remodeling during sepsis progression. The identification of the key target gene RPA1 offers new insights into the immunopathological mechanisms of sepsis and lays a theoretical foundation for future precision interventions and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapies represent a promising approach for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse, yet their efficacy is hindered by immunosuppressive factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in the tumor microenvironment. This study investigated the effects of TGF-β on NK cell cytotoxicity and migration using 2D and 3D co-culture models that mimic the leukemic microenvironment. Methods TGF-β production was evaluated in AML-derived leukemic cell lines and mesenchymal stromal cells (hTERT-MSCs) using ELISA. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to analyze global gene expression changes in TGF-β-treated primary human NK cells. NK cell cytotoxicity and migration were assessed in 2D monolayer and 3D spheroid co-cultures containing hTERT-MSCs and leukemic cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results Both leukemic cells and MSCs produced TGF-β, with increased levels observed in MSCs after co-culture with primary AML blasts. RNA sequencing revealed that TGF-β altered key gene pathways associated with NK cell cytotoxicity, adhesion, and migration, supporting its immunosuppressive role. In functional assays, TGF-β exposure significantly reduced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a time-dependent manner and impaired NK cell infiltration into 3D spheroids, particularly in models incorporating MSCs. Additionally, MSCs themselves provided a protective environment for leukemic cells, further reducing NK cell effectiveness in 2D co-cultures. Conclusion TGF-β suppresses both NK cell cytotoxicity and migration, limiting their ability to eliminate leukemic cells and infiltrate the bone marrow niche (BMN). These findings provide novel insights into TGF-β–mediated immune evasion mechanisms and provide important insights for the future design of NK-based immunotherapies and clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Gasdermin D (GSDMD), an effector molecule of cell pyroptosis, is known to be activated in various cells during inflammation. However, the patterns of GSDMD activation in immune regulatory cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) remain unclear. In this study, we found that neutrophils in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues exhibited reduced GSDMD transcription, as evidenced by a single-cell RNA sequencing result. Consistent with this, cleaved GSDMD expression is negatively correlated with S100A8 in CRC tissues. Additionally, CD15+CD14−LOX1+ cells (G-MDSCs) from the peripheral blood of CRC patients exhibited a significant reduction in GSDMD activation. Mice with ubiquitous GSDMD deficiency bred in a clean environment exhibited a notable increase in G-MDSCs. These GSDMD−/− MDSCs enhanced immunosuppressive activity by both inhibiting effector T-cell activity and promoting regulatory T-cell induction. This enhancement was also observed in GSDMDflox/flox-S100A8Cre mice, in which GSDMD was specifically deleted in MDSCs. The tumor-promoting effects in the GSDMD−/− and GSDMDflox/flox-S100A8Cre mice were abrogated following MDSC depletion, as shown by the use of an anti-DR5 antibody. In the absence of GSDMD, G-MDSCs showed reduced inflammasome activation and decreased production of IL-1β and IL-18. Furthermore, a significant reduction in interferon-related factor 8/7 (IRF8/7) was observed in GSDMD−/− G-MDSCs via bulk RNA sequencing analysis. After treatment with LPS/nigericin, these cells maintained mitochondrial integrity, thus impairing the mtDNA release and the downstream cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF8/7 signaling axis activation. Reduced IRF8/7 levels were responsible for increased differentiation of GSDMD−/− G-MDSCs. Finally, treatment with a GSDMD recombinant lentivirus injected into in situ tumors significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced G-MDSC levels, suggesting that a GSDMD-based vaccine could simultaneously exert anti-carcinoma and anti-MDSC effects.

        <tr id="Background Myeloid cells, such as resident microglia (MG), infiltrating monocytes (Mo), macrophages (MΦ), and CNS border-associated macrophages (BAM) in the brain, participate in aged brain injury. Aged microglial replacement is protective against brain injury in aged mice; however, whether/how the molecular changes in myeloid cells are affected by this replacement in injured brains remains unclear. Methods Aged microglia in mice were eliminated by PLX3397 for 21 consecutive days and repopulated following withdrawal for 21 days; then, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) models were constructed. Then, a single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of acutely injured brains in aged mice with microglial replacement was performed. Results We observed similarities but strong divergence in the composition and molecular change features of myeloid cells between the replacement (Rep) and control (Con) groups, indicating retention of the core transcriptome and development of differential genes in myeloid cells after microglial replacement in response to brain injury. Both MG and Mo/MΦ experience modification of immune responses after microglial repopulation, with more prominent changes in MG. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that one term directly related to the “immune response” was shared between upregulated genes in Rep-MG and Rep-Mo/MΦ, while the other terms related to immune functions and other biofunctions were different between Rep-MG and Rep-Mo/MΦ, indicative of significantly different immune responses to brain injury between MG and MΦ. Furthermore, the trajectory analysis showed a significant transition from aged to young state in Rep-MG compared to only a modest youthful shift in Rep-Mo/MΦ, suggesting a rejuvenation process of aged microglia and macrophages toward young ones in response to brain injury after the treatment of microglial replacement. Conclusion Our data indicate that microglial replacement-induced changes in the molecular heterogeneity and state transition of myeloid cells may be neuroprotective against acute brain injury.">

        <tr id="A burgeoning approach to treat cancer is the pharmacological induction of ferroptotic cell death of tumor cells. However, the impact of disrupting anti-ferroptotic pathways in the broader tumor microenvironment (TME), such as in immune cells, is still undefined and may complicate treatments. Here, we show that Ferroptosis Suppressor Protein 1 (FSP1/Aifm2) is critically required for regulatory T cell (Treg) resistance to ferroptosis and their immunosuppressive function within the TME. Compared to other canonical ferroptosis regulators such as GPX4, GCH1, and NRF2, only FSP1 was induced upon T cell activation. Deletion of Aifm2 in all T cells, or Tregs specifically, enhanced tumor control by selectively disrupting Treg immunosuppression within tumors without inciting autoimmune pathology in mice. As opposed to deletion of Gpx4 in all T cells, T cell deletion of Aifm2 did not impair antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These results reveal a unique opportunity for targeting a regulator of ferroptosis that can not only directly target cancer cells, but also simultaneously enhance anti-cancer immune responses without inciting autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="Background Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) triggers a dynamic immune response involving macrophages, However, the functional heterogeneity of these cells and the mechanisms through which they promote repair remain unclear. Although the neuropeptide CGRP has been shown to modulate macrophage phenotypes in other pathological contexts, its role in ICH recovery and white matter repair remains unexplored. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45 + cells from ICH mice (GSE167593 and GSE230414 datasets) identified macrophage subsets. Flow cytometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), behavioral assays, and immunofluorescence validated macrophage dynamics and white matter (WM) integrity. Bone marrow and skull analyses traced macrophage origins. The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was tested via intraperitoneal administration in ICH mice, with outcomes assessed through transcriptomics, ultrastructural imaging, and functional recovery. Results scRNA-seq revealed sustained accumulation of THBS1 + macrophages post-ICH, correlating with WM repair and neurological recovery. These macrophages exhibited pro-repair and remyelination gene signatures (e.g., Arg1, Tgm2). Bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, particularly skull-resident populations, served as the primary source of THBS1 + macrophages. CGRP, elevated in meninges and bone marrow post-ICH, drove macrophage polarization toward THBS + phenotypes. CGRP administration expanded THBS1-positive macrophages in the bone marrow and brain, improving WM integrity (reduced radial diffusivity, higher fractional anisotropy) and sensorimotor function. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed enhanced myelin regeneration (lower g-ratio) in CGRP-treated mice. Conclusions This study identifies a neuroimmune axis wherein CGRP promotes bone marrow-derived THBS1 + macrophages to facilitate WM repair and functional recovery after ICH. Targeting CGRP-macrophage signaling offers a therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery in hemorrhagic brain injury.

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells are well recognized for their role in immune regulation; however, their role in tissue regeneration is not fully understood. This study demonstrates such a role of Tregs in a published preclinical murine model of spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis (PF) expressing a human PF related mutation in the Surfactant Protein-C (SP-C) gene (SFTPCI73T). Genetic crosses of SP-CI73T mice with Foxp3GFP and Foxp3DTR lines were utilized to study Treg behavior during PF development. We found that FoxP3+Tregs accumulate during the transition from inflammation to fibrogenesis, peaking at 21-28 days after mutant SftpcI73T induction localizing to both perivascular and distal fibrotic lung regions. Diphtheria toxin mediated ablation of Tregs at 17 days worsened fibrosis and increased levels of TGFβ and inflammatory cytokines. Tregs expressed Th2 markers (Gata3+) and elaborated factors including amphiregulin (Areg) and Osteopontin (Spp1). Reductionist experiments showed that lung Tregs enhanced organoid formation when co-cultured with alveolar epithelial cells and adventitial fibroblasts, an effect size mimicked using Areg and Spp1 in combination. Our findings demonstrate that immune-mesenchymal-epithelial signaling crosstalk is present in the distal lung wherein Tregs play a protective role by limiting fibrosis and promoting tissue repair, highlighting their broader function beyond immune modulation in lung injury. HIGHLIGHTS In a preclinical model of spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis, regulatory T cells (Tregs) were found to infiltrate the lung coincident with the resolution of early injury and transition to fibrogenesis. Depletion of Tregs at this transition worsened lung injury and enhanced fibrogenesis. Tregs recovered from the fibrotic lung are Type 2 skewed – GATA3+ and produce growth factors (e.g. Amphiregulin, Osteopontin) that promote lung tissue repair in ex vivo organoid models.">

        <tr id="Background Chemotherapy is an integral part of the clinical management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), however, development of chemoresistance occurs frequently. Tumor sensitivity to treatment is known to be strongly influenced by the immune microenvironment, signifying the predictive potential of immune alterations. How tumor cells that acquire resistance may subsequently modulate the immune microenvironment it is still not well described. Here, we investigated immunomodulation in the context of acquired chemoresistance in TNBC, focusing on the role of the secretome. Methods Bulk RNA sequencing and multiplex cytokine profiling were performed on paclitaxel-resistant and -sensitive isogenic variants of TNBC cells to reveal resistance-associated secretome alterations. The immunomodulatory influence of the tumor cell secretome was investigated by exploring its effect on monocytes, macrophages (MΦs) and T cells derived from healthy blood donors. The influence on the immune cell phenotype and activity was evaluated by measuring molecular markers and performing functional assays. To validate the clinical relevance, we utilized longitudinal -omics data from breast cancer patients refractory to standard chemotherapy in the NeoAva clinical trial. CIBERSORT was applied to transcriptomics data to infer MΦ and T cell abundance in individual tumors upon treatment. To evaluate their association with the secretome profiles, patient-matched serum cytokine data were used. Results The acquisition of chemoresistance was accompanied by enhanced secretion of cytokines. Subsequently, the resistant cell secretome affected the abundance, phenotype and activity of immune cells. Specifically, it potentiated the recruitment of monocytes, facilitated the polarization of MΦs towards the immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype, and attenuated the activation of CD8+ T cells. Data from the NeoAva clinical cohort validated the enrichment of M2 MΦs and/or the depletion of M1 MΦs after treatment in the majority of residual tumors. The MΦ-associated changes counteracted CD8+ T cell abundance and were partially associated with the cytokine-enriched secretome. Conclusion Development of chemoresistance in BC is associated with alterations in the tumor secretome, which impairs immune activation and facilitates immunosuppression. Knowledge on the immune microenvironment in residual tumors after standard chemotherapy could aid in selecting rational treatment options for this group of patients.

The review discusses how the complex trafficking between the tumor microenvironment (TME), surrounding lymphoid tissues and peripheral circulation creates multiple opportunities for tumors to evade immune surveillance. Within the TME, T-cell exclusion mechanisms, antigen specificity and the spectrum of T-cell exhaustion states, from progenitor exhausted T cells to terminally exhausted T-cell phenotypes, are reviewed. Beyond the local TME, the crucial roles of tumor-draining lymph nodes and tertiary lymphoid structures in maintaining sustainable antitumor immunity, as well as the significance of circulating T cells as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, are analyzed. This systemic perspective provides insights into the dynamic nature of antitumor immunity and suggests potential strategies for next-generation immunotherapies, including combination approaches targeting multiple immune compartments to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe, diffuse, progressive, and fibrosing interstitial disease leading to respiratory failure and death in the absence of organ transplantation. Substantial evidence has confirmed the pivotal role of fibroblasts in the progression of IPF, yet effective therapeutic options are scarce. Single-cell transcriptomics profiling revealed that among the diverse fibroblast subsets, FAP1+ alveolar fibroblasts (AFs) were pivotal for the progression of IPF. On the basis of these findings, we developed FAP1-targeting chimeric antigen receptor cytotoxic effector regulatory T cells (CAR-cTregs), which leveraged the targeted killing advantage of the currently trending CAR-based immunotherapy for tumors and incorporated the immunosuppressive functions of Tregs to mitigate the inflammation caused by both the disease itself and CAR-T cell infusion. Accordingly, CAR-cTregs were constructed to effectively eliminate FAP1+ fibroblasts in vitro. This cytotoxic effect could be abrogated by inhibitors of the granzyme B/perforin pathway. In the bleomycin-induced PF model, CAR-cTregs were found to reverse fibrosis characterized by diminished recruitment of fibrocytes and improved remodeling of epithelial cells. Together, our results demonstrate that CAR-cTregs can serve as a promising therapeutic option for IPF and provide an alternative strategy for treating multiple chronic inflammatory diseases by inducing both cytotoxicity and immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="Imbalances in the gut microbiome have been linked to increased intestinal permeability and disease flares in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our study revealed that patients with flares of lupus nephritis (LN) and intestinal expansions of the anaerobic commensal, Ruminococcus gnavus (RG), displayed whole blood transcriptome profiles indicative of platelet, neutrophil, and myeloid cell activation, a profile reminiscent of sepsis. Serum analysis confirmed elevated serum levels of Platelet Factor 4 and neutrophil extracellular traps, which significantly correlated with levels of IgG-antibody to a novel lipoglycan (LG) produced by pathogenic RG strains, which was also documented in an independent LN cohort. To test for causality, in vivo mouse models further demonstrated that gut colonization with LG-producing RG strains, as well as a single intraperitoneal challenge with an LG preparation, caused platelet activation and megakaryocytosis in bone marrow and spleen. Mice colonized with RG strains that produce LG developed cellular infiltration of the kidneys by neutrophils and monocytes. Hence, RG expansions during renal flares may identify a specific LN flare endotype driven by thromboinflammatory mechanisms. Antibodies that arise from immune exposure to the RG lipoglycan may serve as a surrogate biomarker, helping to elucidate the impact of the relationship between gut microbiota communities and clinical outcomes in patients afflicted by LN.

        <tr id="Trained immunity represents a recent concept that elucidates the long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells, enabling them to adapt and respond more effectively to subsequent encounters with diverse pathogens. Initially recognized through the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine, Candida albicans infection, and β-glucan administration, this phenomenon challenges the traditional view that immune memory is exclusive to the adaptive immune system. Trained immunity is characterized by epigenetic and metabolic modifications in innate immune cells that facilitate enhanced responses to infections through mechanisms like chromatin remodeling and altered gene expression. This review focuses on the implications of trained immunity within the lung environment, which is constantly exposed to a plethora of pathogens and environmental irritants. We discuss the roles of various immune cell types, including alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, in mediating trained immunity and how these adaptations may influence pulmonary insults and disease. Furthermore, we highlight the potential for leveraging trained immunity to enhance vaccine efficacy and develop novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related lung conditions. As research progresses, understanding trained immunity in the lung could pave the way for innovative interventions that improve lung health and resilience against infections.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) tumors present a major clinical challenge due to complex immune evasion mechanisms and generally poor responses to immunotherapy. Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a critical determinant of immunotherapy resistance. Immunosuppressive cell populations such as regulatory T cells, M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts, together with aberrant cytokine networks and mechanical stress in the tumor stroma, cooperate to exclude T-cell infiltration and induce T-cell exhaustion, thereby undermining the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, TIME-driven signaling pathway activation and epigenetic reprogramming further reinforce immune escape and therapeutic failure. Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies have greatly improved our understanding of these processes. Meanwhile, strategies including multi-target combination immunotherapies, epigenetic modulators, mRNA vaccines, and gut microbiota interventions are under active investigation to reverse resistance and remodel the TIME. This mini review summarizes the multifaceted mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in GI tumors and discusses the potential of emerging therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Immunosenescence describes the gradual remodeling of immune responses, leading to disturbed immune homeostasis and increased susceptibility of older adults for infections, neoplasia and autoimmunity. Decline in cellular immunity is associated with intrinsic changes in the T cell compartment, but can be further pushed by age-related changes in cells regulating T cell immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent inhibitors of T cell activation and function, whose induction requires chronic inflammation. Since aging is associated with low grade inflammation (inflammaging) and increased myelopoiesis, age-induced changes in MDSC induction and function in relation to T cell immunity were analyzed. Results MDSC numbers and functions were compared between “healthy” young and old adults, who were negatively diagnosed for severe acute and chronic diseases known to induce MDSC accumulation. MDSCs were either isolated from peripheral blood or generated in vitro from blood-derived CD14 cells. Aging was associated with significantly increased MDSC numbers in the monocytic- (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSC subpopulations. MDSCs could be induced more efficiently from CD14 cells of old donors and these MDSCs inhibited CD3/28-induced T cell proliferation significantly better than MDSCs induced from young donors. Serum factors of old donors supported MDSC induction comparable to serum factors from young donors, but increased immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs was only achieved by serum from old donors. Elevated immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs from old donors was associated with major metabolic changes and increased intracellular levels of neutral and oxidized lipids known to promote immunosuppressive functions. Independent of age, MDSC-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation required direct MDSC– T cell contact. Besides their increased ability to inhibit activation-induced T cell proliferation, MDSCs from old donors strongly shift the immune response towards Th2 immunity and might thereby further contribute to impaired cell-mediated immunity during aging. Conclusions These results indicate that immunosenescence of innate immunity comprises accumulation and functional changes in the MDSC compartment, which directly impacts T cell functions and contribute to age-associated impaired T cell immunity. Targeting MDSCs during aging might help to maintain functional T cell responses and increase the chance of healthy aging.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite causative links to lymphoproliferative disorders, little is known about early events governing KSHV infection in B lymphocytes. IL‐6 signaling plays a critical role in KSHV‐mediated disease, with human IL‐6 (hIL6) levels correlating with viral load and disease progression. This dynamic is even more complex due to the coexistence of hIL6 and KSHV‐encoded viral IL‐6 (vIL6) in these diseases. We hypothesize that hIL6 and vIL6 play critical, separable and collective roles in the early stages of KSHV infection in B cells. In this study, we use our ex vivo model of KSHV infection in human tonsil lymphocytes to investigate the relative contributions of vIL6 and hIL6 to early infection events in human B cells. We demonstrate that vIL6 and hIL6 collectively suppress KSHV infection in B cells restricting the distribution of KSHV within B cell subsets. We show that vIL6 manipulates hIL6 expression in a subset‐specific manner, and that vIL6 and hIL6 differentially influence the differentiation of germinal center and plasmablasts. Taken together, these results suggest a novel paradigm in which KSHV uses vIL6 to abrogate the GC‐mediated maturation pathway for antibody secreting cells that is driven by hIL6 signaling.">

Here, we describe that TH17 cytokines strongly inhibit expression of critical chemokines in epithelial tissues, which leads to blocking infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells into the colon, rendering resistance to DSS-induced colitis and colon cancer. We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of TH17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. Overall, our findings have identified a previously unrecognized critical gap between TH17 cytokines, epithelial chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration through a C/EBPβ-mediated pathway.">

        <tr id="Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is characterized by a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that enables EOC progression and limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. In this study, we demonstrated that isogenic BRCA2-mutated PEO1 and BRCA2-wild type PEO4 EOC cells induced immunosuppressive TMEs through distinct mechanisms. PEO1 cells produced IFNγ-induced PD-L1 and expressed CD39 and CD73 for generating adenosine. Treatment with the adenosine antagonist CGS15943 reversed PEO1 cell-mediated suppression of effector T cell activation. In contrast, PEO4 cells secreted IFNγ-induced CXCL10 and promoted up-regulation of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Treatment with the CXCL10/CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 attenuated PEO4 cell-induced Tregs and decreased IL10 production. In vivo, administration of a monoclonal antibody against CXCR3 effectively hindered the progression of tumor ascites and prolonged survival in the p53(-/-) ID8 EOC syngeneic mouse model. Additionally, AMG487 treatment synergized with the VEGFA inhibitor bevacizumab, significantly reducing tumor ascites and extending mouse survival. Collectively, our results reveal that EOC leverages CXCL10-induced Tregs or adenosine signaling to dampen T cell-mediated anti-cancer immune responses. These findings suggest that targeting CXCL10/CXCR3 and adenosine signaling could effectively counter immunosuppression of EOC, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for improving patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that plays a critical role in disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, exhibit dual functions, either promoting or suppressing tumor growth depending on their phenotype and interactions within the TME. The presence of immune evasion mechanisms, such as the loss of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression, upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, and metabolic reprogramming (hypoxia-induced glycolysis and lactate accumulation), further contributes to immune suppression and poor treatment responses. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, response rates remain highly variable, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven patient selection and combinatorial therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis represent established therapies for many cancers. However, resistance occurs in most patients due to complex immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment. NK cells can play effector roles in tumor control, but their impact on T-cell dysfunction and ICB efficacy remains controversial. Through genetic and antibody-mediated NK cell depletion, we found that a subset of tumor-associated NK cells plays a negative role in ICB sensitivity; they further impede CD8+ T-cell differentiation toward a CD69+ BCL2+ EOMES+ GZMB+ TIM3- GITR- phenotype. Mechanistically, the retinoic acid receptor α-dependent differentiation program in CD8+ T cells is hindered by tumor-infiltrating NK cells via competition for IFNα and IL-2. Finally, we observed that lower frequencies of NK cells correlate with better clinical responses to ICBs in patients with cancer. These findings suggest potential avenues for enhancing CD8+ T cell-centered immunotherapy by targeting regulatory NK cells.


SIGNIFICANCE
Although NK cells are traditionally viewed as antitumor effectors, our study uncovers their unexpected suppressive role in CD8+ T cell-based immunotherapy. By competing for cytokines, they disrupt retinoic acid receptor α-driven CD8+ T-cell differentiation and limit ICB efficacy. Clinically, reduced NK cell presence is associated with an enhanced immunotherapy response. See related article by Pozniak et al. p. XX.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has emerged as a cornerstone strategy for augmenting therapeutic efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The immunosuppressive AML microenvironment, characterized by profound immune dysfunction, critically impairs anti-leukemic immune surveillance. This immunologically hostile niche is principally governed by specialized immunosuppressive cell populations—notably regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs), and regulatory B cells (Bregs)—which collectively establish an immune-privileged sanctuary for leukemic cells. This review critically examines three fundamental aspects of these immunosuppressive regulators in AML pathogenesis: (1) their recruitment dynamics within the leukemic niche, (2) the molecular mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive functions, and (3) current and emerging therapeutic approaches designed to neutralize their inhibitory effects. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to provide a mechanistic framework for developing more effective immunotherapeutic interventions against AML.">

These effects were observed following the treatment of splenic mononuclear cells with erythroblast-conditioned media received from both healthy mice and mice subjected to hematopoiesis-activating conditions (hypoxia, blood loss, and hemolytic anemia), suggesting a common mechanism of action. Using flow cytometry, we elucidated that erythroblast-derived soluble products modulate T cell differentiation by promoting Treg development and increasing PD-1 surface expression on B cells. The immunoregulatory potential of erythroblasts is subpopulation-dependent: CD45+ erythroblasts respond to hemolytic stress by upregulating the surface expression of immunosuppressive molecules PDL1 and Galectin-9, while CD45- erythroblasts primarily increase TGFb production. These findings highlight the regulatory role of erythroblasts in modulating immune responses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing natural killer (NK) cells has demonstrated success against hematological malignancies. Efficacy against solid tumors has been limited by poor NK cell survival and function in the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To enhance efficacy against solid tumors, stimulatory cytokines have been incorporated into CAR-NK cell therapeutic approaches. However, current cytokine strategies have limitations, including systemic toxicities, exogenous dependencies, and unwanted TME bystander effects. Here, we aimed to overcome these limitations by modifying CAR-NK cells to express a constitutively active interleukin (IL)-7 receptor, termed C7R, capable of providing intrinsic CAR-NK cell activation that does not rely on or produce exogenous signals nor activate bystander cells. Methods We examined persistence, antitumor function, and transcriptional profiles of CAR-NK cells coexpressing C7R in a novel tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) co-culture system and against hematologic and solid tumor xenografts in vivo. Results Peripheral blood NK cells expressing a CAR directed against the solid tumor antigen GD2 and modified with C7R demonstrated enhanced tumor killing and persistence in vitro compared with CAR-NK cells without cytokine support and similar functions to CAR-NK cells supplemented with recombinant IL-15. C7R.CAR-NK cells exhibited enhanced survival and proliferation within neuroblastoma TiME xenografts in vivo but produced poor long-term tumor control compared with CAR-NK cells supplemented with IL-15. Similar results were seen using C7R-expressing CD19.CAR-NK cells against CD19+leukemia xenografts. Gene expression analysis revealed that chronic signaling via C7R induced a transcriptional signature consistent with intratumor stressed NK cells with blunted effector function. We identified gene candidates associated with chronic cytokine-stressed NK cells that could be targeted to reduce CAR-NK cell stress within the solid TME. Conclusion C7R promoted CAR-NK cell survival in hostile TMEs independent of exogenous signals but resulted in poor antitumor function in vivo. Our data reveals the detrimental role of continuous IL-7 signaling in CAR-NK cells and provides insights into proper application of cytokine signals when attempting to enhance CAR-NK cell antitumor activity.">

        <tr id="Macrophages, as key sentinel cells of the innate immune system, can retain memory of prior stimulus exposure. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) plays a central role in maintaining trained immunity in vivo and can induce potent memory in macrophages. Such memory is associated with the formation of de novo enhancers that alter gene expression responses to subsequent stimuli. However, how such enhancers are maintained after cytokine exposure remains unclear. We report that durable IFNγ-induced enhancers can last for days after cytokine washout, yet the underlying persistence mechanism is not cell-intrinsic. IFNγ-treated macrophages continue to exhibit JAK/STAT signaling days after cytokine removal. Blocking IFNγ signaling with a JAK inhibitor or anti-IFNγ neutralizing antibodies after cytokine removal is sufficient to reverse IFNγ-induced enhancers and erase the potentiated state of the treated macrophages. Our findings suggest that epigenetic changes in macrophages do not inherently encode innate immune memory or a “potentiated” macrophage state, but in fact are themselves dependent on ongoing cytokine signaling. These findings suggest new possibilities for pharmacologic interventions to reverse aberrantly trained immune states associated with pathology.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) exhibits complex dynamics among immune, stromal, and malignant cells that drive immune escape (IE) mechanisms and influence clinical outcomes. Through single-cell RNA sequencing and high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA), we identified a crucial IE-related gene module most strongly associated with KIRC progression. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering delineated two distinct IE patterns, with pattern one demonstrating prolonged patient survival. Employing advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms, we identified Cathepsin S (CTSS) as the most pivotal tumor suppressor, with elevated CTSS expression consistently predicting improved survival across multiple independent cohorts. Functional analyses revealed significant enrichment of CTSS in immune-regulatory pathways, including B/T cell activation and inflammatory activity. Mutation profiling uncovered distinct genomic alterations in 5q35.3 among CTSS-high tumors, while drug response prediction identified eight potential therapeutic agents (e.g., Navitoclax, Ibrutinib) exhibiting enhanced efficacy in these patients. Notably, CTSS expression strongly correlated with immune cell infiltration and established immunotherapy biomarkers, supporting its dual role as both a prognostic indicator and predictor of immune response. This study provides mechanistic insights into IE in KIRC and positions CTSS as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for precision immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) typically present with widespread metastasis, obscuring a temporal understanding of tumor-immune dynamics. To address this, we perform multi-site global proteomics alongside matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. We order the protein expression profiles using an unbiased pseudotime analysis, recapitulating clinical observations of metastatic progression, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlates with immune cell infiltration, the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to counterbalance γδ T cell abundance, and an increased abundance of exhausted CD8⁺ T cells. The accumulation of Tregs at metastatic sites correlates with SNX8 expression, a critical regulator of the STING pathway. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruit Tregs via MHC class II, fostering an inflammatory phenotype with limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Together, our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with both localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC.">

In addition, in vitro cultures of tonsil cells are straightforward to process and enable the assessment of Tfh cell biology under various conditions. Here, we introduce a protocol for collection, isolation, preservation, and culture of human tonsil cells. We also describe two optimized spectral flow cytometry panels designed for in-depth characterization of Tfh cells.

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are temporary abnormal collections of lymphoid tissues in which specialized immune responses against tumors can occur. B cells are crucial for the prognostic prediction of various cancers, particularly in response to immunotherapy. There are many types of B cells within the TME, including naive, terminally differentiated plasma, and memory B cells. Our focus was to understand the various types of B cells and how radiation therapy influences B cells in TLS. In this review, we discuss the notion that radiotherapy may alter the creation and function of B cells in TLS, which could result in a powerful and advanced form of cancer immunity.">

        <tr id="Prolonged or broad-spectrum antibiotic courses are associated with intestinal dysbiosis and cytopenias, and depletion of hematopoietic progenitor populations following antibiotics is associated with loss of peripheral immune cells, leading to increased susceptibility to systemic infections. We evaluated the bone marrow hematopoietic compartment in a murine model of antibiotic exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a substantial and previously unrecognized depletion of bone marrow B cells at all stages of development in antibiotic-treated mice, further confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. Depletion of the microbiota was associated with rapid changes in the peripheral B cell compartment, yet fecal microbiota transfer did not rescue both peripheral and bone marrow B cells to a greater degree than natural recovery from antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic-mediated loss of B cell progenitors was secondary to enhanced apoptosis and occurred independent of disrupted systemic type I and II interferon signaling, previously implicated in the maintenance of other hematopoietic compartments. Instead, the depletion of pro-survival MYC signaling was implicated in the depletion of circulating lymphocytes and bone marrow B cell progenitor populations during antibiotic treatment. Further, in vitro exposure of bone marrow cells to antibiotics demonstrated significantly decreased viability of B cells. We conclude that both microbiota depletion and cytotoxic effects of prolonged broad spectrum antibiotic treatment disrupt cytokine and cell survival signaling critical for B cell progenitor maintenance. These results contribute to our understanding of the compartment-specific mechanisms by which the microbiota maintains the hematopoietic system and suggest critical pathways for maintenance of bone marrow progenitors during prolonged antibiotic treatment.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous group of immune cells that play a central role in regulating host immune responses during fungal infections. Their recruitment is mediated by pathogen recognition receptors, particularly Dectin-1 and CARD9 signaling, which promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-1β. Once activated, MDSCs suppress T-cell and natural killer cell functions through immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β, as well as enzymes such as arginase-1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1). This review explores the role of MDSCs in fungal infections caused by Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Aspergillus spp., and Cryptococcus neoformans, emphasizing their impact on immune modulation and disease progression. The emerging evidence suggests that fungal bioactive compounds, such as polysaccharides, can influence MDSC activity and restore immune balance. Notably, therapies targeting MDSCs have demonstrated promise in both fungal infections. In particular, infections with P. brasiliensis and C. neoformans show improved T-cell responses following MDSC-targeted interventions. Additionally, polysaccharides from Grifola frondosa and exposure to Aspergillus sydowii affect MDSC behavior, supporting the potential of modulating these cells therapeutically.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The hyporesponsiveness of tumor-infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells to tumor cells contributes to immune escape of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), representing a major challenge in current immunotherapy. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Methods We first examined myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT) expression in RCC cell lines and clinical specimens, and analyzed its correlation with CD8+ T-cell exhaustion markers. To investigate the immunoregulatory role of MIAT, we evaluated its effects on CD8+ T-cell function using T-cell co-culture systems and humanized-peripheral blood mononuclear cells RCC patient-derived xenograft models. To determine the direct effects of MIAT on tumor cells, we assessed RCC cell malignant phenotypes following MIAT knockdown both in vitro and in immunodeficient nude mouse orthotopic xenograft models. Mechanistically, we employed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromatin isolation by RNA purification followed by mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to identify the molecular interactions between MIAT, transcription factors, and target genes. Results MIAT was highly expressed in RCC cells and positively correlated with CD8+ T-cell exhaustion status. MIAT knockdown significantly enhanced CD8+ T-cell function with increased perforin and interferon-γ production, while reducing the expression of exhaustion markers programmed cell death protein 1 and T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains. Mechanistically, MIAT was predominantly localized in the nucleus and formed a trimeric complex with transcription factor ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) and janus kinase 3 (JAK3) promoter, thereby upregulating JAK3 expression and activating the JAK3/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Importantly, ectopic expression of JAK3 largely abolished both the tumor-suppressive effects and enhanced T-cell function induced by MIAT depletion. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that the MIAT/JAK3/STAT3 pathway plays a critical role in malignant progression and immune escape of RCC through regulating CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for RCC immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The transmembrane protein Tim-3 has received significant attention in recent years as a possible immunotherapy target. This is due to its robust expression on dysfunctional, exhausted, T cells found in the settings of cancer and chronic infection and biochemical evidence suggesting an inhibitory function of Tim-3. However, numerous clinical trials of putative Tim-3 blocking antibodies have yielded modest benefits, at best, in clinical trials for various cancers. Thus, there is a need to more fully understand the function of Tim-3 in vivo. Here we have studied the function of Tim-3 early during a T cell response to LCMV Armstrong, which causes an acute viral infection in mice. We show that Tim-3 is rapidly expressed after infection and that the expression of Tim-3 is associated with acquisition of a type I effector phenotype, including expression of T-bet and downregulation of Tcf-1, by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition, we demonstrate that knockout or cytoplasmic truncation of Tim-3 attenuates the acquisition of the effector program by T cells after LCMV Armstrong infection. Together, these data help to clarify the role of Tim-3 during acute infection.">

        <tr id="Background Aging is linked to various dysfunctions of the immune system, including the decline of its primary developmental source: the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. This decline leads to chronic inflammation, increased vulnerability to infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and reduced vaccine efficacy. As individuals age, the HSC niche undergoes significant changes, including greater adipocyte accumulation and alterations in the molecular microenvironment, which may influence the development and function of immune cells. Among these cells, the impact of the aging HSC niche on dendritic cell (DC) function is less understood. Heterochronic autologous HSC transplantation is a promising intervention to prevent age-related disorders, contributing to the extension of healthspan and longevity, however, several murine experiments failed to produce the expected results, which led us to presume that the problem lies within the old HSC niche. Therefore, we created in vitro models of young and old HSC niches and examined how these microenvironments affect the differentiation and maturation and functionality of BM-derived DCs (BMDCs). Results An analysis of the conditioned media from young and aged HSC niches revealed that the environment of aged niches exhibited an increased presence of adiponectin. This media was subsequently utilized in BMDC differentiation and maturation protocols, with their effects closely monitored. Our results indicate that the old HSC niche microenvironment promotes premature BMDC activation, characterized by elevated MHC class II expression and enhanced allostimulatory capacity of BMDCs at their immature stage. Additionally, LPS stimulation of BMDCs, used to induce DC maturation, significantly increased CD86 expression on BMDCs from the aged niche. However, these cells did not show superior allostimulatory capacity compared to their counterparts from the young niche environment. By analyzing the BMDC cytokine profile, we observed that when cultured in aged niche-conditioned media, the BMDCs secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6, indicating a heightened proinflammatory activation state. Conclusions Collectively, our findings suggest that aging-related changes within the HSC niche can considerably alter DC functionality by disrupting their normal development from BM precursors. These results emphasize the significance of this phenomenon and its implications for immunosenescence.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Oncolytic virus (OV)-mediated immunotherapy has been shown limited efficacy. Small molecule inhibitors specific to the KRASG12C driver oncoprotein have recently been developed for cancer treatment. The combination of a potent OV with a KRASG12C inhibitor could be a potent combination strategy for treating KRASG12C cancer. Methods We explored combination therapies using KRASG12C inhibitor and OV in cancer cells in vitro and in two KRASG12C cancer models. We employed flow cytometry to evaluate the immune cell profiles, including dendritic cells, macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, natural killer (NK), subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and exhaustion markers (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3), activation markers (granzyme B, IFN-γ and 4-1BB) as well as enzyme-linked immunospot assay to identify tumor-antigen specific T cells. The importance of CD4+, CD8+ T and NK cells in the therapeutic effects was evaluated by antibody-mediated depletion in vivo. Results We confirmed that three inhibitors for KRASG12C, AMG510 (sotorasib), MRTX849 (adagrasib) and MRTX1257, all displayed potent cytotoxicity to cancer cells harboring KRASG12C, but not to cancer cells without this specific KRAS mutation in vitro. All three inhibitors exhibited potent antitumor activity in KRASG12C Lewis lung cancer, but not in MC38 colon cancer with wild-type KRAS. In two KRASG12C tumor models, either an IL-36γ-armed OV or orally delivered MRTX1257 inhibited tumor growth, but the combination worked much more efficiently, and efficacy was further improved with PD-1 blockade although with no statistical difference in survival, leading to complete tumor remission in a large fraction of the mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that MRTX1257, and other KRASG12C inhibitors as well, are potent inducers of antitumor immunity by themselves, and that it worked with OV to elicit potent innate and adaptive tumor-specific immunity. The combination therapeutic efficacy depended largely on increased tumor-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and to a smaller degree, on CD4+ T and NK cells. Conclusions Small molecule inhibitors of KRASG12C are novel inducers of tumor-specific immunity, and a unique triple combination regimen is highly efficacious through elicited potent antitumor immunity for KRASG12C cancers.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Emerging clinical and mouse tumor data indicate that tumor cells induce immune suppression in an anatomical site-specific manner. In lung metastases, tumor cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) engages myeloid cell programmed cell death protein 1 to activate SHP2 to suppress type I interferon (IFN-I) expression to repress Cxcl9 expression to impair cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) tumor recruitment. Loss of IFN-I expression thus underlies tumor immune evasion in lung metastases niche. We aimed at testing the hypothesis that forcing tumor cells to express IFNα2 activates Cxcl9 expression to increase CTL tumor recruitment to suppress lung metastasis. Methods Codon usage-optimized IFNα2-encoding DNA was designed and cloned to plasmid. IFNα2-encoding messenger RNA (mRNA) was synthesized. The plasmid DNA and mRNA were encapsulated into DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate)-cholesterol to generate lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mouse IFNα2 (LNP-mIFNα2), human IFNα2 plasmid, and mouse IFNα2 mRNA (LNP-mIFNα2-mRNA). Mouse breast tumor spontaneous lung metastasis, mouse melanoma experimental lung metastasis, and human colon tumor experimental lung metastasis humanized mouse models were used to determine LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid and mRNA efficacy in IFNα2 expression and antitumor immunity, toxicity, and mechanism of action in vivo. Results LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid primarily accumulated in tumor-bearing lungs in mice. LNP-IFNα2 therapy produces mouse IFNα2 protein in mouse tumor-bearing mice and human IFNα2 protein in human tumor-bearing humanized mice to suppress lung metastasis, respectively. Similarly, LNP-mIFNα2-mRNA therapy produces mouse IFNα2 protein and suppressed lung metastasis in tumor-bearing mice. The increased IFNα2 protein activates Cxcl9 expression and increases T cell infiltration in lung metastases. LNP-IFNα2 therapy did not induce liver toxicity and inflammatory cytokines. In human patients with cancer, IFN-I pathway activation is correlated with CXCL9 expression and T cell expansion after PD-(L)1 immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Mechanistically, LNP-delivered IFNα2 suppresses tumor lung metastasis through upregulating Cxcl9 in tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions Our findings determine that LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid DNA and mRNA are effective agents in restoring IFNα2 expression to activate Cxcl9 expression to enhance T cell tumor recruitment to suppress tumor lung metastasis. LNP-IFNα2 is potentially a safe and yet effective third-generation IFNα2 agent for human cancer immunotherapy to treat patients with lung metastasis.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoints expressed by immune cells are critical mediators of immune suppression in cancer. Recently, the role of VISTA, an immune checkpoint, in suppressing T cells has been highlighted in several studies. However, its involvement in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains underexplored. In this study, we analyzed the expression of VISTA, the immune-regulatory marker CD244, and its corresponding ligand CD48. Additionally, we examined the expression of the transcription factors FOXD3 and PVRL2 in pediatric patients with B-ALL. Peripheral blood samples from pediatric patients with naïve B-ALL were analyzed using flow cytometry. Additionally, real-time PCR was used to evaluate the downstream regulatory gene FOXD3 expression and the immune regulator PVRL2. VISTA was overexpressed on blasts in B-ALL patients. Also, the frequency of CD3+CD8+VISTA+ T cytotoxic cells was significantly higher in patients compared to controls, while CD3+CD4+VISTA+ T helper cells were reduced. CD19+VISTA+ cells were more abundant in the complete remission group compared to the non-complete remission group. FOXD3, a key regulator of VISTA, was significantly downregulated in B-ALL, consistent with VISTA overexpression. The CD244/CD48 interaction, which can promote anti-tumoral immune responses, showed a reduction in CD3+CD4+CD48+ and CD19+CD48+ cells, while CD3+CD8+CD48+ cells were increased. VISTA overexpression and FOXD3 downregulation in B-ALL, alongside altered CD48, and PVRL2 expression, highlight mechanisms of immune evasion. These findings position VISTA as a promising biomarker and target for B-ALL immunotherapy.

        <tr id="The traditional paradigm of multiple sclerosis (MS) as a T cell-mediated disorder has been challenged by the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting CD20-expressing lymphocytes. Although these are mostly represented by B cells, the CD20 marker is expressed by 2–6% of T cells (CD20+ T), which are effectively depleted in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients by anti-CD20 mAbs. CD20+ T cells are characterized by a pro-inflammatory phenotype and increased potential for migrating and invading the central nervous system (CNS) compared to CD20− T cells. Furthermore, CD20+ T cells are detected within brain inflammatory lesions from MS patients and actively participate in the experimental MS model. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on CD20+ T cells, from their identification and characterization to evidence of depletion by disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), likely contributing to therapeutic efficacy. Conflicting hypotheses on the origin and development of CD20+ T cells will also be discussed, as well as evidence from clinical and preclinical studies supporting their pathogenetic role in MS.">

Responders often exhibit upregulated baseline inflammatory signatures; however, these markers capture only a single facet of the Cancer-Immunity Cycle—a comprehensive model describing the sequential steps required for effective anti-cancer immunity. To determine whether non-responsiveness to immunotherapy arises from single or multiple ‘defective’ steps, we analyzed in melanoma patients, treated with neoadjuvant immunotherapy, gene signatures representing each step of the cycle. Patients not achieving a major pathological response showed overall lower expression of these signatures. Among the ‘immune-hot’ patients, we identified a low response subgroup defective in one step (‘homing-to-the-tumor,’ involving CXCL9 and CXCL10), making this a promising target for improving their outcomes.

It remains a predominant etiology of end-stage liver pathologies, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While nucleos(t)ide analog (NUC) therapies effectively suppress viral replication, functional cure is achieved in less than 1% of patients annually. Given that viral clearance fundamentally requires reconstitution of antiviral immunity, emerging therapeutic paradigms necessitate combinatorial strategies integrating direct-acting antiviral agents with immunomodulatory interventions. Substantial research efforts have been directed toward elucidating the immunological mechanisms underlying HBV persistence during chronic infection.

To investigate tissue-specific immune responses to CMV, we analysed paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) from HCMV-seropositive donors using multiparametric flow cytometry and cytokine FluroSpot assays. We assessed immune cell composition, memory T cell subsets, cytokine production, cytotoxic potential, activation marker expression, and checkpoint inhibitory receptor (CIR) profiles, both ex vivo and following stimulation with lytic and latent HCMV antigens. BMMNCs were enriched in CD34+ progenitor cells and exhibited distinct T cell memory subset distributions. HCMV-specific responses were compartmentalised: IFN-γ responses predominated in PBMCs following lytic antigen stimulation, while IL-10 and TNF-α responses were more prominent in BMMNCs, particularly in response to latent antigens. US28-specific T cells in the BM showed elevated expression of CD39, PD-1, BTLA, CTLA-4, ICOS, and LAG-3 on CD4+ T cells and increased expression of PD-1, CD39, BTLA, TIGIT, LAG-3, and ICOS on CD8+ T cell populations, suggesting a more immunoregulatory phenotype. These findings highlight functional and phenotypic differences in HCMV-specific T cell responses between blood and bone marrow, underscoring the role of the BM niche in shaping antiviral immunity and maintaining viral latency.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that is often resistant to conventional therapies. The present narrative review discusses on the role of T cell metabolic reprogramming in the AML tumor microenvironment (TME), which markedly impacts the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The TME of AML, influenced by factors such as high lactic acid (LA) levels, hypoxia and nutrient competition, hampers T cell functions such as glycolysis, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, leading to impaired T cell proliferation and antitumor response. Metabolic waste products, including LA and adenosine, further contribute to the immunosuppressive environment. T cell exhaustion, induced by nutrient deprivation and metabolic dysregulation, serves a key role in the failure of immune responses. Moreover, strategies to modulate T cell metabolism, such as targeting glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, show promise in enhancing immunotherapy outcomes. The current review also highlights emerging technologies, such as single-cell metabolomics and CRISPR screening, which are critical for identifying metabolic targets and advancing personalized therapies. Despite challenges in translating these findings to clinical settings, understanding T cell metabolism in the AML TME offers new therapeutic avenues for improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Innate immune cells constitute the majority of the tumor microenvironment (TME), where they mediate both natural anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy responses. While single-cell T- and B-cell receptor sequencing has provided fundamental insights into the clonal dynamics of human adaptive immunity, the lack of appropriate tools has precluded similar analysis of innate immune cells. Here, we describe a method that leverages somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to reconstruct clonal lineage relationships between single cells across cell types in native human tissues. We jointly sequenced single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin and mtDNA to profile n =124,958 cells from matched tumor, non-involved lung tissue (NILT), and peripheral blood of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, as well as n =93,757 cells from matched tumor and peripheral blood of ovarian cancer patients. Single-cell concomitant profiling of lineage and cell states of thousands of immune cells resolved clonality across cell types, tissue sites, and malignancies. Clonal tracing of innate immune cells demonstrates that TME-resident myeloid subsets, including macrophages and type 3 dendritic cells (DC3), are clonally linked to both circulating and tissue-infiltrating monocytes. Further, we identify distinct DC-biased and macrophage-biased myeloid clones, enriched in the tumor and NILT, respectively, and find that their circulating monocyte precursors exhibit distinct epigenetic profiles, suggesting that myeloid differentiation fate may be predetermined before TME infiltration. These results delineate the clonal pathways of intratumoral myeloid cell recruitment and differentiation in human cancer and suggest that remodeling of the tumor myeloid compartment may be peripherally programmed.">

        <tr id="Standing as the most aggressive form of primary malignant tumor, Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors with marked heterogeneity represents one of the enormous challenges in glioma treatment. Myeloid cells, which includes neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, microglia, and macrophages, play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment of GBM. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), T cells and natural killer (NK) cells exert anti-tumor functions, whereas myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can promote tumor progression by suppressing these immune responses. Therefore, MDSCs play a critical role in shaping the effectiveness of immunotherapy. TME has constrained the ability of traditional GBM treatment approaches to significantly enhance prognostic outcomes for patients. This category encompasses conventional therapies like surgical resection and radiation therapy, along with cutting-edge methodologies such as immunotherapy. Through extensive investigations into the dynamic interactions between the GBM microenvironment and neoplastic cells, both targeted treatment strategies and innovative immunotherapeutic modalities have emerged, offering promising new directions for clinical intervention. This review focuses on the interactions between GBM and myeloid cells (MCs), providing novel insights into the oncogenesis and progression of GBM.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a high-mortality cancer due to its aggressive nature and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which enables evasion of immune surveillance. Despite chemotherapy and targeted therapies, 5-year survival is ~ 30%, necessitating novel immunotherapies. AML suppresses cytotoxic T/NK cells by co-opting regulatory pathways, creating an “immune paradox.” Emerging strategies aim to disrupt this evasion. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 nivolumab and anti-CD47 magrolimab, combined with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), enhance T-cell activity and phagocytosis, especially in TP53-mutated AML. Therapeutic vaccines targeting leukemia-associated antigens (e.g., WT1, PRAME) via dendritic cell fusion show early success in prolonging remission. Combinatorial approaches, like HMAs with STING agonists or dual checkpoint blockade, target multiple immunosuppressive pathways to overcome resistance. Challenges include TME heterogeneity, therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells, toxicities (e.g., anemia, cytokine release syndrome), relapse from clonal evolution, and a lack of predictive biomarkers. Autologous therapies face economic and logistical hurdles, driving demand for scalable solutions. Advances in single-cell genomics, AI, and synthetic biology are identifying novel targets (TIM-3, TIGIT, VISTA) and improving patient stratification. Integrating these innovations may transform AML into a chronic condition, bridging preclinical potential to clinical impact. In this review, we aim to evaluate mechanisms, challenges, and future directions of immunotherapies in AML with highlighting ICIs and vaccination to improve therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cytokine-induced memory-like natural killer cells (CIMLNK) represent a novel form of adoptive cellular therapy that is easy to manufacture and readily available. These cells are generated after overnight stimulation of purified natural killer (NK) cells with interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-15 (IL-15), and interleukin-18 (IL-18). While CIMLNK has demonstrated efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), its potential application in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains unclear. Tafasitamab (TAFA), a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against CD19, a surface antigen expressed on B-ALL cells, has been developed to augment anti-tumor efficacy through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a mechanism predominantly mediated by NK cells. Consequently, we sought to assess the susceptibility of B-ALL to the combination of CIMLNK and TAFA using three B-ALL cell lines: NALM6, SUP-B15, and RS4;11. The addition of TAFA significantly augmented the cytotoxic activity, degranulation capacity, and IFN-γ production of CIMLNK. TAFA-induced ADCC was found to be dose-dependent and was abolished after CD16 blockade. Furthermore, TAFA-mediated effects against NALM6 and SUP-B15 were more pronounced in CIMLNK compared to unstimulated NK cells. In vivo, the combination of CIMLNK and TAFA led to a more pronounced survival benefit in leukemia-bearing mice. In summary, our findings suggest that this combination holds promise as a potential alternative treatment option for patients with relapsed refractory B-ALL.">

A key mediator of immune evasion in ovarian cancer is the infiltration and activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which suppress antitumor immunity and foster therapeutic resistance. Emerging therapeutic strategies to target Tregs—such as cytokine modulation, checkpoint blockade, metabolic inhibitors, and epigenetic regulators—are critically evaluated for their potential to restore antitumor immunity. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding how the ovarian TME shapes Treg biology, highlighting mechanisms such as cytokine signaling, chemokine-driven recruitment, metabolic reprogramming, and immune checkpoint interactions, as well as the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, including tissue-resident and follicular subsets, and their clonal expansion in response to tumor antigens. By elucidating the dynamic crosstalk between Tregs and the ovarian TME, this review provides a framework for developing novel immunotherapies to overcome Treg-mediated immunosuppression and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="The liver presents a unique immune system. Liver diseases are closely associated with the immune system. Disruption of the tightly regulated balance between immune activation and tolerance induction leads to the development and worsening of immune-related liver diseases. T cells play diverse crucial roles in the immune system, and they have long been known to induce inflammation through direct tissue damage by effector molecules and the recruitment of effector cells via chemokines. Additionally, T cells interact with B cells to induce autoantibodies, promoting tissue inflammation and dysfunction through the deposition of IgG and immune complexes in the tissues. Recent advances in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have elucidated the role of T cells in the progression and recovery of liver fibrosis. Moreover, comprehensive and unbiased information can now be obtained from small samples of human and mouse tissues, which advances our understanding of tissue-specific functions of T cells, including resident memory T cells, peripheral helper T cells, and tissue Tregs. However, significant unmet needs remain in the fields of immune-related liver diseases. In this review, we discuss the T cell biology and its role in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which are non-viral liver diseases exhibiting a strong involvement of immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, the latest therapeutic concepts for the diseases and associated drugs targeting T cells have been overviewed.">

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are complex immune structures that spontaneously form within and outside of the tumor microenvironment, resembling secondary lymphoid organs. The formation of TLS formation dynamically adapts to the tumor microenvironment, with their immune function maintained by resident immune cells and cytokine networks. TLS develops antitumor immune competence following dynamic reorganization of their cellular components and proportions, although the precise mechanistic underpinnings remain to be fully characterized. Numerous studies have demonstrated that TLS can modulate the immune status of CRC, potentially enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Currently, the clinical setting lacks appropriate immunological markers to assess immunotherapy outcomes, and TLS may offer a solution to this limitation. This article will review current research on TLS as a novel therapeutic target in the immunotherapy of malignant colorectal tumors.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) pathogenesis involves immune dysregulation, genetic factors, and bile duct pathology; however, a comprehensive pathogenesis model and effective therapeutic strategies remain limited. Here, we develop a novel human liver multilineage organoid (Mulorg) model combined with Mdr2−/− mice to investigate the pro-fibrotic role of T helper 17 cells (Th17) and the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVMSC) for PSC, particularly periductal fibrosis. EVMSC alleviates interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-induced fibrotic Mulorgs (FibHOs) and mitigates periductal fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice by inhibiting Th17 differentiation, decreasing Th17 numbers, and lowering intrahepatic IL-17A levels. Functional assays, miRNA array, and CUT & Tag analyses reveal that EVs-derived hsa-miR-7977 targets NFKBIZ, repressing IκBζ translation to reduce IL-17A and its downstream targets involved in Th17 differentiation, IL-17 signaling, and bile secretion pathways. Moreover, miR-7977-enriched EVMSC efficiently reduces IL-17A+ cell percentages in fibrotic areas and improves periductal fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice. Co-culture of FibHOs with Th17 found miR-7977 inhibits Th17 migration to the periductal fibrosis area, with distinct morphological differences observed between patient- and healthy-derived FibHOs. These findings demonstrate that EV-derived miR-7977 mitigates the periductal fibrosis microenvironment by inhibiting Th17 differentiation and migration, the former by targeting NFKBIZ, regulating IL-17A and IκBζ-targeted gene expression. This study clarifies Th17’s role in the PSC fibrotic microenvironment, underscores the modeling contributions of Mulorgs, and highlights EV-derived miR-7977’s potential to ameliorate Th17-related periductal fibrosis, offering insights and novel therapeutic avenues for PSC.

        <tr id="TCR repertoires against tumors lack high-affinity TCRs and are further suppressed by Tregs. We hypothesized that Treg depletion enhances the antitumor efficacy of low-affinity T cells. Using the weak agonistic peptide A4Y derived from LCMV glycoprotein peptide p33 as a model antigen and VLPs as a vaccine platform, we tested this approach. In a separate low-affinity model, we targeted B16F10 melanoma with our multi-target vaccine. Results revealed limited in vivo lytic cross-reactivity between A4Y and p33 peptides, and the A4Y-vaccine alone failed to inhibit B16F10p33 tumor progression. However, combining A4Y-vaccine with Treg depletion triggered a robust immune response, characterized by increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, enhanced T cell functionality, and tumor-free survival. Infiltrating T cells also exhibited closer spatial proximity and heightened migration from blood vessels. Similarly, combining low-affinity vaccine with Treg depletion enhanced antitumor responses. These findings highlight the potential of Treg depletion to advance vaccination strategies targeting TAAs with low-affinity T cells.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion is one of the hallmarks of cancers, including glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of primary brain tumors. Multiple mechanisms are employed by tumor cells and its microenvironment to evade immune detection and foster tumor growth and progression. The secretion of immunosuppressive molecules such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), the expression of checkpoint proteins such programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and the recruitment of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to suppressed immune cell activity, favoring unchecked tumor growth. The FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1) has shown context/tissue-dependent effects in cancers of different tissue origins, with either oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles. Our laboratory has reported FAT1 to have an oncogenic function in glioblastoma. In addition, FAT1 promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment in glioblastoma, reducing T-cell and monocyte infiltration while increasing immunosuppressive cells such as MDSCs. It also upregulates pro-inflammatory mediators [cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)], fostering tumor-promoting signaling. This dual role in immune evasion and pro-tumorigenic inflammatory processes makes FAT1 a key driver of glioblastoma progression. This highlights the potential of FAT1 as a compelling therapeutic target. This article provides a concise overview of immune tolerance mechanisms in glioblastoma, and the crucial role of FAT1 in promoting immune tolerance and tumor advancement. In addition, this review highlights currently available immunotherapies in clinical use or undergoing trials, and the potential of FAT1 as a promising target for combinatorial therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Macrophages are heterogeneous immune cells with diverse subtypes and tissue‐specific distributions, displaying dynamic polarization states that critically govern their immunomodulatory functions and responses to environmental cues. As key regulators of innate and adaptive immunity, they originate from either embryonic progenitors or bone marrow‐derived monocytes and exhibit remarkable plasticity in response to microenvironmental cues. Tissue‐resident macrophages (e.g., Langerhans cells, Kupffer cells, microglia) display unique organ‐specific functions, while inflammatory stimuli drive their polarization into proinflammatory (M1) or anti‐inflammatory (M2) phenotypes along a functional continuum. This review systematically examines macrophage subtypes, their anatomical distribution, and the signaling pathways (e.g., NF‐κB, STATs, PPARγ) underlying polarization shifts in acute and chronic inflammation. We highlight how polarization imbalances contribute to pathologies including neuroinflammation, liver fibrosis, and impaired tissue repair, particularly in aging contexts. Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting macrophage plasticity, such as cytokine modulation, metabolic reprogramming, and subtype‐specific interventions. By integrating recent advances in macrophage biology, this work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding their dual roles in immune regulation and tissue homeostasis, offering insights for treating inflammatory and age‐related diseases through macrophage‐centered immunomodulation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Combining interleukin-2 (IL-2) agonism with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibition has shown synergistic potential in reinvigorating antitumor T cell responses. However, integrating these two mechanisms within a single molecule has been challenging due to competing requirements for PD-1 engagement and IL-2 receptor signaling. ANV600 is a novel bispecific antibody–cytokine fusion protein that targets a non-blocking epitope on PD-1, enabling cis-targeted IL-2Rβγ agonism while preserving combinability with therapeutic PD-1 inhibitors. This design allows for selective expansion of tumor antigen-specific T cells while avoiding the systemic toxicity and regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion associated with conventional IL-2 therapies. Methods The PD-1-targeting antibody used in ANV600 was generated by immunization of humanized mice and selected for its ability to bind PD-1 without blocking the binding epitope of PD-1 checkpoint blocking agents. ANV600 was evaluated in multiple syngeneic tumor models using human PD-1 transgenic mice. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were analyzed to assess the selectivity of ANV600 for PD-1+ T cell subsets. Combination studies with pembrolizumab and nivolumab were performed to assess synergy with checkpoint inhibitors. Results ANV600 significantly inhibited tumor growth as monotherapy across multiple models, including the immune checkpoint-resistant B16F10 melanoma. By targeting PD-1, ANV600 selectively expanded tumor antigen-specific CD8+T cells, particularly progenitor exhausted (Tpex) and cytotoxic exhausted (Tcex) subsets, while sparing Tregs and NK cells. Combination with pembrolizumab and nivolumab resulted in additive effects, consistent with the complementary roles of PD-1 blockade in expanding Tpex cells and IL-2Rβγ signaling in reprogramming Tcex cells. ANV600’s efficacy was dependent on CD8+T cells and primarily driven by tumor-resident T cells, as it remained effective despite blocked lymph node trafficking (FTY720) but was abrogated on CD8+ T cell depletion. Conclusions ANV600 represents a novel approach to delivering IL-2Rβγ agonism specifically to PD-1+ cells while preserving the binding site for PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. By targeting a non-blocking epitope on PD-1, ANV600 enables the selective expansion of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells while allowing independent and optimized dosing of both agents. This design ensures combinability with PD-1 inhibitors at clinically relevant doses, including in patients previously treated with checkpoint blockade. These findings support the clinical development of ANV600 as both a monotherapy and a combination therapy in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background As a malignancy of hematopoietic origin, the standard-of-care cytoreductive chemotherapy can not provide satisfactory treatment effect for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Immunotherapy has received increasing attention in leukemia treatment. However, the immunosuppressive microenvironment and low cancer immunogenicity of AML blasts create major obstacles to effectively inducing immune responses. Methods We developed an extracellular vesicle-based dual-delivery biosystem, which enhanced anti-AML immune responses by activating the immunogenicity of leukemia cells and relieving immunosuppression in AML allografted mice. Red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles (REVs) were selected as delivery carriers due to the excellent biocompatibility. REVs were ligated with leukemia-targeting peptide P9 and subsequently loaded with immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer (Doxorubicin, Dox) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 siRNA (siIDO1) to construct a chemoimmunological cascade biosystem (REVs-Dox/siIDO1-P9). Results The biosystem can specifically deliver the loaded Dox and siIDO1 into target leukemia cells and was validated capable of inducing efficient ICD. ICD-mediated release of damage-associated molecular patterns synergistically functions with siIDO1-mediated IDO1 silence to effectually recruit CD8+ T cells and enhance CD8+ T cell’s functions. In the AML mouse model, REVs-Dox/siIDO1-P9 can evoke a strong antileukemia response and prolong leukemia-bearing mice survival compared with REVs-Dox/siNC-P9 and REVs-siIDO1-P9. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the extracellular vesicle-based chemoimmunological cascade biosystem provides a novel strategy for AML treatment.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by intratumoral abundance of neutrophilic/polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC) which exert anti-T-cell functions through multiple mechanisms, especially JAK2/STAT3-regulated arginase activity. To overcome limitations of systemic inhibition of PMN-MDSCs in cancer-bearing patients such as neutropenia and compensatory myelopoietic adaptations, we developed a nanoengineering strategy to disrupt cell-specific signaling exclusively in PMN-MDSCs without compromising viability or provoking neutropenia. Single-cell RNA sequencing in human/murine PDAC, and flow cytometry in peripheral blood cells from treatment-naïve PDAC patients, nominated surface receptor CXCR2 as a PMN-MDSC-exclusive target. We chemically modified a small-molecule CXCR2 inhibitor AZD5069 by conjugating it with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance aqueous solubility. This AZD5069-PEG construct was then chemically grafted onto amphiphilic polysaccharide derivatives to engineer CXCR2-homing nanoparticles (CXCR2-NP). Cy5.5 dye-loaded CXCR2-NPs showed near-exclusive uptake in PMN-MDSCs compared with KrasLSL.G12D/+;p53R172H/+;Pdx1Cre/+ (KPC) PDAC tumor cells, KPC cancer-associated fibroblasts, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Encapsulation of JAK2/STAT3i Ruxolitinib (CXCR2-NPRuxo) resulted in more efficient and durable attenuation in STAT3-regulated arginase activity from PMN-MDSCs as well as robust induction of cytolytic T-cell activity compared with free Ruxolitinib in vitro and in orthotopic tumor cell-CAF co-injection models in vivo. Treatment of orthotopic tumor-bearing KPC mice with CXCR2-NPRuxo reduced tumor burden compared with vehicle, free Ruxolitinib, or non-drug-loaded CXCR2-NP treatments, without causing appreciable neutropenia. Taken together, cell-specific delivery of payloads via CXCR2-homing immunonanoparticles represents a novel strategy to disrupt MDSC-mediated immunosuppression and invigorate antitumor immunity in PDAC.

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a significant barrier to the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), contributing to long-term morbidity and non-relapse mortality in both pediatric and adult populations. Central to GVHD pathophysiology is the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, where JAK2 mediates key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF. These cytokines promote donor T cell activation, effector differentiation, and target organ damage. The introduction of ruxolitinib, a selective JAK1/2 inhibitor, has transformed the treatment landscape for steroid-refractory acute and chronic GVHD, leading to improved response rates and durable symptom control. However, its limitations—such as cytopenias, infectious complications, and incomplete responses—have catalyzed the development of next-generation agents. In 2024, the FDA approved axatilimab, a CSF-1R inhibitor that targets monocyte-derived macrophages in fibrotic chronic GVHD, and remestemcel-L, an allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cell therapy, for pediatric steroid-refractory acute GVHD. Both agents offer mechanistically distinct and clinically meaningful additions to the therapeutic armamentarium. In parallel, emerging combination strategies involving JAK2 inhibitors and novel biologics show promise in enhancing immune tolerance while preserving graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects. Recent advances in biomarker development, such as the MAGIC Algorithm Probability (MAP), are enabling early risk stratification and response prediction. The integration of these tools with organ-specific and personalized approaches marks a shift toward more precise, durable, and tolerable GVHD therapy. This review highlights the current state and future direction of JAK2 inhibition and complementary therapies in the evolving GVHD treatment paradigm.">

Myeloid populations—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—play pivotal roles in dampening anti-tumor immune responses and promoting tumor progression. Recent advances in our understanding of myeloid cell biology have unveiled new therapeutic opportunities to disrupt these immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with tumor inflammation. This review highlights key signaling pathways and surface molecules involved in myeloid-mediated immune suppression, including CSF1R, PI3Kγ, mTOR, Syk, MerTK/Axl, and immune checkpoints such as Trem2, LILRBs, VISTA, and CD40. We examine preclinical and clinical findings that support targeting these pathways to reprogram the TME and enhance anti-tumor immunity. By integrating insights from mechanistic studies and therapeutic development, this review underscores the potential of myeloid cell-targeting strategies as promising adjuncts to current cancer immunotherapies. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges in translating these approaches into durable clinical benefit.">

        <tr id="Myeloid leukemia (ML) is a clonal malignant disease with abnormal hematopoietic stem cells. With the emergence of novel immunotherapies, such as CAR-T, therapeutic outcomes in ML patients have improved, while significant challenges persist, including severe adverse events and disease recurrence. Natural killer cells (NK cells) are “natural killers” of the immune system that do not require antigen presentation and responsible for recognizing and destroying tumor cells. Some NK cells-based clinical experiments have been carried out and achieved remarkable results with lower side effects in ML. Crucially, within the ML microenvironment, NK cells frequently exhibit more severe functional exhaustion compared with T cells, characterized by impaired cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and proliferative capacity which limits anti-ML efficacy of NK cells. However, clinical studies utilizing NK cell-based therapies (e.g., adoptive transfer, CAR-NK cells) have demonstrated promising results with favorable safety profiles, underscoring their therapeutic potential. Therefore, developing more strategies based on NK cell is of great clinical significance for the treatment of ML. In this review, we systematically analysed the relationship between ML and NK cells, aiming to propose more novel protocols for NK cell expansion and persistence enhancement, establish evidence-based guidelines for next-generation NK cell-based immunotherapies in ML treatment.">

        <tr id="The dynamic evolution of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) during targeted therapy is a critical yet poorly understood determinant of treatment response and resistance. While most studies compare immune states before and after treatment, temporal immune changes during therapy remain largely uncharacterized, limiting development of effective combination strategies. Here, we investigated immune dynamics throughout targeted therapy using mouse melanoma models that recapitulate human therapeutic responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified a previously unrecognized inflection point where the inflamed TME during tumor regression, characterized by robust NK cell infiltration, transitions to an immune-excluded state upon onset of drug-tolerant residual disease. We uncovered a unique macrophage subset (F4/80 hi CCL5⁺MHCII⁺CD63⁺) that orchestrates NK cell recruitment through CCR2/5 signaling during regression. Depletion of these macrophages using LysM-cre;iDTR mice significantly reduced NK cell infiltration. Specifically during residual disease, pharmacological inhibition of Ptpn22, a phosphatase that negatively regulates immune activation, reprogrammed macrophages, restored NK cell recruitment and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Extending these findings to human cancer, longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of melanoma and lung cancer patient samples revealed dynamic NK cell infiltration during targeted therapy, establishing a direct link between innate immune remodeling and treatment outcome. Unlike prior prognostic studies assessing immune states at single time points, our results provide mechanistic evidence of a temporal relationship between NK cell infiltration and therapeutic efficacy. Together, these findings position immune evolution as a driver of acquired resistance and identify macrophage-NK cell crosstalk as a therapeutically actionable axis to overcome immune exclusion and improve targeted therapy across multiple cancer types.

        <tr id="Background: Increased IL-1β levels may promote carcinogenesis and metastasis by affecting tumor biology and the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this context, extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role in cell-to-cell communication, thus modulating the TME and immune response. Here, we aimed to test whether tumor-derived small EVs (TEVs) isolated from sensitive and osimertinib-resistant (OR) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells may promote EMT via fibronectin binding to α5β1 integrin as well as suppress the immune system and if these effects may be favored by IL-1β. Methods: TEVs were isolated from control, OR, and IL-1β-stimulated NSCLC cells. Expressions of fibronectin and PD-L1 were screened in TEVs and the mRNA levels of vimentin and SMAD3 were also assessed in cancer cells after TEV co-culturing. Furthermore, to detect the effect on immune cells, we co-cultured TEVs with lung cancer patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: TEVs were positive for fibronectin and the highest protein levels were found in TEVs obtained from the OR and IL-1β-stimulated cells. TEV-mediated activation of α5β1 signaling led to the upregulation of vimentin and SMAD3 mRNA in NSCLC cells and stimulated cell migration. EVs also increased PD-1, CTLA-4, FOXP3, TNF-α, IL-12, and INF-γ mRNA in lung cancer patients’ immune cells. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that TEVs promote EMT in NSCLC cells by the activation of the fibronectin–α5β1 axis. Finally, IL-1β stimulation induces TEV release with biological properties similar to OR TEVs, thus leading to cancer invasion and immune suppression and suggesting that inflammation can promote tumor spreading.">

Pediatric B cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a hematopoietic malignancy. T cell exhaustion has an important impact on the prognosis of leukemia. The interaction between tumor cells and T cells can influence the degree of T cell exhaustion. However, the effects of B-ALL cells on exhausted T cell subpopulations and how the interaction influences the prognosis of B-ALL patients remain unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from pediatric B-ALL patients were downloaded from GEO. Cell interaction analysis identified ligand-receptor pairs between B-ALL cells and exhausted CD8+ T cell. To confirm the function of CCL3/CCL4/CCL5/CCR5 in prognosis prediction, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed. We further developed an innovative stratified model that integrates CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 through multi-Cox regression. Clustering of scRNA-Seq data revealed an increased proportion of exhausted CD8+ T cells in relapsed B-ALL, especially terminal exhausted CD8+ T cells (CD8_Ex), with increased exhaustion and decreased proliferation scores. Moreover, the CCL3/CCL4/CCL5-CCR5 axis was upregulated in interactions between B-ALL cells and terminal CD8_Ex. Transcriptome data from 221 pediatric B-ALL samples revealed that high CCL3/CCL4/CCL5/CCR5 levels correlate with low overall survival (OS). A multivariate Cox regression model incorporating CCL3/CCL4/CCL5 predicted prognoses. Finally, a model based on the adult B-ALL patients from our center also accurately predicted prognoses. We report for the first time the crucial role of the CCL3/CCL4/CCL5-CCR5 axis in the differentiation of terminal exhausted CD8+ T cells in B-ALL. High expression of CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CCR5 correlates with poor prognosis in B-ALL, suggesting potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Background Blockade of Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) significantly improves progression-free survival in patients with cancers, including melanoma. In addition to unleashing antitumor immunity, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapies disrupt immune regulatory networks critical for maintaining homeostasis in various tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Despite growing reports of cancer- and ICI-related cognitive impairments among survivors, our understanding of the pathophysiology of ICI-related neurodegenerative effects is limited. Methods In this study, we used a murine model of melanoma, cognitive function tests, and neuroimmunological assays to investigate the cellular mechanisms and impact of combinatorial blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 on brain function. Syngeneic melanoma was induced in C57Bl6 mice via intradermal injection of D4M-3A.UV2 melanoma cells. After confirmation of tumor growth, cancer-bearing and non-cancer mice received combinatorial treatment of anti-CTLA-4 (1 mg per dose, twice per week) and anti-PD-1 (200 µg per dose, thrice per week) for three weeks. One month after completing ICI treatment, mice were evaluated for learning, memory, and memory consolidation cognitive function tasks. Neuroinflammation, synaptic and myelin integrity, and immune cell status in the brain were analyzed to examine neuro-immunological changes post-ICI treatment. Results While tumor-related alterations in brain function were evident, combined ICI treatment specifically disrupted synaptic integrity and reduced myelin levels independent of neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity in both cancer-bearing and non-cancer mice brains. Combined ICI selectively impaired hippocampal-dependent cognitive function. This was associated with a two-fold increase in T cell numbers within the brain along with immune activation of myeloid cells, especially microglia. Furthermore, an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model revealed that combination ICI predisposes the CNS to exacerbated autoimmunity, highlighting neuroinflammation-related, and tumor-independent, neurodegenerative sequelae of combination ICI. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that combinatorial blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 destabilizes neuroimmune-regulatory networks and activates microglia, contributing to long-term neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments. Therefore, selectively limiting microglial activation could be a potential avenue to preserve CNS functions while maintaining the therapeutic benefits of rapidly evolving ICIs and their combinations.

Some unique features, such as rapid MHC-independent recognition of antigens, performing heterogeneous anti-tumor activities, and being less susceptible to tumor-induced suppression, suggest promising roles of ILTCs in cancer immunology. On the other hand, these cells exhibit a dualistic nature in cancer, which includes both pro-tumor and anti-tumor effects, highlighting the importance of the complex regulatory environment of their functioning and activation. The functions and evolution of ILTC are greatly influenced by microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNA molecules that mediate post-transcriptional regulation.

This review addresses the complicated relationship between ILTCs and different miRNAs, such as miR-155, let-7 s, and miR-181a, expressed in tumor cells, ILTCs, or packed in tumor-derived exosomes. We will underscore the synergetic effects of the expression of miRNA in tumor and immune cells, influencing ILTC’s function and cancer progression. We emphasized the recent and innovative therapeutic approaches, novel delivery systems, and CAR-T cell-based strategy, and the therapeutic potential of modifying the expression of miRNA to regulate the miRNA expression to modulate ILTC activity and improve cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is driven by abnormal type-I and -II interferon activation, affecting a variety of immunocompetent cells. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modulate inflammation but often lack consistent potency. We developed HXB-319, an MSC-based therapy targeting inflammatory pathways in SLE. Previously, HXB-319 was shown to reduce alveolar hemorrhage in an SLE model. Here, we report its effects in a model of SLE that progresses to end stage kidney disease.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
SLE-like disease was induced via intraperitoneal (IP) pristane injection in female BALB/cJ mice, followed by treatment with naïve MSCs or HXB-319. Over 9 months, survival and proteinuria were monitored. Upon euthanasia, kidneys were analyzed for histopathology and gene expression, splenocytes for immune subsets by flow cytometry, and serum for autoantibodies, growth factors and cytokines.


RESULTS
HXB-319 significantly altered plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4+PD-L1+ cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ RORγt+ (Th17 cells) subsets. HXB-310 lowered IFN-γ (p< 0.001), IL-17A (p=0.01), BAFF (p<0.05), and anti-dsDNA (p<0.05), compared to untreated mice. HXB-319, but not naïve MSCs, significantly improved survival, halted progression of kidney disease and stabilized proteinuria (all p < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
HXB-319 demonstrates potential for mitigating SLE associated glomerulonephritis, improving survival and reducing proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive cancer with an increasing incidence worldwide, highlighting the need for research into its pathogenesis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in melanoma progression and consists of cellular components and an extracellular matrix (ECM) rich in cytokines and signaling molecules. The most abundant stromal cells within the TME are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which remodel the ECM and modulate immune responses. Among immune cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) predominate, and their polarization toward the M2 phenotype supports tumor progression. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have diverse functions, including cytotoxic T-cells, helper T-cells that modulate immune response, B-cells forming tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and regulatory T-cells with immunosuppressive properties. Dendritic cells (DCs) also play a complex role in the TME. A notable subpopulation are mature regulatory dendritic cells (mregDCs), which contribute to immune evasion. All of these TME components may drive tumorigenesis. Advancements in melanoma treatment—including immunotherapy and targeted therapies—have significantly improved outcomes in advanced-stage disease. In parallel, emerging approaches targeting the tumor microenvironment and gut microbiome, as well as personalized strategies such as neoantigen vaccines and cell-based therapies, are under active investigation and may further enhance therapeutic efficacy in the near future.">

        <tr id="Inflammation is a self-defense mechanism that controls the homeostasis of an organism, and its alteration by persistent noxious stimuli could lead to an imbalance in the regulation of inflammatory responses mediated by innate and adaptive immunity. During chronic inflammation, sustained exposure of myeloid cells to the various inflammatory signals derived from inflamed tissue could lead to the generation of myeloid cells with an immunosuppressive state, called myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which can exert protective or deleterious functions depending on the nature of signals and the specific inflammatory conditions created by different pathophysiological contexts. Initially identified in various tumor models and cancer patient samples, these cells have long been recognized as negative regulators of anti-tumor immunity. Consequently, researchers have focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying their potent immunosuppressive activity. As a key component of the signal transducing processes, protein kinases play a central role in regulating the signal transduction mechanisms of many cellular activities, including differentiation and immunosuppression. Over the past decade, at least a dozen kinases, including mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TAM RTKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and others, have emerged as key contributors to the generation and differentiation of MDSCs. Here, we discuss the recent findings on these kinases that directly contribute to the immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute cellular rejection of transplanted lung allografts involves activated cytotoxic T cells and reduced Regulatory T (Treg) cell function. Calcineurin inhibitors, the cornerstone of immunosuppressive regimens, suppress T cell cytotoxicity but inhibit Treg proliferation. The DNA hypomethylating agent decitabine (DAC) can abrogate T cell cytotoxicity while stimulating Treg proliferation. Methods We sought to determine the effects of DAC treatment in a murine MHC-mismatched orthotopic lung transplant model. Results Rescue treatment with DAC maintains lung allograft gross and histologic integrity with a reduction in cytotoxic T cell responses. CD4+FoxP3+ T cell depletion in Foxp3DTR mice exacerbated rejection lung injury compared to CD4+FoxP3+ T cell sufficient mice and failed to abolish the protective effect of DAC in this model. The protective effect of DAC was associated with a reduction in cytokine production from host T-cells. Discussion Decitabine could offer a new line of treatment for acute lung allograft rejection, in part via its effects on Tregs.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) is a significant challenge for global health. Neutrophils, the predominant white blood cells in the innate immune system, are increasingly becoming known as potential contributors to either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive activities within different tumor biology settings. This review highlights such dual roles of neutrophils in GC, where complex interactions occur within the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we focus on the formation and function of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which have emerged as critical players in GC progression. NETs influence key processes such as inflammation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the polarization of neutrophils into two of its distinct subtypes, namely N1 and N2, which exert opposing influences on tumor biology. While N1 neutrophils exert anti-tumor properties, N2 neutrophils are generally regarded as pro-tumor. We uniquely discuss how these subtypes interact with cancer cells, affecting epithelial–mesenchymal transition and immune evasion mechanisms. These interactions change the tumor microenvironment and impact overall GC progression. In addition, we underscore the potential of neutrophils and their associated molecules as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Specific neutrophil-derived markers and neutrophil-associated signaling pathways, along with their perspectives in personalized medicine that would pave the way for neutrophil-based anti-GC therapy, have been discussed in this review. Through the integration of these perspectives, we aim to guide future research involving neutrophils and their therapeutic implications, thus establishing strategies to precisely and effectively treat GC and improve prognosis.">

        <tr id="Cellular and molecular heterogeneity contributes to the insufficient immunogenicity of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a lethal malignancy characterized by post-resection relapse, ultimately leading to limited immune cell infiltration. Here, we report a strategy to boost tumor immunity by activating the endogenous cGAS-STING signaling pathway through in-situ manipulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), thereby augmenting the immune responsiveness of GBM. Under white light irradiation, the synthetic butterfly-shaped photosensitizer B-TTPy disrupts the mitochondrial ETC by producing excessive reactive oxygen species. Synergistically, inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 amplifies ETC dysfunction, thus enhancing the cytotoxicity of B-TTPy against tumor cells. Our results demonstrate that the in-house-customized Mitochondrial Electron Alteration Nanoparticles in Glioblastoma (MEANING) efficiently activate innate and adaptive immune response by recruiting antigen-presenting cells and cytotoxic T cells to the surgical margin. Moreover, biodegradable hydrogel-medicated surgical cavity treatment with MEANING can reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and eliminate residual GBM cells. In sum, our findings establish a local immune activation approach for GBM, to prevent postoperative tumor recurrence and identify ETC blockade as a promising therapeutic strategy for low-immunogenic tumors.">

        <tr id="The lymphocyte-specific transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is a key player in immune evasion in cancers, with the complex mechanism(s) being barely understood. In this study, we have focused on the role of IRF4 in regulating T cell functions through its transcriptional regulation of programmed death 1 (PD1) and its ligand PD1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), which were identified as IRF4 transcriptional targets in multi-omics analysis. We have shown that IRF4 transcriptionally regulates both PD1 and PD-L1, promoting immune suppression in the context of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection. Co-culturing EBV+ JiJoye lymphoma cells with CD4+ T cells or with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) downregulates CD4+ T cell functions, but the depletion of IRF4 in EBV+ JiJoye lymphoma cells reduces PD1 and PD-L1 expression, and partially restores CD4+ T cell functions. Moreover, CD4+ T cell depletion from PBMCs enhances EBV transformation, and EBV has a greater efficiency in transforming PBMCs from HIV patients with impaired CD4+ T cell functions. These findings support the role of IRF4 in immune evasion by upregulating PD1/PD-L1 during EBV transformation, and that functional CD4+ T cells are essential for limiting EBV transformation.">

This review explores the dual roles of CD8 T cells during ZIKV infection, emphasizing both their antiviral functions and their potential to drive neuroinflammation.

We also explore how therapeutic agents, such as the S1P receptor modulator FTY720, influence lymphocyte trafficking and CNS immune regulation. Finally, we review emerging interventions—including vaccines, antivirals, immunomodulators, and passive immunotherapies—that aim to achieve effective viral control while minimizing neural damage.

The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who develop severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. These signatures are exacerbated in patients with overweight/obesity compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic potential compared to non-SD. Using transcriptional and proteomics approaches we show decreased type-I Interferon responses in SD, suggesting defective innate immunity may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional T and NK-cell signatures underpin dengue pathogenesis and may represent novel targets for immunomodulatory therapy in dengue.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background and Objectives A pivotal role of cancer (e.g., glioma) microenvironment is primarily executed by tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) in facilitating cancer immune evasion and even resisting immunotherapies. However, the molecular base for governing such functionality of TAMs remains poorly understood. Thereby, we here explore the impact of such a key regulatory transcription factor NFE2L1 (also called Nrf1) on glioma‐relevant TAMs. Methods A set of combining in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches, e.g., by utilizing CRISPR‐Cas9 and overexpression plasmids to modulate NFE2L1 expression, and the resulting phenotypic changes in TAMs were evaluated. Besides, immunofluorescence, RT‐qPCR and flow cytometry were conducted to assay the infiltration of various immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells and M1‐type macrophages, in the glioma microenvironment, as well as their therapeutic response to anti‐PD1 treatment. Results Deficiency of NFE2L1 causes a unique phenotypic switch in the TAMs from its pro‐cancer M2‐type to another anti‐cancer M1‐type, thereby inhibiting malignant progression of glioma. Such NFE2L1‐deficiency leads to significantly increases of CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages within tumor tissues of glioma and hence enhances its sensitivity to anti‐PD1 therapy. Further experimental evidence has provided revealing a synergistic efficacy triggered by combined therapy of CD38 inhibitor with PD1 antibodies, significantly inhibited tumor growth, compared to that of their monotherapy. The mechanistic study unraveled that NFE2L1 enables for directly binding to those ARE sites within the promoter regions of both CD38 and PD‐L1 genes in order to govern their transcriptional expression. Conclusions The aberrant role of NFE2L1 in the malignant progression of glioma was discovered in this study. It is of crucial significance to emphasize the potential of NFE2L1 inhibition as a strategic approach to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic intervention. Overall, this discovery holds a substantial promise for advancement of innovative combination therapies, potentially enhancing treatment outcomes for individuals afflicted with glioma.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The management of HNC is a major global challenge, with chemo-radiotherapy resistance and a low 5-year survival rate. Recently, the FDA has approved anti-PD1/PDL1-based immunotherapies for the better management and longer survival of HNC patients. However, immune-escaping mechanisms mitigate the antitumoral effect of anti-PD-1/PD-L1-based therapies. Dysregulated miRNAs are increasingly recognized as key players in immune evasion mechanisms through the modulation of several immune signaling pathways that are essential for antitumor immune responses. In this study, we aimed to identify miRNAs whose dysregulation is closely associated with immune-escaping mechanisms and lower survival rates in HNC patients. The present study found some key miRNAs that are associated with lower survival rates and immune evasion mechanisms. Targeting the identified miRNAs can help modulate immune evasion mechanisms and possibly enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies, including other immune checkpoint therapies in HNC.">

LSC heterogeneity has been characterized in depth in mice based on cell-fate mapping, high-resolution imaging and single-cell RNAseq analysis, and more recently in humans despite the difficulty of accessing these rare cell populations. At steady-state, LSCs organize discrete anatomical niches in lymphoid organs and orchestrate adaptive immune response. Studies of LSCs at the single cell level have identified a wide role for these cells in various pathological conditions, including solid tumors, autoimmune diseases, and lymphomas. In this review, we will discuss the diversity and plasticity of LSCs and LSC-like cells as well as their functions in pathological settings, with a focus on cancer and autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Background Regulatory B cell (Breg), known for its immunosuppressive properties through the provision of IL-10, plays a critical role in the control of inflammatory diseases. Although Breg has been discovered for over two decades in mammals, its existence in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the differentiation mechanism and functional profiles of teleost CD25L+ Breg to gain insights into the origin and evolution of Breg. Methods Flow cytometry, RNA-seq, qPCR, morphological analysis, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, recombinant IL-35 stimulation, cell co-culture in Transwell system were performed to reveal the phenotypic features, differentiation mechanism and suppressive functions of teleost CD25L+ Breg. To elucidate the immunoregulatory role of CD25L+ Breg in vivo, bacterial infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models were established in teleost fish. Systemic and local inflammatory responses were assessed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, histological analysis, and cytokine measurements. Results Phenotypically, we identified a unique IgM+CD25L+ B cell subset, termed CD25L+ B cells, characterized by their capacity to produce IL-10 and IL-12p35 in a cold-blooded vertebrate, the grass carp. Mechanistically, IL-35 stimulation induced the differentiation of CD25L− B cells into CD25L+ B cells, promoting the production of IL-35 and IL-10 via STAT3 activation. Functionally, teleost CD25L+ B cells served as a conventional Breg subtype that exerted its immunosuppressive functions on effector T cells and neutrophils via cell contact or cytokine delivery. Upon bacterial infection, CD25L+ Breg increased earlier than CD25L+ Treg and produced IL-10. In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD model, Breg frequency and IL-10 levels increased significantly during IBD remission, and Breg adoptive transfer could prevent IBD development and contribute to intestinal tissue repair. Conclusions These novel findings reveal that fish have evolved Breg with specialized anti-inflammatory functions, providing evolutionary insights into the phylogenetic origin and functional conservation of Breg from fish to mammals.

        <tr id="Immune-based agents, especially Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI), are standard of care therapy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC); however, a significant number of patient tumors fail to respond, or develop resistance. While target expression, mutation burden and oncogenic pathways impact responses, an established mechanism contributing to ICI therapy failure is evasion of T-cell responses via downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Conversely, natural killer (NK) cells eQector function is enhanced in the absence of HLA, making NK cellular therapies an attractive option for ICI resistant tumors. Challenges for current NK cell therapies include failure to adequately infiltrate solid tumors and long-term persistence, which may be overcome by deploying NK-derived extracellular vesicles (NKEVs) as a personalized novel adoptive cellular therapeutic with cytotoxic effects.In a human NSCLC cohort (n=10), we used single cell RNAseq and antibody labeling (CITEseq) to examine the immune cell landscape in peripheral immune cells (PBMCs) and tumors. NKEVs retrieved from patient NK cells were characterized with proteomics and bulk RNAseq, and EV functionality was assessed using primary tumor organoids. We identified circulating NK cell subsets, describing diQerences in cell composition, gene expression and signaling, related to time point, NSCLC subtype (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell), composition and tumor grade. Next, we examined the functional capabilities of patient NKEVs in organoid structures derived from primary tumor cells, finding that exposure to patient NKEVs resulted in a 40-45% decrease in organoid viability, and significantly lowered the cisplatin dose required to elicit cytotoxicity. In Nivolumab treated PBMC co-culture experiments, NKEV addition favorably shifted the organoid infiltrating immune population to significantly fewer CD4+ T cells and more CD56+ NK cells. Finally, we used the multi-omic characterization of NKEV molecular cargo to identify RNA transcripts and proteins associated with cytotoxic and immune recruiting functions. This work demonstrated that NKEVs can be successfully harvested from patient derived, expanded NK cells, and highlights their heterogeneous cargo, and anti-tumor properties in combination with standard-of-care therapies.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic, triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to global consequences since its emergence in late 2019, impacting health, economies, and societies worldwide. Understanding the early responses following infection will provide crucial insights into the immune mechanisms governing disease progression and protection. We employed the single-cell RNA-sequencing approach using bronchoalveolar lavage cells of rhesus macaques at 0-3 days post-infection (dpi) in a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2. Our results show the increased abundance of two subsets of macrophages that express IFN-responsive gene signatures, inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid DCs, and conventional DCs at 3 dpi, coinciding with peak viremia. Moreover, our investigation underscores the enrichment of IFN-α/β, IFN-γ, and IL-1 signaling pathways within myeloid populations at 2-3 dpi in comparison to baseline. These findings substantially deepen our comprehension, elucidating the transcriptional landscape at the single-cell level during the early phases of COVID-19 within a highly relevant model.


IMPORTANCE
Understanding the immune response in the early stages of COVID-19 is crucial for developing better treatments and vaccines. In this study, we used advanced single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the immune cells in the lungs of rhesus macaques, a model for human SARS-CoV-2 infection, within the first few days after infection. We identify key immune cell types, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that are activated early on and produce important signals to fight the virus. These findings help clarify how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 at the single-cell level, offering valuable insights that could guide future therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are immunocompromised and highly vulnerable to serious recurrent infections. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are principal sensors of pathogen challenge and are essential in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses to resolve infection. This study identified significant deficiencies in six functionally distinct DC subsets in blood of untreated CLL (UT-CLL) patients and selective normalization of pDCs in response to acalabrutinib (a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. DCs are continuously replenished from hematopoiesis in bone marrow (BM). Four BM developmental intermediates that give rise to cDCs and pDCs were examined and significant reductions identified in UT-CLL patients supporting a precursor/progeny relationship. The deficiencies in blood DCs and BM DC progenitors were significantly associated with alterations in the Flt3/FL signaling pathway critical to DC development and function. The CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI), a highly accurate model to predict progression-free survival and time-to-first treatment (TTFT), revealed that cDC1 and pDC were reduced in High/Very High CLL-IPI compared to Low CLL-IPI patients. Notably, UT-CLL patients with shared DC subset deficiencies had shorter TTFT, uncovering a profound alteration in innate immunity with the potential to instruct therapeutic decision-making.">

        <tr id="Background/Aims Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a severe complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, characterized by immune-mediated tissue damage primarily affecting the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis. However, the pathogenic roles of changes in Treg cell number and function on acute GvHD remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the quantitative and qualitative changes in Treg cells and their clinical and pathogenic implication of acute GvHD. Methods A total of 62 patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation at a tertiary institution from 2019 to 2024 were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. Treg cell subsets and cytokine production were assessed after T-cell receptor stimulation. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured using cytometric bead array, and Treg cell suppressive function was evaluated through co-culture experiments. Results Patients with acute GvHD showed a decreased frequency of circulating Treg cells, with a notable increase in the CD45RA-FoxP3lo pro-inflammatory subset. Treg cells produced inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α upon stimulation and exhibited reduced suppressive activity. The frequency of TNF-α+ Treg cells correlated with the clinical severity of acute GvHD. Elevated serum levels of IL-6 and IL-21 were associated with the inflammatory conversion of Treg cells. Conclusions During human acute GvHD, frequencies of circulating Treg cells are significantly decreased. Inflammatory change of Treg cells, represented by TNF-α production and reduced suppressive capacity, contributes to the immunopathogenesis of acute GvHD.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a complex and life-threatening disease process related to a systemic response to severe infection. Due to the challenges of treating patients with sepsis, new therapies are being investigated, including cell-based approaches. Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are immune privileged cells with immunomodulatory properties. Thus, we proposed that TSCs may be beneficial in experimental models of sepsis to regulate the immune response and curtail organ injury. Methods Sepsis was induced by experimental models in mice; cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lung infection with Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae. TSCs were isolated from the chorionic villi of human (h) term placentas, and from mouse (m) placentas using anti-CD117 MicroBeads, and were administered intravenously 6 h after CLP or S. pneumoniae infection. We assessed mortality, bacterial clearance, organ injury, inflammatory response, and production of cytokines and chemokines. Results CD117+ hTSCs did not express human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I or II, and were clonogenic and self-renewing. CLP led to severe mortality by 7 days, and administration of either hTSCs or mTSCs resulted in markedly improved survival compared with control cells or vehicle. hTSCs promoted bacterial clearance and decreased organ injury in the liver, kidney, spleen, and bowel. The elevated innate immune response in the peritoneum, predominantly neutrophils, was attenuated by hTSCs. In addition, neutrophil infiltration into the spleen was less in mice receiving hTSCs, which corresponded with reduced plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. When assessing the lung response to S. pneumoniae infection, administration of hTSCs resulted in fewer bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, and less lung edema and injury. Neutrophils, which were markedly increased in BALF, were diminished and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs was decreased by hTSCs. BALF pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were mitigated by hTSCs to levels of Sham mice, and systemic injury to the liver and spleen was attenuated. Conclusions CD117+ hTSCs are immune privileged cells that when given after the onset of experimental models of infection/sepsis resulted in improved outcomes due to enhanced bacterial clearance, resolving inflammation, and less organ injury. These data support hTSCs as a potential cell-based therapy for sepsis. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13287-025-04479-z.">

        <tr id="Background: The STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) pathway plays a vital role in the body’s innate immune defense system, primarily involved in DNA sensing and type I interferon production. While STING is well-established in various immune cells, its role in natural killer (NK) cells, particularly within the context of liver fibrosis, remains inadequately explored. Aim: The current study investigates the relationship between STING expression, NK cell activity, and insulin receptor (IR) signaling in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Methods: Peripheral NK cells were isolated from healthy controls and MASH patients with varying stages of liver fibrosis (early: F1/F2; advanced: F3/F4). The expressions of STING, IR, NK cell activation markers (CD107a, NKp46), and NK cell inhibitory markers (LAIR-1, Siglec-7) were assessed using flow cytometry. NK cell cytotoxicity against primary hepatic stellate cells (pHSCs) was evaluated through apoptosis assays. STING agonists (2′3′-cGAMP and DMXAA) were used to stimulate NK cells, and their effects on STING expression, NK cell activation, and cytotoxicity were measured. Additionally, the impact of insulin signaling on STING expression and NK cell function was examined. Results: Our results demonstrate that STING expression in NK cells correlates with disease severity in liver fibrosis. NK cells from MASH patients with advanced fibrosis (F3/F4) showed inhibited STING protein levels that were statistically comparable to healthy NK cells and accompanied by impaired cytotoxicity and decreased IFN-γ production. In contrast, NK cells from early fibrosis (F1/F2) exhibited higher STING expression and better functional activity. STING agonist treatment (2′3′-cGAMP) restored STING expression and enhanced NK cell activity across all fibrosis stages. Furthermore, insulin treatment and combined insulin and 2′3′-cGAMP treatment synergistically upregulated both IR and STING expressions, leading to improved NK cell function and increased cytotoxicity, particularly in advanced fibrosis. Conclusion: Our results highlight the potential of targeting STING and insulin signaling pathways as a therapeutic approach in restoring NK cell function and enhance immune surveillance in liver fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous and aggressive hematologic malignancy, remains challenging to treat due to high relapse rates, chemotherapy resistance, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While traditional therapies like chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have improved outcomes, their efficacy is often limited by toxicity and disease recurrence. Recent advancements in antibody engineering have revolutionized AML immunotherapy, offering precision-targeted strategies to overcome these barriers. This narrative review explores the transformative role of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), and bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) in redirecting immune effector cells, blocking immune checkpoints, and eradicating leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Key innovations include CD33-targeted gemtuzumab ozogamicin, CD123-directed bispecific engagers, and anti-CD47 agents that disrupt “don’t eat me” signals. We highlight breakthroughs in antibody design—such as Fc optimization, trispecific constructs, and conditionally active biologics—that enhance specificity while minimizing on-target off-tumor toxicity. Clinical trials demonstrate promising results, including improved remission rates and survival in refractory/relapsed AML when combining antibodies with hypomethylating agents, venetoclax, or checkpoint inhibitors. However, challenges persist, including AML’s genetic heterogeneity, adaptive immune evasion, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risks. Emerging strategies such as biomarker-driven personalization, TME modulation, and engineered NK-cell engagers are poised to address these limitations. By integrating preclinical insights with clinical data, this review underscores the potential of antibody-based combinatorial regimens to redefine AML therapy, offering durable responses and bridging the gap to curative approaches.">

        <tr id="Unlike conventional T cells that detect peptide antigens loaded to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, unconventional T cells respond to non-peptidic metabolite antigens presented by MHC class I-like proteins, such as CD1 and MHC-related protein 1 (MR1). Semi-invariant mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, γδ T cells, and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, together with other CD1- or MR1-restricted T cell subsets expressing diverse T cell receptors (TCR), elicit an innate-like response independent of diverse MHC genetics. In contrast to an overall enhanced response to bacterial-derived riboflavin precursor metabolites in infections, MAIT cells often exhibit an immunosuppressive or exhausted phenotype in glioblastoma, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and various hematological malignancies. Whereas some tumor cells can activate MAIT cells, the structures and functions of tumor-derived MR1 ligands remain largely unknown. Novel discoveries of mammalian-derived agonists and antagonists binding to MR1 protein are our knowledge of MR1 ligand structures and functions from MAIT cell activation in healthy conditions to anti-cancer immunity. Recent findings reveal that nucleoside and nucleobase analogs, as self-metabolites to activate MR1-restricted T cells, are regulated in the tumor microenvironment. Likewise, iNKT cells exhibit a dynamic role in cancer, capable of both protumor and antitumor immunity. Similarly, γδ T cells have also demonstrated both protective and tumor-promoting roles, via recognizing stress-induced protein and metabolite ligands. This review further depicts the distinct kinetics of responses, highlighting a rapid activation of unconventional T cells in solid versus hematological cancers. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including antigen-loaded MR1 and CD1, adoptive T cell transfer, chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cells, T cell receptor-T (TCR-T) cells, and combination treatments with immune checkpoint inhibitors, yet remain challenging, hold promise in overcoming tumor-induced immunosuppression and genetic restriction of conventional T cell therapies. By addressing critical gaps, such as novel structures and functions of cancer metabolite antigens, unconventional T cells offer unique advantages in anti-cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare and aggressive pediatric bone malignancy with poor prognosis, driven by therapy-resistant tumor microenvironments (TME). The TME plays a critical role in tumor progression through a complex and dynamic network of reciprocal interactions among immune cells (dysfunctional T cells, immunosuppressive macrophages), stromal components (cancer-associated fibroblasts), and tumor cells. These interactions collectively shape the immune landscape, promote immune evasion, and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Identifying reliable prognostic markers remains a critical challenge. Methods Here we performed an integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, WGCNA, and bulk RNA-seq analyses to investigate tumor-immune interactions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) intersected with T cell markers identified a total of 174 T cell-associated genes. Functional enrichment analysis and molecular subtyping were performed to explore immune-related pathways. A prognostic model based on CLEC11A, BDP1, and ID3 was constructed using Cox regression and validated in external datasets. Immune infiltration was assessed using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Results T cell marker analyses revealed key roles in pathways such as PI3K-Akt signaling and immune modulation. Molecular subtyping identified two clusters with distinct immune microenvironments: Cluster C1 (immunosuppressive phenotype and poorer prognosis) and Cluster C2 (functionally active immune profile associated with better prognosis). The prognostic model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival (AUC: 0.85, 0.82, 0.78). Additionally, a higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) with low survival rate has been observed in High-risk group. Immune infiltration analysis showed higher CD8+ T cell and dendritic cell activity and immune checkpoint expression in low-risk groups. Experimental validation demonstrated that ID3 silencing inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in ES cell lines. Conclusion Together, our study identified CLEC11A, BDP1, and ID3 as key T cell associated prognostic markers and developed a validated model to predict survival outcomes in ES. Insights into T cell markers and tumor-immune dynamics offer promising advances in prognostic assessment and immunotherapy for ES. Furthermore, the role of ID3 in immune evasion and tumor proliferation underscores its potential as a therapeutic target, providing new avenues for immune checkpoint regulation and personalized treatment strategies.">

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematological cancer in people living with (PLWH), and most B-cell NHLs express CD20. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized vesicles released by cells into the extracellular environment. Here, we examined the association between plasma-derived CD20+ EVs and prognostic biomarkers in the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC) 034 trial. We isolated EVs from plasma of patients with AIDS-NHL before and after initiation of treatment (rituximab plus concurrent infusional EPOCH), measuring CD20 on EVs by ELISA. Ramos cells were treated with EVs isolated from NHL and AIDS-NHL lymphoma cell lines in the presence of rituximab to measure if EVs protect cells from rituximab cytotoxicity. Baseline plasma levels of CD20+ EVs were significantly higher in non-responders and in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with high International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores (2 to 3) compared to those with lower IPI scores (0 to 1). Moreover, baseline plasma levels of CD20+ EVs were significantly associated with baseline levels of prognostic biomarkers for AIDS-NHL. We further demonstrate that EVs from NHL and AIDS-NHL cell lines can sequester rituximab and inhibit apoptosis.

        <tr id="Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are critical components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), playing a pivotal role in tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. This review explores the dual roles of CAFs in regulating tumor cell senescence and cell death, elucidating their mechanisms in inducing cellular senescence, shaping an immunosuppressive milieu, and modulating cell death pathways. CAFs promote tumor progression by secreting pro-inflammatory factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, while also contributing to metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, thereby influencing anti-cancer treatment efficacy. Studies indicate that the heterogeneity and plasticity of CAFs determine their distinct functions across various tumor types. Consequently, precision-targeted therapeutic strategies against CAFs, including the elimination of senescent CAFs, inhibition of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and disruption of CAF-mediated cell death evasion mechanisms, have emerged as promising directions in cancer research. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of CAFs functions and their potential as therapeutic targets, offering valuable insights into the development of novel anti-cancer strategies.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women, with complex mechanisms driving its initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy. In recent years, the tumor microenvironment (TME) has gained attention for its critical role in shaping tumor behavior, where small extracellular vesicles (small EVs) have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication. These vesicles carry a diverse cargo of proteins, lipids, DNA, and various non-coding RNAs—such as miR-21, miR-155, and miR-1246—mirroring the molecular status of their originating cells. This review highlights the roles of small EVs in immune modulation, stromal remodelling, and metastatic niche formation, emphasizing their contribution to therapy resistance and immune evasion. We discuss recent updates on EV biogenesis, characterisation and isolation techniques, such as ultracentrifugation, immunoaffinity and microfluidic systems. We also critically evaluate their potential for clinical application and how well they conform to the MISEV2023 guidelines. Furthermore, we examine small EVs as diagnostic tools in liquid biopsies and compare them with conventional methods such as mammography and tissue biopsies. We also discuss organotropism mediated by small EV cargo (e.g., integrins α6β4, αvβ5) and the diagnostic potential of protein and lipid signatures (e.g., PD-L1, CD63, and exosomal lipidomics). Therapeutically, we explore engineered small EVs for drug delivery, gene modulation, and immune activation, addressing challenges of targeting efficiency, in vivo stability, immunogenicity, and clinical scalability. The review discusses ongoing clinical trials involving small EVs in BC and highlights key translational gaps between preclinical advances and clinical implementation. Finally, we explores how integrating artificial intelligence, single-cell transcriptomics, and multi-omics approaches can help overcome major challenges such as small EV heterogeneity and tracking limitations. Crucially, this integration enables a more tailored understanding of each patient’s tumor biology, reducing therapeutic failures by guiding more personalized and effective treatment strategies. Overall, small EVs represent a transformative tool in precision oncology, contingent on resolving key challenges in their clinical translation.">

        <tr id="As the diverse functions of neutrophils continue to be uncovered, elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate their differentiation, development, and apoptosis has become crucial for overcoming limitations in the treatment of neutrophil-related diseases. Hematopoietic cell-specific protein 1-associated protein X 1 (HAX1), encoded by the primary pathogenic gene of autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia, serves as a key target for in-depth exploration of neutrophil function. In the Hax1 myeloid knockout C57BL/6J mice and stably transduced HL-60 cells with HAX1 knockdown that we constructed, our results showed that the differentiation of granulocyte-monocyte precursor cells (GMPs) and the maturation of neutrophils were inhibited, significantly reducing the proportion of myeloid cells and neutrophils in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. In addition, HAX1 deletion disrupted mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial membrane potential in neutrophils and increased the protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family members and cleaved Caspase-9. Through RNA sequencing and mRNA validation, we further demonstrated that HAX1 regulates neutrophil apoptosis and maturation via the mitochondrial-mediated classical apoptotic pathway and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated purine-rich box 1 (PU.1) signaling. This study elucidated the critical role of HAX1 in neutrophil differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis, providing new targets for research into neutrophil-related diseases.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown limited efficacy against solid tumors because of poor tissue penetration, constrained activity, and early exhaustion due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although stimulatory cytokines can counteract immune suppression, their systemic administration entails risk of toxicities and counter-regulatory responses. Here, we leveraged a population of tumor-associated TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs) to release interferon-α (IFN-α) and/or orthogonal interleukin-2 (oIL2) at the tumor site. Targeted cytokine delivery rescued CAR T cell functionality against the clinically relevant tumor antigen B7-homolog 3 (B7-H3) in an orthotopic, CAR T cell-refractory, immunocompetent mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM) named mGB2 that recapitulates pathological features of the human disease. Immunophenotypic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that inhibition of premature terminal exhaustion and induction of effector and memory states featuring activation of signaling pathways and transcriptional networks putatively boosted CAR T cell antitumor activity. Furthermore, IFN-α, especially when combined with private oIL2 signaling to CAR T cells, elicited potent endogenous T cell responses against multiple tumor-associated antigens, leading to delayed GBM growth and prolonged mouse survival even with tumors expressing B7-H3 in only a fraction of cells. These data suggest that the combination of TEM-based cytokine delivery and CAR T cells may have synergistic effects and support the further study of this approach for the treatment of patients with GBM.">

        <tr id="Combination immunotherapies have entered the treatment armamentarium of oncology, but important knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of how these therapeutics work. A recent study by Rolig, Peng, and colleagues has shed new light on how dual blockade of PD1 and LAG3 enhances antitumor immunity. The authors first interrogated LAG3 expression on T cells across murine tumor models, classifying the models as LAG3hi or LAG3lo. Next, they found that LAG3hi models were unresponsive to anti‐PD1 alone but responsive to combination therapy with anti‐PD1 + anti‐LAG3. Surprisingly, the response to anti‐PD1 + anti‐LAG3 in LAG3hi models was associated with reprogramming of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) from the canonically immunosuppressive state to an inflammatory state characterized by loss of expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 and upregulation of transcription factor Tbet. Importantly, an analogous reprogrammed Treg state was associated with response to anti‐PD1 + anti‐LAG3 and longer overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. This work highlights the importance of cells beyond cytotoxic CD8+ T cells as drivers of response to immunotherapy and sets the stage for subsequent mechanistic and translational studies.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are a specialised subset of immune cells that remain within tissues, playing a vital role in localised immune defence and long-term immunity. Unlike circulating memory T cells, TRM cells do not recirculate to provide rapid and effective responses against previously encountered pathogens at the tissue level. The formation of TRM cells is driven by tissue-specific cues, guiding their differentiation and retention within organs such as the skin, lungs and gut. They are characterised by the expression of unique markers, including CD69 and CD103, which facilitate their retention and longevity in tissues. TRM cells are essential for immune surveillance, effectively detecting and responding to different infections and contributing to tumour suppression. However, TRM cells are also implicated in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, where persistent activation by resident and autoantigens can lead to tissue damage. This pathogenic role is evident in chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, vitiligo and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where TRM cells may drive persistent localised inflammation and contribute to disease progression and severity. Emerging therapeutic strategies seek to modulate TRM cells to balance their protective and pathogenic roles in these inflammatory diseases. Approaches such as checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine modulation and cell-depletion therapies aim to enhance TRM cells' beneficial immune functions while minimising their role in autoimmunity. A deeper understanding of TRM cell development, maintenance and functional diversity is critical for advancing treatments for infectious diseases, chronic inflammation, autoimmune conditions and cancer.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) are pivotal cell populations involved in the immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, there has been little success in large-scale clinical trials of myeloid cell modulators. We aim to investigate potential molecular targets for TIMs and disclose the underlying mechanism. Using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we analyzed 24 spontaneous HCC tissues from mouse. Orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor models were established with or without anti-SIRPα antibody treatment. Patient-derived tumor xenografts model (PDX) was used to identify the CD47-SIRPα axis blocked therapy. In 24 murine spontaneous HCC tissues, we observed that the proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) plus macrophages accounts for 40–90% of TIMs and SIRPα was highly expressed in TIMs, especially in macrophages and MDSCs. Through in vivo experiments, we showed that anti-SIRPα therapy inhibited tumor growth, accompanied by increased CD8+ T cells infiltration and decreased TIMs including MDSCs and macrophages. We found that anti-SIRPα inhibited immunosuppressive function, migration and PD-L1 expression of myeloid cells. In a series of in vivo experiments, we demonstrated the anti-tumor and immune-active effect of SIRPα-blocked therapy. Mechanistically, anti-SIRPα inhibited the immunosuppressive function and PD-L1 expression of TIMs through downregulating PI3K/AKT signaling in myeloid cells. At last, anti-SIRPα enhanced the antitumor effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy in orthotopic and spontaneous murine models. Together, SIRPα blocked therapy reversed the immunosuppressive TIME, which provides a promising therapeutic rationale for increasing the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in treating HCC.">

        <tr id="Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airway inflammation and immune dysfunction. However, the molecular alterations and precise origins of immune cells in COPD airways remain poorly understood. Methods Here, CD45+ immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from four COPD patients and four healthy smokers to provide a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of immune cells in COPD airways. Results Notably, CD8+ T cells exhibited increased exhaustion, reduced cytotoxicity, and decreased TCR diversity in COPD airways. Especially, we identified two distinct exhausted CD8+ T cell clusters (CD8Tex_PDCD1 and CD8Trm_LAG3) originating from different developmental trajectories. Regulatory T cells had a reduced proportion and regulatory capacity in COPD airways, while CD4+ tissue-resident memory T cells displayed excessive Th2 responses and diminished Th1 responses. Additionally, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (Macro_SPP1) underwent lipid metabolic reprogramming and exhibited a shift to an anti-inflammatory phenotype with reduced phagocytosis and protease-antiprotease imbalance in COPD airways. Furthermore, macrophages (particularly Macro_SPP1) showed increased interactions with T cells via SPP1 and GALECTIN signaling, likely contributing to T cell suppression in COPD airways. Conclusion Together, these findings elucidate the dysregulated immune responses in COPD airways and provide a valuable resource for identifying potential therapeutic targets to restore immune homeostasis in COPD.">

Natural Killer (NK) cells, a subset of innate lymphoid cells, have emerged as a promising
avenue in cancer immunotherapy due to their ability to recognize and eliminate malignant and virusinfected
cells without prior antigen sensitization. Unlike T cells, NK cells function independently of
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) restriction, making them effective against tumors that
evade adaptive immune responses. However, several challenges, including limited persistence, poor
tumor infiltration, and immune suppression, hinder their clinical efficacy, particularly in solid tumors.
Recent advancements in NK cell expansion, activation, and genetic engineering have significantly
enhanced their therapeutic potential. Strategies such as cytokine-mediated stimulation, artificial
scaffolds, and CRISPR-based modifications have improved NK cell persistence and cytotoxicity.
Additionally, Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-modified NK cells offer targeted tumor recognition
while minimizing the risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) and Cytokine Release Syndrome
(CRS), making them a safer alternative to CAR-T therapy. Despite these advancements, immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironments and high manufacturing costs remain key obstacles.
Emerging approaches, including metabolic reprogramming, synthetic biology, and combinatorial
therapies integrating checkpoint inhibitors and bispecific antibodies, hold promise for overcoming
these limitations. Furthermore, the development of off-the-shelf, induced Pluripotent Stem Cell
(iPSC)-derived NK therapies is expected to enhance scalability and accessibility. This review highlights
the latest progress in NK cell-based immunotherapy, addressing both current challenges and
future directions in optimizing NK cell expansion, activation, and genetic engineering for clinical
applications.

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and chronic neuroinflammation. While microglia and astrocytes dominate CNS immune responses, emerging evidence implicates peripheral innate immune cells (PIICs)—including neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—as critical modulators of AD pathogenesis. This review synthesizes recent advances linking PIIC-related genetic polymorphisms to AD susceptibility and progression. We highlight how PIICs traffic into the brain via chemokine signaling, where they exhibit stage-specific effects: early recruitment may limit Aβ deposition via phagocytosis, whereas chronic infiltration exacerbates neuroinflammation and neuronal death. Paradoxically, some PIICs exert immunosuppressive effects that could be harnessed therapeutically. We further discuss preclinical strategies to modulate PIIC function, such as CCR2 inhibition, neutrophil depletion, and MDSC adoptive transfer. By bridging peripheral and central immunity, this review unveils PIICs as promising targets for next-generation AD therapies, advocating for precision immunomodulation tailored to disease stages.">

        <tr id="Background Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) mediate cancer immune suppression by promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment that inhibits effective anti-tumor immunity. However, they are still a poorly understood, heterogeneous mix of neutrophil subsets. This study aims to determine the Siglec expression profile on several neutrophil subsets and assess their immunosuppressive ability. Methods We identified CD16high and CD16low neutrophil subsets from the low-density fractions of human peripheral blood and compared them to high-density neutrophils. We profiled the expression of the entire family of Siglecs on these three key neutrophil populations under steady-state conditions in healthy subjects as well as cancer patients. Moreover, the ability of these populations, isolated from healthy subjects, to suppress T cell proliferation was assessed. Results Two distinct subpopulations were investigated within the low-density fraction of human peripheral blood (CD15+CD66b+CD16low and CD15+CD66b+CD16high) and compared to high-density neutrophils (CD15+CD66b+CD16high). We found that in addition to CD33 (Siglec-3), Siglec-5/-14, -7, and -9, are differentially expressed on the CD16low and CD16high low-density subsets in both healthy, steady-state subjects, and cancer patients. Upregulated expression of CD33 on the CD16low cells led to the initial speculation that they are MDSCs. As the differential expression of Siglec-9 between these two populations was striking, we used CD16 and Siglec-9 double staining to quantify these populations, which demonstrated that the CD16lowSiglec-9low population is greatly upregulated in cancer patients. The CD16high low-density and high-density neutrophils, but not the CD16low low-density neutrophils from healthy subjects, inhibited T cell proliferation, indicating that the CD16lowSiglec-9low population are not MDSCs. Conclusions These results demonstrate that Siglecs are differentially expressed on neutrophil subsets, and along with CD16, may be used to help further define what is a PMN-MDSC. Consistent with current observations by others, PMN-MDSCs may encompass an array of neutrophil subtypes, including low-density neutrophils, and point to the need for more work to precisely define the genetic signatures of PMN-MDSCs.">

This single-cell transcriptomic and flow cytometry analyses revealed distinct activation and transition patterns among neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, and B cells. Neutrophils exhibited early transcriptional remodeling enriched in inflammatory and interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling pathways. Cross-species integration identified a conserved IFNγ-driven transition toward il8⁺ neutrophils. Furthermore, recombinant interleukin-8 (IL8) enhanced antibacterial responses in tilapia and human neutrophils, while inhibition of STAT1 reduced IL8 expression. IL8 stimulation increased phagocytosis and  reactive oxygen species (ROS） production, supporting its role in neutrophil-mediated bacterial clearance. Together, this findings establish IFNγ-IL8 as a conserved mechanism in vertebrate immunity and a potential target for antibacterial therapies.">

        <tr id="Toxoplasma gondii is a globally prevalent intracellular parasite that infects ∼40 million Americans. The murine immune response to Toxoplasma relies on both toll-like receptor (TLR) 11/12 and immunity related GTPase-mediated (IRGs) responses, which humans lack, making it unclear how the human immune response detects and responds to the parasite. We investigated whether human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, which detect phosphoantigens through the BTN3A1 receptor, shape the early immune response to the parasite. Using primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we show that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are activated by Toxoplasma-infected cells in a BTN3A1- dependent manner leading to secretion of interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). Additionally, these T cells potentiate IFNγ production by natural killer (NK) cells, likely via TNFα and interleukin (IL)-12 produced during infection. Active parasite invasion is required to stimulate the IFNγ response, and inhibition of the host mevalonate pathway, which limits the synthesis of the phosphoantigen isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), attenuates the cytokine response, indicating Toxoplasma infection increases host phosphoantigens leading to Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation. Our findings identify Vγ9Vδ2 T cells as key effectors that potentiate NK cells in the early human immune response to Toxoplasma, bridging innate and adaptive immunity in the absence of TLR11/12 signaling.">

        <tr id="Type II testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common solid malignancies in young men and are classified into seminomas and non-seminomatous subtypes. Seminomas are known for their highly pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) with abundant immune cell infiltration. While previous work has demonstrated that the seminoma-derived cell line TCam-2 induces immune cell activation in co-culture and undergoes phenotypic changes itself, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. To explore the role of direct cell–cell interaction and the effects mediated by soluble mediators such as cytokines, we conducted co-culture experiments of TCam-2 cells with purified human T cells or monocytes, including Transwell assays and treatments with IL-6, TNFα, or their respective blocking antibodies Tocilizumab and Adalimumab. In this way, we found that immune cell activation, indicated by enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an upregulation of activation markers, strongly depended on direct physical contact between both cell types. Nonetheless, we also unveiled the role of soluble mediators in both immune cell activation and promoting a shift in TCam-2 cells from a seminoma-like phenotype to a more dedifferentiated phenotype, suggesting that cytokines critically shape the TME. These observations highlight the complexity of tumor–immune interactions in the seminoma microenvironment, offering new insight into immune-driven dynamics in TGCTs.">

It is evident that NK cells exert a significant influence on symptom severity, and their absence, with the presence or absence of their surface receptors, elicits a tailored response to the virus.

        <tr id="The long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs following kidney transplantation increases the risk of life-threatening infections, malignancies, and, paradoxically, eventual allograft rejection. Therefore, achieving a balance between over-immunosuppression and under-immunosuppression is critical to optimizing patient outcomes. One promising approach is immune cell-based therapy using suppressor immune cells to modulate the immune response more precisely. Among these, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the most extensively studied and have shown significant potential in the post-transplant setting. Tregs are broadly categorized into thymus-derived and peripherally derived subsets. Physiologically, they play key roles in maintaining immune tolerance, including in autoimmune diseases and within the tumor microenvironment. Their immunosuppressive functions are mediated through both contact-dependent and contact-independent mechanisms. Studies investigating the use of Tregs following kidney transplantation have shown encouraging results. This review summarizes the biology of Tregs and highlights current evidence supporting their role in transplant immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The transformation of myeloid leukemia blasts into leukemia‑derived dendritic cells (DCleu) is a notable phenomenon. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in modulating physiological and pathological activities, particularly in immune activation. In the present study, EVs were isolated from DC/DCleu culture supernatants derived from healthy (H) donors (n=9) and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=9) using whole blood (WB) samples, both with and without Kit M (granulocyte‑macrophage colony‑stimulating factor and prostaglandin E1). This was followed by T‑cell enriched mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) with Kit M‑treated and untreated WB. To assess the qualitative and quantitative differences in EVs between Kit M‑treated and untreated samples, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis and multiplex bead‑based flow cytometry were employed. The present findings indicate that DC/MLC supernatant‑derived EVs can be successfully identified, quantified and characterized. Furthermore, these EVs exhibit regulatory properties in both H and AML samples. Results showed that a higher number of CD8+ EVs were detected after DC culture compared with before in both H and AML samples. Thrombocyte‑associated EVs (CD41b+, CD42a+ and CD62P+) significantly increased following DC culture in both groups. While low frequencies of progenitor/blast marker (CD133+) associated EVs were detected in H samples before and after DC culture, their frequencies increased after DC culture in AML samples. Additionally, a higher number of CD8+ and CD2+ EVs were observed after MLC culture compared with before in both H and AML samples. Correlation analyses revealed that improved blast lysis in Kit M‑pretreated samples (normalized to control) associated with the presence of EV subtypes associated with T (CD2+), B (CD20+, 24+), and other cell markers (for example, CD31+, CD146+, CD44+ and CD49e+). This comprehensive approach provides insights into the impact of Kit M on DC/DCleu generation and the subsequent activation of immune cells, leading to differences in EV production between H and AML samples.">

        <tr id="Background CNS stromal cells, especially fibroblasts and endothelial cells, support leukocyte accumulation through upregulation of adhesion molecules and lymphoid chemokines. While chronically activated fibroblast networks can drive pathogenic immune cell aggregates known as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), early stromal cell activation during CNS infection can support anti-viral T cells. However, the cell types and factors driving early stromal cell activation is poorly explored. Aims A neurotropic murine coronavirus (mCoV) infection model was used to better characterize signals that promote fibroblast networks supporting accumulation of antiviral lymphocytes. Based on the early appearance of IgD+ B cells with unknown functions during several CNS infections, we probed their potential to activate stromal cells through lymphotoxin β (LTβ), a molecule critical in maintaining fibroblast-networks in lymphoid tissues as well as promoting TLS in autoimmunity and cancers. Results Kinetic analysis of stromal cell activation in olfactory bulbs and brains revealed that upregulation of adhesion molecules and lymphoid chemokines Ccl19, Ccl21 and Cxcl13 closely tracked viral replication. Immunohistochemistry revealed that upregulation of the fibroblast marker podoplanin (PDPN) at meningeal and perivascular sites mirrored kinetics of RNA expression. Moreover, both B cells and T cells colocalized to areas of PDPN reactivity, supporting a potential role in regulating stromal cell activation. However, specific depletion of LTβ from B cells using Mb1-creERT2 x Ltβfl/fl mice had no effect on T or B cell recruitment or viral replication. B cell depletion by anti-CD20 antibody also had no adverse effects. Surprisingly, LTβR agonism reduced viral control and parenchymal T cell localization despite increasing stromal cell lymphoid chemokines and PDPN. Additional assessment of direct stromal cell activation by the viral RNA mimic poly I:C showed induction of Pdpn and Ccl19 preceding Ltb. Conclusions Neither B cell-derived LTβ or B cells are primary drivers of stromal cell activation networks in the CNS following mCoV infection. Although supplementary agonist mediated LTβR engagement confirmed a role for LTβ in enhancing PDPN and lymphoid chemokine expression, it impeded T cell migration to the CNS parenchyma and viral control. Our data overall indicate that stromal cells can integrate LTβR signals to tune their activation, but that LTβ is not necessarily essential and can even dysregulate protective antiviral T cell functions.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and intrinsic resistance to conventional therapies. Radiotherapy (RT), traditionally valued for its cytotoxic effects, has recently been recognized for its immunomodulatory potential. This mini-review explores the multifaceted interactions between RT and the PDAC immune microenvironment, highlighting mechanisms such as induction of immunogenic cell death, enhancement of antigen presentation, modulation of cytokine and chemokine profiles, and upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules. These effects may transform immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot” ones, providing a rationale for combination strategies with immunotherapy. However, the dense desmoplastic stroma, abundance of regulatory T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells within PDAC present substantial challenges that hinder effective immune activation. Advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies offer new opportunities to better characterize the TME and guide personalized treatment strategies. By synthesizing mechanistic insights and clinical evidence, this review underscores the potential of integrating RT with immunotherapy to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve therapeutic outcomes in PDAC.">

        <tr id="This study employed single-cell sequencing to analyze immune dynamics in pediatric infectious mononucleosis (IM), focusing on EBV-host interactions. EBV primarily infected B-cell subsets, showing distinct tropism from EBV-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, indicating stage-specific infection patterns. Coexpression of lytic (BALF3/5) and latent (EBNA-3A, LMP-2A) genes suggested dynamic infection states. Notably, RPMS1 expression was consistently detected in IM patients, where this oncogenic regulator influences viral latency maintenance and cellular transformation through Notch signaling. NK cell subsets exhibited differential responses: CD16 + CD56dim NK cells demonstrated enhanced EBV cytotoxicity, while CD16 - CD56bright NK cells showed immunoregulatory potential. Clonal expansion of IGHV4-34/59 in B cells (involved in EBV gp350 binding and autoimmunity) suggested dual roles in viral neutralization and pathogenesis. Frequent IGHJ4/IGLJ3 BCR rearrangements informed vaccine design. Elevated COTL1 in T cells correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine release, indicating therapeutic potential. Dysregulated IRF4/PRDM1 in plasma cells reflected interindividual EBV control variability. These findings delineate IM immunopathology, linking EBV persistence to clonal expansion and immune evasion, while providing a framework for targeted therapies (NK cell engineering, IGHV4-directed antibodies, COTL1 modulation) to advance EBV-associated disease treatment.">

        <tr id="Recent clinical trials show that CAR-T cell therapies can initially blunt tumor growth in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. However, the tumor microenvironment activates mechanisms that inhibit tumor-killing potential of the CAR-T cells and limit their therapeutic efficacy. To counteract this, we have utilized oncolytic adenovirus (OV) Ad5-Δ24-RGD as a platform to overexpress a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) targeting both T cell marker CD3 and GBM specific tumor associated antigen IL-13Rα2. We first demonstrated that OV-BiTE could enhance recruitment of T cells to GBM in vitro and in vivo . We then showed that intratumoral injection of OV-BiTE followed by infusion of combined EGFR- and EGFRvIII-CAR-T cells was more effective than OV-BiTE supplemented with either CAR-T therapy alone, and led to significant tumor eradication in a GBM xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, our multimodal OV-BiTE & CAR-T cell immunotherapy is capable of overcoming immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and GBM resistance to treatment.

        <tr id="Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are initially efficacious against anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene-positive lung adenocarcinoma (ALK+ LUAD), but acquired resistance inevitably occurs. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies are needed for TKI-resistant cases. Although the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has improved the prognosis of patients with lung cancer, patients with ALK+ LUAD exhibit little or no response to immunotherapy and the underlying resistance mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we explored the immunological status of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in ALK+ LUAD tissues. Tumor-infiltrating leukocyte analysis revealed reduced numbers of effector T cells and increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) relative to ALK- LUAD cases, indicating that ALK+ LUAD has a myeloid cell-dominant immunosuppressive TME. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis identified a subset of macrophages that expressed most T cell-attractant chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), and the macrophages were inactivated in ALK+ LUAD. In contrast, ALK+ LUAD expressed high levels of MDSC-attractant chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL8). In addition, ALK+ LUAD showed higher levels of IL-6, an MDSC-inducing cytokine, than ALK- LUAD. An IL-6R inhibitor transformed the TME in a murine ALK+ LUAD model, shifting it from an immunosuppressive to a T cell-dominant status. Although ICI monotherapy lacked antitumor effects, a combination of ICI and the IL-6R inhibitor had significant antitumor effects in mice. Our findings illustrate the molecular basis of fusion gene-mediated immunosuppressive TMEs, providing a rationale for a novel combination immunotherapy for ALK+ LUAD.">

        <tr id="Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) confers growth advantage to glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and is associated with significantly shorter survival in GBM patients. The interaction between tumor cells and macrophages plays a crucial role in tumor development, supporting angiogenesis, nurturing tumor stem cells, and promoting immune-suppressive TME. Therefore, elucidating the potential mechanisms by which EGFRvIII mutation in GBM cells regulates surrounding immune cells to drive tumor progression may provide new targets for precise immune therapy for specific GBM subtypes or genotypes. In this study, we found that EGFRvIII was the most common form of EGFR mutation, with an incidence rate of 22.13% in glioma patients and 33.3% in GBM patients. Mechanistically, we found for the first time that EGFRvIII-positive GBM secretes high levels of MDK via the ERK-c-Fos signaling pathway. Subsequently, GBM cell-secreted MDK drives macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype and secretion of the cytokine CXCL1 via activation of the macrophage surface receptor LRP1 and downstream pathways. In turn, these macrophages secrete CXCL1, which attracts immune-suppressive cells and TAMs to support GBM growth. In the intracranial glioma model, blocking MDK signaling pathway could inhibit macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype and tumor malignant progression. In summary, our study for the first time found that EGFRvIII-positive GBM can drive macrophage polarization towards M2 phenotype and secretion of immune-suppressive cytokine CXCL1 via the c-Fos-MDK-LRP1 signaling pathway, providing new targets for precise immune therapy for specific GBM subtypes or genotypes.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AIMS
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer mortality in China. Anti-angiogenic drugs (AADs) plus immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) combination therapy shows considerable promise for HCC; however, its efficacy is hampered by immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment. High endothelial venules (HEVs) facilitate lymphocyte migration and tumor infiltration. The aim was to study the formation, functional mechanisms, and clinical relevance of HEVs in the treatment of HCC with combination therapy.


APPROACH RESULTS
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry revealed increased HEV expression and higher CD3⁺ T-cell infiltration in HCC tissue after combination AAD and ICB therapy. Multiplex immunohistochemistry and spatial analysis demonstrated that CCR7⁺CD8⁺ T cells were spatially associated with HEVs. Pseudotime analysis of human T cells and treatment of Hepa1-6 orthotopic liver tumor mouse models with CCR7+CD8+ T-cell transfusions were used to show that CCR7+CD8+ T cells can differentiate into cytotoxic effector T cells. The same models demonstrated that combination therapy activated VEGFC and non-canonical NF-κB pathways, promoting HEV formation. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that high HEV density correlated with improved clinical response and prolonged survival.


CONCLUSIONS
HEVs are pivotal in modulating immune activity within the HCC tumor microenvironment. Targeting the VEGFC-NF-κB (non- canonical)-HEV axis could be a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance antitumor immunity and improve outcomes in patients with HCC who are receiving combination AAD plus ICB therapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction T cells are major components of the immune system. Their activation requires interaction between the T cell receptor and co-stimulatory molecules, crucial during infection, inflammation, and allogeneic rejection. Monomeric CRP (mCRP) is a known modulator of inflammation and particularly the innate immune response, however its interaction with T cells as part of the adaptive immune response remains unclear. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and T cells were isolated. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted to evaluate Fcγ receptor CD16 expression on T cells, the binding of CRP to T cells, and its impact on proliferation and apoptosis. T cell activation was assessed after 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days by assessing CD69 and CD25 expression, and under various conditions including coculture with monocytes and several inhibitory factors. Results T cells express CD16 that binds mCRP in a concentration-dependent manner, and particularly on activated T cells. While mCRP reduces apoptosis and accelerates proliferation in T cells, it does not independently activate them. However, activation of monocytes by mCRP leads to T cell activation, indicating a direct cell to cell interaction during CRP-induced activation. This effect could be alleviated by inhibition of the CD80/CD28 pathway. Conclusion CRP does not activate T Cells directly but via PI3-kinase-dependent activation of monocytes and subsequent CD80/CD28 cell to cell contact. The findings suggest the effects of CRP on T cells depend on their environment and the presence of other proinflammatory agents.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells play pivotal immunological roles including direct cytotoxic effector function and secretion of inflammatory and immunomodulating cytokines. In the context of chronic inflammation, NK cell fitness decreases during disease progression through currently unknown mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that Interleukin-35 (IL-35) inhibits human NK cell proliferation, pro-inflammatory, and cytotoxic functions, while promoting secretion of TGF-β and proangiogenic factors in vitro. We show prolonged exposure to IL-35 converts both conventional and adaptive NK cells into CD9+CD103+CD49a+ ILC1-like cells via autocrine TGF-β. We assess cancer patient-derived public datasets and reveal the presence of IL-35-producing cells and IL-35-receptor-expressing NK/ILC1-like cells within the tumor microenvironment and associate IL-35 with poor prognosis. Collectively, our findings identify and implicate IL-35 as a key driver of NK cell plasticity, promoting the acquisition of features associated with tissue residency and weakened effector functions, and could be relevant in pathophysiological contexts, highlighting IL-35 as an attractive target for future immunotherapies aimed at enhancing NK cell clinical activity.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a fatal central nervous system infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans breaching the blood–brain barrier (BBB), carrying a mortality rate approaching 100% in untreated individuals, while even survivors following treatment often experience neurological complications including optic nerve atrophy, memory impairment, hydrocephalus, and motor dysfunction. Current research has yet to fully elucidate the complex pathological mechanisms of CM, particularly leaving a significant gap in the systemic analysis within the dynamic interaction network of immunity, metabolism, and the gut microbiota. This article systematically integrates the interplay of immune responses, metabolic reprogramming, and the gut microbiome to reveal the pathogenesis of CM across multiple dimensions: in immune regulation, the phagocytic-inflammatory equilibrium in macrophages and CD4 + T cells defends against pathogen invasion, but hyperactivated immune responses may damage the BBB and exacerbate neural injury; metabolically, host iron overload induces ferroptosis, disrupting the BBB via lipid peroxidation, while inositol metabolism provides substrates for cryptococcal capsular synthesis, enhancing its virulence and promoting CNS invasion; the gut microbiota, meanwhile, modulates immune homeostasis via the “gut-brain axis,” with its metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) enhancing BBB integrity and suppressing neuroinflammation through immunomodulation. We propose a combined therapeutic strategy of “immunomodulators + metabolic inhibitors + microbiota intervention,” moving beyond traditional single-factor research paradigms to establish a multi-omics integrated framework for the precise treatment of CM—spanning molecular mechanisms to clinical translation—and propelling the field of neuroinfectious diseases towards a host-pathogen-microenvironment systemic regulation paradigm.">

        <tr id="Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by cartilage damage and bone erosion. Current pharmacological treatments often fail to repair damaged tissues and may cause severe immune-related side effects. Moreover, some patients exhibit inadequate responses to existing therapies. This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles (EV) derived from immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) overexpressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA4Ig) (CT-EV) compared with iMSC-derived EVs (ASC-EV). Methods Following EV characterization and in vitro functional assessments, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model mice (n = 10/group) were treated with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS, 150 µL, twice weekly; Group C), ASC-EV (derived from the culture supernatant of 2 × 106 iMSCs/150 µL of dPBS, twice weekly; Group E), CT-EV (derived from the culture supernatant of 2 × 106 CTLA4Ig-overexpressing iMSCs/150 µL of dPBS, twice weekly; Group CT), or methotrexate (3 mg/kg, three times per week; Group M). A normal control group received dPBS (150 µL, twice weekly; Group N). Results CT-EV showed a significant increase in EV quantity and the production of CTLA4, transforming growth factor β1, and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist compared with ASC-EV. In mitogen-stimulated immune cells from CIA mice, CT-EV significantly reduced IL-6, IL-10, and Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Presumably Secreted (RANTES) levels. Administration of both ASC-EV and CT-EV led to a decrease in macrophage proportions and an increase in T helper type 2 cells and serum IL-4 levels. Furthermore, CT-EV treatment resulted in additional reductions in anti-CII antibody levels, C-telopeptide II concentrations, and the proportion of CD138⁺ cells, thereby contributing to cartilage protection. Conclusions CT-EV demonstrated superior therapeutic effects compared with ASC-EV in the CIA model, highlighting its potential as an effective treatment strategy for RA.

        <tr id="VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is an autoinflammatory disorder caused by acquired somatic UBA1 mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, affecting peripheral myeloid and natural killer (NK) cells. Given the high rate of severe infections observed in VEXAS patients, we hypothesized that NK cell dysfunction contributes to this increased susceptibility. We conducted a comprehensive immune characterization of peripheral NK cells in patients with VEXAS (n=40), patients with autoinflammatory diseases without UBA1 mutations (n=22), and elderly gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n=16). Multiparameter phenotyping was performed using CyTOF, scRNAseq, whole blood stimulation assays and in vitro NK cell cytotoxic assay. Peripheral NK cells in VEXAS were quantitatively and qualitatively impaired. Mass cytometry revealed reduced frequencies of mature cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells and an expansion of the CD56high CD16dim subset. NK cells exhibited features of exhaustion, including increased PD-1 expression, and reduced levels of cytotoxic markers such as NKp46 and CD8α. scRNAseq analysis showed decreased signatures of cytotoxicity and IL-2 and IFN-γ production, alongside increased inflammatory signatures. Whole blood stimulation assays confirmed impaired IL-2, IFN-γ, and granzyme B production following TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/TLR8 agonist stimulation. Extended NK phenotyping by flow cytometry confirmed reduced activating receptors' expression and impaired IFN-γ production in VEXAS. Moreover, in vitro UBA1 inhibitors impaired NK cell cytotoxic capacity and promote cell death. Finally, reduced NK cell frequencies were independently associated with an increased risk of severe infections. These findings suggest that NK cell dysfunction in VEXAS syndrome contributes to increased susceptibility to severe infections.">

Examining how VEGF affects the behavior and functionality of dendritic cells (DCs). Through an examination of the interactions among VEGF, DCs, and the tumor microenvironment. Methods This study investigated the expression of the immunosuppressive markers IDO and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in DCs under the effect of VEGF employing real-time PCR (RT-PCR), flow cytometry and Western blot (WB). Additionally, mixed lymphocyte reactions and tumor cell cytotoxicity assays were conducted to assess functional changes in DCs. Results VEGF exposure led to an upregulation of IDO and PD-L1 in DCs, coupled with reduced T-cell proliferation and altered immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. In vivo studies using mice models further substantiated the role of VEGF in enhancing tumor immune tolerance. Conclusion Our findings elucidate the crucial role of VEGF in OSCC progression by modulating DC function, offering new insights into potential immunotherapeutic strategies targeting VEGF-mediated pathways.

        <tr id="Previously, we reported that targeting IGSF9 could enhance anti-tumor T-cell activity and sensitivity to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, although the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we find that, similar to the regulation of PD-L1 expression, IFNγ also induces the expression of IGSF9 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The siRNA specifically targeting JAK1 and a STAT1 inhibitor blocking IFNγ signal pathway significantly inhibit the expression of IGSF9 and PD-L1. As a tumor-specific immune checkpoint molecule, IGSF9 plays a significant role in promoting tumor escape. The induction of both PD-L1 and IGSF9 by IFNγ in the tumor microenvironment explains why IGSF9 is highly expressed in tumors and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This induction also underpins the strong synergistic effects when combining anti-IGSF9 and anti-PD-1 therapies. Additionally, IGSF9 also mediates the extramedullary infiltration of AML cells, which can be inhibited by depletion of IGSF9 or anti-IGSF9. The binding epitopes of anti-IGSF9 are located within the immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) and fibronectin type-III-2(FnIII-2) domains of IGSF9. Based on these findings, we develop an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting IGSF9 (anti-IGSF9-linker-DXd). This ADC exhibits 99.7% purity, primarily exists in monomeric form, demonstrating excellent homogeneity (DAR=8-10) and specificity. Anti-IGSF9-linker-DXd effectively kills IGSF9-positive tumor cells and exhibits a potent bystander effect. In vivo, anti-IGSF9-linker-DXd almost completely eliminates early- and mid-stage tumors and significantly inhibits the progression of advanced tumors. In summary, our findings underscore the potential of IGSF9 as a novel therapeutic target for AML treatment, highlighting its role in disease progression and the efficacy of targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Human papillomavirus-mediated recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a premalignant neoplasia of the upper airway characterized by significant dysphonia and respiratory obstruction. Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a potential alternative to repeated surgical interventions in RRP. Here, we investigated the intralesional T-cell composition and expression of the immune checkpoints programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) in RRP. We analyzed tissue samples from 30 patients treated at a tertiary care center between 2009 and 2021, including paired samples from individual patients collected at different time points. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for CD4, CD8, CTLA-4, FoxP3, and PD-L1 and correlated with disease severity and previous adjuvant therapies. Overall disease burden and intervention-free survival were not associated with the abundance of CD4+, CD8+, or FoxP3+ T cells, nor with immune checkpoint expression. However, patients with aggressive disease exhibited a higher intralesional FoxP3/CD4 T-cell ratio. Prior intralesional cidofovir treatment was associated with reduced CD4+ T-cell infiltration. These findings suggest that a locally immunosuppressive microenvironment, reflected by an elevated FoxP3/CD4 ratio, contributes to disease severity in RRP. Consistent CTLA-4 expression across all evaluated samples supports further investigation of anti-CTLA-4 therapy, either alone or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. Unfortunately, the inability of lymphocytes to infiltrate the tumor nest, a phenomenon known as immune exclusion, drastically limits ICB responsiveness. Analyzing the immune landscape of matched pre- and early on-treatment biopsies of patients with melanoma undergoing ICB therapy, we observed a significant increase in cytotoxic NK cells in early on-treatment biopsies from nonresponders. Spatial multiomic analyses revealed that, although NK cells colocalized with CD8+ T cells within the tumor bed in responding lesions, they were excluded from the tumor parenchyma in nonresponding lesions. Strikingly, pharmacologic depletion of NK cells in a unique melanoma mouse model exhibiting an immune-excluded phenotype unleashed immune infiltration of the tumor core and tumor clearance upon ICB exposure. Mechanistically, we show that NK cells are actively recruited to immune-excluded areas upon ICB exposure via the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 to suppress tumor infiltration and antitumor function of CD8+ T cells.


SIGNIFICANCE
Immune exclusion is responsible for intrinsic resistance to ICB in about half of nonresponder patients. Our unexpected observation that targeting NK cell biology unleashes the recruitment and antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells in tumors with an immune-excluded phenotype offers a potential therapeutic avenue for this large patient population.

However, the intricate mechanisms governing IgA class-switch recombination and its dysregulation in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease remain a significant challenge in the field. Our study delves into the significance of IgA regulation in mucosal immunity, focusing on the N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) in NIK mRNA by NAT10 in B cells. We discovered that NAT10-mediated ac4C stabilizes NIK mRNA, thereby promoting IgA production, which is pivotal for immune defense. Our findings in a B-cell conditional NAT10 knockout mouse model highlight a reduction in IgA expression and a dampened noncanonical NF-κB pathway, suggesting NAT10 as a potential therapeutic target for IgA-related disorders. This research provides novel insights into the post-transcriptional regulation of IgA and underscores the role of NAT10 in modulating mucosal immunity.">

Therefore, TIM3 has been suggested as a potential target for AML treatment. Hence, we explored the feasibility of targeting TIM3 with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cells. Despite the expression of TIM3 on activated T‐cells, TIM3 CAR T‐cells were successfully generated from different healthy individuals with excellent in vitro expansion without signs of fratricide and sustained central‐memory phenotype with minimal expression of exhaustion‐related markers, including complete loss of TIM3 expression. TIM3 loss also did not affect effector functions since TIM3 CAR T‐cells efficiently lysed TIM3+ leukemic cell lines, produced Th1‐predominant cytokines, successfully inhibited the colony‐forming of TIM3+ AML‐derived LSPCs, and showed excellent AML tumor control in xenogeneic mouse models. Notably, TIM3 CAR T‐cells did not affect healthy hematopoietic progenitor cells and healthy mature hematopoietic cells that express TIM3 at moderate levels, suggesting an optimal therapeutic window for the treatment of AML.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive hematological malignancy, is driven by oncogenic mutations in stem and progenitor cells that give rise to AML blasts. While these mutations are well-characterized, their impact on healthy hematopoiesis-those blood cells exposed to AML but not mutated-has not been well-characterized. As the marrow is the major site for granulopoiesis, neutrophils are heavily influenced by AML pathobiology. Indeed, most AML patients report neutropenia, rendering them susceptible to infections. However, since AML studies use peripheral blood mononuclear cells devoid of neutrophils, the characterization of neutrophil dysfunction remains poorly understood. To investigate AML-exposed neutrophils, a pre-clinical AML mouse model was used where primary leukemic cells were transplanted into non-irradiated neutrophil reporter (Ly6G-tdTomato; Catchup) hosts. Neutrophils could not completely mature, suggesting impaired granulopoiesis. Single-cell transcriptomics of AML-exposed neutrophils revealed higher inflammation signatures and expression of CD14, an inflammatory marker. To address the factors contributing to this biology, an ex vivo cytokine screen was performed on marrow neutrophils and identified that NFκB signaling drove CD14 expression. AML-exposed neutrophils displayed widespread chromatin remodeling, and de novo motif discovery predicted increased binding sites for CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) and Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Moreover, AML-exposed neutrophils inhibited T-cell proliferation, highlighting their immune-suppressive capability. Finally, similar biology of immature, inflammatory neutrophils was found in AML patients, again indicating dysregulated granulopoiesis. Collectively, these data show that AML-associated inflammation alters neutrophil granulopoiesis, impairs neutrophil function, and drives immunosuppression, thus contributing to patient susceptibility to infection.">

        <tr id="Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a leading cause of limb disability due to ischemia caused by atherosclerotic plaques. Cell-based therapies using endothelial cells (ECs) have shown promise in promoting angiogenesis for PAD, but challenges remain in obtaining sufficient ECs from human tissues. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potential solution, though immune rejection issues arise due to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches. The depletion of HLA class I and II through gene editing aims to broadly avoid lymphocyte recognition and can be achieved by inactivating β2-microglobulin (B2M) and class II transactivator (CIITA). However, B2M inactivation can lead to a ‘missing self’ killing response by NK cells and macrophages. To overcome this, we proposed universal iPSCs by knocking out B2M and CIITA and over-expressing CD24 to reduce immune rejection. Methods Universal iPSCs were tested for their pluripotency and ability to differentiate into ECs. The stimulation of universal iPSC-derived endothelial cells (U-ECs) to T and NK cells was evaluated by activation marker using flow cytometry. We generated a humanized mouse model by intravenously injecting CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells isolated from umbilical cord blood into NSG mice. Finally, we induced a humanized PAD mouse model by removing the femoral artery of the left hindlimb. Then we injected U-ECs, demonstrating the therapeutic efficacy of U-ECs. Results We generated hypoimmunogenic universal iPSC by knocking out B2M and CIITA, along with over-expressing CD24, and confirmed that their pluripotency was maintained. We demonstrated that U-ECs exhibit functional endothelial properties and reduced immunogenicity, effectively mitigating immune recognition from both adaptive and innate immune responses. U-ECs survived in significantly greater numbers after transplantation and elicited a weaker immune response in humanized mice. Then we induced hindlimb ischemia in humanized mice to establish a humanized PAD model. U-ECs induced effective angiogenic capabilities, leading to significant blood flow restoration in ischemic limbs. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of creating hypoimmunogenic iPSCs and their derivatives that can reduce immune response and function effectively in vivo.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Colon cancer is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with significant global incidence and mortality. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in disease progression and treatment response. Among key components of the TME are tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T cells, whose balance influences cancer outcomes.


METHODS
This review analyzes recent findings regarding the role of Treg cells in colon cancer progression by evaluating preclinical and clinical studies that explore immune cell composition, function, and modulation within the TME.


RESULTS
Treg cells demonstrate a dual role in colon cancer. While they suppress effective anti-tumor immune responses, facilitating immune evasion, they may also mitigate chronic inflammation, which contributes to carcinogenesis. High intratumoral Treg levels are correlated with poor prognosis, reduced immunotherapy efficacy, and lower overall survival. Strategies to deplete or reprogram Tregs, such as immune checkpoint inhibition, modulation of T cell plasticity, and selective targeting, have shown promise in enhancing anti-tumor immunity.


DISCUSSION
Complete depletion of Tregs risks inducing autoimmune toxicity. Therefore, a precise understanding of Treg cell subsets and functions is essential. This review highlights the importance of developing targeted immunotherapeutic strategies that modulate Treg activity while preserving immune homeostasis in colon cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute myocarditis (AM), particularly fulminant myocarditis (FM), is an infrequent but life-threatening cardiac inflammation, with limited effective precision-targeted treatments available. This urgent clinical challenge has prompted further investigations into the mechanisms underlying this pathology to develop novel therapeutic approaches.


METHODS
We enrolled 40 patients diagnosed with AM (24 mild, 16 fulminant) between December 2022 and November 2023. Using a multi-omics approach, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma-integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing, cytometry by time of flight, and Olink proteomics to identify specific pathogenic immune subsets and molecular alterations. In vitro experiments validated the function and inducing signals of identified pathogenic subsets. In coxsackievirus B3-induced FM mice, cytometry by time of flight analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cardiac infiltrating immune cells. Pharmacological blockade of key molecular was tested to assess potential therapeutic efficacy.


RESULTS
We identified that a specialized type of CD8+ effector T cells, CD57+CD8+ T cells with high cytotoxicity and migration potential, were significantly enriched and exhibited large clonal expansion in AM. Differential expression analysis revealed upregulation of natural killer-like receptor genes in CD57+CD8+ effector T cells from FM compared with mild cases, which was positively associated with enhanced cytotoxicity and migration potential. In vitro experiments confirmed the existence of circulating CD57+CD8+ effector T cells with high cytotoxic degranulation and migration potential inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis, supporting their cardiac migration and cardiomyocyte cytotoxicity in pathogenesis. Elevated circulating interleukin (IL)-18 levels in patients with AM induced the functional differentiation of CD57+CD8+ effector T cells. In addition, increased proinflammatory CXCL8+CD14+ monocytes potentially contributed to increasing IL-18 levels and crosstalk with CD57+CD8+ effector T cells. In FM mice, we observed the analogous expansions of CD57+CD8+ effector T cells and CXCL2+LY6C+ monocytes in both blood and hearts, accompanied by elevated plasma IL-18 levels. Disrupting the pathogenic axis involving proinflammatory monocytes, IL-18 signaling, and CCR5-mediated cardiac recruitment significantly alleviated FM in mice.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides a comprehensive immune landscape for understanding the pathogenesis of AM, especially in FM, highlighting clonal CD57+CD8+ effector T cells with high cytotoxicity and migration potential, along with their upstream inflammatory signals, as potential therapeutic targets for mitigating immune-related cardiac damage in AM management, especially in FM.">

Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are widely used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reactivation being a significant unresolved issue. The pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. Integrated transcriptomic analysis could provide insights into monitoring tuberculosis progression after TNFi therapy and help reduce LTBI reactivation.


METHODS
We selected six transcriptomic datasets from studies related to TNFi treatment and tuberculosis. Pathway enrichment, pseudotime, and transcription factor analyses were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms.


RESULTS
Our analysis revealed distinct transcriptional changes in memory B cells during tuberculosis progression and TNFi therapy. In active tuberculosis (ATB), ROR1+ memory B cells were identified in a noncanonical differentiation trajectory, characterized by downregulation of B cell-related genes (e.g., CD22, EBF1, MS4A1), reduced translational capacity, and suppression of immune response pathways, accompanied by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, which highlighted metabolic alterations during tuberculosis progression. A similar subtype also emerged in TNFi-treated patients, suggesting that metabolic reprogramming of memory B cells may disrupt immune balance, thereby contributing to LTBI reactivation and ATB development following TNFi therapy.


CONCLUSIONS
The study integrates bioinformatics and single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the role of memory B cells in ATB progression and TNFi treatment, offering insights into TNFi-associated TB susceptibility and potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for systemic sclerosis (SSc), a rare autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and vasculopathy. Recent evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefits of MSCs do not depend directly on their ability to proliferate but rather on their capacity to release extracellular nanovesicles known as exosomes (MSC-Exos). MSC-Exos are rich in bioactive molecules such as microRNAs, which can modulate gene expression and trigger significant biological responses, playing a central role in modulating immune responses, inhibiting fibrotic pathways and promoting tissue repair and angiogenesis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that MSC-Exos can attenuate fibrosis, modulate macrophage polarization, suppress autoreactive lymphocyte activity, and even reverse pulmonary arterial hypertension in animal models of SSc. Compared to cell-based therapies, MSC-Exos offer several advantages, including lower immunogenicity and better safety profile. This review provides an overview of the immunomodulatory, antifibrotic, and angiogenic properties of MSC-Exos and explores their potential as novel cell-free therapy for SSc.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion and suppression lead to unchecked tumor growth in glioblastoma. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been implicated in tumor progression and modulation in glioblastoma. To investigate this potential connection, CMV-associated changes in the glioblastoma immune landscape were characterized in vitro and in a murine glioblastoma model. Infection of mouse glioblastoma cells (GL261Luc2) with mCMV resulted in a short period of viral replication. MHC-I cell surface expression was reduced after mCMV infection by approximately 40% compared with non-infected tumor cells (p < 0.0001). Viral regulators of antigen presentation (vRAP) were shown to be responsible for MHC-I downregulation using a recombinant mCMV (ΔvRAP) lacking the known immune evasion genes. RNA sequencing of mCMV infected GL261Luc cells revealed 2711 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.005). Of particular interest was the downregulation of MHC-I-associated genes H2-Q1-10 and Tap1 fter CMV infection. In vivo, the mCMV immediate early gene (IE1) was detected in brains of mCMV + animals after tumor implantation and increased during tumor growth. mCMV + mice had significantly shorter survival than controls, depending on initial tumor size (P < 0.001). Tumor immune infiltrates in mCMV infection were characterized by B cell infiltrates and low levels of NK cell infiltration. Here, the landscape of immune cell infiltrates is shifted toward B cell infiltration and reduced numbers of NK cells. CMV leads to immune evasion mediated MHC-I downregulation in murine glioblastoma. Thus, CMV infection in glioblastoma may contribute to unchecked tumor growth in glioblastoma by increasing immune evasion.

        <tr id="Tissue stromal cells are composed of numerous cell types with phenotypical and functional heterogeneity. Apart from providing structural support, they are emerging as key orchestrators of both activation and repression of immune responses in tissue microenvironment. The underlying mechanisms by which stromal cells contribute to immunomodulation are multifaceted, in which the chemokine-mediated interactions with immune cells have drawn great attention. The distinct stromal cell subpopulations can change the chemokine secretion profiles to regulate the recruitment and activation of immune cells in the onset and progression of inflammation. Elucidation of the mechanisms of the homeostatic and pathogenic stromal-immune cell interactions via chemokines can assist in the identification of novel therapeutic targets for modulating inflammatory diseases and enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, the current review highlights the updated understanding of the stromal-immune interactions via chemokines in inflammation, as well as potential therapeutic avenues to target at the intercellular crosstalk for inflammatory disorders and cancer.">

        <tr id="Pathogenic germline variants causing excessive telomere shortening may result in bone marrow failure, hematopoietic malignancy, and extramedullary complications, such as pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and solid tumors. Patients with short telomeres also develop immunodeficiency with low CD4+ T cells and impaired general immunosurveillance, particularly against solid neoplasms. We investigated a broad spectrum of lymphocyte subsets and myeloid immune cells from human patients with telomere biology disorders (TBDs) and matched healthy volunteers to understand further how the immune system is affected by telomere dysfunction. We employed mass cytometry (CyTOF) for deep-immunophenotyping peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), followed by high-dimensional data analysis. Cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were assessed in serum. Our results showed profound immune alterations in TBD beyond those observed in aging, with low naïve lymphocytes and thymic hypofunction. We further observed that T helper subsets were markedly skewed, with an inverted TH2/TH1 ratio and low TH17 and TH17.1 levels. T cell activation and exhaustion markers were upregulated, whereas circulating mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells were significantly decreased and overactivated. Several serum cytokine levels were positively correlated with telomere length and blood counts, suggesting an association with marrow function. In aggregate, these findings suggest a pro-inflammatory profile in TBDs. Our data provide new details on how TBD affects immune cells, particularly lymphocytes, which may contribute to the clinical phenotypes.">

        <tr id="T cell-dependent bispecific antibodies (TDBs) are next-generation antibody therapies that link cancer cells and T cells to achieve potent antitumor effects. Despite the successful development of TDBs for hematological malignancies, their efficacy against solid tumors remains limited. Overcoming this challenge requires a deeper understanding of their mechanisms of action. While the basic process of immunological synapse (IS) formation and T cell activation by TDB is known, the detailed effects of IS on the bystander effect and T cell migration, both crucial for therapeutic efficacy, remain unclear. This study investigated these mechanisms using an EGFR/CD3 TDB (hEx3) and EGFR knockout cancer cells (KO). The results revealed that IS formation by TDB induced a bystander effect, leading to damage in surrounding KO, with the extent depending on the proportion of EGFR-positive wild-type cancer cells (WT) and the duration of co-culture. Furthermore, IS formation significantly enhanced T cell cytokine and chemokine secretion, promoting T cell migration. These findings provide critical insights into TDB efficacy mechanisms and highlight the importance of evaluating IS formation in developing new antibody drugs. Establishing a reliable system for assessing IS formation will be essential for advancing TDBs and other antibody-based therapies, particularly against solid tumors.

        <tr id="Mitochondria are integral to the regulation of CD8+ T cell function, critically influencing processes such as activation, differentiation, and long-term persistence during immune responses. Emerging evidence highlights the detrimental impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on CD8+ T cell activity, contributing to immune exhaustion and impairing both antitumor and antiviral immunity. This underscores the importance of understanding and modulating mitochondrial dynamics to optimize T cell-based immunotherapies. In this review, a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the essential mitochondrial processes-including biogenesis, redox homeostasis, and metabolic reprogramming is provided-that govern CD8+ T cell function and are intricately linked to their therapeutic potential. The current strategies aimed at enhancing mitochondrial function in CD8+ T cells are also examined, focusing on both metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial-targeted interventions. Despite these promising approaches, several significant challenges remain, such as achieving selective targeting, addressing mitochondrial plasticity, and mitigating off-target effects. Overcoming these obstacles will be crucial to improving the clinical efficacy and safety of mitochondrial modulation therapies. As the understanding of mitochondrial dynamics within CD8+ T cells continues to evolve, there is growing potential to leverage these insights to improve immune-based therapies across a range of diseases, including cancer and viral infections.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in modulating excessive immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis in humans. Notably, therapeutic strategies employing autologous and allogeneic Tregs have shown promising signs of efficacy in the treatment and prevention of graft versus-host disease (GvHD), transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases. Treg cells are typically obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood, but the largely antigen-experienced memory state of peripheral blood Tregs and the limited number of Tregs that can be isolated from cord blood remain obstacles. However, recent studies have identified the thymus as a novel and promising source of Tregs, overcoming the abovementioned limitations. Currently, human thymus-isolated regulatory T cells (thyTregs) are being investigated in phase 1/2 clinical trials to assess their safety and efficacy in both autologous and allogeneic settings. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the different manufacturing processes for isolation and expansion of thymus-derived regulatory T cells, their clinical relevance and current ongoing clinical trials investigating the therapeutic potential of this novel class of Tregs.">

        <tr id="Introduction Although natural killer (NK) cells play crucial roles in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection, systematic investigations delineating the immune characteristics of NK cells across the tuberculosis (TB) disease spectrum are scarce. Methods This multiomics study employed transcriptomic, proteomic, and RT-qPCR analyses to characterize and validate CD56+ NK cells from 165 participants stratified by TB infection status (active TB (ATB), latent TB infection (LTBI), and healthy control (HC)). Peripheral blood samples from an independent cohort of 85 participants were subjected to flow cytometry analysis and validation. Results and discussion Enrichment analyses of transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed that the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis pathways were enriched in LTBI and ATB groups, whereas chemotaxis-related pathway enrichment was specific to ATB. Further analysis revealed that the expression of genes mediating the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity signaling pathway through perforin–granzyme was upregulated in the LTBI state, whereas that of those associated with death receptors was elevated in ATB, potentially indicating a transformation of NK cell function in different TB infection states. Moreover, analysis of ATB-specific chemotaxis genes suggested that the migration of NK cells was likely to occur in the ATB state. Flow cytometry revealed an increased frequency of CD56dim NK cells and a decreased frequency of CD56bright NK cells in individuals with LTBI versus that in HCs in an independent cohort. In addition, RT-qPCR validation identified a four-biomarker combination (SLC7A5, PDE4D, CXCR4, and SOCS3) distinguishing ATB from HCs, a three-biomarker combination (SLC7A5, PER1, and PDE4D) differentiating LTBI from HC, and a three-biomarker combination (SOCS3, GZMK, and HIST1H3B) differentiating ATB from LTBI. These findings elucidate the immune clearance mechanism of NK cells in TB and provide clinically actionable biomarkers for infection staging, advancing our understanding of TB immunopathogenesis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The adaptive immune system is shaped by self‐recognition, creating a paradox where autoreactivity is essential for immune regulation, yet implicated in autoimmune diseases. Traditionally, B cell selection in the bone marrow (BM) has been viewed through the lens of negative selection, eliminating potentially harmful clones. Emerging evidence challenges this perspective, revealing a subset of B suppressor cells (Bsup) that actively regulate immune homeostasis. Unlike conventional negative selection, C1‐specific Bsup cells, which recognize collagen type II (Col2), engage Col2‐specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) to suppress inflammation in healthy individuals. This suggests that Bsup play a role in both peripheral and central tolerance, akin to Tregs. However, the molecular mechanisms governing Bsup selection, differentiation, and function remain unknown. Understanding how Bsup distinguish homeostatic from pathogenic autoreactivity could transform autoimmune disease treatment, shifting the focus from eliminating autoreactive B cells to harnessing their regulatory potential for precision immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains a major cause of mortality among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The interplay between fungal genotype and host immune response is critical in determining disease outcome. We conducted ex vivo cytokine profiling using peripheral blood from HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults stimulated with heat-inactivated whole-cell antigens from two Cryptococcus neoformans strains: the reference strain H99 and the genetically distinct UgCl377 clinical strain. These strains differ at multiple loci, including the CNAG_04922 gene. Luminex-based quantification revealed that H99 induced significantly higher levels of CD40-ligand, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, and IL-33. These cytokines reflect pro-inflammatory, Th2, and regulatory responses, suggesting robust immune activation. In contrast, the UgCl377 strain elicited a dampened cytokine profile. While this study does not isolate the effect of CNAG_04922 alone, it demonstrates that whole-cell antigens from genetically distinct strains of C. neoformans elicit differential cytokine responses. These findings provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies using purified proteins or isogenic strains.">

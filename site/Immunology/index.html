        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Aberrant immune response is a hallmark of asthma, with 5%–10% of patients suffering from severe disease exhibiting poor response to standard treatment. A better understanding of the immune responses contributing to disease heterogeneity is critical for improving asthma management. T cells are major players in the orchestration of asthma, in both mild and severe disease, but it is unclear whether specific T cell subsets influence asthma symptom duration. Here we show a significant association of airway CD8+ effector memory T cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRAs), but not CD8+CD45RO+ or tissue-resident memory T cells, with asthma duration in patients with severe asthma (SA) but not mild to moderate asthma (MMA). Higher frequencies of IFN-γ+CD8+ TEMRAs compared with IFN-γ+CD45RO+ T cells were detected in SA airways, and the TEMRAs from patients with SA but not MMA proliferated ex vivo, although both expressed cellular senescence-associated biomarkers. Prompted by the transcriptomic profile of SA CD8+ TEMRAs and proliferative response to IL-15, airway IL15 expression was higher in patients with SA compared with MMA. Additionally, IL15 expression in asthmatic airways negatively correlated with lung function. Our findings add what we believe is a new dimension to understanding asthma heterogeneity, identifying IL-15 as a potential target for treatment.">

        <tr id="Preserving barrier integrity is of great importance in mucosal tissues while simultaneously defending against inflammatory threats and exposures to pathogens. NK cells at barrier sites are essential for viral control during infections such as herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) but must also balance pathogen response with tissue protection. We have characterized human tissue NK cells in the vaginal tissue (VT) as having distinct effector and tissue protective functions. Using scRNA-seq and high- parameter flow cytometry, we uncovered a unique signature for VT NK cells, indicating a reduced effector phenotype with increased factors related to tissue residency and immunoregulation at steady state. Despite their functionally quiescent nature, these cells were able to respond robustly to inflammatory signals, suggesting they are poised for pathogen response. We found that the gene signatures between mouse and human NK cells were remarkably similar, demonstrating the feasibility of using a mouse model to probe distinct NK cell functions during mucosal infection. In mice, VT NK cells responded robustly to acute HSV-2 infection and retained an enhanced recall potential after viral clearance. They also secreted tissue repair factors and played a role in restricting tissue damage following viral infection. Our data, using both human tissues and a mouse model, reveal an unexpected role of mucosal tissue NK cells in the VT in balancing host protection with tissue repair in the context of localized mucosal tissue infection.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms driving immune evasion in early-stage I high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Our findings revealed a highly immunosuppressive HGSOC microenvironment, characterized by abundant infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Trajectory analysis uncovered differentiation pathways of naïve Tregs, which underwent either activation and proliferation or transcriptional instability. The predicted Treg-cell interaction network, including crosstalk within tumor cells, facilitates Treg mobility and maturation while reinforcing their immunosuppressive function and persistence in the tumor. Moreover, their interactions with immune cells likely inhibit CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting cells, supporting tumor immune escape. Additionally, more immunogenic tumor conditions, marked by IFNγ production, may contribute to Treg destabilization. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of Tregs in early immune evasion of HGSOC and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting their activity and differentiation fate.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objective To elucidate crucial immune cell subsets and associated immunological pathways by stratifying patients with immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) using immunophenotyping and transcriptomic approaches. Methods We conducted flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses in 23 immune cell subsets derived from 235 patients with six IMDs, using our database, utilizing our database, ImmuNexUT. Patients were stratified based on immunophenotyping data. Subsequently, we examined clinical and transcriptomic differences among these stratified clusters. Results Patients with IMDs were stratified into two clusters based on their immunophenotypes. Cluster 1 was enriched with differentiated B cells, including unswitched memory B cells (USM B), switched memory B cells, double-negative B cells and plasmablasts, while cluster 2 was enriched with naïve B cells. Higher disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis and decreased respiratory functions in systemic sclerosis were observed in cluster 1, whereas the disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus was higher in cluster 2. Numerous differentially expressed genes were detected in USM B. Cluster 1 was associated with glycosylation processes in USM B and elevated B cell-activating factor signalling from myeloid cells in B cells, while cluster 2 exhibited higher B-cell receptor signalling in USM B. Patients in cluster 2, which had an elevated age-associated B-cell signature, exhibited more frequent flares, suggesting that an increased proportion of naïve B cells with this signature is associated with poor prognosis. Conclusion Immunophenotyping-based clusters and transcriptome-based states revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in B cells. To predict IMD prognosis, assessing both the quantity and quality of naïve B cells may be crucial.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8+ T cells are pivotal for long-term anti-tumor immunity due to their longevity and rapid response upon encountering tumor cells. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a member of the Ste20 family of kinases, restricts proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and plays critical roles in T cell priming and activation. However, the impact of HPK1 on CD8+ T cell differentiation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells derived from patients lacking HPK1 exhibit a stronger memory phenotype. HPK1 deletion promotes the formation of precursor and central memory CD8+ T cells, resulting in superior and long-lasting antitumor activity in murine cancer models compared to WT mice. Additionally, HPK1 knockout induces metabolic reprogramming by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial respiration complex activity. Mechanistically, HPK1 deletion downregulates mTOR signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of mTOR and S6. Increased mitophagy activity is observed in HPK1-depleted cells, with upregulation of key mitophagy regulators, including Pink1 and Bnip3l, maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Our study reveals that HPK1 regulates CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming, guiding cell differentiation and antitumor responses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Arginine methyltransferase protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are crucial modulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses, and their differentiation into tumor-associated macrophages is critical in shaping the TME. Despite ongoing clinical trials of small molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 for cancer therapy, their effects on macrophages, a key component of the immune system, remain poorly understood. Methods A pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis was initially conducted to investigate the expression of PRMT5 in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 in mice, as well as the use of a PRMT5-specific inhibitor, was performed to evaluate the impact of PRMT5 on macrophage polarization and tumor progression. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics were employed to explore the mechanistic roles of PRMT5 in regulating lipid metabolism and macrophage polarization. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy was assessed to study its effects on antitumor immunity in vivo. Results The pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis revealed that PRMT5 is highly expressed in the PPARG-macrophage subset, which correlates with poor patient survival. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 reprogrammed macrophages towards an antitumor phenotype, effectively inhibiting tumor progression. Mechanistically, PRMT5 was found to regulate lipid metabolism and drive macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory state via the STAT6-PPARγ pathway, fostering an immunosuppressive TME conducive to tumor growth. Notably, Prmt5 deletion induced PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells. Combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-PD-L1 therapy significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy, demonstrating a synergistic therapeutic effect. Conclusions These findings uncover a crucial role for PRMT5 in macrophage biology and suggest that targeting PRMT5 in myeloid cells offers a promising new approach for cancer immunotherapy. The combination of PRMT5 inhibition with anti-PD-L1 therapy may provide a potent strategy to reprogram the TME and enhance antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Drug-tolerant persister cancer cells were first reported fifteen years ago as a quiescent, reversible cell state which tolerates unattenuated cytotoxic drug stress. It remains unknown whether a similar phenomenon contributes to immune evasion. Here we report a persister state which survives weeks of direct cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) attack. In contrast to previously known immune evasion mechanisms that avoid immune attack, antigenic persister cells robustly activate CTLs which deliver Granzyme B, secrete IFNγ, and induce tryptophan starvation resulting in apoptosis initiation. Instead of dying, persister cells paradoxically leverage apoptotic caspase activity to avoid inflammatory death. Furthermore, persister cells acquire mutations and epigenetic changes which enable outgrowth of CTL-resistant cells. Persister cell features are enriched in inflamed tumors which regressed during immunotherapy in vivo and in surgically resected human melanoma tissue under immune stress ex vivo. These findings reveal a persister cell state which is a barrier to immune-mediated tumor clearance. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) depends on restoring immune recognition of cancer cells that have evaded immune surveillance. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) is associated with immune-poor, so-called cold tumors whereas loss of its signaling promotes DNA misrepair that could stimulate immune response. Methods We analyzed transcriptomic data from IMvigor210, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and Tumor Immune Syngeneic MOuse data sets to evaluate the predictive value of high βAlt, a score representing low expression of a signature consisting of TGFβ targets and high expression of genes involved in error-prone DNA repair. The immune context of βAlt was assessed by evaluating tumor-educated immune signatures. An ICB-resistant, high βAlt preclinical tumor model was treated with a TGFβ inhibitor, radiation, and/or ICB and assessed for immune composition and tumor control. Results We found that a high βAlt score predicts ICB response yet is paradoxically associated with an immune-poor tumor microenvironmentcancer in both human and mouse tumors. We postulated that high βAlt cancers consist of cancer cells in which loss of TGFβ signaling generates a TGFβ rich, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, preclinical modeling showed that TGFβ inhibition followed by radiotherapy could convert an immune-poor, high βAlt tumor to an immune-rich, ICB-responsive tumor. Mechanistically, TGFβ inhibition increased activated natural killer (NK) cells, which were required to recruit lymphocytes to respond to ICB in irradiated tumors. NK cell activation signatures were also increased in high βAlt, cold mouse and human tumors that responded to ICB. Conclusions These studies indicate that loss of TGFβ signaling competency and gain of error-prone DNA repair identifies a subset of cold tumors that are responsive to ICB. Our mechanistic studies show that inhibiting TGFβ activity can convert a high βAlt, cold tumor into ICB-responsive tumors via NK cells. A biomarker consisting of combined TGFβ, DNA repair, and immune context signatures is a means to prospectively identify patients whose cancers may be converted from cold to hot with appropriate therapy.">

        <tr id="Humoral immunity is orchestrated by follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, which promote cognate B cells to produce high-affinity, protective antibodies. In aged individuals, humoral immunity after vaccination is diminished despite the presence of Tfh cells, suggesting defects after initial Tfh cell formation. In this study, we utilized both murine and human systems to investigate how aging alters Tfh cell differentiation after influenza vaccination. We found that young Tfh cells underwent progressive differentiation after influenza vaccination, culminating in clonal expansion of effector-like cells in both draining lymph nodes and blood. In aging, early stages of Tfh cell development occurred normally. However, aging rewired the later stages of development in Tfh cells, resulting in a transcriptional program reflective of cellular senescence, sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and metabolic reprogramming. We investigated the extent to which this rewiring of aged Tfh cells is due to the age-associated inflammatory (“inflammaging”) microenvironment and found that this setting was sufficient to both block the transition of Tfh cells to a post-effector resting state and skew Tfh cells toward the age-rewired state. Together, these data suggest that aging dampens humoral immunity by cytokine-mediated rewiring of late effector Tfh cell differentiation into an activated, yet less functional, cellular state.">

        <tr id="Introduction The tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, with tumor-associated macrophages significantly influencing immune suppression and tumor growth. Colorectal cancers (CRC) classified as Consensus Molecular Subtype 4 (CMS4) and triple-negative breast cancers subsets are particularly characterized by a mesenchymal phenotype, immune exclusion, and extensive macrophage infiltration. This study aimed to investigate how targeting cancer cell stemness with specific inhibitors could modulate macrophage polarization in CRC in vitro and breast cancer in vivo, potentially shifting the immune balance from pro-tumor M2-like to anti-tumor M1-like macrophages. Methods We used four stemness inhibitors—salinomycin, SB-431542, JIB-04, and napabucasin—each targeting different pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β, histone demethylation, and STAT3, respectively), to evaluate their effects on CMS4 CRC cell lines (HCT116 and SW620) and human peripheral blood-derived macrophages in an indirect co-culture model. Results Our results showed that CMS4 CRC cell lines induced distinct macrophage polarization patterns, with HCT116 promoting M2-like macrophages and SW620 leaning toward M1-like profile. Notably, the combination of stemness inhibitors reduced stemness markers (CD133, CD44) in colorectal cancer cells and shifted macrophage polarization toward an M1-like phenotype, particularly in co-culture with HCT116. In vivo studies using the syngeneic immunocompetent EO771 breast cancer mouse model demonstrated that combination of stemness inhibitors increased the M1/M2 macrophage ratio. Conclusions Our study highlights the dual potential of stemness inhibitors to target both cancer cells and the immune microenvironment. These findings offer promising strategies for enhancing favorable immunomodulation in mesenchymal-like colorectal tumors.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the main immunosuppressive cells in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, systemic Treg depletion is not favored due to the crucial role of Tregs in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and prevention of autoimmunity. Recently, CCR8 has been identified as a key chemokine receptor expressed on tumor-infiltrating Tregs and targeted blockade of CCR8 exerts anticancer effect in several cancer types, but whether this pathway is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods We determined the involvement of CCR8+ Tregs in HCC using human HCC tissues and TCGA database, and examined the anticancer effect and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the CCR8 antagonist, IPG0521m, which was developed in house, in murine liver cancer model with flow cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and Real-Time PCR. Results Remarkable increase in CCR8+ Tregs was observed in human HCC tissues. Treatment of syngeneic liver cancer model with IPG0521m resulted in dramatic inhibition of tumor growth, associated with increased CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues. Bulk RNA sequencing analysis indicated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in remarkable increase in antitumor immunity. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in a switch of Tregs from high immunosuppression to low immunosuppression phenotype, associated with elevated CD8+ T and NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, and decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor tissues. Conclusions IPG0521m inhibited liver cancer growth via reducing the immunosuppressive function of Tregs, thereby boosting anti-cancer immunity. Our study paves the way for the clinical study of CCR8 antagonist in HCC and other cancers.

        <tr id="Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) play a crucial role in tumor progression and immune regulation. However, the functional heterogeneity of CAFs remains unclear. Here, we identify antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAF), characterized by high MHC II expression, in gastric cancer (GC) tumors and find that apCAFs are preferentially located near tertiary lymphoid structures. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that apCAFs promote T cell activation and enhances its cytotoxic and proliferative capacities, thereby strengthening T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, apCAFs facilitate the polarization of macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. These polarized macrophages, in turn, promote the formation of apCAFs, creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies anti-tumor immune responses. Notably, baseline tumors in immunotherapy responders across various cancer types exhibit higher levels of apCAFs infiltration. This study advances the understanding of CAFs heterogeneity in GC and highlights apCAFs as a potential biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in pan-cancer.">

        <tr id="Transplant recipients require lifelong, multimodal immunosuppression to prevent rejection by reducing alloreactive immunity. Rapamycin, a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is known to modulate adaptive and innate immunity, while the full spectrum of its immunosuppressive mechanisms remains incompletely understood. Given the broad expression of mTOR, we investigated the understudied effects of rapamycin on lymph node (LN) architecture, leukocyte trafficking, and the gut microbiome and metabolism after 3, 7, and 30 days of rapamycin treatment, to characterize the early, intermediate, and late changes. Rapamycin significantly reduced CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T (Treg) cells in peripheral LNs, mesenteric LNs, and the spleen over time. Rapamycin induced early pro-inflammation transition to pro-tolerogenic status, by modulating the LN laminin α4:α5 expression ratios through LN stromal cells laminin α5 expression and by adjusting Treg numbers and distribution. Additionally, rapamycin significantly altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic functions, shifting the Bacteroides to Firmicutes ratio and increasing amino acid bioavailability in the gut lumen. These effects were evident by 7 days and became most pronounced by 30 days in naïve mice, with notable changes as early as 3 days in allogeneic splenocyte-stimulated mice. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of rapamycin’s action through time-dependent modulation of LN architecture and gut microbiome, which orchestrates changes in immune cell trafficking, providing a new framework for understanding and optimizing immunosuppressive therapies.">

By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5–dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment and Park2−/− signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor.

        <tr id="Immune evasion by cancer cells involves reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) via communication with non-malignant cells. However, resistance-promoting interactions during treatment remain lesser known. Here we examine the composition, communication, and phenotypes of tumor-associated cells in serial biopsies from stage II and III high-risk estrogen receptor positive (ER+ ) breast cancers of patients receiving endocrine therapy (letrozole) as single agent or in combination with ribociclib, a CDK4/6-targeting cell cycle inhibitor. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses on longitudinally collected samples show that in tumors overcoming the growth suppressive effects of ribociclib, first cancer cells upregulate cytokines and growth factors that stimulate immune-suppressive myeloid differentiation, resulting in reduced myeloid cell- CD8 + T-cell crosstalk via IL-15/18 signaling. Subsequently, tumors growing during treatment show diminished T-cell activation and recruitment. In vitro, ribociclib does not only inhibit cancer cell growth but also T cell proliferation and activation upon co-culturing. Exogenous IL-15 improves CDK4/6 inhibitor efficacy by augmenting T-cell proliferation and cancer cell killing by T cells. In summary, response to ribociclib in stage II and III high-risk ER +  breast cancer depends on the composition, activation phenotypes and communication network of immune cells.">

        <tr id="Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown unprecedented success in a subset of immunogenic tumors, however a host of patients with advanced solid tumors fail to respond well or at all to immunotherapy. Refractory tumors commonly display a tumor microenvironment (TME) rich in immunosuppressive macrophages (M2-like) that suppress adaptive immunity and promote tumor progression. The ability to reprogram macrophages in the TME into an immune-active state holds great promise for enhancing responses to ICIs. Lucicebtide (previously referred to as ST101) is a peptide antagonist of the transcription factor C/EBPβ, a key activator of the transcriptional program in immunosuppressive macrophages. Here we show that lucicebtide exposure reprograms human immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype, restores cytotoxic T cell activation in immunosuppressed co-culture assays in vitro, and further increases T-cell activity in M1-like/T cell co-cultures. In immunocompetent, macrophage-rich triple-negative breast and colorectal cancer models, lucicebtide induces repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype and suppresses tumor growth. Lucicebtide synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy and overcomes resistance to checkpoint inhibition in anti-PD-1-refractory tumors, but in vivo responses are impaired by systemic macrophage depletion, indicating that macrophage reprogramming is integral to lucicebtide activity. These results identify lucicebtide as a novel immunomodulator that reprograms immunosuppressive macrophage populations to enhance anti-tumor activity and suggests its utility for combination strategies in cancers with poor response to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality but heterogeneity in patient responsiveness remains. Thus, greater understanding of the immunologic factors that dictate response to immunotherapy is critical to improve patient outcomes. Here, we show that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is elevated in the setting of melanoma in humans and mice and plays a functional role in inhibiting the CD8+ T cell response. Surprisingly, the tumor itself is not the major cellular source of Fgl2. Instead, we found that macrophage-secreted Fgl2 dampens the CD8+ T cell response through binding and apoptosis of FcγRIIB+CD8+ T cells. This regulation was CD8+ T cell autonomous and not via an antigen-presenting cell intermediary, as absence of Fcgr2b from the CD8+ T cells rendered T cells insensitive to Fgl2 regulation. Fgl2 is robustly expressed by macrophages in 10 cancer types in humans and in 6 syngeneic tumor models in mice, underscoring the clinical relevance of Fgl2 as a therapeutic target to promote T cell activity and improve patient immunotherapeutic response.">

For this reason, the variety of preclinical and clinical studies to modulate the activity of these cells have been conducted, however without successful outcome to date. In this review, pro-tumor activity of myeloid cells, myeloid cell-specific therapeutic targets, in vivo studies on myeloid cell re-polarization and the impact of myeloid cells on immunotherapies/genetic engineering are addressed.

        <tr id="Coeliac Disease (CeD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting 0.5-1% of the general population with a wide geographical distribution. Despite recent efforts to deeply phenotype gluten-specific immune activation at the single cell level, recent clinical studies targeting gluten degradation and other immune tolerance mechanisms have been unsuccessful. To this end, a deeper understanding of immune and non-immune cellular dynamics and interactions are required to characterize tissue-specific mechanisms responsible for CeD pathogenesis, repair, and resolution. Here, we assembled the most comprehensive scRNAseq dataset in Coeliac Disease to date, including 203,555 cells across 21 active CeD and 11 control duodenal samples. Compared to control duodenum, CeD was characterized by single cell differential changes in abundance, gene expression and cell-cell interactions across cellular compartments. In the immune compartments, CeD samples showed expected increases in plasma cell abundance and shifts toward type 1 effector biology (e.g., increase in cycling CD8pos, γδ T cells and IFNG transcriptional shifts) and Tfh-related biology (e.g., increases in IL21 signaling to effector T cells). In addition, activated myeloid subsets, including DC2 and monocytes, were increased in disease and were characterized by increased pro-inflammatory pathway expression, including IL-1β. Non-immune compartments showed increased stem/crypt and secretory enterocytes in CeD samples with a decrease in absorptive enterocytes, reflecting the villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia hallmarks of CeD epithelial dysfunction. Accompanying the epithelial changes, distinct changes in stromal populations were identified, particularly with increases in abundance and transcriptional activity of NRG1 and SMOC2 fibroblasts. Cell-cell interaction analysis across multiple cellular compartments proposed a distinct increased role of fibroblasts to support the epithelial reprogramming of the increased stem/crypt epithelial fraction in CeD, mediated by myeloid derived IL-1β signal and lymphoid-derived IFN-γ. This dataset reveals a previously unknown role for T-myeloid-stromal-epithelial cell communication in CeD, highlighting key mechanisms of the tissue-level cellular dynamics in response to gluten ingestion.">

        <tr id="Overcoming immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for developing novel cancer immunotherapies. Here, we report that IL-16 administration enhances the polarization of T helper 1 (Th1) cells by inhibiting glutamine catabolism through the downregulation of glutaminase in CD4+ T cells and increases the production of Th1 effector cytokine IFN-γ, thus improving anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, we find that establishing an IL-16-dependent, Th1-dominant TME relies on mast cell-produced histamine and results in the increased expression of the CXCR3 ligands in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), thereby improving the therapeutic effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Cancer patients exhibit impaired production of IL-16, which correlates with poorer prognosis. Additionally, low IL-16 production is associated with unresponsiveness to immunotherapy in cancer patients. Collectively, our findings provided new insights into the biological function of IL-16, emphasizing its potential clinical significance as a therapeutic approach to augment anti-tumor immunity and sensitize ICB-based cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88) is a key adaptor protein mediate immune responses, primarily through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling. The TLR/MYD88 pathway plays a critical role in dendritic cells (DC) maturation and function, contributing to the body’s innate immunity. Recent studies have further highlighted MYD88’s pivotal role in intrinsic immunity and its regulatory influence on the tumor microenvironment (TME) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of MYD88 in DCs and its regulatory role in the TME have gained increasing attention. Methods RNA-sequencing data retrieved from the TCGA and GEO databases were utilized for both the training and validation of our signature. Single-cell RNA transcriptome data from GEO were analyzed to investigate the correlation among subclusters of T cells, myeloid cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) within the HCC tumor microenvironment (TME). A combination of bioinformatics and machine learning approaches was employed to perform statistical analyses.Additionally, flow cytometry was conducted to quantify T cell subtypes and assess biomarker expression in DCs. A BALB/c-derived xenograft mouse model was established to evaluate the functional role of MyD88 in tumor progression and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to reassess the biological effects of MyD88 in HCC patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Results Our pan-cancer data analysis further highlights the significant impact of MYD88 on clinical outcomes in HCC. Analysis of TCGA and GEO databases confirms that MYD88 serves as a key signaling molecule in DCs, reinforcing its critical role in immune regulation. Our in vitro experiments demonstrates that MyD88 modulates T cell function through DCs. In vivo, H22 tumor cells exhibited accelerated growth in MyD88 knockout mice and a reduced response to anti-PD-1 treatment, whereas wild-type mice showed the opposite trend. Discussion These findings underscore the critical role of MYD88 in DC function, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for immunoregulation in HCC. By shaping the TME, MYD88 not only regulates the immune response in HCC but also influences patient clinical outcomes. Both ex vivo and in vivo experiments further validate that MYD88 impacts DC functionality, contributing to variations in HCC progression">

        <tr id="Excessive neutrophil infiltration can exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage, contributing to conditions like autoimmune disorders and liver diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects. Our study offers a perspective for advancing MSC-based therapies in tissue repair.">

        <tr id="Background and objectives Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) bring cancer patients tumor control and survival benefits, yet they also trigger immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), notably checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP), affecting about 5% of patients among whom 1–2% experiencing severe grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Current research points to potential links with T cell subset dysfunction and autoantibody increase, but the specific mechanisms underlying different grades of CIP are understudied. Methods Herein, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from CIP patients across varying severity levels, aiming to elucidate underlying immune environment and mechanisms of CIP progression at cellular and molecular levels. Findings Totally, 121,409 high qualified cells from BALF of 11 patients were annotated and categorized into five major cell types. Severe CIP (CIP-S) cases have a significant increase in the percentage of unreported epithelial cells in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with mild CIP (CIP-M) cases. These cells were defined as aberrant basaloid cells. They upregulated SOX9, increased the expression of CXCL3/5, recruited neutrophils, and activated the immune system. Additionally, macrophages in the CIP-S group had stronger antigen-presenting abilities and resulted in more CD8 + effective T cells infiltrated. Conclusions Utilizing single-cell sequencing of BALF, we discovered an enriched population of aberrant basaloid cells in CIP-S patients, which had not been previously reported. Aberrant basaloid cells may upregulate SOX9 via CXCL3/5-CXCR2 to recruit and activate neutrophils, and further activate the immune system, resulting in CIP-S. This finding could identify new targets for stratified treatment of CIP patients, holding promise of a novel approach for clinical guidance.

        <tr id="Introduction Alterations of the adaptive immune system have been shown to impact bone healing and may result in impaired healing in some patients. Apart from T cells, B cells are the key drivers of adaptive immunity. Therefore, their role in age-associated impairments of bone healing might be essential to understand delays during the healing process. B cells are essential for bone formation, and their dysfunction has been associated with aging or autoimmune diseases. But whether age-associated changes in B cell phenotypes are involved in bone regeneration is unknown. Methods Here, we aimed to characterize the role of immune aging in B cell phenotypes during the early inflammatory phase of bone healing. By comparing non-immune experienced with young and immune experienced mice we aimed to analyze the effect of gained immune experience on B cells. Our single cell proteo-genomics analysis quantified thousands of transcriptomes of cells that were isolated from post osteotomy hematoma and the proximal and distal bone marrow cavities, and enabled us to evaluate cell proportion, differential gene expression and cell trajectories. Results While the B cell proportion in young and non-immune experienced animals did not significantly change from 2 to 5 days post osteotomy in the hematoma, we found a significant decrease of the B cell proportion in the immune experienced mice, which was accompanied by the decreased expression of B cell specific genes, suggesting a specific response in immune experienced animals. Furthermore, we detected the most extensive B cell differentiation block in immune-experienced mice compared to non-immune experienced and young animals, predominantly in the transition from immature to mature B cells. Discussion Our results suggest that the pronounced impairment of B cell production found in immune experienced animals plays an important role in the initial phase leading to delayed bone healing. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches may be able target the B cell differentiation defect to retain B cell functionality even in the immune experienced setting, which is prone to delayed healing.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Curative responses to immunotherapy require the generation of robust systemic immunity with limited toxicity. Recruitment of T cell populations such as precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex) from lymphoid tissues to tumors is a hallmark of effective treatment. However, the ability to efficiently induce this recruitment is lacking in current immunotherapy approaches. Furthermore, systemic administration of immunotherapies frequently results in dose-limiting toxicities, yielding an inadequate therapeutic window for eliciting durable responses. Methods In this investigation, we evaluated the safety and antitumor efficacy of locally administered interleukin 12 (IL-12) using a clinically translatable cytokine delivery platform (NCT05538624) to identify Tpex recruitment capabilities at tolerable cytokine doses. Results We show IL-12 cytokine factories can effectively treat a broad spectrum of cancer types. Single-cell RNA sequencing data suggests that the antitumor efficacy seen in our studies was due to retinal pigmented epithelial cells-mIL12 treatment inducing differentiation of Tpex cells within the tumor microenvironment. When administered in combination with checkpoint therapy, IL-12 cytokine factory treatment generated systemic abscopal immunity, preventing subcutaneous tumor outgrowth in 8/9 mice with colorectal cancer and lung metastasis in mice with melanoma. Furthermore, this platform was well tolerated in a non-human primate without signs of toxicity. Conclusions Our new immunotherapy approach provides a robust strategy for inducing Tpex recruitment and systemic immunity against a range of solid peritoneal malignancies, many incurable with current immunotherapy strategies. Notably, these features were achieved using IL-12, and by leveraging our technology, we avoided the toxicities that have prevented the translation of IL-12 to the clinic. Our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of IL-12 cytokine factories.">

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) are versatile professional antigen-presenting cells and play an instrumental role in the generation of antigen-specific T-cell responses. Modulation of DC function holds promise as an effective strategy to improve anti-tumor immunotherapy efficacy and enhance self-antigen tolerance in autoimmune diseases. Methods Wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (KO) mice at 2 weeks of age were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to induce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Four weeks later, WT and KO mice were randomly divided into control and treatment groups and treated once every two days for 30 weeks with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and a mix of 4 TLR2-activating lactic acid-producing probiotics (LAP), respectively. Mice were euthanized after 30 weeks of LAP treatment and their liver tissues were collected for gene expression, histological, flow cytometric and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Results We demonstrate here that oral administration of a mix of TLR2-activating LAP triggers a marked accumulation of regulatory DCs (rDCs) in the liver of mice. LAP-treated mice are protected from DEN-induced liver injury, fibrosis and HCC in a TLR2-dependent manner. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that LAP treatment determines an immunosuppressive hepatic T-cell program that is characterized by a significantly reduced cytotoxic activity. The observed functional changes of T cells correlated well with the presence of a hepatic DC subset displaying a regulatory or tolerogenic transcriptional signature. Conclusion Overall, these data suggest that stimulation of regulatory dendritic cells (rDCs) in the liver by LAP suppresses cytotoxic T-cell function and alleviates DEN-induced liver damage, fibrosis and tumorigenesis.">

        <tr id="In solid tumors, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex mix of tumor, immune, stromal cells, fibroblasts, and the extracellular matrix. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute a fraction of immune cells that may infiltrate into the TME. The primary function of these T-cells is to detect and eliminate tumor cells. However, due to the immunosuppressive factors present in the TME primarily mediated by Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) as well as the tumor cells themselves, T-cells fail to differentiate into effector cells or become dysfunctional and are unable to eliminate the tumor. In addition, chronic antigen stimulation within the TME also leads to a phenomenon, first identified in chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, where the T-cells become exhausted and lose their effector functions. Exhausted T-cells (Tex) are characterized by the presence of remarkably conserved inhibitory receptors, transcription and signaling factors and the downregulation of key effector molecules. Tex cells have been identified in various malignancies, including melanoma, colorectal and hepatocellular cancers. Recent studies have indicated novel strategies to reverse T-cell exhaustion. These include checkpoint inhibitor blockade targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), or combinations of different immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) or combination of ICTs with cytokine co-stimulation. In this review, we discuss aspects of T-cell dysfunction within the TME with a focus on T-cell exhaustion. We believe that gaining insight into the mechanisms of T-cell exhaustion within the TME of human solid tumors will pave the way for developing therapeutic strategies to target and potentially re-invigorate exhausted T-cells in cancer.">

        <tr id="In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (Tregs) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD+), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes Tregs by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD+ with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing Tregs back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral Tregs, sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD+ axis disrupts Tregs metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have shown that the antitumor immunity of adaptive immune cells is regulated by Vitamin A (retinoic acid, RA). However, it remains unclear whether RA and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling can modulate antitumor immunity by reversing immune exhaustion of innate-like γδ T cells in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Periphery blood samples from patients with NPC were prospectively collected, and phenotypic and functional analyses of γδ T cells were performed using flow cytometry. Tumor-bearing models and RAR inhibitor approaches were utilized to investigate RA/RAR-mediated regulation of T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) and the antitumor activity of γδ T cells. Here, our findings indicate that immune exhaustion markers are highly expressed on peripheral αβ and γδ T cells in NPC patients. Serum RA levels are negatively correlated with the abundance of Tim-3 on circulating Vδ2 T cells. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that RA/RAR signaling directly targets Vδ2 T cells, repressing Tim-3 expression, promoting NF-κB activation, and enhancing the production of antitumor-related cytokines. Notably, RA supplementation improved the efficacy of Vδ2 T cell-mediated immunotherapy in human NPC by suppressing Tim-3 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that RA/RAR signaling plays a crucial role in reversing immune exhaustion and represents a promising target for γδ T cell antitumor immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Esophageal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death, often preceded with chronic inflammation and injuries. The NFκB/IKKβ pathway plays a central role in inflammation, yet its role in early esophageal carcinogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated the role of epithelial IKKβ in early esophageal carcinogenesis. Mice were treated with the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) or a vehicle for one month to induce precancerous lesions. Esophagi were harvested and examined through histological, protein, flow cytometry, and RNA analyses. Histological analysis revealed that 4-NQO treatment led to increased inflammation, intraepithelial CD45+ immune cells, and elevated IKKβ phosphorylation levels. Mice with esophageal epithelial-specific Ikkβ deletion (4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO) showed delayed progression to a precancerous state, with reduced immune cell recruitment compared to 4-NQO/controls. Immunophenotyping showed decreased recruitment of T cells, including CD4+, CD8+ and regulatory (Tregs) T cells, and increased recruitment of macrophages in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice compared to 4-NQO/controls. RNA sequencing data identified 262 differentially expressed genes in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice, implicating pathways related to inflammation and wound healing. Notably, the chemokine CXCL9, a T cell chemoattractant, was significantly upregulated in 4-NQO control mice, but not in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice. Further analysis identified IFNγ as an upstream regulator of Cxcl9 expression, and neutralization of IFNγ reduced Cxcl9 expression levels in 4-NQO treated mice. Additionally, in vitro studies demonstrated that IFNγ upregulates Cxcl9 in an NF-ĸB dependent manner in esophageal keratinocytes. These findings suggest that epithelial IKKβ regulates the immune microenvironment in early esophageal carcinogenesis through the IFNγ/CXCL9 axis and influencing T cell recruitment and inflammatory responses. Summary In a mouse model of early esophageal squamous cell carcinogenesis, loss of epithelial Ikkβ reduced inflammation and T cell recruitment, increased macrophage recruitment, inhibited IFNγ/CXCL9 signaling, and delayed the transition to a precancerous state.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effectors with considerable heterogeneity and potent antitumor capabilities. Intraepithelial ILC1 (ieILC1)-like NK cells, a population of cytotoxic tissue-resident innate lymphoid cells, have recently been documented in the microenvironment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and other solid tumors. These cells have antitumor cytolytic potential and are potent producers of type 1 cytokines, including IFNγ. Here, we identify a subpopulation of ex vivo differentiated ieILC1-like NK cells that produce IL-13 upon stimulation. Functional characterization revealed that these cells co-expressed IFNγ and IL-13 while maintaining an ILC1 transcriptional signature. IL-13 was induced either upon co-culture with tumor cell lines, or in response to TGF-β and IL-15. IL-13-expressing ieILC1-like NK cells were identified among tumor infiltrating lymphocytes expanded from patient HNSCC tumors, in support of their in vivoexistence in primary tumors. These data demonstrate additional heterogeneity within the ieILC1-like NK cell population than previously appreciated and highlight a unique form of ILC plasticity in which cells with clear ILC1 transcriptional profiles express a type 2 cytokine. With the known roles of IL-13 in cancer cell growth dynamics and immunoregulation, the identification of this subset within tumor microenvironments presents a potential target for therapeutic manipulation.">

        <tr id="A primary obstacle for HIV elimination is the long-term viral reservoir in lymphoid tissues (LT) that can cause rebound viremia if therapy is stopped. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are critical for control of HIV and SIV viremia; however, CD8+ T cells that migrate to LT are primarily non-cytotoxic, calling into question whether these cells could reduce the viral reservoir on ART or control viral replication when therapy is halted. To determine if CD8+ T cells can inhibit viral replication when retained in lymphoid tissues, we inhibited lymphocyte egress from LTs in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RM) during analytic treatment interruption (ATI) using the S1PR modulator FTY720 alone or in combination with anti-PD1 and the IL-15 receptor superagonist N-803 to increase cytolytic function. FTY720 retained migrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in LT, whereas cytotoxic CD8+ T cells remained in the vasculature. After ATI and viral rebound, activated SIV-specific CD8+ T cells increased in frequency in LT of FTY720-treated RM but failed to become cytotoxic or control plasma viremia compared to controls, even when combined with anti-PD1 and N-803. These findings indicate that LT-localized CD8+ T cells alone are insufficient to delay or prevent plasma viral rebound during ATI. Significance Statement HIV therapeutic and cure strategies have all operated under the assumption that CD8+ T cells can become cytotoxic in lymph nodes to eliminate infected cells from reservoir repositories. Using FTY720 to prevent lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes, we demonstrated that lymphoid tissue-restricted CD8+ T cells are insufficient to prevent SIV rebound during antiretroviral treatment interruption, even in the presence of immunomodulators such as IL-15 receptor superagonist and PD-1 blockade. These findings call into question the ability of lymph node CD8+ T cells to control or eliminate SIV/HIV infection from lymphoid tissues without substantial immunomodulation, a notion contrary to current efforts to engage CD8+ T cells for therapeutic elimination of HIV viral reservoirs during ART.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor immune evasion extends beyond T cells, affecting innate immune elements like natural killer cells (NK) and macrophages within the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME). Nevertheless, translational strategies to trigger collaboration of NK cells and macrophages to initiate sufficient anti-tumor cytoxicity remain scarce and are urgently needed. Methods In this study, TCGA datasets was used to confirm the prognosis value of the expression level of NLR family pyrin domain containing 4 (NLRP4) in NSCLC and the tumor tissues microarray was used to further check its clinical-relevance at protein-level. Subsequently, a tumor cell line with stable NLRP4 overexpression was established and subcutaneous tumor models in C57BL/6J mice were used to validate the anti-tumor characteristics of NLRP4. After analyzing the tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence, we further validated our findings through co-culture transwell assays and TCGA analysis. Utilizing bulk-RNA sequencing, proteomics, and mass spectrometry of mouse tumor tissues, we innovatively identified the downstream pathways of NLRP4 and verified them through co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and Western blot (WB) experiments. Results NLRP4 could trigger a distinct anti-tumor ecosystem organized by TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1 in lung cancer, discovered in TCGA analysis and verified in murine model. NLRP4-eco exerted tumor-suppression capacity through chemokine reprogramming including CCL5 and CXCL2. Meanwhile, the cytoxicity of NK could be facilitated by iNOS+M1. Mechanistically, NLRP4 stimulated PI3K/Akt-NF-kB axis through suppression of the activity of PP2A. Besides, knockdown of CCL5 and blockade of CXCL2-CXCR2 axis abolished chemotaxis of TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1 respectively, as well as for LB-100, a PP2A inhibitor. Conclusion Altogether, we delineated NLRP4’s unexplored facets and discovered an NLRP4-driven anti-tumor ecosystem composed of TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1. Finally, targeting PP2A by its inhibitor successfully mimicked the anti-tumor capacity of the overexpression of NLRP4.

        <tr id="Chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases are driven, in part, by the activation of (auto)reactive CD4+ T-cells, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets for these diseases. Nicotinamide (NAM) has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in various disease models and has already demonstrated safety in several large clinical trials in humans. The mechanisms behind these observations, and especially their direct effects on CD4+ T-cells, remain poorly understood. Here, we address this gap by investigating how NAM influences CD4+ T-cell activation and function. We also describe that NAM treatment significantly suppresses CD4+ T-cell activation in vitro, as evidenced by impaired proliferation and reduced expression of surface activation markers. Additionally, NAM treatment resulted in reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-2, IFNy, and IL-17, further highlighting its anti-inflammatory potential. We found that NAM modulates key metabolic processes, including glycolysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production—both essential to T-cell activation. Taken together, our findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the regulation of T-cell activation by NAM, suggesting NAM as an attractive candidate for novel therapies targeting immune-related diseases.">

        <tr id="Cancer cells harbor cell-intrinsic programs capable of sculpting immunogenic landscapes, yet molecular brakes that enforce immune evasion remain poorly defined. Here, we identify C9ORF50, a previously uncharacterized intrinsically disordered protein, as a liquid-liquid phase separation-driven regulator of RNA processing and actionable immunotherapy target. Genetic ablation of C9ORF50 induces selective intron retention in spliceosome component transcripts, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This dsRNA activates type I interferon pathway that in turn orchestrates a chemokine secretory program critical for T cell recruitment. The resultant enhancement of tumor immunogenicity and reprogramming of tumor immune microenvironment drives robust antitumor immunity, effectively converting immunologically “cold” tumors to “hot” phenotypes. Therapeutic targeting of C9ORF50 via RNA interference achieved robust tumor suppression in syngeneic models, suggesting its translational relevance. Notably, C9ORF50 exhibits tumor-predominant expression, with minimal baseline levels detected in healthy tissues or immune cell populations, underscoring its potential safety as a therapeutic target. Our study not only identifies C9ORF50 as a novel LLPS-dependent regulator of RNA splicing but also establishes it as a promising and potentially safe therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity serves as a de facto memory for innate immune responses, resulting in long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. It enhances resistance to pathogens and augments immunosurveillance under physiological conditions. Given that innate immune cells typically have a short lifespan and do not divide, persistent innate immune memory may be mediated by epigenetic and metabolic changes in long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. HSCs fine-tune their state and fate in various training conditions, thereby generating functionally adapted progeny cells that orchestrate innate immune plasticity. Notably, both beneficial and maladaptive trained immunity processes can comprehensively influence HSC state and fate, leading to divergent hematopoiesis and immune outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize recent advances regarding HSC state and fate in the context of trained immunity. By elucidating the stem cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory network, we aim to refine current models of innate immune memory and provide actionable insights for developing targeted therapies against infectious diseases and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for engineering precision-trained immunity through HSC-targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic regulators of T cell maturation and exhaustion. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs influence T cell function in tumor environments remain unclear. This study focuses on miR-379-5p, which counteracts T cell exhaustion and enhances antitumor responses. Methods Native CD8+ T cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors and subjected to chronic stimulation to induce exhaustion. RNA sequencing and miRNA sequencing were performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. These miRNAs underwent bioinformatics analyses, including DESeq enrichment, immune cell infiltration assessment, and patient prognostic outcomes in The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets to assess their potential involvement in T cell exhaustion and antitumor immunity. The biological functions of miRNA on T cell differentiation, cytotoxic killing, and immune checkpoint regulation were investigated using in vitro assays, OT-I B16F10-OVA models, and patient-derived tumor organoids. Results MiR-379-5p is downregulated in exhausted T cells and negatively associated with exhausted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in advanced tumors. It correlates positively with better survival outcomes in breast cancer, cervical cancer and melanoma. In CD8+ T cells, miR-379-5p reduces the expression of immune checkpoint proteins T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3) and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) by targeting their 3’ untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-379-5p in CD8+ T cell promotes differentiation into memory-like T effector cells and enhances cytotoxic killing of cancer cells. The transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) with increased expression in exhausted T cells and negatively regulates miR-379, restoring immune checkpoint expression and suppressing cancer-killing ability. In contrast, OT-I T cells expressing ectopic miR-379-5p show increased cytotoxicity against B16F10-OVA tumors in mice. Autologous T cells isolated from patients with breast cancer transduced with miR-379-5p significantly improve killing of tumor organoids derived from the same patients. Conclusions MiR-379-5p acts as an epigenetic tumor suppressor by enhancing CD8+ T cell effector functions and suppressing T cell exhaustion. MiR-379-5p could represent a novel marker and strategy for cancer immunotherapy, offering promising avenues for enhancing antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has revolutionized cancer treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. However, resistance remains a critical challenge. This study aimed to comparatively elucidate immunophenotypic changes in syngeneic mouse models sensitive (MC-38) or resistant (LLC1) to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. In the sensitive MC-38 model, anti-PD-1 therapy increased dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, while decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment. Enhanced expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I/II) and costimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86) was observed on tumor-associated DCs and macrophages. Tumor-infiltrating CD4+T, CD8+T, regulatory T, NK, and NKT cells also significantly increased. Importantly, treatment boosted lymphocyte cytotoxic potential, with perforin identified as a key marker of efficacy. Notably, perforin expression in CD4+T and NKT cells strongly negatively correlated with tumor volume. In contrast, the resistant LLC1 model exhibited minimal immunophenotypic changes upon treatment. These findings highlight critical immune modifications induced by anti-PD-1 therapy, particularly the role of perforin, and the DC/MDSC ratio in predicting therapeutic outcomes. This research offers valuable insights into potential predictive biomarkers and informs strategies to overcome resistance, emphasizing the complex interplay between anti-PD-1 treatment and the tumor microenvironment, ultimately aiming to improve immunotherapy response rates.">

        <tr id="T cells play diverse roles in cancer immunology, acting as tumor suppressors, cytotoxic effectors, enhancers of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and immune suppressors; providing memory and surveillance; modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME); or activating innate immune cells. However, cancer cells can disrupt T cell function, leading to T cell exhaustion and a weakened immune response against the tumor. The expression of exhausted T cell (Tex) markers plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune landscape of multiple cancers. Our aim was to systematically investigate the role of known T cell exhaustion (Tex) markers across multiple cancers while exploring their molecular interactions, mutation profiles, and potential implications for immunotherapy. The mRNA expression profile of six Tex markers, LAG-3, PDCD1, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CXCL13, and LAYN was investigated in pan-cancer. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), and other repositories, we characterized the differential expression of the Tex markers, their association with the patients’ survival outcome, and their mutation profile in multiple cancers. Additionally, we analyzed the effects on cancer-related pathways and immune infiltration within the TME, offering valuable insights into mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and progression. Finally, the correlation between their expression and sensitivity to multiple anti-cancer drugs was investigated extensively. Differential expression of all six markers was significantly associated with KIRC and poor prognosis in several cancers. They also played a potential activating role in apoptosis, EMT, and hormone ER pathways, as well as a potential inhibitory role in the DNA damage response and RTK oncogenic pathways. Infiltration of different immune cells was also found to be associated with the expression of the Tex-related genes in most cancer types. These findings underline that the reviving of exhausted T cells can be used to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Macrophages, as the predominant phagocytes, play an essential role in pathogens defense and tissue homeostasis maintenance. In the context of cancer, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have evolved into cunning actors involved in angiogenesis, cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, as well as the construction of immunosuppressive microenvironment. Once properly activated, macrophages can kill tumor cells directly through phagocytosis or attack tumor cells indirectly by stimulating innate and adaptive immunity. Thus, the prospect of targeting TAMs has sparked significant interest and emerged as a promising strategy in immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the diverse roles and underlying mechanisms of TAMs in cancer development and immunity and highlight the TAM-based therapeutic strategies such as inhibiting macrophage recruitment, inhibiting the differentiation reprogramming of TAMs, blocking phagocytotic checkpoints, inducing trained macrophages, as well as the potential of engineered CAR-armed macrophages in cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in engineered adaptive immune cell therapies, current options for innate immune cell therapies are sparse. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a neutrophil progenitor-based cell therapy. Murine conditionally-immortalized neutrophil progenitors (NPs) overcome the hurdles of alternative cell therapies by engrafting in the unconditioned host and substantially contributing to the host neutrophil population. Here we demonstrate the therapeutic value of NPs using a murine model of the primary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Those with CGD are highly susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus because of genetic mutations that impair neutrophil antimicrobial function. We find that the prophylactic treatment of CGD mice with transfused NPs rescue them from an otherwise lethal S. aureus pulmonary infection. In investigating the mechanisms behind the improved clearance of S. aureus and survival of CGD mice, our data suggests that the antimicrobial function of host CGD neutrophils is rescued by the presence of donor-derived wild-type neutrophils. We also observe that survival is improved to >50% in the CGD model when mice receive NPs post-infection. This work highlights the application of NPs to improving outcomes to acute bacterial infection in CGD, demonstrating the translational potential of conditionally-immortalized myeloid progenitors as a cellular therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Impairment of Akt signaling has been observed in antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) during chronic viral infections or tumor progression. Despite numerous studies emphasizing Akt’s role in driving CTL effector functions, there is limited exploration of using Akt molecules in T-cell engineering to enhance their antiviral or antitumor capabilities for therapeutic purposes. Some studies even conclude that inhibiting Akt activation during the in vitro expansion process can prevent T-cell exhaustion and boost the antitumor effector functions of chimeric antigen receptor-T cells in vivo. Given the unique expression patterns and functions of the three Akt isoforms in immune cells, we proposed that Akt isoforms in CTLs may regulate effector functions and T-cell exhaustion distinctly. Methods In this study, we genetically modified tumor/virus-antigen-specific T-cell receptor tg CTLs to ectopically express Akt isoforms via retroviral transduction. We subsequently conducted western blotting, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing analysis to assess their Akt expression, expression of immune checkpoints, antitumor/antivirus functionalities, and transcriptome. Additionally, we employed a persistent Hepatitis B Virus mouse model and a syngeneic hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model for further evaluation of their antivirus/antitumor efficacies. Results We found that both Akt1 and Akt2 overexpression enhanced the cytotoxic capabilities of mouse CTLs, although with different dynamics. Specifically, Akt2 signaling in CTLs accelerated effector functions, leading to a rapid attack on tumor cells. Conversely, Akt1 signaling triggered calcium influx and subsequent nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation, while Akt2 signaling suppressed calcium influx, preventing excessive NFAT expression and nuclear translocation. This repression of NFAT transcriptional activity by Akt2 signaling during prolonged antigen stimulation subsequently led to reduced expression of transcription factors associated with T-cell exhaustion, such as Egr2, Nr4a, Tox, and immune checkpoints. Consequently, Akt2-overexpressed CTLs displayed reduced T-cell exhaustion within the tumor microenvironment and efficiently eradicated tumors. Conclusion These findings highlight the essential role of Akt signaling in enabling tumor-specific CTLs to eliminate cancer cells in the solid TME, with Akt isoforms differentially regulating the calcium–calcineurin–NFAT signaling pathway. This discovery suggests the potential of AKT2 in T-cell engineering technology to enhance the survival and effector functions of adoptively transferred T cells for treating liver malignancies or chronic viral infections.">

        <tr id="Despite the success of cancer immunotherapy in treating hematologic malignancies, their efficacy in solid tumors remains limited due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which is mainly formed by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs not only exert potent immunosuppressive effects that hinder the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and adaptive cellular therapies, but they also promote tumor advancement through non-immunological pathways, including promoting angiogenesis, driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and contributing to the establishment of pre-metastatic environments. While targeting MDSCs alone or in combination with conventional therapies has shown limited success, emerging evidence suggests that MDSC checkpoint blockade in combination with other immunotherapies holds great promise in overcoming both immunological and non-immunological barriers. In this review, we discussed the dual roles of MDSCs, with a particular emphasis on their underexplored checkpoints blockade strategies. We discussed the rationale behind combination strategies, their potential advantages in overcoming MDSC-mediated immunosuppression, and the challenges associated with their development. Additionally, we highlight future research directions aimed at optimizing combination immunotherapies to enhance cancer therapeutic effectiveness, particularly in solid tumor therapies where MDSCs are highly prevalent.">

        <tr id="Neuroblastoma (NB) is an immunologically “cold” tumor with poor or no inflamed substrates as most of solid pediatric tumors (SPT). Consistent data indicate that NB tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by myeloid cells, with little (but variable) T cell infiltration. The obstacles to lymphocyte infiltration and to their anti-tumor activity are due to different tumor immune evasion strategies, including loss of HLA Class I molecules, high expression of immune checkpoint molecular ligands leading to exhaustion of T effector (and NK) cells, induction of T regulatory, myeloid and stromal cells and secretion of immunosuppressive mediators. In odds with adult solid tumors, NB displays weak immunogenicity caused by intrinsic low mutational burden and scant expression of neoepitopes in the context of MHC-class I antigens which, in turn, are particularly poorly expressed on NB cells, thus inducing low anti-tumor T cell responses. In addition, NB is generated from embryonal cells and is the result of transcriptional abnormalities and not of the accumulation of genetic mutations over time, thus further explaining the low immunogenicity. The poor expression of immunogenic molecules on tumor cells is associated with the high production of immunosuppressive factors which further downregulate lymphocyte infiltration and activity, thus explaining the limited efficacy of new drugs in NB, as immune checkpoint inhibitors. This review is focused on examining the role of T effector and regulatory cells infiltrating TME of NB, taking into account their repertoire, phenotype, function, plasticity and, importantly, predictive value for defining novel targets for therapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Efficient tumor T-cell infiltration is crucial for the effectiveness of T-cell-based therapies against solid tumors. Eosinophils play crucial roles in recruiting T cells in solid tumors. Our group has previously generated induced eosinophils (iEOs) from human pluripotent stem cells and exhibited synergistic efficacy with CAR-T cells in solid tumor inhibition. However, administrated eosinophils might influx into inflammatory lungs, posing a potential safety risk. Mitigating the safety concern and enhancing efficacy is a promising development direction for further application of eosinophils.


METHODS
We developed a new approach to generate eosinophils with enhanced potency from human chemically reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (hCiPSCs) with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 signaling agonist R848.


RESULTS
R848-activated iEOs (R-iEOs) showed significantly decreased influx to the inflamed lungs, indicating a lower risk of causing airway disorders. Furthermore, these R-iEOs had enhanced anti-tumor functions, preferably accumulated at tumor sites, and further increased T-cell infiltration. The combination of R-iEOs and CAR-T cells suppressed tumor growth in mice. Moreover, the chemo-trafficking signaling increased in R-iEOs, which may contribute to the decreased lung influx of R-iEOs and the increased tumor recruitment of T cells.


CONCLUSION
Our study provides a novel approach to alleviate the potential safety concerns associated with eosinophils while increasing T-cell infiltration in solid tumors. This finding offers a prospective strategy for incorporating eosinophils to improve CAR-T-cell immunotherapy for solid tumors in the future.">

        <tr id="In the last two decades, novel and promising cell-based therapies have populated the treatment landscape for haematological tumors. However, commonly exploited T and NK cell-based therapies show limited applicability to solid tumors. This is mainly given by the impaired tumor trafficking capability and limited effector activity of these cells within a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Myeloid cells spontaneously home to tumors and can thus be reprogrammed and/or engineered to directly attack tumor cells or locally and selectively deliver therapeutically relevant payloads that may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy against difficult-to-access solid tumors. In the context of myeloid cell-based therapies, adoptive transfer of monocytes has often been overshadowed by infusion of differentiated macrophages or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite their promising therapeutic potential.

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT People living with HIV (PLWH) exhibit accelerated aging, characterized by systemic inflammation, termed “inflammaging.” While T-cell expansion is prevalent in PLWH, its connection to inflammaging remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the TCRβ repertoire of 257 healthy controls (HC) and 228 PLWH, revealing pronounced T cell clonal expansion in PLWH. The expansion was only partially reversed following antiretroviral therapy (ART) and closely associated with ART duration, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio. TCR-based age modeling showed a continuous accelerated trajectory of aging in PLWH, especially in younger individuals, in stark contrast to the nonlinear aging acceleration pattern seen in HC. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA combined TCR sequencing and in vitro experiments, we identified GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the primary population driving clonal expansion and maintenance in PLWH. These cells are characterized by high cytotoxicity and low exhaustion and are activated by interleukin-15 (IL-15) in vitro. Notably, GNLY+CD8+ T cells predominantly express the pro-inflammatory 15 kDa form of granulysin(GNLY). The supernatant from IL-15-stimulated CD8+ T cells induces monocytes to secrete inflammatory factors and disrupts the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells, which can be partially restored by the anti-GNLY antibodies. These findings identify GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the central drivers of persistent clonal expansion, highlighting their crucial role for mitigating inflammaging in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors include targeting additional immunosuppressive compartments in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Inhibitory macrophages (Mφ) can be one of the most abundant immune cells in the TME associated with poor prognosis. However, to date, selective Mφ depletion strategies as a cancer immunotherapy have not been successful in clinical trials. Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure (MARCO) is one of a family of class-A scavenger receptors expressed by Mφ in the TME and is one of the most upregulated transcripts in dendritic cells (DC) following their ex vivo uptake of dead tumor cells. The clinical significance of MARCO expression in the TME is not fully understood. Methods The therapeutic potential of targeting MARCO by an anti-murine MARCO (ED31, clone ED31) monoclonal antibody, which inhibits ligand-binding to MARCO, was explored in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) in C57BL/6J mice bearing B16F10 or Pan02 tumors. The mechanism by which ED31 impacts the TME was investigated by flow cytometry in the different treatment arms. The contribution of Mφ was assessed by both in vivo depletion and in vitro functional assays. Chemokine production was measured by a bead-based multiplex assay. Results ED31 enhanced antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4, but not of anti-PD-1. Analysis of the TME revealed that adding ED31 to anti-CTLA-4 substantially increased immune cell infiltration, including mature conventional DC recruitment, that was due to a switch to M1-pattern chemokines by Mφ. Mφ depletion completely abrogated both the increase in immune cell infiltration and chemokine production, and abolished the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy. Conclusions Targeting MARCO as an additional checkpoint in the TME can offer a strategy to improve the antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 through a mechanism involving Mφ reprogramming rather than their depletion.">

        <tr id="Although anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cells demonstrate high response rates in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas, a considerable proportion of patients eventually encounter disease progression or relapse. The short-term and long-term outcomes of CAR-T treatment are intricately linked to the tumor microenvironment (TME), wherein macrophages with polarized characteristics can exhibit either anti-tumorigenic or pro-tumorigenic roles. Despite evidence implicating the crucial involvement of macrophages in CAR-T cell-treated lymphoma, their dynamic distribution and immune function related to lymphoma progression remain poorly understood. Immunocompetent mice were utilized to establish syngeneic A20 lymphoma/leukemia models. The distribution and polarization of macrophages were detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry techniques. We observed that CD19 CAR-T therapy exhibited significant efficacy in protecting mice against lymphoma, leading to increased infiltration of macrophages into the tumor tissue. Notably, during remission stages, M1-like macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+C206−CD80+) were predominant, whereas in relapsed mice, there was a shift towards M2-like phenotypes (CD11b+F4/80+C206+CD80+). The transition from remissive to relapsed status was accompanied by a reduction in the M1/M2 ratio and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed differential expression levels of CD206 and CD163 between remissive and relapsed mice, while signaling pathways involving PI3K and STAT3 may contribute to the skewing towards M2 polarization. In summary, our findings highlight the dynamic transformation of macrophage polarization during different stages of lymphoma progression and underscore its potential implications for immunotherapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="To provide protection, anticipatory T cell–dependent immunity is reliant on the generation and maintenance of a naïve T cell repertoire, which is sufficiently diverse to ensure recognition of newly encountered antigens. Therefore, under steady-state conditions, a given individual needs to maintain a large pool of naïve T cells, ready to respond to potential threats. Here, we demonstrate that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (Ndrg3) is essential for naïve T cell stability. Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis.">

Mechanistically, HLH / MAS are driven by persistent activation of lymphoid and myeloid cells, but our understanding of the pathogenic cell populations remains incomplete. Main body In this Perspectives article, we provide an overview of the biology of HLH / MAS and the critical role of interferon-g in disease pathogenesis. We discuss the recent discovery of cycling lymphocytes in HLH / MAS marked by expression of CD38 and HLA-DR, which are primary producers of IFN-γ. The expansion of cycling lymphocytes correlates with disease activity and helps to distinguish HLH / MAS from clinical mimics. We demonstrate an approach to quantify CD38+HLA-DR+ cycling lymphocytes and evaluate their utility as a diagnostic biomarker for HLH / MAS. Lastly, we discuss the treatment of MAS, including potential therapeutic options to target these pathogenic lymphocytes. Conclusion Understanding of biology of cycling lymphocytes in HLH / MAS will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches to overcome these fatal hyperinflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Mechanisms underlying the T-cell-dependent anti-cancer effect of cyclophosphamide (CTX) are not fully understood. We found that CTX chemotherapy induces long-term survival of mice bearing metastasized breast cancer with chromosomal instability. Given that CTX induces DNA damage and type I interferon (IFN-I) in vivo and that cGAS senses cytosolic double-stranded DNA, we investigated the role of the host cGAS–STING–IFN-I pathway in CTX therapy. We found that CD8+ T cells, the cGAS of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells, the STING of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), and the IFN-I response of non-cDC1 myeloid cells are essential for CTX efficacy. Moreover, the cGAS and STING of BM-derived cells positively modulate intratumoral CD8+ T cell populations. Our study shows that the T-cell-dependent anti-tumor effect of CTX critically involves the cGAS–STING–IFN-I axis, the IFN-I response, and the STING-independent cGAS function of host myeloid cells, which supports the deployment of CTX in treating advanced solid tumors by bypassing the often-failed IFN-I production by tumor cells due to a chronic activation of the intrinsic cGAS–STING caused by chromosomal instability.">

        <tr id="Background
 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a critical treatment for hematologic disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, and specific immune deficiencies. Despite its efficacy, challenges such as engraftment failure and delayed neutrophil regeneration remain significant barriers. These complications lead to prolonged cytopenia, increased risks of infections and other complications, and elevated morbidity and mortality rates. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to play essential roles in supporting hematopoiesis, the precise mechanisms and interactions between MSCs and other cellular components in HSCT require further investigation. Methods To address these challenges, we explored the combined infusion of allotype-cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and activated T cells from the same donor along with third-party MSCs. The study assessed the effects of this triple-cell therapy on neutrophil differentiation and function ex vivo and in vivo. Using a respiratory infection model, we evaluated the accumulation of human neutrophils, cytokine secretion (IL-6 and IL-8), bacterial clearance, and overall survival compared to control groups. Results The triple-cell therapy demonstrated a significant improvement in the differentiation of human HSCs into neutrophils both in ex vivo and in vivo. In the respiratory infection model, this approach resulted in enhanced accumulation of human neutrophils, increased secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, superior bacterial clearance, and reduced mortality rates compared to the control group. These findings highlight the synergistic interplay between allo-HSCs, MSCs, and activated T cells in promoting neutrophil production and function. Conclusions Our study presents a novel therapeutic strategy combining allo-HSCs, activated T cells, and third-party MSCs to enhance neutrophil production and functionality post-transplantation. This approach not only accelerates neutrophil regeneration but also improves resistance to infections, offering a promising avenue to overcome engraftment challenges in HSCT.">

Their unique positioning makes them promising targets for vaccines designed to enhance protection at barrier sites and other organs. Recent studies have shown a correlation between CD8+ TRM cells and favorable clinical outcomes in various types of cancer, indicating their potential role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, the dual nature of CD8+ TRM cells presents challenges, as their inappropriate activation may lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review highlights significant advancements in the field, focusing on the differentiation pathways and phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8+ TRM cells across different tissues and disease states. We also review their protective roles in various contexts and the implications for vaccine development against infections and treatment strategies for tumors. Overall, this comprehensive review outlines the common features of CD8+ TRM cell differentiation and biological functions, emphasizing their specific characteristics across diverse tissues and disease states, which can guide the design of therapies against infections and tumors while minimizing the risk of autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (NATI) significantly prolonged outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Residual tumor cells that survive NATI represent high-risk cell populations with metastatic potential and usually evade immunosurveillance by NK cells. Using an 82-protein panel, we here profiled single-cell membrane proteomics of CD56+ (NCAM1+) NK cells from tumor, peri-cancerous tissue, as well as peripheral blood from 28 TNBC patients post-NATI of residual cancer burden II/III. Unsupervised clustering resulted in several distinct clusters: 2 tumor-infiltrating NK (TINK) clusters with divergent functions of immune activation (TNFRSF7+) and suppression (SELL+); 2 immuno-suppressive peri-cancerous clusters; and 1 periphery-specific cluster. Considering the contradiction of the 2 TINK clusters, we further tested cytokine functions of SELL + and TNFRSF7 + TINKs by single-cell secreting proteomics using a 32-cytokine panel. Consistently, SELL + TINK clusters were characterized by immuno-suppressive secretion patterns (IL10+). A low proportion of SELL + TINK cluster and low proportion of IL10 + secreting SELL + TINK cluster (single-cell secreting proteomics) were both associated with better progression-free survival time. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 15 patients during 16-month follow-up. Overall, we identified a distinct immuno-suppressive TINK cell group, featuring IL10 + secreting and SELL expression with a strong relation to poor survival prognosis in TNBC patients post-NATI.

        <tr id="LPIN3 has emerged as a key factor in a variety of malignancies, although its precise role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. By analyzing the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we discovered that the expression pattern of LPIN3 and the relevant makeup of the immune microenvironment were immensely diverse among tumors. LPIN3 is abundantly expressed in CRC and may enhance tumor growth by activating the β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, we discovered that LPIN3 might reduce tumor antigen presentation signals, hence suppressing CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, high expression of LPIN3 predicts decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration and effector function via bioinformatics analysis. Indeed, CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity as well as CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation in vivo were strengthened by LPIN3 knockdown. To sum up, our results highlight the part that LPIN3 plays in driving the progression of CRC by regulating β-catenin signaling and CD8+ T cell activity.

        <tr id="Parasitic infections are a major worldwide health burden, yet most studies of CD8 T cell differentiation focus on acute viral and bacterial infections. To understand effector and memory CD8 T cell responses during erythrocytic malaria infection in mice, we utilized transgenic OT-I T cells and compared CD8 T cell responses between infection with OVA-expressing strains of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). We find that CD8 T cells expand vigorously during both infections. However, in contrast to Lm infection, PbA infection induces T cells that are heavily biased toward an IL-7Ra-deficient and KLRG1+ short-lived effector cell (SLEC) phenotype at the expense of memory precursor effector cell (MPECs) formation. PbA-induced inflammation, including IFNγ, is partially responsible for this outcome. Following treatment with antimalarial drugs and T cell contraction, PbA-primed memory T cells are rarely found in the blood and peripheral tissues but do maintain a low presence in the spleen and bone marrow. Despite these poor numbers, PbA memory T cells robustly expand upon vaccination or viral infection, control pathogen burden, and form secondary memory pools. Thus, despite PbA enforced SLEC formation and limited memory, effective secondary responses can still proceed.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors, enhancing clinical outcomes by releasing T cells from inhibitory effects of receptors like programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Despite these advancements, achieving durable antitumor responses remains challenging, often due to additional immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute significantly to the immunosuppressive TME and play a pivotal role in shaping T cell-mediated antitumor responses. Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2), expressed on myeloid cells, including TAMs, is an inhibitory receptor, which contributes to macrophage-mediated immunosuppression. In this study, we present AZD2796, a high-affinity anti-LILRB2 antibody designed to repolarize TAMs from an immunosuppressive to a proinflammatory phenotype. Methods Anti-LILRB2 antibodies were identified using single-B-cell encapsulation Immune Replica technology. The ability of AZD2796 to enhance proinflammatory responses from macrophages treated with CD40 ligand or lipopolysaccharide was assessed using a macrophage stimulation assay. A tumor cell/macrophage/T cell co-culture assay was developed to evaluate the effect of AZD2796, as a single agent and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody, on the cytolytic activity of antigen-specific T cells. In vivo assessments were then carried out to determine the ability of AZD2796 to alter tumor growth rate in mice humanized with CD34 hematopoietic stem cells. Results In preclinical assessments, AZD2796 skewed macrophage differentiation away from an immunosuppressive phenotype and enhanced the proinflammatory function of macrophages. AZD2796 significantly increased the anti-tumor response of T cells following PD-1 checkpoint blockade, while AZD2796 monotherapy reduced tumor growth in humanized mouse models. Conclusions These findings support the potential of AZD2796 as an anti-cancer therapy, with the ability to synergize with T-cell-based therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Tumors often arise in chronically inflamed, and thus immunologically highly active niches. While immune cells are able to recognize and remove transformed cells, tumors eventually escape the control of the immune system by shaping their immediate microenvironment. In this context, macrophages are of major importance, as they initially exert anti-tumor functions before they adopt a tumor-associated phenotype that instead inhibits anti-tumor immune responses and even allows for sustaining a smoldering inflammatory, growth promoting tumor microenvironment (TME). Type I interferons (IFNs) are well established modulators of inflammatory reactions. While they have been shown to directly inhibit tumor growth, there is accumulating evidence that they also play an important role in altering immune cell functions within the TME. In the present review, we focus on the impact of type I IFNs on anti-tumor responses, driven by monocytes and macrophages. Specifically, we will provide an overview of tumor-intrinsic factors, which impinge on IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, like the presence of nucleic acids, metabolites, or hypoxia. We will further summarize the current understanding of the consequences of altered IFN responses on macrophage phenotypes, i.e., differentiation, polarization, and functions. For the latter, we will focus on macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing and phagocytosis, as well as on how macrophages affect their environment by secreting cytokines and directly interacting with immune cells.

        <tr id="Background Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) initiates secondary injuries that worsen neurological damage and hinder recovery. While peripheral immune responses play a key role in stroke outcomes, clinical results from immunotherapy have been suboptimal, with limited focus on T-cell dynamics. Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) offer therapeutic potential due to their immunomodulatory properties. They can regulate immune responses and reduce neuroinflammation, potentially enhancing recovery by fostering a pro-regenerative peripheral immune environment. However, the effect of UMSCs on T-cell dynamics in AIS remains underexplored. This study investigates T-cell dynamics following AIS and examines how UMSCs may mitigate immune dysregulation to develop better treatment strategies. Methods AIS patients (NIHSS scores 0–15) were recruited within 72 h of stroke onset, with peripheral blood samples collected on Day 0 (enrollment) and Day 7. T-cell compartments were identified by flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine levels were quantified using a cytometric bead array (CBA). Mitochondria in UMSCs were labeled with MitoTracker. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients were isolated, treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cocultured with UMSCs in both direct contact and Transwell systems. Flow cytometry, CBA, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect T-cell compartments, gene expression markers for helper T (Th) cell differentiation, cytokine profiles, mitochondrial transfer, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA in UMSCs was depleted. The effects of UMSCs and mitochondria-depleted UMSCs on ischemic stroke mice were compared through behavioral assessments and analysis of the peripheral immune microenvironment. Results In AIS, T-cell compartments underwent a phenotypic shift from naïve to effector or memory states, with a specific increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells, leading to alterations in T-cell-mediated immune functions. In an ex vivo co-culture system, LPS stimulation further amplified these disparities, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in T cells. Notably, UMSCs restored mitochondrial function and reversed the shift in T-cell compartments through mitochondrial transfer. Critically, UMSC treatment significantly improved both neurological deficits and peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke mice, whereas mitochondria-depleted UMSCs failed to produce this effect. Conclusions Our comprehensive insights into the key attributes of T-cell compartments in acute ischemic stroke and the immune regulatory mechanisms of UMSCs provide a crucial theoretical foundation for understanding peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke and the therapeutic potential of UMSC treatment.

        <tr id="Abstract Checkpoint inhibitors have led to remarkable benefits in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet response rates remain below expectations. High-dimensional analysis and mechanistic experiments in clinical samples and relevant NSCLC models uncovered the immune composition of lung cancer tissues, providing invaluable insights into the functional properties of tumor-infiltrating T cells and myeloid cells. Among myeloid cells, type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) stand out for their unique ability to induce effector CD8 T cells against neoantigens and coordinate antitumoral immunity. Notably, lung resident cDC1 are particularly abundant and long-lived and express a unique tissue-specific gene program, underscoring their central role in lung immunity. Here, we discuss recent insights on the induction and regulation of antitumoral T cell responses in lung cancer, separating it from the tissue-agnostic knowledge generated from heterogeneous tumor models. We focus on the most recent studies dissecting functional states and spatial distribution of lung cDC1 across tumor stages and their impact on T cell responses to neoantigens. Finally, we highlight relevant gaps and emerging strategies to harness lung cDC1 immunostimulatory potential.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background A subset of CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic activity has been identified, and these cells exert their effects by expressing perforin and granzymes. Despite the progress made in characterizing cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in various diseases, the status of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the underlying mechanisms involved in promoting intratumoral cytotoxic CD4+ T-cell activation remain unclear. Methods We used flow cytometry to examine the phenotypic and functional properties of CD4+GzmB+ T cells in the peripheral blood and tumor tissues of patients with NSCLC. Loss-of-function analyses and RNA sequencing were used to identify the underlying mechanisms involved in the effects of interleukin (IL)-15 on the restoration of CD4+GzmB+ T-cell function in vitro. A patient-derived lung cancer explant model and an animal model were used to verify the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors on CD4+GzmB+ T-cell activation. Results In patients with NSCLC, impaired cytolytic function of tumor-infiltrated granzyme B (GzmB)-expressing CD4+ T cells was restored by IL-15 through activation of the AKT-FOXO1-T-bet axis. Moreover, IL-15 stimulation increased solute carrier family 7 member 5 (SLC7A5) expression in CD4+GzmB+ T cells in an Protein Kinase B (AKT)-dependent manner, and inhibition of SLC7A5 abrogated the effect of IL-15 on CD4+GzmB+ T cells. Additionally, we showed that the immune checkpoint molecules programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and CD85j were mutually exclusively expressed in CD4+GzmB+ T cells and that dual targeting of PD-1 and CD85j enhanced the effector function of CD4+GzmB+ T cells by activating the AKT pathway. Notably, tumor cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II and IL-15 determine the effectiveness of CD4+GzmB+ T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity in response to immunotherapy. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating CD4+GzmB+ T cells fail to eliminate tumors. Dual blockade of PD-1 and CD85j alongside IL-15 restores the effector function of CD4+GzmB+ T cells and drives CD4+GzmB+ T-cell transformation in the tumor microenvironment to combat MHC-II-expressing tumors.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT B cells play a crucial role in autoimmune diseases, as evidenced by autoantibody responses and the effectiveness of B cell‐targeted therapies. Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), which target downstream signaling of cytokine receptors, are potent rheumatic disease‐modifying drugs. However, besides reducing inflammation, JAKi may impact the adaptive immune system. In this study, we examined the effects of JAKi on B‐cell function using in vitro cultures and multiparameter flow cytometry. The results show a JAKi‐mediated reduction in plasma cell differentiation, primarily by inhibition of memory B‐cell stimulation and proliferation. JAKi exposure resulted in stalling R848, IL‐2, and IL‐21 stimulated B cells in an intermediate activated state with elevated naïve cells displaying increased expression of CXCR5, CD71, CD22, and CD20. In addition, the data demonstrate a moderate JAKi‐mediated reduction of B cell TNF and IL‐8 cytokine expression following stimulation. Importantly, the efficacy varied greatly between drugs; tofacitinib and upadacitinib (pan JAKi; JAK1i) exhibited the strongest impact, while baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2i) showed donor‐dependent variation, and filgotinib (JAK1i) had no effect. All JAKi, except filgotinib, inhibited IL‐2 or IL‐21‐induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Still, filgotinib demonstrated similar inhibition of phospho‐STAT5 as other JAKi following IL‐21. These findings underscore the therapeutic impact of JAKi through the modulation of B‐cell functions.">

        <tr id="Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), professional type I IFN–producing cells, have been implicated in host responses against bacterial infections. However, their role in host defense is debated, and the operating molecular mechanisms are unknown. Certain signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family (SLAMF) members act as microbial sensors and modulate immune functions in response to infection. Here, human blood transcriptomic analyses reveal the involvement of SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 in many infectious diseases, with elevated levels associated with type I IFN responses in salmonellosis and brucellosis patients. We further identify SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 as key regulators of human pDC function. They activate pDC maturation and cytokine production during infection with bacteria that induce acute (Salmonella) or chronic (Brucella) inflammation. SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 signal through NF-κB, IRF7, and STAT-1, and limit mitochondrial ROS accumulation upon Salmonella infection. Remarkably, this SLAMF7/8-dependent control of mitochondrial ROS levels favors bacterial persistence and NF-κB activation. Overall, our results unravel essential shared multifaceted roles of SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 in finely tuning human pDC responses to intracellular bacterial infections with potential for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BRCA) is a common malignant tumor, and its immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in disease progression. In this research, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing technologies, combined with in vivo and in vitro experiments, to thoroughly investigate the immunological functions and mechanisms of FOLR2+ macrophages in BRCA. Our findings demonstrate a significant enhancement in the interaction between FOLR2+ macrophages and CD8+ T cells within the tumor tissues of BRCA patients. FOLR2 is closely associated with T cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment of BRCA patients, particularly with CD8+ T cells. By secreting CXCL9 and engaging with CXCR3, FOLR2+ macrophages can activate the functionality of CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting cancer cell apoptosis. Further animal experiments confirm that FOLR2+ macrophages activate CD8+ T cells through the CXCL9-CXCR3 axis, exhibiting an antitumor immunity effect in BRCA. FOLR2+ macrophages play a crucial role in antitumor immunity in BRCA through the CXCL9-CXCR3 axis.

        <tr id="Recent studies on the pathogenesis of leukemia have led to remarkable advances in disease treatment. Numerous studies have shown the potential and viability of immune responses against leukemia. In the classical pathway, this process is often initiated by the upstream activity of CD39, which hydrolyzes extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to AMP. Subsequently, CD73 acts on AMP to generate adenosine, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, CD73 can also utilize substrates derived from other molecules through the non-canonical NAD+ pathway, specifically via the CD38/CD203a/CD73 axis, further enhancing adenosine production and facilitating immune escape. Targeting CD73 has shown potential in disrupting these immunosuppressive pathways, thereby enhancing anti-leukemic immune responses and improving patient outcomes. Inhibiting CD73 not only reduces the levels of immunosuppressive adenosine but also increases the efficacy of existing immunotherapies, such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, making it a versatile therapeutic target in leukemia treatment. This review discusses the potential of CD73 as a therapeutic target and emphasizes its unique position in the immune escape mechanism of leukemia. Moreover, this review provides an overview of the current research progress and future trends, emphasizing the clinical significance of targeting CD73 and other potential therapeutic strategies in leukemia.">

These cells are pivotal in eliminating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the bloodstream, thus limiting cancer spread and metastasis.

In this review, we first discuss the biology of NK cells, focusing on their functions within the tumor microenvironment (TME), the lymphatic system, and circulation. We then examine the immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells to inhibit NK cell activity, including the upregulation of inhibitory receptors. Finally, we explore the clinical implications of monitoring circulating biomarkers, such as NK cells and CTCs, for therapeutic decision-making and emphasize the need to enhance NK cell-based therapies by overcoming immune escape mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Brain metastases (BMs) are a relatively common and severe complication in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), significantly affecting patient prognosis. Metastatic tumor cells can alter the brain tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote an immunosuppressive state, characterized by reduced infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), diminished expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and changes in other proinflammatory factors and immune cell populations. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, play a pivotal role in modulating the central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment through interactions with metastatic cancer cells, astrocytes, and infiltrating T cells. The M2 phenotype of microglia contributes to immunosuppression in BM via the activation of signaling pathways such as STAT3 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. Recent advances have enhanced our understanding of the immune landscape of BMs in NSCLC, particularly regarding immune evasion within the CNS. Current immunotherapeutic strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promise for NSCLC patients with BM, demonstrating intracranial activity and manageable safety profiles.

        <tr id="Background Ageing-associated remodeling of the murine B cell system is accompanied with a reduction of CD19+ B cells such as follicular B cells (FOB) and an accumulation of age-associated B cells (ABC) or activated B cell subsets. This remodeling is thought to confer an attenuated antibody response, such as to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) vaccines in both aged mice and humans. To gain insight into the de novo development and function of an old B cell system, we reconstituted young and old immune systems by transferring hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from immune-competent young (2–3 months) CD45.1+ donors (DY-HSC) or old (20–24 months) donors (DO-HSC) into T and B cell-deficient young recipient CD45.2+ RAG1−/− mice, followed by protein-based vaccination. Results In the same environment of young RAG1−/− mice, transplanted DO-HSCs compared to DY-HSCs reconstituted lower numbers of CD19+ B cells and CD45.1+ cells, though the engraftment of donor-derived HSCs in the young bone marrow (BM) was very similar. Furthermore, indicative for youthful and unchallenged B cell systems, and in contrast to aged mice, very low levels of antigen-experienced memory B cells or age-associated B cells (ABC) developed in both DY-HSC and DO-HSC hosts. The commercially available recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) induced lower IgG+ S-antibody titers and pseudovirus neutralization activity in old compared to young mice. In contrast, very similar high IgG+ S-antibody titers were induced in DO-HSC and DY-HSC hosts, and pseudovirus neutralization activity was even enhanced in DO-HSC compared with DY-HSC hosts. Conclusions Both DO-HSCs and DY-HSCs established in the young recipient BM to a similar extend, suggesting that the concomitant reduction in the de novo reconstitution of CD19+ B cells in DO-HSC vs. DY-HSC transplanted animals is specifically related to old HSCs. DO-HSCs and DY-HSCs reconstitute very similar unchallenged B cell systems that efficiently elicit antigen-specific IgG antibodies by protein-based vaccination. Old HSCs thus retain competence to reconstitute a youthful and functional B cell system, at least in the young environment of transplanted RAG1−/− mice. This suggests that it is primarily age-related factors, and not HSCs per se, that influence the composition and functionality of the old B cell system.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with limited efficacy of established therapies, and a pronounced immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Targeting HER2 with local immunotherapy allows for high tumor specificity in the brain with physiologically very low expression. Monotherapy with CAR-NK cells targeted against HER2 has previously shown efficacy in medium-sized GL261/HER2 tumors.


METHODS
Advanced GL261/HER2 tumors were treated by local CAR-NK cell injection combined with systemic anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Tumor growth and survival were monitored. In-depth characterization of the microenvironment was performed by multiplex immune fluorescence, spectral flow cytometry and RNAseq.


RESULTS
Untreated GL261/HER2 tumors were characterized by local immunosuppression and high PD-L1 expression. Combined treatment with NK-92/5.28.z and systemic anti-PD-1 induced robust anti-tumor response and long-term survival. Multiplex immunofluorescence and spectral flow cytometry showed increased CD4+ T cell infiltration in mice treated with CAR-NK cell and anti-PD-1 combination therapy. A cluster of T cells specifically emerging in the combination therapy group expressed markers of NKT cells, which was further verified by immunofluorescence staining.


CONCLUSION
The combination therapy reverted the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with increased T and NKT cell infiltration. This resulted in successful treatment of advanced orthotopic tumors refractory to CAR-NK cell monotherapy.">

To better understand the association between T cell phenotypes and vaccine responsiveness, we conducted an in-depth analysis of CD4+, CD8+, and γδ + T cells on VITAL cohort participants who are low or high responders to multiple vaccines (influenza, pneumococcal, and SARS-CoV-2). Results Using spectral cytometry and FlowSOM, we identified detailed phenotypes of naïve, regulatory, and terminally differentiated T cells. We observed that the percentages of CD31 + naïve CD4+, CD31 + naïve CD8+, and CD38 + naïve CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in low vaccine responders. Notably, CD31 + naïve T cell subsets showed a stronger correlation with immune entropy, a measure of cumulative immune system perturbations, than with age itself. Conclusions These findings suggest that subsets of naïve cells could be associated with weak vaccine responsiveness and immunosenescence. Furthermore, these naive T cell signatures could help predict weak vaccine responses, potentially informing targeted vaccination strategies in older adults.

        <tr id="Myeloid cells are a major component of immune cells infiltrating tumors, interacting with each other, with tumor cells and other stromal cells, and demonstrating a prominent plasticity. Neutrophils, as a population of such cells, contribute to cancer progression via multiple mechanisms, including stimulation of angiogenesis and the regulation of adaptive immune responses. Importantly, neutrophils were demonstrated to be associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with different kinds of cancer, including head and neck cancer, renal cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma or melanoma. Enrichment of neutrophils was also associated with metastases in various tumor entities. 
Activity of neutrophils strongly depends on the cytokines or growth factors present in the microenvironment. Since these cells are highly plastic and their functionality can be easily altered, they are ideal target for anti-tumor therapies. Since we observe that elevated STAT3 is associated with pro-tumoral activity of neutrophils, we tested here the approach to functionally reprogram these cells by the inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway. We could show that such STAT3 inhibition solely in neutrophils led to decreased tumor growth and metastasis in cancer, which was accompanied by a significant expansion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Comprehensive multiparameter analyses of tumors and TDLNs revealed a significant enrichment of CD8+ T cell subsets with strongly cytotoxic activity, which effectively killed cancer cells in vitro. These findings provide novel insights in therapeutic avenues and suggest neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition as a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Upon activation, B cells undergo either the germinal center (GC) or extrafollicular (EF) response. While GC are known to generate high‐affinity memory B cells and long‐lived plasma cells, the role of the EF response is less well understood. Initially, it was thought to be limited to that of a source of fast but lower‐quality antibodies until the GC can form. However, recent evidence strongly supports the EF response as an important component of the humoral response to infection. EF responses are now also recognized as a source of pathogenic B cells in autoimmune diseases. The EF response itself is dynamic and regulated by pathways that are only recently being uncovered. We have identified that the cytokine IL‐12 acts as a molecular switch, enhancing the EF response and suppressing GC through multiple mechanisms. These include direct effects on both B cells themselves and the coordinated differentiation of helper CD4 T cells. Here, we explore this pathway in relation to other recent advancements in our understanding of the EF response's role and highlight areas for future research. A better understanding of how the EF response forms and is regulated is essential for advancing treatments for many disease states.">

Unlike conventional αβ T cells, γδ T cells can respond rapidly during the early stages of infection, and their antigen recognition is not restricted by MHC molecules. These distinctive features underscore the important role of γδ T cells in viral clearance and infection control. Therefore, γδ T cell-based immunotherapies have been extensively explored for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including viral infections and cancers. Several therapeutic strategies based on γδ T cells have advanced to clinical trials, demonstrating promising safety and efficacy. Currently, there are no effective treatments for flavivirus infections, which are typically characterized by acute onset. Research has shown that γδ T cells can rapidly expand during the early phases of flavivirus infections and effectively suppress viral replication, making them an attractive target for the development of novel therapies for flavivirus infections.

        <tr id="Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by dysregulated megakaryopoiesis and neoplastic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) expansion. Using a murine model with MK-specific JAK2V617F expression, we establish an MPN aging model where mutant MKs drive HSC expansion and a progressive decline in wild-type HSC function. Compared to wild-type MKs, JAK2V617F MKs exhibit heightened inflammation and innate immune activation with aging, including increased antigen presentation, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, skewed T cell populations, and impaired T cell functions in the marrow niche. Enhanced MK immunomodulatory function is linked to mutant cell expansion and MPN progression in a chimeric murine model with co-existing wild-type and JAK2V617F mutant HSCs. LINE-1 (long-interspersed element-1), a retrotransposon linked to innate immune activation and aging, is upregulated in mutant MKs during aging in murine models. We validated that LINE-1–encoded protein ORF1p is expressed in marrow MKs in 12 of 13 MPN patients but absent in control samples from patients undergoing orthopedic surgery (n=5). These findings suggest that MKs reprogram the marrow immune microenvironment, impairing normal HSC function while promoting neoplastic expansion in MPNs. LINE-1 activation in mutant MKs may be a key driver of immune dysregulation in MPNs. Key Points JAK2V617F mutant MKs reprogram the marrow immune microenvironment to promote neoplastic HSC expansion in MPNs.

The patient, who had experienced disease progression despite multiple lines of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, underwent experimental virotherapy with two intratumoral T-VEC injections. The treatment was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse effects, and led to substantial tumor regression and clinical stabilization, suggesting potential remission. Single-cell analysis revealed that T-VEC treatment induced robust local and systemic immune responses, including tumor necrosis, activation of M1 macrophages, and infiltration of CD8+ effector memory T cells. These findings demonstrate T-VEC’s safety and efficacy in generating both localized oncolysis and systemic anti-tumor immune response, highlighting its promise as a novel therapeutic approach for refractory ATLL.">

        <tr id="Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as a transformative approach for cancer treatment, demonstrating remarkable success in patients with relapsed and refractory hematological malignancies. However, challenges persist in optimizing CAR-T cell production and improving therapeutic outcomes. One of the major hurdles is the efficiency of retroviral or lentiviral transduction during CAR-T cell manufacturing. Additionally, the heterogeneity of T-cell populations isolated from patients can impact CAR-T cell effectiveness and persistence in vivo. This article explores a novel strategy to address these challenges by focusing on serum-free medium and additive optimization. We propose a unique approach that incorporates the culturing of T cells in Nutri-T medium, along with 24 h of exposure to combined low concentrations of BX795 and rosuvastatin, to enhance the transduction efficacy and functionality of CAR-T cells. The results presented here provide promising insights into the potential of this strategy to produce more effective CAR-T cells for immunotherapy, ultimately advancing the field and benefiting cancer patients worldwide.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease remains one of the most formidable barriers to the complete success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that has emerged as the curative approach for many hematopoietic malignancies because it affects quality of life and overall survival. Macrophages are among the important members of the immune system, which perform dual roles in GVHD as both therapeutic tools and targets. This review epitomizes the multifunctional role of macrophages in the pathophysiology of both acute and chronic GVHD. Macrophages play an important role in the early phase of GVHD because of their recruitment and infiltration into target organs. Furthermore, they polarize into two functionally different phenotypes, including M1 and M2. In the case of acute GVHD, most macrophages express the M1 phenotype characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to tissue damage. In contrast, in chronic GVHD, macrophages tend toward the M2 phenotype associated with the repair of tissues and fibrosis. A critical balance among these phenotypes is central to the course and severity of GVHD. Further interactions of macrophages with other lymphocytes such as T cells, B cells, and fibroblast further determine the course of GVHD. Macrophage interaction associated with alloreactive T cells promotes inflammation. This is therefore important in inducing injuries of tissues during acute GVHD. Interaction of macrophages, B cell, fibroblast, and CD4+ T cells promotes fibrosis during chronic GVHD and, hence, the subsequent dysfunction of organs. These are some insights, while several challenges remain. First, the impact of the dominant cytokines in GVHD on the polarization of macrophages is incompletely characterized and sometimes controversial. Second, the development of targeted therapies able to modulate macrophage function without systemic side effects remains an area of ongoing investigation. Future directions involve the exploration of macrophage-targeted therapies, including small molecules, antibodies, and nanotechnology, which modulate macrophage behavior and improve patient outcomes. This underlines the fact that a profound understanding of the dual role of macrophages in GVHD is essential for developing new and more effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting macrophages might represent one avenue for decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD and improving the success and safety of HSCT.">

The TME plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulating processes such as cancer cell migration, proliferation, tumor vascularization, and the modulation of anti-cancer immune responses. 2 Effects of the TME are partially mediated by secreted factors, including exosomes, metabolites, cytokines, chemokines, and a remodeled extracellular matrix produced by CAFs, which profoundly in ﬂ uence cancer progression. 2 Numerous studies revealed that the TME plays a pivotal role in modulating anti-cancer immune responses, either promoting or suppressing these processes in a manner that appears highly context-dependent. 3 Effective immune responses against cancer cells basically involve three different key mechanisms.

Using an experimental model of tumor relapse, we show that adjuvant or neoadjuvant cDC1 vaccination improves anti-tumor immune memory, particularly by increasing the infiltrates of CD4+ tissue resident memory (Trm) and CD8+ memory T cells. This translates into complete prevention of tumor relapses. Moreover, elevated abundance of cDC1s positively correlates with CD4+ Trm presence, and both associate with enhanced survival in human breast cancer and melanoma.

        <tr id="In a recent study published in Nature , Breart et al. 1 untangled the controversy surrounding interleukin (IL)-27 ’ s role in regulating T cell differentiation and immune responses in cancer. Their ﬁ ndings reveal that IL-27 enhances the persistence and effector functions of tumor-in ﬁ ltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes (TILs), preventing exhaustion, sustaining T cell-dependent tumor control and immunotherapy ef ﬁ cacy without signi ﬁ cant systemic side effects. Effective immune control of cancer relies on the ability of T lymphocytes to in ﬁ ltrate tumors and exert their cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, surviving neoplastic cells promptly adapt to immune-patrolled environments and evolve under immune system pressure to progressively avoid immune clearance, establishing immune-privileged conditions that sustain limitless growth. These immune evasive strategies are deployed in 3 main routes: “ camou ﬂ age ” (reduced immunogenicity and immune exclusion), “ coercion ” (impaired local immune activation through the establishment of a highly immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment [TME]), “ cytoprotection ” (avoiding neoplastic cell killing through intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms). 2 Therapeutic approaches targeting immune checkpoints and aiming to restore cancer immune surveillance signi ﬁ cantly improved the survival and life quality of cancer patients, although their ef ﬁ cacy is restricted to a fraction of patients and tumor types.

        <tr id="Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) play a crucial role in modulating tumor immune responses and influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, our current understanding of the microenvironment within these lymph nodes remains limited. Tumors not only impair the anti-tumor activity of CD8+ T cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment, but they also facilitate immune evasion and promote metastasis by altering the structure and function of TDLNs. Research has shown that tumor-specific memory CD8+ T cells (TTSM) within TDLNs are essential for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockers. Moreover, the abnormal structure of TDLNs, along with the presence of immunosuppressive cells—such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), and immunosuppressive dendritic cells (DCs)—contributes to tumor-mediated immune evasion. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the immune microenvironment within TDLNs is essential for improving the effectiveness of immunotherapies and developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review explores various TDLN-based therapeutic strategies, addressing the controversies surrounding lymph node dissection, the use of TDLNs as a source of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for therapy, targeting immunosuppressive cells within TDLNs, and methods to reverse the structural abnormalities of TDLNs.

How to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm remains an important challenge. Whether Trm contribute also to immune control of tumors or just correlate with an unrelated process linked to clinical outcome has not been unequivocally established9,10, and phenotypic markers such as co-expression of CD69 and CD103 or CD49a integrins commonly used to monitor tumor infiltrating Trm do not unambiguously define this subset. Here we tested the hypothesis that transient downregulation of KLF2, the most conserved feature of Trm ontogeny4,11,12, will promote the differentiation of vaccine activated CD8+ T cells into Trm and enhance antitumor immunity. We show that 4-1BB antibody targeted delivery of a KLF2 siRNA to tumor bearing mice led to the downregulation of KLF2 in vaccine activated CD8+ T cells and the accumulation of phenotypically defined intratumoral CD69+CD103+ and CD69+CD49a+ CD8+ T cells which correlated with enhanced control of tumor growth. This study could serve as the foundation of a broadly applicable and clinically useful way to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm and provides direct evidence that intratumoral CD8+CD69+CD103+ and CD8+CD69+CD49a+ cells are indeed Trm and that Trm contribute to tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Background The role of T cell immunity during antineoplastic therapy is poorly understood. In the BEGYN-1 study, patients with breast cancer underwent quarterly assessments prior to and during antineoplastic therapy over a period of 12 months. Methods We used flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassays to quantify 25 T cell subpopulations and seven T cell associated plasma cytokines in peripheral blood from 92 non-metastatic breast cancer patients, respectively. In addition, the association between T cell dynamics and the outcome of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy was investigated. Results In patients undergoing chemotherapy, a significant reduction in T helper (Th) cells, particularly naïve central and effector cells and thymus positive Th cells, was observed over time. Interestingly, Th1 immune response-associated cytokines (IL-12, TNF, IFN-γ) declined while Th2 cells and cytotoxic T cells increased over time. Conclusions We conclude that in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy is associated with a transition from a Th1 immune response towards Th2 and an increase in cytotoxic T cells, whereas in patients without chemotherapy, these alterations were less pronounced. Future studies should clarify whether patterns of T cell subsets or plasma cytokines can be used as biomarkers to monitor or even improve therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Background: α-Galactosylceramide (α-Galcer), a specific ligand for invariant natural killer T (NKT) cell activation, has been actively investigated in clinical trials such as antitumor therapy; however, treatment with α-Galcer is well known to induce acute hepatitis due to enriched NKT cells in the liver. The molecular mechanisms underlying NKT-mediated hepatitis still remain obscure. The object of this study was to investigate whether and how myeloid cells affect NKT-mediated hepatitis. Methods: α-Galcer–induced NKT hepatitis was used in this study. microRNA-223 (miR-223) and neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (Ncf1)–deficent mice were generated and subjected to α-Galcer–induced NKT hepatitis. Results: In this study, we demonstrated that α-Galcer–induced NKT cell activation resulted in neutrophil and monocyte-derived macrophage accumulation in the liver. Importantly, serum levels of several hepatic myeloid cell infiltration–related cytokines and chemokines were significantly elevated after α-Galcer administration. Among these myeloid cells, blockade of neutrophil or macrophage migration through using different inhibitors of (C-X-C Motif) receptor 2, (C-C motif) receptor 2, and (C-C motif) receptor 5 signaling ameliorated α-Galcer–induced liver injury, mainly due to the decrease of reactive oxygen species production and inflammation. Depletion of neutrophils reduced α-Galcer–induced liver injury and hepatitis. Interestingly, genetic deletion of neutrophil-specific miR-223 markedly enhanced while Ncf﻿1﻿ deficiency significantly ameliorated liver inflammation and oxidative damage caused by α-Galcer. Conclusions: Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration through multiple inflammatory mediators is required for NKT cell activation–induced hepatitis, which sheds light on the myeloid cell infiltration–related molecular mechanisms of NKT cell–mediated liver injury. Our study may provide a novel therapeutical strategy for the treatment of NKT cell hepatitis.">

        <tr id="Lactate has emerged as a key regulator in the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing both tumor progression and immune dynamics. As a byproduct of aerobic glycolysis, lactate satisfies the metabolic needs of proliferating tumor cells while reshaping the TME to facilitate immune evasion. Elevated lactate levels inhibit effector immune cells such as CD8+ T and natural killer cells, while supporting immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, thus fostering an immunosuppressive environment. Lactate promotes epigenetic reprogramming, stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and activates nuclear factor kappa B, leading to further immunological dysfunction. In this review, we examined the role of lactate in metabolic reprogramming, immune suppression, and treatment resistance. We also discuss promising therapeutic strategies targeting lactate metabolism, including lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, monocarboxylate transporter inhibitors, and TME neutralization methods, all of which can restore immune function and enhance immunotherapy outcomes. By highlighting recent advances, this review provides a theoretical foundation for integrating lactate-targeted therapies into clinical practice. We also highlight the potential synergy between these therapies and current immunotherapeutic strategies, providing new avenues for addressing TME-related challenges and improving outcomes for patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, driven by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and immune-related factors. Among the pivotal pathways implicated in CRC tumorigenesis, the Notch signaling pathway is instrumental in governing cell fate decisions, tissue renewal, homeostasis, and immune cell development. As a highly conserved mechanism, Notch signaling not only modulates tumor cell behavior but also shapes the immune landscape within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Aberrant Notch signaling in CRC fosters immune evasion and tumor progression through its effects on the balance and functionality of immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Elevated Notch pathway activation correlates with advanced clinicopathological features and poorer clinical outcomes, highlighting its relevance as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target. Therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting the Notch pathway, such as γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in combination with other therapies, have demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical and clinical settings. This review examines the impact of Notch signaling on CRC immunity, elucidating its regulatory mechanisms within immune cells and its role in promoting tumor progression. Additionally, this review discusses therapeutic strategies targeting Notch signaling, including GSIs, mAbs, and potential combination therapies designed to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. By elucidating the multifaceted role of Notch within the CRC TME, this review underscores its potential as a target for innovative therapeutic strategies.">

This effect is mediated both by cell-cell contact through increased PD-L1 expression on plasma cells and by production of a soluble factor. These observations are recapitulated in three cohorts of critically ill patients with bacterial and viral sepsis in association with increased mortality. Our findings thus reveal the function of regulatory plasma cells in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced immune alterations, and present a potential therapeutic target for improving immune cell function impaired by sepsis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Only a minority of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) respond favourably to immunotherapy. The oral oncogenic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.nucleatum) was recently observed to suppress the anti‐tumour immune response, although the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from F.nucleatum (F.n‐OMVs) promoted HNSCC progression by inducing immunosuppressive phenotypes of tumour‐associated macrophages (TAMs), resulting in decreased cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration in vivo. Mechanistically, TAMs internalized tryptophanase presented in F.n‐OMVs, which activated the tryptophan‐2,3‐dioxygenase 2/aryl hydrocarbon receptor (TDO2/AHR) pathway and upregulated the transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoints. TDO2 inhibitor enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti‐programmed death‐1 in a tumour‐bearing mouse model. Both TDO2 and F.nucleatum demonstrated excellent performance in predicting the immunotherapy outcomes in patients with HNSCC. These results indicate that F.n‐OMVs induce immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC, providing novel insights into the microbiota–tumour immunity crosstalk.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, characterized by rapid proliferation, extensive infiltration, and significant intratumoral heterogeneity. Despite advancements in conventional treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis for GBM patients remains poor, with a median survival of approximately 15 months. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising alternative; however, the unique biological and immunological features, including its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and low mutational burden, render it resistant to many immunotherapeutic strategies. This review explores the key challenges in GBM immunotherapy, focusing on immune evasion mechanisms, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the TME. Immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells have shown promise in preclinical models but have limited clinical success due to antigen heterogeneity, immune cell exhaustion, and impaired trafficking across the BBB. Emerging strategies, including dual-targeting CAR-T cells, engineered immune cells secreting therapeutic molecules, and advanced delivery systems to overcome the BBB, show potential for enhancing treatment efficacy. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving GBM immunotherapy outcomes.">

        <tr id="The spleen, the largest lymphatic organ, comprises a diverse array of immunocytes in approximately one quarter of the body, including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells (such as dendritic cells, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and macrophages). These immune cells undergo dynamic transitions and mobilization, enabling the spleen to execute a wide range of immunological functions. The spleen's structural organization and multicellular composition, along with its reservoir of lymphocytes, facilitate the capture and clearance of blood-borne antigens while also orchestrating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, the spleen plays critical roles in hematopoiesis and the removal of aged or damaged red blood cells. Despite being innervated by sympathetic (catecholaminergic) nerve fibers, the spleen lacks parasympathetic (vagal or cholinergic) innervation. The neuroimmune axis, particularly the interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system immune circuits, significantly influences disease onset and progression. Extensive research employing physical, genetic, and pharmacological approaches has sought to directly modulate splenic immunocytes and activate neuroimmune interactions to restore immune homeostasis and counteract disease. Two primary mechanisms underlie these immunomodulatory interventions: (1) the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, wherein norepinephrine released by splenic catecholaminergic fibers binds to β2-adrenergic receptors on CD4⁺ T cells, triggering acetylcholine secretion, which in turn suppresses inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling, and (2) direct immunomodulation of splenic immunocytes, which regulates key genes and signaling pathways, alters cytokine secretion, and modulates ion flux to influence cellular functions. Among various therapeutic strategies, physical methods, particularly electrical stimulation and splenic ultrasound stimulation, have demonstrated the greatest promise for clinical applications in splenic immunomodulation and disease management.">

        <tr id="Background Cancer immunotherapy has shown promising results in the clinic, but it faces great challenges such as low response rates and low efficacy in solid tumors. c-Rel, a member of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB family, is a newly described immune checkpoint for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which contribute to the formation of immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. How to selectively target myeloid c-Rel for the treatment of cancer is not well established. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and efficacy of knocking down myeloid c-Rel with siRNA-loaded peptide-based nanoparticles as a new cancer immunotherapy strategy. Methods The knockdown of c-Rel gene by the siRNA-loaded peptide nanoparticles was confirmed on MDSCs in vitro and in vivo. The effects of c-Rel silencing on cell number and immune suppressive function of the murine bone marrow-derived MDSCs were then investigated. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of the c-Rel siRNA loaded nanoparticles, female C57BL/6 mice with subcutaneous B16 tumor were treated with PBS, c-Rel siRNA loaded nanoparticles, control siRNA loaded nanoparticles or empty nanoparticles. The tumor growth and body weight of mice were monitored, and the numbers and immune activities of tumor infiltrated immune cells in different groups were analyzed at the end of the experiment. The immune function of MDSCs isolated from tumor bearing mice received different treatments were further investigated ex vivo by T cell proliferation assays. Results The c-Rel siRNA nanoparticles significantly reduced c-Rel expression in MDSCs, diminished both the number and immune suppressive function of MDSCs, and enhanced intratumor CD8+ T cell responses. Significantly reduced tumor growth was observed in mice treated with the c-Rel siRNA nanoparticles compared to control mice. Conclusion Our data indicates that peptide-based nanoparticles can be successfully utilized to target the myeloid immune checkpoint c-Rel for the treatment of cancer.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT We conducted a phase Ib/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and clinical activity of combining pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) with XL888 (Hsp90 inhibitor) in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). We hypothesized that this regimen would modulate soluble and cellular immune mediators and enhance clinical outcomes. The trial employed a 3 + 3 open-label design, with an expansion cohort at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in treatment-refractory, mismatch repair-proficient CRC patients. Comprehensive analyses of plasma cytokines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and spatial immune cell patterns in liver biopsies were performed to identify unique immune signatures resulting from the combined therapy. The combination of pembrolizumab and XL888 proved to be safe and feasible, with a subset of patients achieving stable disease, although no objective responses were observed in this heavily pre-treated population. Correlative studies revealed immunomodulatory effects in tumors and circulation, including a reduction in IL6+ cells and macrophages (CD68+) within metastatic liver tissue, alterations in blood CD3+ cells, and upregulation of numerous inflammatory plasma cytokines. These findings suggest local and systemic immune activation by the combination of pembrolizumab and XL888. While clinical activity was modest in treatment-refractory CRC patients, there were notable effects on the tumor immune environment and systemic immune modulation.">

        <tr id="Anti-tumor immunity, including innate and adaptive immunity is critical in inhibiting tumorigenesis and development of tumor. The adaptive immunity needs specific lymph organs such as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which are highly correlated with improved survival outcomes in many cancers. In recent years, with increasing attention on the TLS in tumor microenvironment, TLSs have emerged as a novel target for anti-tumor therapy. Excitingly, studies have shown the contribution of TLSs to the adaptive immune responses. However, it is unclear how TLSs to form and how to more effectively defense against tumor through TLS formation. Recent studies have shown that the inflammation plays a critical role in TLS formation. Interestingly, studies have also found that gut microbiota can regulate the occurrence and development of inflammation. Therefore, we here summarize the potential effects of gut microbiota- mediated inflammation or immunosuppression on the TLS formation in tumor environments. Meanwhile, this review also explores how to manipulate mature TLS formation through regulating gut microbiota/metabolites or gut microbiota associated signal pathways for anti-tumor immunity, which potentially lead to a next-generation cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Advances in cancer therapies have significantly improved patient survival; however, tumors enriched in cancer stem cells (CSCs) have poor treatment responses. CSCs are a key source of tumor heterogeneity, contributing to therapeutic resistance and unfavorable patient outcomes. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), cell-in-cell (CIC) structures, where one cell engulfs another, have been identified as markers of poor prognosis. Despite their clinical relevance, the mechanisms underlying CIC formation across different tumor cell subpopulations remain largely unknown. Elucidating these processes could provide novel insights and therapeutic opportunities to address aggressive, treatment-resistant cancers. Method: Fluorescent mCherry-carrying colorectal cancer stem cells (CRCSCs) were expanded as spheroids in serum-free media and cocultured with either parental cancer cell-expressing Venus fluorescent protein or CFSE dye-stained immune cells (T cells, M1/M2 macrophages, neutrophils, and NK cells) or treated with EGFR- or PD-L1-targeting antibodies to assess the formation of CIC structures. Genes potentially crucial for the formation of CIC structures were knocked down or overexpressed, and their effects on CIC formation were evaluated. The clinical relevance of the in vitro findings was confirmed through analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens. Results: CRCSCs have a strong predilection for serving as the outer cell in a CIC structure and forming homotypic CIC structures predominantly with parental CRC cells. The frequency of CIC structure formation increased when the cells were exposed to anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment. Both the outer CRCSC in a CIC structure and CRCSCs released from a homotypic CIC structure showed enhanced resistance to the cytotoxicity of NK-92MI cells. Restoration of Stathmin1 (STMN1) expression but not RAC1 knockdown in CRCSCs reduced the homotypic CIC frequency, disrupted the outer cell fate in CIC structures, and increased cell susceptibility to NK-92MI cytotoxicity. In CRC patients, CIC structures are associated with poor tumor differentiation, negative STMN1 expression, and poor prognosis. Conclusion: CSCs play a crucial role in informing CIC structures in CRC. CIC structure formation partially depends on low STMN1 expression and confers a survival advantage under NK cytotoxicity. Targeting this pathway may significantly improve immunotherapy's efficacy for CRC patients.">

        <tr id="Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), members of the lipid kinase family, play a significant role in modulating immune cell functions, including activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Recent studies have identified the PI3K signaling pathway as a key regulator in tumor biology and the immune microenvironment. This pathway enhances the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that impairs the effectiveness of cancer vaccines and immunotherapies. The present study explores PI3K isoforms, particularly p110γ and p110δ, and their associated signaling pathways. The therapeutic potential of selective PI3K inhibitors and their capacity to act synergistically with immunization strategies are analyzed. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway represents a promising approach to counteract tumor-induced immune suppression and improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines, ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction In type 2 diabetes (T2D), beta cell failure is often associated with islet inflammation driven by the innate immune response, with macrophages playing a significant role. However, the composition and phenotype of lymphoid immune cells in the islets of individuals with T2D have not been extensively studied. This study aims to characterize and compare the presence, phenotype, and frequency of islet-associated lymphocytes—specifically T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells—in patients with T2D and non-diabetic organ donors. Research design and methods Multicolor flow cytometry was employed to detect NK, B, and T cells in dissociated pancreatic islets from 13 T2D and 44 non-diabetic donors. The frequencies and phenotypes of T cell subsets were determined using markers for memory differentiation status and tissue-resident T cells. The frequencies of alpha and beta cells were assessed by flow cytometry, and the insulin secretion level was measured by ELISA. Results In both T2D and non-diabetic islets, CD3(+) T cells were the predominant lymphocytes, mainly central and effector memory phenotypes, with a bias toward CD8(+) T cells expressing canonical residency markers (CD69 and CD103). The frequencies of CD19(+) B cells and CD3(−) CD16(+) CD56(+) NK cells were low in both groups. The proportions of these immune and beta cells were similar between T2D and non-diabetic donors. However, T2D donors had a higher proportion of glucagon-producing alpha cells and significantly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared with non-diabetic individuals. Conclusions In T2D islets, resident CD8(+) T cells with a central memory phenotype dominate the lymphoid immune cell population, similar to non-diabetic donors. These findings provide the first insights into the memory T cell composition in human pancreatic islets in T2D, suggesting that the diabetic condition does not significantly alter the lymphoid landscape of pancreatic islets.">

        <tr id="The tumor-immune response is mobilized to suppress tumorigenesis, while the immune microenvironment and lymph node microenvironment are formed gradually during tumor progression. In fact, tumor surface antigens are not easily recognized by antigen-presenting cells. So it is hard for the immune system to kill the newly formed tumor cells effectively. In a normal immune environment, immune function is always suppressed to maintain the stability of the body, and regulatory T cells play an important role in maintaining immune suppression. However, during tumorigenesis, the suppression of regulatory T cell immune functions is more likely to contribute to tumor cell proliferation and migration leading directly to tumor progression. Therefore, focusing on the role of regulatory T cells in tumor immunity could improve tumor immunotherapy outcomes in the clinic. Regulatory T cells are more mature in hematologic system tumors than in solid tumors. However, there are continuing efforts to apply regulatory T cells for immunotherapy in solid tumors. This review describes the role of regulatory T cells in solid tumor immunotherapy from the perspective of prognosis, immune microenvironment remodeling, and current clinical applications. This summary could help us better understand the mechanisms of regulatory T cells in solid tumor immunotherapy and further expand their clinical application.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary In solid tumors, cancer cells are surrounded by nontumor cells, such as immune and stromal cells. Together with non-cellular components, they form the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cancer cells can hijack nontumor cells in the TME to support tumor growth. Therefore, the TME has a significant influence on the success of cancer therapy. In pancreatic cancer, immune cells of the innate immune system, macrophages, have been shown to negatively impact the survival rate of cancer patients. However, the mediators (chemokines) released by pancreatic cancer cells to control macrophages are understudied. In the present study, we characterized interactions between a murine macrophage cell line and two pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro. In screening 13 different chemokines, we observed a congruent increase in seven. This was paralleled by an increased expression of surface markers associated with a protumoral macrophage phenotype. Our findings are an essential basis for functional studies and might help to improve and develop novel therapies for pancreatic cancer in the future.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated disorders are a broad range of diseases, arising as consequence of immune defects, exaggerated/misguided immune response or a mixture of both conditions. Their frequency is on a rise in the developed societies and they pose a significant challenge for diagnosis and treatment. Traditional pharmacological, monoclonal antibody-based or polyclonal antibody replacement-based therapies aiming at modulation of the immune responses give very often dissatisfactory results and/or are burdened with unacceptable adverse effects. In recent years, a new group of treatment modalities has emerged, utilizing cells as living drugs, especially with the use of the up-to-date genetic engineering. These modern cellular therapies are designed to offer a high potential for more targeted, safe, durable, and personalized treatment options. This work briefly reviews the latest advances in the treatment of immune-mediated disorders, mainly those related to exaggeration of the immune response, with such cellular therapies as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and others. We highlight the main features of these therapies as new treatment options for taming the dysregulated immune system. Undoubtfully, in near future such therapies can provide lasting remissions in a range of immune-mediated disorders with reduced treatment burden and improved quality of life for the patients.">

        <tr id="South Africa has the highest HIV prevalence globally, often co-occurring with helminth infections in impoverished regions. The coexistence of these infections leads to immunological interactions, potentially enhancing oncogenesis by upregulating immune checkpoint molecules (ICs) among other effects. Notably, most ICs are overexpressed in cancer and correlated with its progression. Helminth infections trigger Th2-type immunity, increasing immunosuppressive M2 macrophages, regulatory T cells, and associated IC molecules. PD-L2 is reported to contribute to Th2-type immunity induced by helminth infections. Similarly, TIM-3, elevated during chronic viral infections, induces a similar immunosuppressive profile. CTLA-4 and PD-1 impact T-cell function by interacting with CD28, crucial for T-cell function. CD28 is downregulated in chronic infections and cancer. This study investigated the impact of HIV-helminth co-infection on co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecule profiles associated with antitumor immunity. Using 78 serum samples collected from March 2020 to May 2021, participants were categorized into uninfected control (no HIV and helminth infections), HIV-infected, helminth-infected, and HIV-helminth co-infected groups. Multiplex immune regulatory molecule assay analysis was conducted. The data were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis and adjusted for confounders (age, gender, BMI, ART, supplements, and other chronic diseases). The uninfected control group was used as the baseline reference group for analysis. HIV-infected individuals had higher PD-1 (adjusted β = 0.12, p = 0.034) and TIM-3 (adjusted β = 23.15, p = 0.052) levels, with the latter showing a trend toward significance. However, lower CD28 levels (adjusted β = −651.95, p = 0.010) were observed. Helminth-infected individuals had higher TIM-3 levels (adjusted β = 20.98, p = 0.020). The co-infected group had higher PD-1 (unadjusted β = 0.18, p = 0.0046) and PD-L2 (adjusted β = 7.95, p = 0.033) levels. A significant decrease in CD28 profile was observed across all infected groups: HIV-infected (adjusted β = −651.95, p = 0.010), helminth-infected (adjusted β = −674.32, p = 0.001), and co-infected (adjusted β = −671.55, p = 0.044). The results suggest that HIV-helminth co-infections alter immune checkpoint markers, potentially increasing cancer risk by promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment that hinders anti-cancer immunity. CD28’s downregulation underscores immune inefficiency in chronic diseases. Addressing these co-infections is crucial for improving HIV care and potentially reducing cancer risks through targeted strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Melanoma, being one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer, is characterized by its aggressive and metastatic nature, with the potential to develop resistance to various treatments. This resistance makes the disease challenging to treat, emphasizing the need for new treatment strategies. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), melanoma cells exploit metabolic shifts, particularly glycolysis, to create an immunosuppressive TME that prevents dendritic cells (DCs) from functioning properly. Essential metabolic alterations such as lactate and lipid accumulation, and lack of tryptophan disrupt DC maturation, antigen presentation, and T cell activation. In recent years, melanoma immunotherapy has increasingly focused on reprogramming the metabolism of DCs. This review paper aims to provide insights into the metabolic suppression of melanoma-associated DCs, allowing the design of therapeutic strategies based on metabolic interventions to promote or restore DC function. This contribution reviews the metabolic reprogramming of DCs as a new approach for melanoma immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="TRIMELVax is an innovative immunotherapeutic vaccine for malignant melanoma, which combines heat shock-conditioned human melanoma cell lysates with a mollusk hemocyanin as an adjuvant. Preclinical studies demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in mice with melanoma and colorectal tumors. However, the precise immunological mechanisms behind its anti-tumor effects have remained unclear. We focused on understanding how TRIMELVax induces inflammation at the injection site, recruits innate immune cells, triggers DC migration to draining lymph nodes, and affects tumor microenvironment and growth. To achieve this, C57BL/6 mice were injected in the footpad with TRIMELVax, PBS, or control vaccines, and then the skin and the popliteal lymph node were harvested for qPCR or FACS analysis. Results showed that TRIMELVax rapidly induced a specific pattern of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a differential acute innate immune response in the injection site. Neutrophils, type 1 macrophages, monocytes, cDC1, Langerhans cells, and monocyte derived-DCs were recruited to the footpad, while type 2 macrophages decreased. This early inflammation facilitated a superior migration of cDC1 and a new subtype of antigen-presenting neutrophils to the draining lymph node compared to controls. Depleting neutrophils before vaccination reduced DC migration, especially cDC1, to the draining lymph node and suppressed TRIMELVax's ability to control tumor growth, demonstrating that vaccine-induced neutrophils play a fundamental role in TRIMELVax's mechanism of action. At the tumor microenvironment level, it was observed that TRIMELVax induces a more intense infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes than controls, with a low level of exhaustiveness and greater cytotoxic capacity. A phase I clinical trial in twenty nivolumab-refractory patients showed that TRIMELVax is well tolerated with no grade 3-5 side effects and induces a Delayed-Type hypersensitivity reaction against melanoma antigens after four doses of the vaccine with an impact on disease stability and patient survival. In summary, TRIMELVax triggers a rapid and potent activation of the innate immune system, which seems crucial for a more effective adaptive immune response against aggressive melanoma tumors. These results underscore the promise of TRIMELVax as a potential immunotherapeutic approach for melanoma treatment.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity provides the critical first line of defense against infection and sterile triggers. Cell death is a key component of the innate immune response to clear pathogens, but excessive or aberrant cell death can induce inflammation, cytokine storm, and pathology, making it a central molecular mechanism in inflammatory diseases. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one such inflammatory disease, but the specific innate immune mechanisms driving pathology in this context remain unclear. Here, by leveraging RNAseq and tissue expression in clinical samples, we identified increased expression of the innate immune sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) in patients with ALD. We discovered that ZBP1 expression correlated with ALD progression in patients, and that ethanol induced ZBP1-dependent lytic cell death, PANoptosis, in immune (macrophages, monocytes, Kupffer cells) and non-immune cells (hepatocytes). Mechanistically, the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) IRF9 and IRF1 upregulated ZBP1 expression, allowing ZBP1 to sense Z-NAs through its Zα2 domain and drive PANoptosis signaling, cell membrane rupture through NINJ1, and DAMP release. Furthermore, the expressions of ZBP1 and NINJ1 were upregulated in both liver and serum samples from patients with ALD. In mouse models of chronic and acute ALD, ZBP1-deficient mice were significantly protected from disease pathology and liver damage. Overall, our findings establish the critical role of the ZBP1-NINJ1 axis regulated by IRFs in driving inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in liver cells, suggesting that targeting these molecules will have therapeutic potential in ALD and other inflammatory conditions.">

Myeloid blasts, which are derived from normal myeloid progenitors, play a central role in these diseases by disrupting hematopoiesis and driving disease progression. In addition, other myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, adapt dynamically to the tumor microenvironment, where they can promote immune evasion and resistance to treatment. This review explores the unique characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of myeloid blasts, the immunosuppressive roles of myeloid cells, and their complex interactions within the TME. Furthermore, we highlight emerging therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells, focusing on strategies to reprogram their functions, inhibit their suppressive effects, or eliminate pathological populations altogether, as well as the latest preclinical and clinical trials advancing these approaches.

The LPS-induced disease model, triggers a remarkable release of inflammatory factors, immune and coagulation dysfunction, and damage to vital organs such as the brain, lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. Recently, the role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in various clinical diseases has garnered significant attention due to their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, tissue healing, anti-apoptotic, and antibacterial properties. Despite the common use of LPS models to induce disease models and simulate acute inflammation, the integration of stem cell therapy within these models remains underexplored. This article integrates the LPS induced animal model and reviews the current evidence regarding the therapeutic mechanisms of stem cells in LPS-induced disease models across various human body systems. Furthermore, this review predicts and hypothesizes the feasibility and potential of using stem cells in disease models that have not yet been extensively studied, based on existing animal inflammation models.

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological cancer and treatment options remain limited. In a recent first-in-class Phase I trial, the monoclonal IgE antibody MOv18, specific for the tumour-associated antigen Folate Receptor-α, was well-tolerated and preliminary anti-tumoural activity observed. Pre-clinical studies identified macrophages as mediators of tumour restriction and pro-inflammatory activation by IgE. However, the mechanisms of IgE-mediated modulation of macrophages and downstream tumour immunity in human cancer remain unclear. Here we study macrophages from patients with epithelial ovarian cancers naive to IgE therapy. High-dimensional flow cytometry and RNA-seq demonstrate immunosuppressive, FcεR-expressing macrophage phenotypes. Ex vivo co-cultures and RNA-seq interaction analyses reveal immunosuppressive associations between patient-derived macrophages and regulatory T (Treg) cells. MOv18 IgE-engaged patient-derived macrophages undergo pro-inflammatory repolarisation ex vivo and display induction of a hyperinflammatory, T cell-stimulatory subset. IgE reverses macrophage-promoted Treg cell induction to increase CD8+ T cell expansion, a signature associated with improved patient prognosis. On-treatment tumours from the MOv18 IgE Phase I trial show evidence of this IgE-driven immune signature, with increased CD68+ and CD3+ cell infiltration. We demonstrate that IgE induces hyperinflammatory repolarised states of patient-derived macrophages to inhibit Treg cell immunosuppression. These processes may collectively promote immune activation in ovarian cancer patients receiving IgE therapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The molecular barriers that cause acute xenograft rejection have been identified and addressed by generating genetically modified (GM) animals, knocked out for specific xenoantigens (xenoAgs), and expressing regulatory molecules for both complement and coagulation pathways among others. The focus of xenotransplantation research now lies in delayed xenograft rejection. Dendritic cells (DC) are a specific subpopulation of professional antigen‐presenting cells (APC) that play a crucial role in the context of organ transplantation. DCs, originating from both the xenograft and the recipient, have the capacity to present xenoAgs to the recipient's immune system via their respective major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules leading to rejection. These processes are known as direct and indirect presentation, respectively. However, under certain microenvironmental conditions, DC develops into anti‐inflammatory regulatory cells that can induce immunological tolerance. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the general characteristics and functions of DC from species relevant to xenotransplantation, specifically humans, non‐human primates (NHP), and pigs. It will also cover the process of xenoAg presentation, different methods for generating DC with regulatory properties in vitro, and finally, discuss the current strategies for using regulatory DC to improve xenograft acceptance by inducing tolerance.">

        <tr id="Background The generation of functionally active, stable T regulatory cells (Tregs) is a crucial target of type 1 diabetes (T1D) immunotherapy. This study investigated therapeutic intervention for T1D/Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), wherein the diabetogenic proinflammatory Treg (intermediate) cell subset was characterized and driven to a Treg phenotype (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+). This involved simultaneous inhibition of the eukaryotic initiation factor 5a (eIF5a) and Notch pathways using GC7 (N1-Guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane) and Anti-DLL4 (Delta-like-ligand-4). Methods Peripheral blood from patients with T1D/LADA and healthy adults (n=7 each) was used to isolate the CD4+CD25− T cell population and CD4 deficient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cells were subjected to GAD65+GC7+anti-DLL4 treatment for seven days and compared with conventional anti-CD3/CD28/CD137 stimulation for conversion into the Tregs. Newly plasticized Tregs were assessed for their suppressive potential against freshly isolated autologous T responder cells. In addition, live, dead, and apoptotic cell counts were performed to evaluate the adverse effects of immunomodulatory treatment on immune cells. The data was analyzed with GraphPad Prism using 1- or 2-way ANOVA and a Student’s t-test. Results A unique population of proinflammatory cytokines expressing intermediate Tregs (CD4+CD25−IFNg+IL17+FOXP3+) was characterized in T1D/LADA patients and found significantly increased compared to age-matched healthy adults. Simultaneous inhibition of eIF5a and Notch pathways could induce Treg phenotype in Treg-deficient CD4+ T cells and CD4 deficient PBMCs from T1D/LADA patients. GAD65+GC7+anti-DLL4 treatment plasticized Tregs withstanding a proinflammatory milieu mimicking T1D/LADA, and the plasticized Tregs exhibited a stable and suppressive functional phenotype. Furthermore, GAD65+GC7+anti-DLL4 treatment had no adverse effects on immune cells. The present approach is a multipronged approach involving the inhibition of eIF5a and Notch pathways that addresses the upregulation of immune tolerance, differentiation, and proliferation of cytotoxic T cells and alleviates β-cell dysfunction. Additionally, this treatment strategy could also be leveraged to boost Treg generation following islet transplantation or as a combinational therapy along with adoptive cell transfer.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) mediates durable and complete regression of various cancers. However, its efficacy is limited by the long-term persistence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, given their irreversible dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we aimed to establish an artificial lung metastasis model to examine T-lymphocyte subsets, in order to identify potential effective cell subsets for ACT.


METHODS
A metastatic lung melanoma mouse model was established using OVA-expressing melanoma B16 cells. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to examine the surface markers, transcription factors, and secreted cytokines of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells within metastatic tissues. The infiltrated cells were sorted by flow cytometry for in vitro tumor cell killing assays or in vivo cell infusion therapy combined with chemotherapeutic drugs and immune checkpoint blockade antibodies.


RESULTS
Exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex) exhibited high heterogeneity in metastatic tissues. Among Tex cells, the CXCR6- precursor cell showed certain memory characteristics, including phenotype, transcription factors, and maintenance, whereas the CXCR6+ subpopulation partially lost these traits. Moreover, CXCR6+ precursor cells effectively replenished effector-like Tex cells in metastatic tissues and exerted direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Notably, transferring these tumor-specific CXCR6+ precursor-exhausted T (Texp) cells into recipients induced a substantial regression of metastasis. In addition, these cells could respond to immune checkpoint blockade, which could better control tumor metastasis.


CONCLUSIONS
In our study, a subset of antigen-specific CXCR6-expressing Texp cells was observed within the metastatic tissue. The cells served as a crucial source of effector-like Tex cells and exerted direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. Adoptive transfer of CXCR6+ Texp cells effectively mitigated lung metastasis in mice. This study helps elucidate the role of Texp cells in metastasis, thereby offering novel insights into enhancing the efficacy and durability of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by chronic synovial inflammation affecting diarthrodial joints, with cartilage destruction and bone erosion. Environmental inflammatory stimuli can induce maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), which promote differentiation and activation of effector T lymphocytes. We previously highlighted the role of extracellular microvesicles (EMVs) in pathogenesis by carrying antigens that trigger autoantibody production. In this investigation we verified whether EMVs may activate immature monocyte-derived DCs, inducing phenotypic and functional characteristics of mature DCs. Methods EMVs were obtained from 7 RA patients naïve to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and tested for their capability to activate DCs from healthy donors. Results We preliminary confirmed by western blot that carbamylated and citrullinated proteins are present in EMVs from RA patients. Moreover, surface marker phenotyping indicated that EMV treated-DCs exhibit increased expression of CD83 and CD86, as well as of CD83+ HLA-DR+ CD80+ CD86+ cells, indicating that the DCs are in a mature state. Furthermore, biochemical data demonstrated that EMVs from plasma of RA patients induce MAPK and NF-κB activation in DCs. EMVs from the plasma of RA patients were also able to stimulate DCs to produce IL-12, IL-1β and IL-10, inducing a proinflammatory phenotype. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that EMVs from RA patients promote DC activation in vitro, suggesting a potential mechanism by which RA microenvironment perpetuates inflammation through the modulation of DC function. These knowledges provide new insight in the role of EMVs in the pathogenesis of RA and their potential role as therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Tumors employ a range of strategies to evade detection and eradication by the host’s immune system. These include downregulating antigen expression, altering antigen presentation processes, and inhibiting immune checkpoint pathways. etc. Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) represents a strategy that boosts anti-tumor immunity. This is achieved by amplifying or genetically engineering immune cells, which are either sourced from the patient or a donor, in a laboratory setting. Subsequently, these cells are reintroduced into the patient to bolster their immune response against cancer. ACT has successfully restored anti-tumor immune responses by amplifying the activity of T cells from patients or donors. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying tumor escape, including alterations in tumor cell antigens, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and modulation of immune checkpoint pathways. It further explores how ACT can avddress these factors to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, the review discusses the application of gene-editing technologies (such as CRISPR) in ACT, highlighting their potential to strengthen the anti-tumor capabilities of T cells. Looking forward, the personalized design of ACT, combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, is expected to significantly improve treatment outcomes, positioning this approach as a key strategy in the field of cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Glatiramer acetate (GA) is the first-line therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and is increasingly demonstrating promising therapeutic benefits in a range of other conditions. Despite its extensive use, the precise pharmacological mechanism of GA remains unclear. In addition to T and B cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play significant roles in the neuroinflammation associated with MS, positioning them as potential initial targets for GA. Here, we investigated GA’s influence on the differentiation of human monocytes from healthy donors into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and assessed their activation status. Our results indicate that GA treatment does not hinder the differentiation of monocytes into moDCs or macrophages. Notably, we observed a significant increase in the expression of molecules required for antigen recognition, presentation, and co-stimulation in GA-treated moDCs. Conversely, there was a significant downregulation of CD1a, which is crucial for activating auto-aggressive T cells that respond to the lipid components of myelin. Furthermore, GA treatment resulted in an increased expression of CD68 on both CD14+CD16+ and CD14+CD16− monocyte subsets. These in vitro findings suggest that GA treatment does not impede the generation of moDCs under inflammatory conditions; however, it may modify their functional characteristics in potentially beneficial ways. This provides a basis for future clinical studies in MS patients to elucidate its precise mode of action.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in extracellular vesicle (EV) research in organ transplantation have highlighted the crucial role of donor-derived EVs in triggering alloimmune responses, ultimately contributing to transplant rejection. Following transplantation, EVs carrying donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules activate recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs), initiating both alloreactive and regulatory T-cell responses. While immunosuppressive drugs are essential for preventing rejection, they may also influence the biogenesis and release of EVs from donor cells. This review examines the impact of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy on EV biogenesis and release post-transplantation. In addition, EV release and uptake may be influenced by specific factors such as the patient's end-stage organ disease and the transplant procedure itself. In-vitro studies using primary human parenchymal and immune cells—integrated with cutting-edge multi-omics techniques, including genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and single-EV analysis—will offer deeper insights into EV biology and the mechanisms by which immunosuppressive agents regulate EV-initiated immune processes. A detailed understanding of how organ failure, the transplantation procedure and immunosuppressive drugs affect the biology of EVs may uncover new roles for EVs in immune activation and regulation in patients, ultimately leading to improved immunosuppressive strategies and better transplant outcomes.">

It is demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), and IL-35. Notably, IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells and breast cancer cells. The conversion of conventional T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells, along with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. It is further demonstrated that key immune checkpoint molecules—such as PD-1, PDL1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT—are upregulated within the TME, leading to Tcell exhaustion and diminished immune responses. The blockade of these checkpoints is shown to restore T-cell functionality and is proposed as a strategy to convert cold tumors into hot ones with robust effector cell infiltration. The therapeutic potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy is also explored, and targeting specific tumor-associated antigens, such as glycoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, is highlighted. It is suggested that CART cell efficacy can be enhanced by combining these cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents, thereby overcoming the barriers imposed by the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, the role of the microbiome in regulating estrogen metabolism and systemic inflammation is reviewed. Alterations in the gut microbiota are shown to affect the TME, and microbiome-based interventions are proposed as an additional means to facilitate the cold-to-hot transition. It is concluded that by targeting the metabolic and immunological pathways that underpin immune suppression—through combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade, CART cell therapies, and microbiome modulation—the conversion of the breast TME from cold to hot can be achieved. This reprogramming is anticipated to enhance immune cell infiltration and function, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapies and leading to better clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients.

        <tr id="Background Antigen-specific immunotherapy shows potential for inducing long-term immune tolerance in type 1 diabetes (T1D), yet its clinical application is hampered by uncertainty regarding dominant epitopes. Conversely, non-antigen-specific treatments such as anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) present a more straightforward approach but struggle to maintain tolerance after treatment. Addressing these issues is critical for advancing T1D therapies. Methods The phenotypic and metabolic properties of two subsets of exhausted CD8+ T cells were analyzed in both humans and NOD mice. T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity and Bulk RNA sequencing provided insights into the transcriptomic profiles and TCR reactivity of these cells. Mechanistic studies were conducted using the HEK-293 T cell line and primary cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was applied to evaluate the characteristics of different CD8+ T cell subsets following two types of immunotherapies. In NY8.3 mice, the effect of mitochondrial fission inhibitors on immunotherapy results was evaluated. Final validation was carried out with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from T1D patients. Results Our study reveals the diversity of two distinct exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets in T1D through flow cytometry, highlighting unique clinical features, phenotypes, and functions. Notable differences in TCR reactivity and metabolic pathways between these subsets were identified through TCR sequencing and transcriptomic analyses in NOD mice. Both antigen-specific and non-antigen-specific stimuli produced unique exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets. Our research identified leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (Lrrk2) as a key regulator of mitochondrial fission, influencing the interconversion of exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets by phosphorylating dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) at serine 637 (Ser637) and serine 616 (Ser616). scRNA-seq confirmed that antigen-specific immunotherapy effectively suppresses T cell signaling, induces exhaustion, and promotes the development of terminally exhausted T (TEX) cells. Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti-CD3 mAb treatment by promoting the development of more TEX cells. Conclusions Our results point to a new immunotherapeutic approach that targets exhausted CD8+ T cells’ energy metabolism, offering valuable insights for advancing clinical strategies in T1D therapy.

        <tr id="Understanding both local and systemic immunity is essential to optimizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the dynamic alterations in systemic immunity during tumor development are yet to be clearly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized connection that bridges the interaction between the spleen and tumor through erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), which suppress tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. We performed the single-cell RNA-seq and RNA-seq to demonstrate the presence of EPCs and identify the characteristic and an immunomodulatory role of EPCs during tumor progression. These tumor-hijacked EPCs proliferate in situ in spleens and impaired systemic and local antitumor response through the interaction between tumor and spleen. Specifically, the splenic CD45- EPCs secreted heparin-binding growth factor to regulate PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression of splenic CD45+ EPCs. Educated CD45+ EPCs from the spleen then migrated to the tumors via the CCL5/CCR5 axis, thereby weakening local antitumor immunity. Consequently, targeting EPCs not only revitalized antitumor immunity but also improved the anti-PD-L1 effect by promoting intratumoral T cell infiltration. Importantly, CD45+ EPCs are associated with immunosuppression and reduced survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal the role of EPCs in orchestrating the interaction between the spleen and tumor, which could have significant implications for the development of more effective cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are immune cells belonging to the mononuclear phagocyte system. They play crucial roles in immune defense, surveillance, and homeostasis. This review systematically discusses the types of hematopoietic progenitors that give rise to macrophages, including primitive hematopoietic progenitors, erythro-myeloid progenitors, and hematopoietic stem cells. These progenitors have distinct genetic backgrounds and developmental processes. Accordingly, macrophages exhibit complex and diverse functions in the body, including phagocytosis and clearance of cellular debris, antigen presentation, and immune response, regulation of inflammation and cytokine production, tissue remodeling and repair, and multi-level regulatory signaling pathways/crosstalk involved in homeostasis and physiology. Besides, tumor-associated macrophages are a key component of the TME, exhibiting both anti-tumor and pro-tumor properties. Furthermore, the functional status of macrophages is closely linked to the development of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic conditions, and trauma. Targeting macrophages has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in these contexts. Clinical trials of macrophage-based targeted drugs, macrophage-based immunotherapies, and nanoparticle-based therapy were comprehensively summarized. Potential challenges and future directions in targeting macrophages have also been discussed. Overall, our review highlights the significance of this versatile immune cell in human health and disease, which is expected to inform future research and clinical practice.">

        <tr id="Abstract Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone cancer. Thirty to forty percent of all patients with OS develop tumor recurrence, almost exclusively in the form of lung metastasis, which is associated with a dismal 20% 5-year survival rate. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are a critical cell type within the lung tumor microenvironment that promote immune suppression, drug resistance, and tumor cell survival. Prior work shows tumor cells can co-opt fibroblasts to a protumorigenic phenotype via exosome-mediated intercellular communication. Currently, the mechanisms by which OS exosomes modulate resident lung fibroblast (LF) function have not been evaluated. To investigate this, we isolated exosomes from a panel of six OS cell lines. We assessed the uptake and response of human donor–derived primary LFs (n = 4) to OS exosome treatment in vitro via flow cytometry, confocal fluorescent microscopy, proliferation assays, phosphokinase array, multiplex cytokine analysis, and RNA sequencing. We observed that LFs efficiently take up OS exosomes, which are associated with the induction of MAPK pathway activation, fibroblast proliferation, and significantly enhanced secretion of IL-6, CXCL8, and CCL2 compared with untreated LFs. RNA sequencing of exosome-treated LFs confirmed these responses and revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to cytokine secretion, proliferation, immune cell chemotaxis, migration, proinflammatory, and profibrotic mediators. Finally, in an exosome-educated LF–OS coculture model, exosome-educated LFs conferred significantly increased OS cell survival and proliferation compared with untreated fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that the OS-derived exosomes can induce a hallmark cancer-associated fibroblast–like inflammatory phenotype in LFs, providing valuable insights into mechanisms that may promote recurrent OS lung metastasis. Significance: These findings provide a critical first step in characterizing the capacity of OS-derived exosomes to reprogram primary LFs toward a tumor-promoting inflammatory phenotype in vitro, offering novel molecular targets for the modulation of fibroblasts in the lung microenvironment as potential therapeutic strategies to prevent OS metastasis.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases are characterized by irregular immune responses that disrupt self-tolerance. This research explores the effects of the immunomodulatory drug celecoxib on the expression of immune checkpoint receptors in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Key receptors, including CTLA-4, VISTA, BTLA, PDL-1, B7H7, and LAG3, play critical roles in initiating and regulating immune responses and maintaining self-tolerance. Previous studies have highlighted the significance of immune checkpoints in preventing autoimmune conditions, with animal research supporting their effectiveness in immunotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that the upregulation of immune checkpoint receptors can enhance the inhibitory functions of DCs, thereby promoting self-tolerance. As a result, tolerogenic DCs present a promising therapeutic avenue for treating autoimmune diseases. Although these results are promising, further trials are required to validate this approach before it can be applied clinically. This study underscores the potential of targeting immune checkpoint receptors as a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune disorders.">

        <tr id="The human T-cell leukemia type-1 (HTLV-1) retrovirus establishes chronic life-long infection in a fraction of infected individuals associated with severe pathological conditions. Although the mechanism driving disease development is not fully understood, current evidence indicates the essential functions of viral regulatory proteins. Among these, the p13 protein has previously been shown to localize to the inner mitochondrial membrane in T cells, altering mitochondrial biology and T-cell function. While CD4+ T cells are the primary cell target of HTLV-1 infection, genomic viral DNA has also been detected in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which orchestrate innate and adaptive immunity and play a critical role in protecting against virus-induce diseases by establishing the appropriate balance of pro and anti-inflammatory responses. Given the central role of mitochondria in monocyte differentiation, we investigated the effect of p13 in monocytes/macrophages and found that by localizing to mitochondria, p13 affects mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, we demonstrate that p13 expression affects macrophage polarization to favor the recruitment of CD4+ T cells, the primary target of the virus, potentially facilitating the spread of viral infection and the development of disease.">

        <tr id="Background Macrophages, polarized into pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 states, are essential cellular elements of innate immunity. In the tumor microenvironment, owing to a paracrine manipulative program by cancerous cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) evolve, which can shift between M1-like and M2-like phenotypes. Since it is fairly unknown how the promising anticancer agents, silver (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) affect the bidirectional communication and reprogramming in the tumor stroma, we examined the behavior, the tumor-supporting functions, and the expression of polarization and functional marker genes of TAMs to reveal how these are modulated upon interaction with nanoparticle-exposed cancer cells. Methods We established co-cultures of murine immortalized J774 or primary bone marrow-derived macrophages with 4T1 breast cancer cells treated with AuNPs or AgNPs or with none of the nanoparticles. We assessed the expression of macrophage polarization and functional markers using RT-qPCR and Proteome Profiler Array and evaluated macrophage migration and matrix metalloproteinase activity by specific assays. Results Protein and mRNA levels of most examined factors – except tumor necrosis factor-alpha – such as C-C-motif chemokine ligands 2 and 22, interleukin-23, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, the macrophage mannose receptor CD206, transforming growth factor-beta, and chitinase-like-3 protein decreased, and the expression of polarization markers revealed a shift towards M1-like phenotype in macrophages co-cultured with AgNP- or AuNP-treated 4T1 cells. Both nanoparticle treatments reduced the levels and activity of cell migration-related factors, such as C-C motif chemokine ligand 3, matrix metalloproteinases, and suppressed macrophage migration. Conclusion Both AuNPs and AgNPs showed a remarkable ability to influence macrophage-cancer cell communication, suppressed indirectly M2-like TAM polarization, and perturbed the migration behavior of TAMs that is critical for tumor invasion, indicating modulated immunological functions and debilitated cancer-promoting capabilities of TAMs in this microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Disrupted cellular polarity (DCP) is a hallmark of solid cancer, the malignant disease of epithelial tissues, which occupies ~90% of all human cancers. DCP has been identified to affect not only the cancer cell’s aggressive behavior but also the migration and infiltration of immune cells, although the precise mechanism of DCP-affected tumor-immune cell interaction remains unclear. This review discusses immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) caused by DCP-driven tumor cell proliferation with DCP-impaired immune cell functions. We will revisit the fundamental roles of cell polarity (CP) proteins in sustaining mammary luminal homeostasis, epithelial transformation, and breast cancer progression. Then, the current data on CP involvement in immune cell activation, maturation, migration, and tumor infiltration are evaluated. The CP status on the immune effector cells and their targeted tumor cells are highlighted in tumor immune regulation, including the antigen presentation and the formation of immune synapses (IS). CP-regulated antigen presentation and delivery and the formation of IS between the immune cells, especially between the immune effectors and tumor cells, will be addressed. Alterations of CP on the tumor cells, infiltrated immune effector cells, or both are discussed with these aspects. We conclude that CP-mediated tumor aggressiveness coupled with DCP-impaired immune cell disability may decide the degree of immunosuppressive status and responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Further elucidating the dynamics of CP- or DCP-mediated immune regulation in TME will provide more critical insights into tumor-immune cell dynamics, which is required to invent more effective approaches for cancer immunotherapy.">

 Manipulating CD28 co-stimulation is a key element of anti-tumour immune responses and treating autoimmune diseases. CD28 can reduce the T cell activation threshold but has a complex relationship with TCR signalling and an unclear role in specific T cell subsets. Using a series of in vitro stimulation assays, we have studied the relative contribution of CD28 and TCR signals in human CD4+ T cell responses. We show that not only the quantity of CD28 co-stimulation, but also its intensity relative to TCR differentially impacts division of Naïve and Memory T cells. We show that CD28 co-stimulation can have TCR independent effects on Memory T cell phenotype and cytokine production and in some settings can antagonise TCR-driven functions. These data highlight the complex relationship between CD28 co-stimulation and TCR signals and expose clear differences in their use by Naïve and Memory T cells.">

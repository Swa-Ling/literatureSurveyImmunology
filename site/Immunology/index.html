        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="For triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subset of breast cancer, immune cell infiltrates have prognostic implications. The presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells supports tumor progression, while tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) correlate with improved survival and responsiveness to immunotherapy. Manipulating the abundance of these populations may enhance tumor immunity. Gemcitabine (GEM), a clinically employed chemotherapeutic, is reported to be systemically myeloablative, and thus it is a potentially useful adjunct therapy for promoting anti-tumor immunity. However, knowledge about the immunological effects of GEM intratumorally is limited. Thus, we directly compared the impact of systemic GEM on immune cell presence and functionality in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to its effects in the periphery. We found that GEM is not myeloablative in the TME; rather, we observed sustained, significant reductions in TILs and dendritic cells—crucial components in initiating an adaptive immune response. We also performed bulk-RNA sequencing to identify immunological alterations transcriptionally induced by GEM. While we found evidence of upregulation in the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) response pathway, we determined that GEM-mediated growth control is not dependent on IFN-γ. Overall, our findings yield new insights into the tissue- and temporal-dependent immune ablative effects of GEM, contrasting the paradigm that this therapy is specifically myeloablative.">

        <tr id="Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has shown promise in colorectal cancer patients with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), response rates remain low for the majority of patients. Key challenges include the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells and the presence of immunosuppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment. By integrating digital spatial profiling and scRNA sequencing, we found that the tumor-intrinsic activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was strongly correlated with the heterogeneity and exhaustion of CD8+ T cells within the spatial context of the tumor microenvironment and correlated with patient survival. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic loss of FAK enhanced antitumor immune responses and synergistically potentiated αPD-1 and αTIM-3 immunotherapy by augmenting CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and restoring exhaustion in preclinical models of colorectal cancer. Mechanistically, nuclear FAK was found to regulate SP1/IL-6-mediated T cell exhaustion and the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. These findings underscore FAK’s pivotal role in CD8+ T cell exhaustion within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, suggesting that FAK is a promising target for advancing cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The adjuvant AS01 plays a key role in the immunogenicity of several approved human vaccines with demonstrated high efficacy. Its adjuvant effect relies on activation of the innate immune system. However, specific effects of AS01-adjuvanted vaccines on innate cell function and epigenetic remodeling, as described for Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and influenza vaccines, are still unknown. We assessed the long-term functional and epigenetic changes in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells induced by a model vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen and AS01 in healthy adults (NCT01777295). The AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, but not an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine, increased the number of circulating monocytes and their expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–DR, which correlated with the magnitude of the memory CD4+ T cell response. Single-cell analyses revealed epigenetic alterations in monocyte and dendritic cell subsets, affecting accessibility of transcription factors involved in cell functions including activator protein-1 (AP-1), GATA, C/EBP, and interferon regulatory factor. The functional changes were characterized by a reduced proinflammatory response to Toll-like receptor activation and an improved response to interferon-γ, a cytokine critical for the adjuvant’s mode of action. Epigenetic changes were most evident shortly after the second vaccine dose in CD14+ monocytes, for which accessibility differences of some transcription factors could persist for up to 6 months postvaccination. Together, we show that reprogramming of monocyte subsets occurs after vaccination with an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, an effect that may contribute to the impact of vaccination beyond antigen-specific protection. An AS01-adjuvanted vaccine for hepatitis B virus modifies the epigenetic landscape of monocytes isolated from clinical study participants. Editor’s summary Most vaccines based on recombinant antigens rely on coadministration with an adjuvant to elicit a robust immune response. Although adjuvants are needed for many vaccines, it is less clear which adjuvant(s) should be paired with each immunogen. In two papers, Bechtold et al. and Arunachalam et al. performed comparative analyses to assess the effect of different adjuvants on the immune response. Bechtold et al. showed that an AS01-adjuvanted hepatitis B virus vaccine, which induces robust CD4+ T cell responses against the vaccine antigen, also elicited trained immunity in human recipients, which was not observed in an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine. Arunachalam et al. found that Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum adjuvantation induced robust immune responses to the R21 malaria vaccine in nonhuman primates, but a third comparator, GLA-LSQ, elicited a lower magnitude of response that was short lived. Although Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum induced robust and durable antibody responses, they elicited distinct innate immune responses, demonstrating that multiple innate immune mechanisms can program durable vaccine-induced immunity. These head-to-head comparisons in both humans and nonhuman primates demonstrate that selecting an adjuvant should be done carefully and that different adjuvants have distinct effects on both innate and adaptive immunity. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections such as influenza A virus. This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.">

        <tr id="Yellow fever vaccination provides long-lasting protection and is a unique model for studying the immune response to an acute RNA virus infection in humans. To elucidate the early innate immune events preceding the rapid generation of protective immunity, we performed transcriptome analysis of human blood dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte subpopulations before and 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after vaccination. We detected temporary upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in all DC and monocyte subsets on day 3 and 7 after vaccination as well as cell type specific responses and temporal dynamics. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed rapid appearance of activated DC and monocyte clusters dominated by ISGs, inflammatory chemokines and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation. This was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in a large cohort of vaccinees. We identified SIGLEC1/CD169 upregulation as a sensitive indicator of the transient IFN-induced activation state elicited in DCs and monocytes by YF17D vaccination correlating with early protective IgM antibody responses.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.">

        <tr id="Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus. Previous studies have shown antibody Fc effector functions are critical for optimal monoclonal antibody-mediated protection against alphaviruses; however, the requirement of Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) for protection during natural infection has not been evaluated. Here, we showed mice lacking activating FcγRs (FcRγ-/-) developed prolonged clinical disease with more virus in joint-associated tissues. Viral clearance was associated with anti-MAYV cell surface binding rather than neutralizing antibodies. Lack of Fc-FcγR engagement increased the number of monocytes through chronic timepoints. Single cell RNA sequencing showed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes in joint-associated tissue with increased MAYV RNA present in FcRγ-/- monocytes and macrophages. Transfer of FcRγ-/- monocytes into wild type animals was sufficient to increase virus in joint-associated tissue. Overall, this study suggests that engagement of antibody Fc with activating FcγRs promotes protective responses during MAYV infection and prevents monocytes from being potential targets of infection.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) presented clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Lack of ICI efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells that create the “cold” tumor microenvironment (TME) impeding infiltration and activation of effector T cells. We developed a designer RGD peptide that hindered glioma-instigated, integrin-mediated pro-tumoral reprogramming of myeloid cells and blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in co-cultures in vitro. Intratumorally-delivered RGD alone did not reduce glioma growth in syngeneic mice but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and led to peritumoral blood vessels normalization. Furthermore, combining RGD with immunotherapy using PD-1 blockade reduced tumor growth, led to upsurge of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depleted regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, consistently with the restored “hot” inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. RGD modified the phenotypes of myeloid cells in human gliomas in nude mice. Thus, combining the integrin blockade with ICI reinvigorates antitumor immunity and paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.">

        <tr id="Type 1 immunity mediates host defense through pathogen elimination, but whether this pathway also impacts tissue function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that rapid induction of IFNγ signaling coordinates a multi-cellular response that is critical to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility following infection of mice with a tissue-invasive helminth. IFNγ production is initiated by antigen-independent activation of lamina propria CD8+ T cells following MyD88-dependent recognition of the microbiota during helminth-induced barrier invasion. IFNγ acted directly on intestinal stromal cells to recruit neutrophils that limited parasite-induced tissue injury. IFNγ sensing also limited the expansion of smooth muscle actin-expressing cells to prevent pathological gut dysmotility. Importantly, this tissue-protective response had limited impact on parasite burden, indicating that IFNγ supports a disease tolerance defense strategy. Our results have important implications for managing the pathophysiological sequelae of post-infectious gut dysfunction and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with stromal remodelling. HIGHLIGHTS Type 1 immunity is required for disease tolerance to tissue-invasive infection. Gut-resident CD8+ T cells produce IFNγ in an antigen-independent, yet microbiota-dependent manner. IFNγ signaling recruits neutrophils in a cell-extrinsic manner to limit helminth-induced tissue injury. Direct sensing of IFNγ by intestinal stroma is essential to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility during infection.">

The gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a critical determinant of immune function and response to cancer immunotherapy, with multiple studies demonstrating association of microbiota composition with clinical response10–16. However, a mechanistic understanding of how gut commensal bacteria influence the efficacy of ICB remains elusive. Here we utilized a gut commensal microorganism, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induces an antigen-specific Th17 cell effector program17, to investigate how colonization with it affects the efficacy of ICB in restraining distal growth of tumors sharing antigen with SFB. We find that anti-PD-1 treatment effectively inhibits the growth of implanted SFB antigen-expressing melanoma only if mice are colonized with SFB. Through T cell receptor clonal lineage tracing, fate mapping, and peptide-MHC tetramer staining, we identify tumor-associated SFB-specific Th1-like cells derived from the homeostatic Th17 cells induced by SFB colonization in the small intestine lamina propria. These gut-educated ex-Th17 cells produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, and promote expansion and effector functions of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby controlling tumor growth. A better understanding of how distinct intestinal commensal microbes can promote T cell plasticity-dependent responses against antigen-sharing tumors may allow for the design of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Aims/hypothesis Immunotherapeutics targeting T cells are crucial for inhibiting autoimmune disease progression proximal to disease onset in type 1 diabetes. A growing number of T cell-directed therapeutics have demonstrated partial therapeutic efficacy, with anti-CD3 (α-CD3) representing the only regulatory agency-approved drug capable of slowing disease progression through a mechanism involving the induction of partial T cell exhaustion. There is an outstanding need to augment the durability and effectiveness of T cell targeting by directly restraining proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 1 cytotoxic CD8+ T cell (Tc1) subsets, while simultaneously augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Here, we present a novel strategy for reducing diabetes incidence in the NOD mouse model using a blocking monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 diabetes-risk associated T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD226. Methods Female NOD mice were treated with anti-CD226 between 7-8 weeks of age and then monitored for diabetes incidence and therapeutic mechanism of action. Results Compared to isotype-treated controls, anti-CD226 treated NOD mice showed reduced insulitis severity at 12 weeks and decreased disease incidence at 30 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis performed five weeks post-treatment demonstrated reduced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells in spleens of anti-CD226 treated mice. Phenotyping of pancreatic Tregs revealed increased CD25 expression and STAT5 phosphorylation following anti-CD226, with splenic Tregs displaying augmented suppression of CD4+ T cell responders in vitro. Anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited reduced frequencies of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein (IGRP)-reactive CD8+ T cells in the pancreas, using both ex vivo tetramer staining and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) approaches. 51Cr-release assays demonstrated reduced cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells by anti-CD226-treated autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Conclusions/interpretation CD226 blockade reduces T cell cytotoxicity and improves Treg function, representing a targeted and rational approach for restoring immune regulation in type 1 diabetes. Research in Context What is already known about this subject? The co-stimulatory receptor CD226 is upregulated upon activation and is highly expressed on NK cell subsets, myeloid cells, and effector T cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism in CD226 (rs763361; C>T) results in a Gly307Ser missense mutation linked to genetic susceptibility for type 1 diabetes. Global knockout of Cd226 and conditional Cd226 knockout in FoxP3+ Tregs reduced insulitis severity and diabetes incidence in NOD mice, indicating a crucial role for CD226 in disease pathogenesis. What is the key question? Can CD226 blockade reduce T cell cytotoxicity and improve Treg function to diminish diabetes incidence in NOD mice? What are the new findings? Anti-CD226 treatment reduced insulitis, decreased disease incidence, and inhibited splenic CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cell proliferation. Pancreatic Tregs from anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited increased CD25 expression; splenic Tregs displayed augmented STAT5 phosphorylation and suppressive capacity in vitro. Anti-CD226 treatment reduced IGRP-specific pancreatic CD8+ T cell frequencies, and reduced autoreactive CD8+ T cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells in vitro. How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? CD226 blockade could reduce autoreactive T cell cytotoxicity, enhance Treg function, and slow disease progression in high-risk or recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases.">

        <tr id="Epithelial and immune cells have long been appreciated for their contribution to the early immune response after injury; however, much less is known about the role of mesenchymal cells. Using single nuclei RNA-sequencing, we defined changes in gene expression associated with inflammation at 1-day post-wounding (dpw) in mouse skin. Compared to keratinocytes and myeloid cells, we detected enriched expression of pro-inflammatory genes in fibroblasts associated with deeper layers of the skin. In particular, SCA1+ fibroblasts were enriched for numerous chemokines, including CCL2, CCL7, and IL33 compared to SCA1-fibroblasts. Genetic deletion of Ccl2 in fibroblasts resulted in fewer wound bed macrophages and monocytes during injury-induced inflammation with reduced revascularization and re-epithelialization during the proliferation phase of healing. These findings highlight the important contribution of deep skin fibroblast-derived factors to injury-induced inflammation and the impact of immune cell dysregulation on subsequent tissue repair.">

        <tr id="Disease tolerance is an evolutionarily conserved host defence strategy that preserves tissue integrity and physiology without affecting pathogen load. Unlike host resistance, the mechanisms underlying disease tolerance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether an adjuvant (β-glucan) can reprogram innate immunity to provide protection against Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here we observe that β-glucan treatment reduced the morbidity and mortality against IAV infection, independent of host resistance (viral load). Increased survival of β-glucan treated mice against IAV is associated with the accumulation of neutrophils via RoRγt+ T cells in the lung tissue. Using gain-and-loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that β- glucan reprogrammed neutrophils are essential for promoting disease tolerance, limiting pulmonary tissue damage, and enhancing survival against IAV infection. β-glucan treatment promotes granulopoiesis in a type 1 interferon-dependent manner that leads to the generation of a unique subset of neutrophils, which are less mature with higher mitochondrial mass utilizing mitochondrial oxidative (OXPHOS) metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that β-glucan reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate neutrophils with a novel “regulatory” function, which is required for promoting disease tolerance and maintaining lung tissue integrity against viral infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Cancer immunotherapy has been regarded as a promising strategy for cancer therapy by blocking immune checkpoints and evoking immunity to fight cancer, but its efficacy seems to be heterogeneous among patients. Manipulating the gut microbiota is a potential strategy for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Here, we report that MS-20, also known as “Symbiota®”, a postbiotic that comprises abundant microbial metabolites generated from a soybean-based medium fermented with multiple strains of probiotics and yeast, inhibited colon and lung cancer growth in combination with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) antibody in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, MS-20 remodeled the immunological tumor microenvironment by increasing effector CD8+ T cells and downregulating PD1 expression, which were mediated by the gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from mice receiving MS-20 treatment to recipient mice increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment and significantly improved antitumor activity when combined with anti-PD1 therapy. Notably, the abundance of Ruminococcus bromii, which increased following MS-20 treatment, was positively associated with a reduced tumor burden and CD8+ T-cell infiltration in vivo. Furthermore, an ex vivo study revealed that MS-20 could alter the composition of the microbiota in cancer patients, resulting in distinct metabolic pathways associated with favorable responses to immunotherapy. Overall, MS-20 could act as a promising adjuvant agent for enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint-mediated antitumor therapy.">

        <tr id="Memory T cells are a highly dynamic and heterogeneous population that is maintained by cytokine-driven homeostatic proliferation interspersed with episodes of antigen-mediated expansion and contraction which affect their functional state and their durability. This heterogeneity complicates studies on the impact of aging on global human memory cells, specifically, it is unclear how aging drives memory T cell dysfunction. Here, we used chronic infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to assess the influence of age on memory states at the level of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. We find that in young adults (<40 years), EBV-specific CD8+ T cells assume preferred differentiation states depending on their peptide specificity. By age >65-years, different T cell specificities had undergone largely distinct aging trajectories, which had in common a loss in adaptive and a gain in innate immunity signatures. No evidence was seen for cellular senescence or exhaustion. While naïve/stem-like EBV-specific T cells disappeared with age, T cell diversity of EBV-specific memory cells did not change or even increased. In summary, by controlling for antigen specificity we uncover age-associated shifts in gene expression and TCR diversity that have implications for optimizing vaccination strategies and adoptive T cell therapy.">

Using these transcriptional signatures, we identify T cell-dependent outcomes associated with inflammatory skin disease, including a set of Th17 cell-induced genes in keratinocytes that are enriched in the skin during psoriasis and normalized by anti-IL-17 therapy, and a skin-resident T cell-induced gene module enriched in scleroderma-associated fibroblasts.

The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who will progress to severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. In patients with overweight/obesity these signatures are exacerbated compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic capacity compared to non-SD. Furthermore, type-I Interferon signalling is downregulated in SD, suggesting defective virus-sensing mechanisms may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional “professional killer” T/NK-cells underpin dengue pathogenesis. Our findings pave the way for the evaluation of immunomodulatory therapies for dengue.">

        <tr id="Tumor cell–originated events prevent efficient antitumor immune response and limit the application of anti-PD1 checkpoint immunotherapy. We show that syndecan-1 (SDC1) has a critical role in the regulation of T cell–mediated control of tumor growth. SDC1 inhibition increases the permeation of CD8+ T cells into tumors and triggers CD8+ T cell–mediated control of tumor growth, accompanied by increased proportions of progenitor-exhausted and effector-like CD8+ T cells. SDC1 deficiency alters multiple signaling events in tumor cells, including enhanced IFN-γ–STAT1 signaling, and augments antigen presentation and sensitivity to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Combinatory inhibition of SDC1 markedly potentiates the therapeutic effects of anti-PD1 in inhibiting tumor growth. Consistently, the findings are supported by the data from human tumors showing that SDC1 expression negatively correlates with T cell presence in tumor tissues and the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our findings suggest that SDC1 inhibits antitumor immunity, and that targeting SDC1 may promote anti-PD1 response for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Acquired resistance is a growing obstacle to durable responses after cancer immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The mechanisms by which heterogeneous tumors evolve under immunotherapy pressure and strategies targeting key populations to prevent relapse are poorly understood. We show that chronic interferon (IFN) enables a subpopulation of cancer cells to acquire inflammatory memory and express memory ISGs, a subset of IFN-stimulated genes enriched for immune evasion properties, leading to subclonal epigenetic evolution of ICB-resistant states. Inflammatory memory is epigenetically encoded through chronic virus mimicry – feedforward MDA5 signaling likely activated by endogenous retroelements. While JAK inhibitors can improve ICB response, combining them with TBK1 inhibitors collapses this feedforward mechanism, erasing inflammatory memory and preventing differentiation into resistance states. Across human cancers, small subpopulations of memory ISG-expressing cells are prevalent and coupled to T cell exhaustion, suggesting inflammatory memory may be a common mechanism of acquired resistance targetable by JAK plus TBK1 inhibition.">

Matched pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from the same lesion were obtained. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and custom multiplex staining to leverage the unique advantage of same-lesion longitudinal sampling. Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased CLEC9A+ dendritic cell and CLEC7A/SYK expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8+ T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13+CD8+ T- cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients.

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) are essential for regional immunity in non-lymphoid tissues. Although single-cell transcriptomics have revealed Trm heterogeneity in various diseases, the molecular mechanisms behind this diversity are unclear. To investigate this, we used Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection, which persists in the central nervous system (CNS) and is controlled by brain CD8+ Trm. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of brain CD8+ T cells from T. gondii-infected mice showed heterogeneous expression of the transcriptional regulator Id2, correlating with different functional states. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we found that Id2-deficiency in T cells caused parasite-specific Trm to develop an altered phenotype with diminished effector functions and reduced expression of CD49a. Furthermore, loss of Id2 in brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells led to the accumulation of exhausted PD1+Tox+CD8+ Trm cells, while Id2 overexpression repressed T cell exhaustion. Overall, our study shows that Id2 levels dictate the acquisition of effector vs. exhausted phenotypes in CD8+ Trm during chronic CNS infection.

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Dysregulated T-cell immune response-mediated inflammation plays critical roles in the pathology of diverse liver diseases, but the underlying mechanism of liver immune homeostasis control and the specific therapies for limiting T-cell overactivation remain unclear. Methods: The metabolic changes in concanavalin A (ConA) mice and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) patients and their associations with liver injury were analyzed. The expression of purine catabolism nucleases (e.g., CD39 and CD73) on liver cells and immune cells was assessed. The effects of MCregs and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and the underlying mechanism were also explored. Results: Our findings revealed significant alterations in purine metabolism in ConA mice and AIH patients, which correlated with liver injury severity and therapeutic response. CD39 and CD73 were markedly upregulated on CD11b+Gr-1+ MCs under liver injury conditions. The naturally expanded CD39+CD73+Gr-1highCD11b+ MCreg subset during early liver injury effectively suppressed CD4+ T-cell hyperactivation and liver injury both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MCregs released CD73high EVs, which converted extracellular AMP to immunosuppressive metabolites (e.g., adenosine and inosine), activating the cAMP pathway and inhibiting glycolysis and cytokine secretion in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the mechanism controlling immune homeostasis during the early liver injury phase and highlights that MCreg or MCreg-EV therapy may be a specific strategy for preventing diverse liver diseases induced by T-cell overactivation.">

While infections robustly elicit both types of immunity, currently approved vaccine adjuvants largely fail to induce T cell responses on par with that instigated by infections. Our goal was to investigate the transcriptional programming that supports the formation of CD8+ T cells elicited by subunit vaccines compared to those elicited by infections. Our data show that vaccine-elicited T cells represent a transcriptionally unique subset of activated T cells with high proliferative capacity and a memory cell fate. This relies on IL-27 signaling, which stabilizes c-Myc and thereby supports the biomass acquisition necessary for clonal expansion. Collectively, our findings reveal that subunit vaccine-elicited T cells uniquely combine aspects of both memory and effector T cell subsets, and selectively utilize IL-27 signaling to sustain the clonal expansion of cells dedicated to a memory fate. One Sentence Summary In contrast to infection, subunit vaccines induce a distinct population of CD8+ T cells with memory fate characteristics which maintain their proliferative capacity during the expansion phase through IL-27 receptor signaling.">

We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract A comprehensive immune landscape for Brucella infection is crucial for developing new treatments for brucellosis. Here, we utilized single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) of 290,369 cells from 35 individuals, including 29 brucellosis patients from acute (n = 10), sub‐acute (n = 9), and chronic (n = 10) phases as well as six healthy donors. Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays were applied for validation within this cohort. Brucella infection caused a significant change in the composition of peripheral immune cells and inflammation was a key feature of brucellosis. Acute patients are characterized by potential cytokine storms resulting from systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, primarily due to classical monocytes. Cytokine storm may be mediated by activating S100A8/A9‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway. Moreover, monocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells were the probable contributors to immune paralysis in acute patients. Chronic patients are characterized by a dysregulated Th1 response, marked by reduced expression of IFN‐γ and Th1 signatures as well as a high exhausted state. Additionally, Brucella infection can suppress apoptosis in myeloid cells (e.g., mDCs, classical monocytes), inhibit antigen presentation in professional antigen‐presenting cells (APCs; e.g., mDC) and nonprofessional APCs (e.g., monocytes), and induce exhaustion in CD8+ T/NK cells, potentially resulting in the establishment of chronic infection. Overall, our study systemically deciphered the coordinated immune responses of Brucella at different phases of the infection, which facilitated a full understanding of the immunopathogenesis of brucellosis and may aid the development of new effective therapeutic strategies, especially for those with chronic infection.">

        <tr id="Soil-transmitted helminths are one of the most common infections across the world, yet how to promote an effective humoral response to helminths is not well understood. To ensure the most effective response, molecular programs underpin the specialization of antibody effector subtype to microenvironmental signals. Here, we identify the methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) as a key target to promote IgA-driven responses. Mll1 was increased in germinal center (GC) B cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues, and the absence of MLL1 in mature B cells led to significant reductions in GCs, IgG1 and IgE in response to the helminth Trichuris muris. Yet, worm expulsion occurred more rapidly in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice compared to control mice in the first two weeks of infection. Accelerated worm clearance correlated with significantly elevated IgA+ plasma cells (PC), serum IgA and fecal IgA in in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice. Stimulation of B cells in vitro confirmed that Mll1-deficiency accelerated the formation of IgA+ PC and that this effect was B cell-intrinsic. CCR9 was identified as a key MLL1-regulated molecule by RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry. Correspondingly, Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice infected with either T. muris or the bacterium C. rodentium significant increased IgA+CCR9+ PC localized in the large intestine. This tailoring of the B cell response to promote IgA-secreting PC correlated to a healthier microbiome in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice, compared to control mice. Thus, this study reveals MLL1 as a key target to tailor B cell responses to helminth infections, which may aid the development of effective mucosal vaccines or new targeted treatments. Significance statement Diseases caused by infections, such as soil-transmitted helminth infections or bacterial infections, continue to pose a major human health problem worldwide. One key reason why soil-transmitted helminths continue to cause long-term health and economic burdens is the lack of an effective vaccine for human use. Antibody responses underpin most successful vaccine designs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how B cell responses are regulated to produce tailored antibody to different pathogens is critical for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines. This study uncovered MLL1 as a novel therapeutic target to promote IgA-producing plasma cells, opening new avenues of investigation into how effective and tailored antibody responses may be produced in response to bacterial or helminth infection.">

In a study of a perforin-deficient mouse model of HLH with a viral trigger, we aimed to determine if CD8+ T cell behaviour could be modulated by targeted interleukin (IL)-2 treatment. We observed a paradoxical benefit that contrasted with IL-2’s typical role in boosting T cell activity: targeted IL-2 delivery to CD8+ T cells led to reduced hyperinflammation and disease severity. Our results demonstrated that IL-2 induced exhaustion in overactive CD8+ T cells, thus mitigating hyperinflammation.

        <tr id="Human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) derived from the tracheo-bronchial regions of human airways provide an excellent in vitro model for studying pathological mechanisms and evaluating therapeutics in human airway cells. This cell population comprises a mixed population of basal cells (BCs), the predominant stem cell in airways capable of both self-renewal and functional differentiation. Despite their potential for regenerative medicine, BCs exhibit significant phenotypic variability in culture. To investigate how culture conditions influence BC phenotype and function, we expanded three independent BC isolates in three media, airway epithelial cell growth medium (AECGM), dual-SMAD inhibitor (DSI)-enriched AECGM, and Pneumacult Ex plus (PEx+). Extensive RNA sequencing, immune assays and electrical measurements revealed that PEx+ media significantly drove cell proliferation and a broad pro-inflammatory phenotype in BCs. In contrast, BCs expanded in AECGM, displayed increased expression of structural and extracellular matrix components at high passage. Whereas culture in AECGM increased expression of some cytokines at high passage, DSI suppressed inflammation altogether thus implicating TGF-β in BC inflammatory processes. Differentiation capacity declined with time in culture irrespective of expansion media except for PLUNC expressing secretory cells that were elevated at high passage in AECGM and PEx+ suggestive of an immune modulatory role of PLUNC in BCs. These findings underscore the profound impact of media conditions on inflammatory niche and function of in vitro expanded BCs. The broad pro-inflammatory phenotype driven by PEx+ media, in particular, should be considered in the development of cell-based models for airway diseases and therapeutic application. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Airway basal cells, vital for airway regeneration and potential therapies, show significant changes based on culture conditions. Our study reveals that media composition and culture duration greatly affect basal cell properties with profound changes in the pro-inflammatory phenotype and extracellular matrix deposition driven by changes in growth conditions. These results underscore the critical impact of culture conditions on BC phenotype, influencing cell-based models for airway disease research and therapy.">

        <tr id="The successful development of germinal centers (GC) relies heavily on innate mechanisms to amplify the initial inflammatory cascade. In addition to their role in antigen presentation, innate cells are essential for the redirection of circulating lymphocytes toward the draining lymph node (dLN) to maximize antigen surveillance. Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) and its receptors (S1PR1-5) affect various aspects of immunity; however, the role of S1PR4 in regulating an immune response is not well understood. Here we use a footpad model of localized TH1 inflammation to carefully monitor changes in leukocyte populations within the blood, the immunized tissue, and the dLN. Within hours of immunization, neutrophils failed to adequately mobilize and infiltrate into the footpad tissue of S1PR4-/- mice, thereby diminishing the local vascular changes thought to be necessary for redirecting circulating cells toward the inflamed region. Neutrophil depletion with anti-Ly6G antibodies significantly reduced early tissue edema as well as the redirection and initial accumulation of naïve lymphocytes in dLN of WT mice, while the effects were less prominent or absent in S1PR4-/- dLN. Adoptive transfer experiments further demonstrated that the lymphocyte homing deficiencies in vivo were not intrinsic to the donor S1PR4-/- lymphocytes, but were instead attributed to differences within the S1PR4-deficient host. Reduced cell recruitment in S1PR4-/- mice would seed the dLN with fewer antigen-respondent lymphocytes and indeed, dLN hypertrophy at the peak of the immune response was severely diminished, with attenuated GC and activation pathways in these mice. Histological examination of the S1PR4-/- dLN also revealed an underdeveloped vascular network with reduced expression of the leukocyte tethering ligand, PNAd, within high endothelial venule regions, suggesting inadequate growth of the dLN meant to support a robust GC response. Thus, our study reveals that S1PR4 may link early immune modulation by neutrophils to the initial recruitment of circulating lymphocytes and downstream expansion and maturation of the dLN, thereby contributing to optimal GC development during an adaptive response.">

        <tr id="Type I and III interferons (IFNs) are robustly induced during infections and protect cells against viral infection. Both type I and III IFNs are also produced at low levels in the thymus at steady state; however, their role in T cell development and immune tolerance is unclear. Here, we found that both type I and III IFNs were constitutively produced by a very small number of AIRE+ murine thymic epithelial cells, independent of microbial stimulation. Antigen-presenting cells were highly responsive to thymic IFNs, and IFNs were required for the activation and maturation of thymic type 1 conventional dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Loss of IFN sensing led to reduced regulatory T cell selection, reduced T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity, and enhanced autoreactive T cell responses to self-antigens expressed during peripheral IFN signaling. Thus, constitutive exposure to IFNs in the thymus is required for generating a tolerant and diverse TCR repertoire. IFN shapes the thymic microenvironment by promoting distinct APC responses and is required for selection of a diverse, self-tolerant TCR repertoire. Editor’s summary Induction of type I and III interferons (IFNs) is critical for antimicrobial innate immune responses, but IFNs are also constitutively produced at low levels in the absence of infection. Using IFN reporter mice and mice lacking various IFN receptors, Ashby et al. investigated the function of type I and III IFNs produced in the thymus during homeostasis. Sterile IFNs were produced by a subset of AIRE+ medullary thymic epithelial cells, with sensing of type III IFN required for the maturation of thymic antigen-presenting cells. Loss of IFN sensing reduced T cell repertoire diversity and impaired central tolerance to inflammation-associated self-antigens, highlighting the importance of sterile thymic IFN production in generating a self-tolerant TCR repertoire. —Claire Olingy and Hannah Isles">

However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

Here we report that the immune receptor CD300e is highly expressed by TAM in colorectal (CRC) and drives their immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic, correlating with reduced expression of MHC-II molecules, essential for antigen presentation. In vitro, CD300e-deficient macrophages exhibit enhanced pro-inflammatory activity and phagocytic capacity, coupled with reduced efferocytosis, suggesting a critical role for CD300e in promoting tumor progression. The depletion of CD300e, in vivo, results in a reduced tumor burden and enhanced survival in CRC mouse models, accompanied by a more robust anti-tumor immune response characterized by increased infiltration of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ. Our study provides comprehensive insights into the roles of CD300e in myeloid cells in CRC, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for reprogramming TAMs to support anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

B cells play a central role in this process, contributing to cytokine production, defective regulatory functions, and abnormal immunoglobulin production, even in the central nervous system. Anti-CD20 (aCD20) therapies, which deplete CD20+ B cells, are largely used in the treatment of both relapsing remitting (RR) and progressive (PR) forms of MS. Although effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+ B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+ T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+ CD4+ T cells and a high proportion of Ag+ CD8+ T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The interleukin (IL)-1-family receptor antagonist IL-38 has emerged as a negative regulator of auto-inflammation. Given the intricate interplay between antitumor immunity and auto-inflammation, we hypothesized that blocking IL-38 may enhance tumor immune control. Methods Our hypothesis was tested in the transgenic polyoma virus middle T oncoprotein mammary carcinoma model that is suitable for identifying strong immunomodulators. To investigate the effect of acute IL-38 blockade, we used a neutralizing antibody, alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Immune cell composition and location in tumors were determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The role of γδ T cells was studied using an antibody blocking γδ T-cell receptor signaling. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing and RNA expression analysis were employed to determine mechanisms downstream of IL-38 neutralization. Additionally, in vitro assays with γδ T cells, CD8+ T cells and cDC1, followed by in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion, were performed to study the underlying mechanistic pathways. Results Both, genetic ablation of IL-38 and neutralization with the antibody, reduced tumorigenesis, and IL-38 blockade improved chemotherapy efficacy. This was accompanied by an augmented lymphocyte infiltrate dominated by γδ T cells and CD8+ T cells, and signaling through the γδ-T-cell receptor was required for CD8+ T cell infiltration. Rather than directly interacting with CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells recruited conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) into tumors via the chemokine Xcl1. cDC1 in turn activated CD8+ T cells via the Notch pathway. Moreover, IL-38 negatively correlated with cDC1, XCL1-producing γδ T cells, T-cell infiltrates and survival in patients with mammary carcinoma. Conclusions These data suggest that interfering with IL-38 improves antitumor immunity even in immunologically cold tumors.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a significant public health problem leading to permanently disfiguring skin lesions caused by Leishmania parasites. Lesion severity stems from an excessive host inflammatory response that prevents healing. Here, we characterized the transcriptional and translational responses of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) during murine CL using historical single-cell RNA sequencing data combined with flow cytometry and in vivo puromycin incorporation to assess translational activity. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation pathways including MHC-I, MHC-II, and immunoproteasome transcripts in dermal LECs from Leishmania major-infected mice compared to naive controls. LECs also exhibited increased expression of guanylate binding proteins and interferon-inducible genes, indicative of immune activation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that LECs in leishmanial lesions displayed heightened translational activity relative to LECs from uninflamed ears, and LEC translational activity was highest in activated LECs. Furthermore, LEC translational activity exceeded that of other cell types within the lesion microenvironment. Validating the transcriptomic data, LECs in lesions expressed elevated MHC-II and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1), supporting their potential role in antigen presentation. Functional assays using DQ-OVA confirmed that LECs from leishmanial lesions efficiently uptake and process antigens, highlighting their capability as antigen presenting cells in the inflamed dermal microenvironment. Overall, our study reveals the activation status of LECs in leishmanial lesions, shedding light on their potential role in shaping local immunity and inflammation in a variety of skin diseases.">

Previous investigations from our research group have revealed an antimicrobial gene expression profile within murine bone marrow erythroid cells which suggested a role for erythroid cells in innate immunity. In the present study, we focused on elucidating the characteristics of human bone marrow erythroid cells through comprehensive analyses, including NanoString gene expression profiling utilizing the Immune Response V2 panel, a BioPlex examination of chemokine and TGF-beta family proteins secretion, and analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data. Our findings demonstrate that an erythroid cell subpopulation manifests a myeloid-like gene expression signature comprised of antibacterial immunity and neutrophil chemotaxis genes which suggests an involvement of human erythroid cells in the innate immunity. Furthermore, we found that human erythroid cells secreted CCL22, CCL24, CXCL5, CXCL8, and MIF chemokines. The ability of human erythroid cells to express these chemokines might facilitate the restriction of immune cells in the bone marrow under normal conditions or contribute to the ability of erythroid cells to induce local immunosuppression by recruiting immune cells in their immediate vicinity in case of extramedullary hematopoiesis.">

Iron is an essential micronutrient for multiple immunologic processes and nutritional deficiency is a common problem worldwide. Despite its prevalence, the impact of nutritional iron deficiency on the establishment of memory T cell responses is not fully understood. In this study we investigate the impact of nutritional iron deficiency on the generation, phenotype, and function of memory T cell responses using a murine model of dietary iron modulation in the context of influenza infection. Iron deficient mice have decreased systemic iron levels and develop significant anemia. Increased T cell expression of the transferrin receptor (CD71) is seen in iron deficient mice at baseline. During primary influenza infection, iron deficient mice experience increased weight loss and phenotypic evidence of impairments in T cell activation. Following recovery from infection, iron deficient mice generate increased influenza specific memory T cells which exhibit impaired ability to produce IFNγ, most notably within the lung. Importantly, the ability to produce IFNγ and TNFα is not recovered by co-culture with iron replete dendritic cells, suggesting a T cell intrinsic alteration in functional memory formation. Altogether, these results isolate a critical effect of nutritional iron deficiency on T cell memory development and function.">

The underlying causes of IBD are not fully understood, but genetic factors have implicated in genome-wide association studies, including CTLA-4, an essential negative regulator of T cell activation. However, establishing a direct link between CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 knockout mice. In this study, we identified zebrafish Ctla-4 homolog and investigated its role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by generating a Ctla-4-deficient (ctla-4-/-) zebrafish line. These mutant zebrafish exhibit reduced weight, along with impaired epithelial barrier integrity and lymphocytic infiltration in their intestines. Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation-related genes, disturbing immune system homeostasis. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated increased Th2 cells and interleukin 13 expression, along with decreased innate lymphoid cells and upregulated proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited reduced diversity and an altered composition of the intestinal microbiota. All these phenotypes closely resemble those found in mammalian IBD. Lastly, supplementation with Ctla-4-Ig successfully alleviated intestinal inflammation in these mutants. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the pivotal role of Ctla-4 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Additionally, they offer substantial evidence linking CTLA-4 to IBD and establish a novel zebrafish model for investigating both the pathogenesis and potential treatments.">

Unresolved inflammation can lead to liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is influenced by various immune cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which exhibit both innate and adaptive immunity traits. Here, we examined iNKT cell dynamics in a diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in iNKT cell numbers in HCC livers due to apoptosis and impaired cytokine production. CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, displayed delayed tumor initiation and lower tumor and foci number. However, these tumors were larger in size and characterized by enhanced proliferation and immunosuppression. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of healthy iNKT cells post-tumor establishment reduced tumor burden, highlighting their potential therapeutic role. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells contribute to early HCC development, while in later stages they help to control tumor growth, thus underscoring their complex role in liver carcinogenesis. Further understanding of iNKT cell functions may inform novel immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC management.">

        <tr id="Radiotherapy (RT) serves as the primary treatment for solid tumors. Its potential to incite an immune response against tumors both locally and distally profoundly impacts clinical outcomes. However, RT may also promote the accumulation of immunosuppressive cytokines and immunosuppressive cells, greatly impeding the activation of antitumor immune responses and substantially limiting the effectiveness of RT. Therefore, regulating post-RT immunosuppression to steer the immune milieu toward heightened activation potentially enhances RT’s therapeutic potential. Cytokines, potent orchestrators of diverse cellular responses, play a pivotal role in regulating this immunosuppressive response. Identifying and promptly neutralizing early released immunosuppressive cytokines are a crucial development in augmenting RT’s immunomodulatory effects. To this end, we conducted a screen of immunosuppressive cytokines following RT and identified macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) as an early up-regulated and persistent immune suppressor. Single-cell sequencing revealed that the main source of up-regulated MCSF derived from tumor cells. Mechanistic exploration revealed that irradiation-dependent phosphorylation of the p65 protein facilitated its binding to the MCSF gene promoter, enhancing transcription. Knockdown and chemical inhibitor experiments conclusively demonstrated that suppressing tumor cell-derived MCSF amplifies RT’s immune-activating effects, with optimal results achieved by early MCSF blockade after irradiation. Additionally, we validated that MCSF acted on macrophages, inducing the secretion of a large number of inhibitory cytokines. In summary, we propose a novel approach to enhance the immune activation effects of RT by blocking the MCSF-CSF1R signaling pathway early after irradiation.">

        <tr id="Objective Beta cell destruction in type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the combined effect of inflammation and recurrent autoimmunity. In recent years, the role played by beta cells in the development of T1D has evolved from passive victims of the immune system to active contributors in their own destruction. We and others have demonstrated that perturbations in the islet microenvironment promote endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in beta cells, leading to enhanced immunogenicity. Among the underlying mechanisms, secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by beta cells has been suggested to mediate the crosstalk with the immune cell compartment. Methods To study the role of cellular stress in the early events of T1D development, we generated a novel cellular model for constitutive ER stress by modulating the expression of HSPA5, which encodes BiP/GRP78, in EndoC-βH1 cells. To investigate the role of EVs in the interaction between beta cells and the immune system, we characterized the EV miRNA cargo and evaluated their effect on innate immune cells. Results Analysis of the transcriptome showed that HSPA5 knockdown resulted in the upregulation of signaling pathways involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and changes the miRNA content of EVs, including reduced levels of miRNAs involved in IL-1β signaling. Treatment of primary human monocytes with EVs from stressed beta cells resulted in increased surface expression of CD11b, HLA-DR, CD40 and CD86 and upregulation of IL-1β and IL-6. Conclusion These findings indicate that the content of EVs derived from stressed beta cells can be a mediator of islet inflammation.">

        <tr id="Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) crucial for the detection of infections and activation of downstream signaling pathways that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons. The TLR pathway is an attractive actively studied target pathway. Because of their strong immunostimulatory activity, TLRs are thought to be a “double-edged sword” for systemic treatment, even in the cancer field. To solve this, we have developed dextran-based TAM targeting activating conjugate (D-TAC) technology, which successfully uses tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to deliver the TLR7 agonist DSP-0509. We used low molecular weight dextran to target CD206 high M2-type macrophages, activate them, and induce a change in phenotype to antitumor M1-type macrophages with rapid clearance from the body and astonishing antitumor activity. We also demonstrated that the antitumor effect of our best drug candidate 5DEX-0509R is dependent on the abundance of TAMs, which is consistent with their mechanism of action. We believe that 5DEX-0509R generated by D-TAC technology can be a clinically applicable immunotherapy targeting the TLR signaling pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell engagers (TCEs) are becoming an integral class of biological therapeutic owing to their highly potent ability to eradicate cancer cells. Nevertheless, the widespread utility of classical CD3-targeted TCEs has been limited by narrow therapeutic index (TI) linked to systemic CD4+ T cell activation and aberrant cytokine release. One attractive approach to circumvent the systemic activation of pan CD3+ T cells and reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome is to redirect specific subsets of T cells. A promising strategy is the use of peptide-major histocompatibility class I bispecific antibodies (pMHC-IgGs), which have emerged as an intriguing modality of TCE, based on their ability to selectively redirect highly reactive viral-specific effector memory cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to eliminate cancer cells. However, the relatively low frequency of these effector memory cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may hamper their redirection as effector cells for clinical applications. To mitigate this potential limitation, we report here the generation of a pMHC-IgG derivative known as guided-pMHC-staging (GPS) carrying a covalent fusion of a monovalent interleukin-2 (IL-2) mutein (H16A, F42A). Using an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) arm as a proof-of-concept, tumor-associated antigen paired with a single-chain HLA-A *02:01/CMVpp65 pMHC fusion moiety, we demonstrate in vitro that the IL-2-armored GPS modality robustly expands CMVpp65-specific CD8+ effector memory T cells and induces potent cytotoxic activity against target cancer cells. Similar to GPS, IL-2-armored GPS molecules induce modulated T cell activation and reduced cytokine release profile compared to an analogous CD3-targeted TCE. In vivo we show that IL-2-armored GPS, but not the corresponding GPS, effectively expands grafted CMVpp65 CD8+ T cells from unstimulated human PBMCs in an NSG mouse model. Lastly, we demonstrate that the IL-2-armored GPS modality exhibits a favorable developability profile and monoclonal antibody-like pharmacokinetic properties in human neonatal Fc receptor transgenic mice. Overall, IL-2-armored GPS represents an attractive approach for treating cancer with the potential for inducing vaccine-like antiviral T cell expansion, immune cell redirection as a TCE, and significantly widened TI due to reduced cytokine release.">

        <tr id="In central nervous system (CNS) diseases characterized by late-onset neurodegeneration, the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="Modulating gene expression in macrophages can be used to improve tissue regeneration and to redirect tumor microenvironments (TME) toward positive therapeutic outcomes. We have developed Bacillus subtilis as an engineered endosymbiont (EES) capable of residing inside the eukaryotic host cell cytoplasm and controlling the fate of macrophages. Secretion of mammalian transcription factors (TFs) from B. subtilis that expresses listeriolysin O (LLO; allowing the EES to escape destruction by the macrophage) modulated expression of surface markers, cytokines and chemokines, indicating functional changes in a macrophage/monocyte cell line. The engineered B. subtilis LLO TF strains were evaluated in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) by flow cytometry, chemokine/cytokine profiling, metabolic assays and RNA-Seq. Delivery of TFs by the EES shifted BMDM gene expression, production of cytokine and chemokines and metabolic patterns, indicating that the TF strains could guide primary macrophage function. Thereafter, the ability of the TF strains to alter the TME was characterized in vivo, in an orthotopic murine model of triple-negative breast cancer to assess therapeutic effects. The TF strains altered the TME by shifting immune cell composition and attenuating tumor growth. Additionally, multiple doses of the TF strains were well-tolerated by the mice. The use of B. subtilis LLO TF strains as EES showed promise as a unique cancer immunotherapy by directing immune function intracellularly. The uses of EES could be expanded to modulate other mammalian cells over a range of biomedical applications.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial in initiating and shaping both innate and adaptive immune responses. Clinical studies and experimental models have highlighted their significant involvement in various autoimmune diseases, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets. Nicotinamide (NAM), a form of vitamin B3, with its anti-inflammatory properties, has been suggested, while the involvement of NAM in DCs regulation remains elusive. Here, through analyzing publicly available databases, we observe substantial alterations in NAM levels and NAM metabolic pathways during DCs activation. Furthermore, we discover that NAM, but not Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN), significantly inhibits DCs over-activation in vitro and in vivo. The suppression of DCs hyperactivation effectively alleviates symptoms of psoriasis. Mechanistically, NAM impairs DCs activation through a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs)-NF-κB dependent manner. Notably, phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) and PARPs are significantly upregulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated DCs and psoriasis patients; elevated NAMPT and PARPs expression in psoriasis patients correlates with higher psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) scores. In summary, our findings underscore the pivotal role of NAM in modulating DCs functions and autoimmune disorders. Targeting the NAMPT-PARP axis emerges as a promising therapeutic approach for DC-related diseases.">

Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

Lactate serves as a direct regulator of macrophage polarization and functions, although the precise regulation mechanism remain inadequately understood. Our study revealed that PC cells promote macrophage polarization towards the M2d phenotype through high lactate secretion. M2d is characterized by elevated secretion of IL-10 and VEGF-A, which diminish CD8+ T cells cytotoxicity and promote tumor neoangiogenesis simultaneously. Additionally, we identify 2,5'-oligoadenylate synthase 3 (OAS3) as an essential regulator of M2d polarization, upregulated by PC cells via lactate/METTL3/OAS3 axis. METTL3 mediated m6A modification on OAS3 mRNA correlates with increased OAS3 expression in TAMs, which is associated with poorer prognosis in PC patients. OAS3 deficiency in macrophages substantially impairs IL-10highVEGF-AhighM2d polarization and their pro-tumor functions while enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine (Gem) and anti-PD-L1 mAb in humanized mouse models. In conclusion, OAS3 presents as a promising immune therapeutic target for reversing IL-10highVEGF-AhighM2d infiltration and restoring CD8+ T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity in pancreatic cancer.">

However, emerging evidence suggests a more complex and multifaceted role for B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. They accumulate at the side of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity continue to be unraveled. Apart from antibodies, B cells produce a wide range of cytokines, which can influence the local immune response.

        <tr id="Most patients treated with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells eventually experience disease progression. Furthermore, CAR T cells have not been curative against solid cancers and several hematological malignancies such as T cell lymphomas, which have very poor prognoses. One of the main barriers to the clinical success of adoptive T cell immunotherapies is CAR T cell dysfunction and lack of expansion and/or persistence after infusion. In this study, we found that CD5 inhibits CAR T cell activation and that knockout (KO) of CD5 using CRISPR-Cas9 enhances the antitumor effect of CAR T cells in multiple hematological and solid cancer models. Mechanistically, CD5 KO drives increased T cell effector function with enhanced cytotoxicity, in vivo expansion, and persistence, without apparent toxicity in preclinical models. These findings indicate that CD5 is a critical inhibitor of T cell function and a potential clinical target for enhancing T cell therapies. Deleting CD5 with CRISPR-Cas9 enhances T cell activation and proliferation, boosting their antitumor effects in multiple tumor models. Editor’s summary The currently available chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have had limited efficacy for a wide range of solid cancers and hematological malignancies, due in part to CAR T cell dysfunction. The scavenger receptor CD5 associates with the T cell receptor (TCR) and inhibits T cell function. Patel et al. show that genetic deletion of CD5 in CAR and TCR T cells enhances expansion, persistence, and cytotoxicity and is effective in preclinical solid tumor and hematological malignancy models. These results suggest that CD5 may be a critical negative regulator of CAR T cells that can be therapeutically targeted. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="Introduction Biological processes such as aging, carcinogenesis, and immune response rely on the ability to maintain or rapidly expand cell populations. The fitness of the involved cells is constrained by their replicative potential, which is reflected in the cellular telomere content. Method We apply TelomereHunter to scATAC-seq data to determine telomere content on single-cell level, in a hematopoietic dataset consisting of 35,139 cells from samples of basal cell carcinoma patients receiving programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade treatment. Integrating information from open-chromatin-based signatures to assess cell identity, we characterize the heterogeneity of telomere length for individual cell populations pre- and post-immunotherapy. Results The extracted telomeric reads reflect the expected telomereome-to-genome fraction. Telomere content distributions differ significantly between cell populations, and the median telomere content in intermediate and terminal exhausted CD8+ T-cells pre-treatment is significantly correlated to response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Likewise, telomere content correlates with post-treatment cell proliferation in terminally exhausted and T follicular helper cells from responding patients. Conclusion Telomere content measurement from scATAC-seq data has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to detect significant differences between cell types. Furthermore, the telomere content of CD8+ exhausted T-cells pre-treatment is a putative biomarker for successful PD-1-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer of stem cells originating in the bone marrow. Increasing evidence suggests that AML survival and relapse are controlled by genetic alterations, as well as a functional interaction between the tumor and the immune system. In this review, we will discuss the biology of immune evasion in AML and explore the current landscape of immune-based therapies. We argue that a better understanding of the immune microenvironment in AML could help predict responses to immunotherapy and guide decisions for future treatment. Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex hematopoietic clonal disorder with limited curative options beyond stem cell transplantation. The success of transplant is intimately linked with the graft versus leukemia effect from the alloreactive donor immune cells including, T and NK cells. The immune system plays a dynamic role in leukemia survival and resistance. Despite our growing understanding of the immune microenvironment, responses to immune-based therapies differ greatly between patients. Herein, we review the biology of immune evasion mechanisms in AML, discuss the current landscape of immunotherapeutic strategies, and discuss the implications of therapeutic targets. This review focuses on T and NK cell-based therapy, including modified and non-modified NK cells, CAR-T and CAR-NK cells, antibodies, and checkpoint blockades. Understanding the complex interchange between immune tolerance and the emergence of tumor resistance will improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Vaccines incorporating slow delivery, multivalent antigen display, or immunomodulation through adjuvants have an important role to play in shaping the humoral immune response. Here we analyzed mechanisms of action of a clinically relevant combination adjuvant strategy, where phosphoserine (pSer)-tagged immunogens bound to aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant (promoting prolonged antigen delivery to draining lymph nodes) are combined with a potent saponin nanoparticle adjuvant termed SMNP (which alters lymph flow and antigen entry into lymph nodes). When employed with a stabilized HIV Env trimer antigen in mice, this combined adjuvant approach promoted substantial enhancements in germinal center (GC) and antibody responses relative to either adjuvant alone. Using scRNA-seq and scBCR-seq, we found that the alum-pSer/SMNP combination both increased the diversity of GC B cell clones and increased GC B cell clonal expansion, coincident with increases in the expression of Myc and the proportion of S-phase GC B cells. To gain insight into the source of these changes in the GC response, we analyzed antigen biodistribution and structural integrity in draining lymph nodes and found that the combination adjuvant approach, but not alum-pSer delivery or SMNP alone, promoted accumulation of highly intact antigen on follicular dendritic cells, reflecting an integration of the slow antigen delivery and altered lymph node uptake effects of these two adjuvants. These results demonstrate how adjuvants with complementary mechanisms of action impacting vaccine biodistribution and kinetics can synergize to enhance humoral immunity.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary T regulatory cells are specialized lymphocytes that prevent excessive immune responses, yet they can suppress beneficial anti-tumor immunity when infiltrating malignant tumors. Osteopontin, a versatile protein produced by various cells, including T lymphocytes, influences both inflammation-related diseases and cancer immunity. Its role in T regulatory cells, however, remains less explored. Our study examined the impact of osteopontin deficiency on T regulatory cells. We generated mice lacking osteopontin in these cells and observed impaired immune suppression capabilities, which resulted in increased tumor-fighting activity against melanoma. These findings emphasize osteopontin’s crucial role in T regulatory cell stability and functionality within the tumor microenvironment, providing valuable insights for developing new immunotherapeutic strategies. Abstract Foxp3-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells represent the most highly immunosuppressive cell in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that halts effective anti-tumor immunity. Osteopontin (Opn), an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycophosphoprotein, plays key roles in many types of immune-related diseases and is associated with cancer aggressiveness when expressed by tumor cells. However, its role in Foxp3Treg heterogeneity, function, and stability in the TME is poorly defined. We generated mice with a Foxp3-specific deletion of Opn and assessed the ability of Opn-deficient Tregs to suppress inflammation. As these mice aged, they developed a scurfy-like syndrome characterized by aberrant and excessive activation of effector T cells. We evaluated and further confirmed the reduced suppressive capacity of Opn-deficient Tregs in an in vivo suppression assay of colitis. We also found that mice with Opn-deficient Foxp3+ Tregs have enhanced anti-tumor immunity and reduced tumor burden, associated with an unstable Treg phenotype, paralleled by reduced Foxp3 expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Finally, we observed reduced Foxp3 and Helios expression in Opn-deficient Tregs compared to wild-type controls after in vitro activation. Our findings indicate that targeting Opn in Tregs reveals vigorous and effective ways of promoting Treg instability and dysfunction in the TME, facilitating anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Macrolide antibiotic azithromycin is widely used in clinical practice to treat respiratory tract infections and inflammatory diseases. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Given the involvement of the CD27 pathway in the pathophysiology of various T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory, autoimmune, and lymphoproliferative diseases, we examined the impact of AZM on CD27 regulation and potential consequences on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotypes. Using cellular immunology approaches on healthy donors’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we demonstrate AZM-mediated downregulation of surface CD27 expression as well as its extracellular release as soluble CD27. Notably, AZM-exposed CD27high (hi) cells were defective in their ability to expand compared to CD27intermediate (Int) and CD27low (lo) subsets. The defective CD27hi subset expansion was found to be associated with impaired cell proliferation and cell division. At the molecular level, the CD27hi subset exhibited lower mTOR activity than other subsets. Functionally, AZM treatment resulted in marked depletion of helper CD4+ (Th1) and cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte (Tc1)-associated CXCR3+CD27hi effector cells and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ production. These findings provide mechanistic insights on immunomodulatory features of AZM on T-lymphocyte by altering the CD27 pathway. From a clinical perspective, this study also sheds light on potential clinical benefits observed in patients on prophylactic AZM regimens against various respiratory diseases and opens avenues for future adjunct therapy against Th1- and Tc1-dominated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), infects approximately one-fourth of the world’s population. While most infected individuals are asymptomatic, latent TB infection (LTBI) can progress to cause pulmonary TB (PTB). We recently reported an increased accumulation of mast cells (MCs) in lungs of macaques with PTB, compared with LTBI in macaques. MCs respond in vitro to Mtb exposure via degranulation and by inducing proinflammatory cytokines. In the current study, we show the dominant production of chymase by MCs in granulomas of humans and macaques with PTB. Using scRNA seq analysis, we show that MCs found in LTBI and healthy lungs in macaques are enriched in genes involved in tumor necrosis factor alpha, cholesterol and transforming growth factor beta signaling. In contrast, MCs clusters found in PTB express transcriptional signatures associated with interferon gamma, oxidative phosphorylation, and MYC signaling. Additionally, MC deficiency in the mouse model showed improved control of Mtb infection that coincided with reduced accumulation of lung myeloid cells and diminished inflammation at chronic stages. Thus, these collective results provide novel evidence for the pathological contribution of MCs during Mtb infection and may represent a novel target for host directive therapy for TB.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of complex interactions between cellular and extracellular components, among which the immune system is known to play an integral role in disease progression and response to therapy. Cytokines and chemokines are cell signaling proteins used by immune cells to communicate with each other as well as with other cell types in the body. These proteins control systemic and local immune responses and levels of cytokines/chemokines in the TME have been associated with tumor outcomes. However, cytokines and chemokines have varied expression across cell types, tumors, and host conditions. Therefore, approaches to effectively study the production of these proteins at the single-cell level in the TME are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms governing the anti-cancer immune response. Here, we detail a protocol to assess the production of cytokines/chemokines across leukocyte populations in mouse tumors using RNA flow cytometry. Importantly, this method can be adapted with minimal changes to study various mouse and human tumors, other RNA analytes, and non-tumor tissues. With this approach, we characterize single-cell production of Ifnb1, Xcl1 and Ccl5 in mouse tumors and identify monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages as the main producers of type I interferon transcript Ifnb1 consistent across 4 different syngeneic tumor models.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cancer can create a shield of suppressive innate immune cells that stop our body’s natural defenses from tumors. VTX-0811 is a new drug that targets these cells and turns them from allies of cancer to fighters against it. Preclinical tests show that it works in the lab on human cells and tumors and is safe and efficacious in animals. The results are promising and pave the way for human trials to see if VTX-0811 can become a new powerful weapon against cancer. Abstract Omnipresent suppressive myeloid populations in the tumor microenvironment limit the efficacy of T-cell-directed immunotherapies, become more inhibitory after administration of T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, and are overall associated with worse survival of cancer patients. In early clinical trials, positive outcomes have been demonstrated for therapies aimed at repolarizing suppressive myeloid populations in the tumor microenvironment. We have previously described the key role of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in maintaining an inhibitory state of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), most of which express high levels of PSGL-1. Here we describe a novel, first-in-class humanized high-affinity monoclonal antibody VTX-0811 that repolarizes human macrophages from an M2-suppressive phenotype towards an M1 inflammatory phenotype, similar to siRNA-mediated knockdown of PSGL-1. VTX-0811 binds to PSGL-1 of human and cynomolgus macaque origins without inhibiting PSGL-1 interaction with P- and L-Selectins or VISTA. In multi-cellular assays and in patient-derived human tumor cultures, VTX-0811 leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators. RNAseq data from VTX-0811 treated ex vivo tumor cultures and M2c macrophages show similar pathways being modulated, indicating that the mechanism of action translates from isolated macrophages to tumors. A chimeric version of VTX-0811, consisting of the parental murine antibody in a human IgG4 backbone, inhibits tumor growth in a humanized mouse model of cancer. VTX-0811 is exceptionally well tolerated in NHP toxicology assessment and is heading into clinical evaluation after successful IND clearance.">

        <tr id="Biliary atresia (BA) is a leading cause of liver failure in infants. Despite effective surgical drainage, patients with BA exhibit attenuated immune responses to childhood vaccines, suggesting there are long-lasting alterations to immune function. The perinatal liver is home to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and serves as the epicenter for rapidly progressive and significantly morbid inflammatory diseases like BA. We have previously established the role of neonatal myeloid progenitors in the pathogenesis of perinatal liver inflammation (PLI) and hypothesize that PLI leads to long-term changes to HSPCs in mice that recovered from PLI. To test this hypothesis, we compared the changes that occur to HSPCs and mature myeloid populations in the bone marrow of adult mice during homeostasis and during PLI. Our results demonstrate that HSPCs from animals that recover from PLI (“PLI-recovered”) undergo long-term expansion with a reduced proliferative capacity. Notably, PLI leads to persistent activation of common myeloid progenitors through the involvement of CXCL10 and its canonical receptor, CXCR3. Our data suggests that the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis may mediate the changes in HSPCs that lead to altered immune function observed in BA, providing support for a targetable pathway to mitigate the detrimental long-term immune effects observed in patients with BA.">

Single cell RNA-seq analysis of human islets exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or Coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) viruses identified activation of proinflammatory macrophages and β cell pyroptosis. To distinguish viral versus proinflammatory macrophage-mediated β cell pyroptosis, we developed human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived vascularized macrophage-islet (VMI) organoids. VMI organoids exhibited enhanced marker expression and function in both β cells and endothelial cells compared to separately cultured cells. Notably, proinflammatory macrophages within VMI organoids induced β cell pyroptosis. Mechanistic investigations highlighted TNFSF12-TNFRSF12A involvement in proinflammatory macrophage-mediated β cell pyroptosis. This study established hPSC- derived VMI organoids as a valuable tool for studying immune cell-mediated host damage and uncovered mechanism of β cell damage during viral exposure.">

        <tr id="How group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) regulate mucosal protection in the presence of T cells remains poorly understood. Here, we examined ILC3 function in intestinal immunity using ILC3-deficient mice that maintain endogenous T cells, T helper 17 (TH17) cells, and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were dispensable for generation of TH17 and TH22 cell responses to commensal and pathogenic bacteria, and absence of ILC3s did not affect IL-22 production by CD4 T cells before or during infection. However, despite the presence of IL-22–producing T cells, ILC3s and ILC3-derived IL-22 were required for maintaining homeostatic functions of the intestinal epithelium. T cell–sufficient, ILC3-deficient mice were capable of pathogen clearance and survived infection with a low dose of Citrobacter rodentium. However, ILC3s promoted pathogen tolerance at early time points of infection by activating tissue-protective immune pathways. Consequently, ILC3s were indispensable for survival after high-dose infection. Our results demonstrate a context-dependent role for ILC3s in immune-sufficient animals and provide a blueprint for uncoupling of ILC3 and TH17 cell functions. In T cell–sufficient mice, ILC3s are required for mucosal protection from high-dose but not low-dose bacterial infection. Editor’s summary Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) contribute to intestinal homeostasis and immunity against gut pathogens. Distinguishing the functions of ILC3s from those of T helper 17 (TH17) cells has remained challenging because of similar transcription factor dependencies and cytokine production profiles. To better define ILC3-specific roles, Araujo et al. developed genetically engineered mice that lack ILC3s while retaining endogenous T cells and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were the primary producers of IL-22, which was required for the maintenance of intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. Whereas TH17 cells were sufficient to protect against low-dose Citrobacter rodentium infection, ILC3s provided early protection and were required for survival after high-dose infection. Together, these findings identify nonredundant functions of ILC3s in mucosal homeostasis and immunity. —Claire Olingy">

Several studies support the idea that innate immunity, through the release of pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines and tumor growth factors, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM). Cutaneous melanoma is the most common skin cancer, with an incidence that rapidly increased in recent decades. Melanoma is a highly immunogenic tumor, due to its high mutational burden. The metastatic form retains a high mortality. The advent of immunotherapy revolutionized the therapeutic approach to this tumor and significantly ameliorated the patients’ clinical outcome.

Here, we determined the effects of the pan-lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody (mAb) alemtuzumab on the RCVR in SIVmac239-infected rhesus macaques (RM) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Alemtuzumab administered during chronic ART or at the time of ART initiation induced >95% depletion of circulating CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood and substantial CD4+ T cell depletion in lymph nodes. However, treatment was followed by proliferation and reconstitution of CD4+ T cells in blood, and despite ongoing ART, levels of cell-associated SIV DNA in blood and lymphoid tissues were not substantially different between alemtuzumab-treated and control RM after immune cell reconstitution, irrespective of the time of alemtuzumab treatment. Upon ART cessation, 19 of 22 alemtuzumab-treated RM and 13 of 13 controls rebounded with no difference in the time to rebound between treatment groups. Time to rebound and reactivation rate was associated with plasma viral loads (pVLs) at time of ART initiation, suggesting lymphocyte depletion had no durable impact on the RCVR. However, 3 alemtuzumab-treated RM that had lowest levels of pre-ART viremia, failed to rebound after ART withdrawal, in contrast to controls with similar levels of SIV replication. These observations suggest that alemtuzumab therapy has little to no ability to reduce well-established RCVRs but may facilitate RCVR destabilization when pre-ART virus levels are particularly low.">

        <tr id="Aberrant activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway causes autoimmunity in humans and mice; however, the exact mechanism by which the cGAS-STING pathway initiates adaptive immunity and tissue pathology is still not fully understood. Here, we used a cGAS knockin (KI) mouse model that develops systemic autoimmunity. In the lungs of cGAS-KI mice, blood vessels were enclosed by organized lymphoid tissues that resemble tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). Cell-intrinsic cGAS induction promoted up-regulation of CCR5 in CD8+ T cells and led to CCL5 production in vascular endothelial cells. Peripheral CD8+ T cells were recruited to the lungs and produced CXCL13 and interferon-γ. The latter triggered endothelial cell death, potentiated CCL5 production, and was essential for TLS establishment. Blocking CCL5 or CCR5, or depleting CD8+ T cells, impaired TLS formation. cGAS-mediated TLS formation also enhanced humoral and antitumor responses. These data demonstrate that cGAS signaling drives a specialized lymphoid structure that underlies autoimmune tissue pathology. cGAS initiates pulmonary TLS formation, which is dependent on the CCL5-CCR5 axis between endothelial cells and T cells. Editor’s summary Overactivation of the innate immune sensing cGAS-STING pathway can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. To investigate how cGAS hyperactivation drives lung inflammation, Zhao et al. generated a cGAS conditional knockin mouse model. Hyperactivation of cGAS resulted in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the lung, which enhanced antibody responses and antitumor immunity. CCL5-producing endothelial cells in the lung promoted CD8+ T cell recruitment to TLSs via CCR5 signaling, which was induced by T cell–intrinsic cGAS expression. Blocking CCR5/CCL5 impaired TLS formation, suggesting that CCR5/CCL5 could be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity or to enhance antitumor immunity. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Abstract Myeloid malignancies arise in bone marrow microenvironments and shape these microenvironments in favor of malignant development. Immune suppression is one of the most important stages in myeloid leukemia progression. Leukemic clone expansion and immune dysregulation occur simultaneously in bone marrow microenvironments. Complex interactions emerge between normal immune system elements and leukemic clones in the bone marrow. In recent years, researchers have identified several of these pathological interactions. For instance, recent works shows that the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), from bone marrow stromal cells contributes to immune dysregulation and the selective proliferation of JAK2V617F+ clones in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Moreover, inflammasome activation and sterile inflammation result in inflamed microenvironments and the development of myelodysplastic syndromes. Additional immune dysregulations, such as exhaustion of T and NK cells, an increase in regulatory T cells, and impairments in antigen presentation are common findings in myeloid malignancies. In this review, we discuss the role of altered bone marrow microenvironments in the induction of immune dysregulations that accompany myeloid malignancies. We also consider both current and novel therapeutic strategies to restore normal immune system function in the context of myeloid malignancies.">

Further phenotypical analysis confirmed the granulocytic-like features of this monocyte subpopulation that is associated with an increase in granulocyte–monocyte precursors (GMPs) in the PB of these patients (pts). Mechanistically, this granulocyte-like monocyte population suppressed NK cell activity by inducing TIGIT and engaging NKp30. Accordingly, an increased frequency of TIGIT+ NK cells with impaired functions was found in both the PB and tumoral tissue of CRC pts. Collectively, we provided new mechanistic explanations for tumor immune escape occurring in CRC by showing the increase in this new kind of MDSC, in both PB and CRC tissue, which is able to significantly impair the effector functions of NK cells, thereby representing a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.">

To determine whether response was associated with in vivo dynamics of DNA hypomethylation, we conducted a phase 2 trial for MDS using both injection and oral azacitidine (AZA). We established that global DNA methylation levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells were comparable in AZA responders and non-responders during their course of treatment. However, there were distinct baseline and early drug induced differences in CpG methylation in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in responders compared to non-responders that overlapped with regulatory regions of genes associated with tissue patterning, cell migration and myeloid differentiation. Following six cycles of therapy when clinical response typically manifests, differential hypomethylation in responder HSPCs pointed to marrow adaptation as a driver of enhanced haematopoiesis. Taken together, CpG methylation differences in HSPCs may explain variable response to AZA.">

        <tr id="During activation the T cell transmembrane receptor CD6 becomes incorporated into the T cell immunological synapse where it can exert both co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory functions. Given the ability of CD6 to carry out opposing functions, this study sought to determine how CD6 regulates early T cell activation in response to viral infection. Infection of CD6 deficient mice with a neurotropic murine coronavirus resulted in greater activation and expansion of CD4 T cells in the draining lymph nodes. Further analysis demonstrated that there was also preferential differentiation of CD4 T cells into T follicular helper cells, resulting in accelerated germinal center responses and emergence of high affinity virus specific antibodies. Given that CD6 conversely supports CD4 T cell activation in many autoimmune models, we probed potential mechanisms of CD6 mediated suppression of CD4 T cell activation during viral infection. Analysis of CD6 binding proteins revealed that infection induced upregulation of Ubash3a, a negative regulator of T cell receptor signaling, was hindered in CD6 deficient lymph nodes. Consistent with greater T cell activation and reduced UBASH3a activity, the T cell receptor signal strength was intensified in CD6 deficient CD4 T cells. These results reveal a novel immunoregulatory role for CD6 in limiting CD4 T cell activation and deterring CD4 T follicular helper cell differentiation, thereby attenuating antiviral humoral immunity. Importance CD6 monoclonal blocking antibodies are being therapeutically administered to inhibit T cell activation in autoimmune disorders. However, the multifaceted nature of CD6 allows for multiple and even opposing functions under different circumstances of T cell activation. We therefore sought to characterize how CD6 regulates T cell activation in the context viral infections using an in vivo murine coronavirus model. In contrast to its role in autoimmunity, but consistent with its function in the presence of superantigens, we found that CD6 deficiency enhances CD4 T cell activation and CD4 T cell help to germinal center dependent antiviral humoral responses. Finally, we provide evidence that CD6 regulates transcription of its intracellular binding partner UBASH3a, which suppresses T cell receptor signaling and consequently T cell activation. These findings highlight the context dependent flexibility of CD6 in regulating in vivo adaptive immune responses, which may be targeted to enhance anti-viral immunity.">

        <tr id="TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a member of the IKK family and plays a crucial role in the activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling and type I interferon responses. The aberrant activation of TBK1 contributes to the proliferation and survival of various types of tumor cells, particularly in specific mutational or tumorous contexts. Inhibitors targeting TBK1 are under development and application in both in vivo and in vitro settings, yet their clinical efficacy remains limited. Numerous literatures have shown that TBK1 can exhibit both tumor promoting and tumor inhibiting effects. TBK1 acts as a pivotal node within the innate immune pathway, mediating anti-tumor immunity through the activation of innate immune responses. Facilitating interferon-I (IFN-I) production represents a critical mechanism through which TBK1 bridges these processes. IFN has been shown to exert both beneficial and detrimental effects on tumor progression. Hence, the paradoxical role of TBK1 in tumor development may necessitate acknowledgment in light of its downstream IFN-I signaling cascade. In this paper, we review the signaling pathways mediated by TBK1 in various tumor contexts and summarize the dual roles of TBK1 and the TBK1-IFN pathways in both promoting and inhibiting tumor progression. Additionally, we highlight the significance of the TBK1-IFN pathway in clinical therapy, particularly in the context of immune response. We anticipate further advancements in the development of TBK1 inhibitors as part of novel cancer treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Concurrent KRAS LKB1 (STK11, KL) mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC) is particularly difficult to treat and does not respond well to current immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This is due to numerous mechanisms including low antigen presentation limiting T cell mediated killing. To activate anti-tumor immunity, we targeted tumor cell – natural killer (NK) cell interactions. We tested whether a novel antibody based therapeutic strategy that predominantly activates natural killer (NK) cells demonstrates efficacy in pre-clinical mouse models of KL NSCLC. NK cells rely on binding of ligands, such as Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I-related chain A or B (MICA/B), to the activating receptor NKG2D. Importantly MICA and MICB are widely expressed in elevated levels across NSCLC subtypes including KL lung cancers. Proteases with the tumor microenvironment (TME) can cleave these proteins rendering tumor cells less visible to NK cells. We therefore developed a MICA monoclonal antibody, AHA-1031, which utilizes two NK cell activating receptors. AHA1031 prevents ligand shedding without interfering with binding to NKG2D while targeting cancer cells to antibody mediated cell dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our therapeutic novel antibody has significant monotherapy activity in KL cancer models including xenografts of human cell lines and patient derived xenografts. Activating NK cells through MICA/B stabilization and inducing ADCC offers an alternative and potent therapy option in KL tumors. MICA/B are shed across different tumors making this therapeutic strategy universally applicable.">

        <tr id="Immune-surveillance depends in part on the recognition of peptide variants by T cell antigen receptors. Given that both normal B cells and malignant B cells accumulate mutations we chose a murine model of multiple myeloma to test conditions to induce cell-mediated immunity targeting malignant plasma cell (PC) clones but sparing of normal PCs. Revealing a novel function for intracellular C3d, we discovered that C3d engaged T cell responses against malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow of mice that had developed multiple myeloma spontaneously. Our results show that C3d internalized by cells augments immune surveillance by several mechanisms. In one, C3d induces a master transcription regulator, E2f1, to increase the expression of long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, to generate peptides for MHC-I presentation and increase MHC-I expression. In another, C3d increases expression of RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins linked to processing of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) that arise from non-canonical translation and known to promote immunosurveillance. Cancer cells are uniquely susceptible to increased expression and presentation of mutant peptides given the extent of protein misfolding and accumulation of somatic mutations. Accordingly, although C3d can be internalized by any cell, C3d preferentially targets malignant clones by evoking specific T cell mediated immunity (CMI) and sparing most non-transformed polyclonal B cells and plasma cells with lower mutation loads. Malignant plasma cell deletion was blocked by cyclosporin or by CD8 depletion confirming that endogenous T cells mediated malignant clone clearance. Besides the potential for therapeutic application our results highlight how intracellular C3d modifies cellular metabolism to augment immune surveillance. One Sentence Summary We show that intracellular soluble fragment 3d of complement (C3d) induces regression of spontaneous multiple myeloma in mice reducing tumor burden by 10 fold, after 8 weeks. C3d enables cell-mediated immunity to target multiple myeloma clones sparing non-transformed polyclonal B cells and plasma cells with lower mutation loads. We show that C3d increases the expression of ribosomal subunits associated with the translation of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). C3d also decreases expression of protein arginine methyl transferase (PRMT) 5 which in turn relieves E2f1 repression increasing the expression of Lnc RNAs and derived peptides that evoke anti-tumor cellular immunity. The approach increases MHC-I expression by tumor cells and generates a CMI response that overcomes tumor immune-evasion strategies. Significance Tumors are immunogenic in part because of somatic mutations that originate novel peptides that once presented on MHC engage cell-mediated immunity (CMI). However, in spite of the higher mutation load most tumors evade immunity. We discovered that a component of the complement system (C3d) overcomes tumor immune evasion by augmenting expression of ribosomal proteins and lncRNAs linked to the presentation of novel peptides by tumor cells. C3d induced CMI targets cancer cells sparing non transformed cells uncovering a novel function for complement in immune surveillance.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) show signs of low-grade inflammation, which is related to the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the underlying triggers remain unknown. The gut microbiota is a plausible source as it comprises pro-inflammatory bacteria, bacterial metabolites and viruses, including (bacterio)phages. These prokaryotic viruses have been shown to mediate inflammatory responses in gastrointestinal disease. Given the differences in phage populations in healthy individuals versus those with cardiometabolic diseases such as T2D, we here questioned whether phages from T2D individuals would have increased immunogenic potential. To address this, we isolated intestinal phages from a fresh stool sample of healthy controls and individuals with newly diagnosed, treatment-naive T2D. Phages were purified using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation and incubated with healthy donor dendritic cells (DCs) and autologous T cells. Donors with T2D had slightly higher free viral particle numbers compared to healthy controls (p = .1972), which has been previously associated with disease states. Further, phages from T2D induced a higher inflammatory response in DCs and T cells than phages from HC. For example, the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on DCs (p < .001) and interferon-y secretion from T cells (p < .01) were increased when comparing the two groups. These results suggest that phages might play a role in low-grade inflammation in T2D individuals.">

        <tr id="NKT cells are innate-like T cells, recruited to the skin during viral infection, yet their contributions to long-term immune memory to viruses are unclear. We identified granzyme K, a product made by cytotoxic cells including NKT cells, is linked to induction of Th1-associated antibodies during primary dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. We examined the role of NKT cells in vivo using DENV-infected mice lacking CD1d-dependent (CD1ddep) NKT cells. In CD1d-KO mice, Th1-polarized immunity and infection resolution were impaired, which was dependent on intrinsic NKT cell production of IFN-γ, since it was restored by adoptive transfer of WT but not IFN-γ-KO NKT cells. Furthermore, NKT cell deficiency triggered immune bias, resulting in higher levels of Th2-associated IgG1 than Th1-associated IgG2a, which failed to protect against a homologous DENV re-challenge and promoted antibody-dependent enhanced disease during secondary heterologous infections. Similarly, Th2-immunity, typified by a higher IgG4:IgG3 ratio, was associated with worsened human disease severity during secondary infections. Thus, CD1ddep NKT cells establish Th1 polarity during the early innate response to DENV, which promotes infection resolution, memory formation and long-term protection from secondary homologous and heterologous infections. These observations illustrate how early innate immune responses during primary infections can influence secondary infection outcomes.">

        <tr id="In triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), pro-tumoral macrophages promote metastasis and suppress the immune response. To target these cells, we engineered a previously identified CD206 (mannose receptor)-binding peptide, mUNO, to enhance its affinity and proteolytic stability. The new rationally designed peptide, MACTIDE, includes a trypsin inhibitor loop, from the Sunflower Trypsin Inhibitor-I. Binding studies to recombinant CD206 revealed a 15-fold lower KD for MACTIDE compared to parental mUNO. Additionally, mass spectrometry showed a 5-fold increase in half-life in tumor lysate for MACTIDE compared to mUNO. Homing studies in TNBC-bearing mice showed that fluorescein (FAM)-MACTIDE precisely targeted CD206+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) upon intravenous, intraperitoneal and even oral administration, with no significant accumulation in liver. We coupled MACTIDE to the FDA-approved drug Verteporfin, an established photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy and inhibitor of the YAP/TAZ pathway, to generate a conjugate here referred to as MACTIDE-V. In the orthotopic 4T1 TNBC mouse model, non-irradiated MACTIDE-V-treated mice unexpectedly showed a similar anti-tumoral effect and fewer signs of toxicity as irradiated MACTIDE-V-treated mice, leading to subsequent studies on the laser-independent activity of this conjugate. In vitro studies using bone-marrow derived mouse macrophages showed that MACTIDE-V excluded YAP from the nucleus, increased the phagocytic activity and upregulated several genes associated with cytotoxic anti-tumoral macrophages. In mouse models of TNBC, MACTIDE-V slowed primary tumor growth, suppressed lung metastases, increased markers of phagocytosis and antigen presentation in TAMs and monocytes, increasing the tumor infiltration of several lymphocyte subsets. We therefore propose MACTIDE-V as a useful peptide-drug conjugate to modulate macrophage function in the context of breast tumor immunotherapy.">

Within the TME, cell-to-cell inhibitory interactions play significant roles in dampening their anti-tumor activities. Recent studies have revealed that soluble factors released in the TME by immune and non-immune cells, as well as by tumor cells themselves, contribute to the exacerbation of T cell exhaustion. Our understanding of the cytokine landscape of the TME, their interrelationships, and their impact on cancer development is still at its early stages. In this review, we aim to shed light on Interleukin (IL) -6, IL-9, and IL-10, a small group of JAK/STAT signaling-dependent cytokines harboring T cell-suppressive effects in the TME and summarize their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we will explore how advancements in scientific research can help us overcoming the obstacles posed by cytokines that suppress T cells in tumors, with the ultimate objective of stimulating further investigations for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to counteract their tumor-promoting activities.">

Nevertheless, the clinical use of cytokines in cancer treatment has faced several challenges associated with poor pharmacokinetic properties and the occurrence of adverse effects. Immunocytokines (ICKs) have emerged as a promising approach to overcome the pharmacological limitations observed with cytokines. ICKs are fusion proteins designed to deliver cytokines in the tumor microenvironment by taking advantage of the stability and specificity of immunoglobulin-based scaffolds. Several technological approaches have been developed. This review focuses on ICKs designed with the most impactful cytokines in the cancer field: IL-2, TNFα, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21, IFNγ, GM-CSF, and IFNα. An overview of the pharmacological effects of the naked cytokines and ICKs tested for cancer therapy is detailed. A particular emphasis is given on the immunomodulatory effects of ICKs associated with their technological design. In conclusion, this review highlights active ways of development of ICKs. Their already promising results observed in clinical trials are likely to be improved with the advances in targeting technologies such as cytokine/linker engineering and the design of multispecific antibodies with tumor targeting and immunostimulatory functional properties.">

While RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells (RORγt-APCs) were shown to program gut microbiota-specific pTregs5–7, understanding of their characteristics remains incomplete, and the APC subset responsible for food tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that RORγt-APCs are similarly required for differentiation of food antigen-specific pTregs and establishment of oral tolerance. The ability of these cells to direct both food and microbiota-specific pTreg cell differentiation is contingent on expression of RORγt and on a unique cis-regulatory element within the Rorc gene locus (Rorc(t) +7kb). Absent this +7kb element, there was a notable increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 (Th2) cells in lieu of pTregs, leading to compromised tolerance in a mouse asthma model. By employing single-cell analyses across these models, as well as freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, we identified a rare subset of evolutionarily conserved APCs that are dependent on RORγt, uniquely express the Prdm16 transcription factor, and are endowed with essential mediators for inducing pTreg cell differentiation. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of how RORγt-APCs develop and how they regulate T cell responses to food and microbial antigens could offer new insights into developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as organ transplant tolerance.">

In this study we generated high-quality lineage-negative (Lin−) single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets under various conditions and introduced a working pipeline named Snapdragon to interrogate naïve and disturbed plasticity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with mutational or environmental challenges. Utilizing embedding methods UMAP or FA, a continuum of hematopoietic development is visually observed in wildtype where the pipeline confirms a very low Proportion of hybrid-cells (Phc, with bias range: 0.4-0.6) on a transition trajectory. Upon Tet2 mutation, a driver of leukemia, or treatment of DSS, an inducer of colitis, Phc is increased and plasticity of HSPCs was enhanced. Quantitative analysis indicates that Tet2 mutation enhances HSC self-renewal capability while DSS treatment results in an enhanced myeloid-skewing trajectory, suggesting their similar but different consequences. We prioritized several transcription factors (i.e the EGR family) and signaling pathways (i.e. receptors IL1R1 and ADRB, inflammation and sympathy-sensing respectively) which are responsible for Phc alterations. CellOracle-based simulation suggests that knocking-out EGR regulons or pathways of IL1R1 and ADRB partially reverses Phc promoted by Tet2 mutation and inflammation.

        <tr id="After the primary response, circulating memory CD4+T effector and T regulatory cells (Treg) regulate recall responses, which are impaired in allergy. Using mass spectrometry, we discovered distinct metabolomes of these cells in humans and their unique enrichment in amino acids. By assessing energy metabolism in in vitro and ex vivo single-cell analyses, we determined that increased intracellular L-phenylalanine boosts glycolysis while limiting OXPHOS in CD4+T, memory CD4+T and Th2, but not in Treg cells. L-phenylalanine also restrains memory CD4+T proliferation in an IL4I1-dependent manner and inhibits Th2 cell proliferation and differentiation. RNA-sequencing, metabolomics, flow cytometry and proteomics, validated in vitro and across patients’ cohorts, revealed an impairment in LAT1-dependent transport of L-phenylalanine into Th2 cells in allergy with an increase in its intracellular processing, accompanied by an expansion of pathogenic Th2 cells. Thus, our study identifies L-phenylalanine as a checkpoint in the development, energy metabolism and function of Th2 cells.">

        <tr id="Native banana lectin (BanLec) is antiviral but highly mitogenic, which limits its therapeutic value. In contrast, the genetically engineered H84T BanLec (H84T) is not mitogenic but remains effective against influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mouse models. However, the potency and effect of H84T on human immune cells and IAV-specific immune responses is undetermined. We found that H84T efficiently inhibited IAV replication in human dendritic cells (DCs) from blood and tonsils, which preserved DC viability and allowed acquisition and presentation of viral antigen. Consequently, H84T-treated DCs initiated effective expansion of IAV-specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, H84T preserved the capacity of IAV-exposed DCs to present a second non-IAV antigen and induce robust CD8 T cell expansion. This supports H84T as a potent antiviral in humans as it effectively inhibits IAV infection without disrupting DC function, and preserves induction of antigen-specific adaptive immune responses against diverse antigens, which likely is clinically beneficial.">

        <tr id="Coinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a significant public health concern. Individuals infected with Mtb who acquire HIV are approximately 16 times more likely to develop active tuberculosis. T cells play an important role as both targets for HIV infection and mediators of the immune response against both pathogens. This review aims to synthesize the current literature and provide insights into the effects of HIV/Mtb coinfection on T cell populations and their contributions to immunity. Evidence from multiple in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that T helper responses are severely compromised during coinfection, leading to impaired cytotoxic responses. Moreover, HIV’s targeting of Mtb-specific cells, including those within granulomas, offers an explanation for the severe progression of the disease. Herein, we discuss the patterns of differentiation, exhaustion, and transcriptomic changes in T cells during coinfection, as well as the metabolic adaptations that are necessary for T cell maintenance and functionality. This review highlights the interconnectedness of the immune response and the pathogenesis of HIV/Mtb coinfection.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a challenging hematological malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) contribute to therapeutic failure, relapse, and adverse outcome. This study investigates the role of quiescence and related molecular mechanisms in AML pathogenesis and LSC functions to identify potential therapeutic targets. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the LSC-enriched quiescent cell population has a distinct gene signature with prognostic relevance in patients with AML. Mechanistically, quiescent blasts exhibit increased autophagic activity, which contributes to their sustained viability. Proteomic profiling uncovered differential requirements for iron metabolism between quiescent and cycling cells, revealing a unique dependence of quiescent cells on ferritinophagy, a selective form of autophagy mediated by nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), which regulates iron bioavailability. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of inhibiting NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy using genetic knockdown and chemical inhibition approaches. In vitro assays showed that suppression of NCOA4 was toxic to leukemic blasts, particularly the CD34+CD38− LSC-enriched population, without affecting normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. In vivo studies using murine patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of AML confirmed that NCOA4 inhibition reduced tumor burden and impaired LSC viability and self-renewal, indicating a specific vulnerability of these cells to ferritinophagy disruption. Our findings underscore the role of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in maintaining LSC quiescence and function and suggest that targeting this pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy for AML. This study highlights the potential of NCOA4 inhibition to improve AML outcomes and paves the way for future research and clinical development. Targeting quiescent leukemic stem cells through NCOA4-dependent ferritinophagy inhibition may improve therapeutic outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia. Editor’s summary Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are thought to be a main contributor to relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, Larrue et al. identified a reliance on ferritinophagy, a form of autophagy that relies on nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), in LSCs and demonstrated that inhibition reduced tumor growth in primary patient samples and mouse models. This represents a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with AML that will require further study. —Dorothy Hallberg">

Here, we demonstrate that navitoclax, an orally bioavailable, small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, significantly improves pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) treatments as a host-directed therapy. Addition of navitoclax to standard TB treatments at human equipotent dosing in mouse models of TB, inhibits Bcl-2 expression, leading to improved bacterial clearance, reduced tissue damage / fibrosis and decreased extrapulmonary bacterial dissemination. Using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, we show that navitoclax induces apoptosis in several immune cells, including CD68 + and CD11b + cells. Finally, positron emission tomography (PET) in live animals using novel, clinically translatable biomarkers for apoptosis ( 18 F-ICMT-11) and fibrosis ( 18 F-FAPI-74) demonstrates that navitoclax significantly increases apoptosis and reduces fibrosis in pulmonary tissues, which are confirmed using post-mortem studies. Our studies suggest that proapoptotic drugs such as navitoclax can improve pulmonary TB treatments, and should be evaluated in clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the leading infectious causes of death worldwide. There is no available licensed therapeutic vaccine that shortens active tuberculosis (TB) disease drug treatment and prevents relapse, despite the World Health Organization’s calls. Here, we show that an intranasal DNA vaccine containing a fusion of the stringent response relMtb gene with the gene encoding the immature dendritic cell-targeting chemokine, MIP-3α/CCL20, shortens the duration of curative TB treatment in immunocompetent mice. Compared to the first-line regimen for drug-susceptible TB alone, our novel adjunctive vaccine induced greater RelMtb-specific T-cell responses associated with optimal TB control in spleen, blood, lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. These responses were sustained, if not augmented, over time. It also triggered more effective dendritic cell recruitment, activation, and colocalization with T cells, implying enhanced crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, it potentiated a 6-month TB drug-resistant regimen, rendering it effective across treatment regimens, and also showed promising results in CD4+ knockout mice, perhaps due to enhanced Rel-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Notably, our novel fusion vaccine was also immunogenic in nonhuman primates, the gold standard animal model for TB vaccine studies, eliciting antigen-specific T-cell responses in blood and BAL fluid analogous to those observed in protected mice. Our findings have critical implications for therapeutic TB vaccine clinical development in immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations and may serve as a model for defining immunological correlates of therapeutic vaccine-induced protection.

T cells are major IL-32 producers in these diseases and key mediators of pathogen and tumor elimination but also autoimmune destruction. However, their contribution to IL-32 biology during immune responses is hardly understood due to several isoforms with divergent inflammatory properties. Here, we identified IL-32β as the predominant isoform in various T cell subsets of healthy individuals and breast cancer patients with the highest levels detected in intratumoral regulatory T cells. We show that IL-32β is induced by IL-2 but IL-32β release requires T Cell Receptor rather than IL2R stimulation. Using inhibitors of protein secretion pathways and serial (ultra)centrifugation of T cell supernatants, we demonstrate that T cells actively secrete IL-32β unconventionally, as a free protein and, to a minor degree, through exosomes. Thus, our data identify activated T cells as major IL-32β secretors in health and cancer.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus and the leading cause of infectious disease related birth defects worldwide. How the immune response modulates the risk of intrauterine transmission of HCMV after maternal infection remains poorly understood. Maternal T cells likely play a critical role in preventing infection at the maternal-fetal interface and limiting spread across the placenta, but concerns exist that immune responses to infection may also cause placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a guinea pig model of primary cytomegalovirus infection. Monoclonal antibodies specific to guinea pig CD4 and CD8 were used to deplete T cells in non- pregnant and in pregnant guinea pigs after mid-gestation. CD4+ T cell depletion increased the severity of illness, caused significantly elevated viral loads, and increased the rate of congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection relative to animals treated with control antibody. CD8+ T cell depletion was comparably well tolerated and did not significantly affect the weight of infected guinea pigs or viral loads in their blood or tissue. However, significantly more viral genomes and transcripts were detected in the placenta and decidua of CD8+ T cell depleted dams post-infection. This study corroborates earlier findings made in nonhuman primates that maternal CD4+ T cells play a critical role in limiting the severity of primary CMV infection during pregnancy while also revealing that other innate and adaptive immune responses can compensate for an absent CD8+ T cell response in α-CD8-treated guinea pigs. Author Summary Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is a leading cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes and preventable disability in children. Using guinea pigs, a well-established small animal model of congenital infection and intrauterine development, this study tested how depleting T cells affects the course of primary cytomegalovirus infections. Severe illness and high rates of congenital infection were observed when helper CD4+ T cells were depleted. The depletion of killer CD8+ T cells did not affect the severity of disease or the rate of congenital infection but did increase the amount of virus that was detected in the placenta. A greater understanding how an immune response can prevent the infection of the placenta and developing offspring is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic development. This study not only describes a new reagent that can be used to study the guinea pig immune system but also sheds new light in how adaptive immunity regulates congenital viral infection.">

        <tr id="Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling has been shown to be upregulated in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Dysregulated B-cell functions, including antigen presentation, as well as antibody and cytokine production, all of which may be affected by IFN-I signaling, play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. We investigated the IFN-I signature in 71 patients with the more severe form of the disease, diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), and 33 healthy controls (HCs). Activation via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can influence the IFN-I signaling cascade; thus, we analyzed the effects of the TLR homologue CD180 ligation on the IFN-I signature in B cells. CD180 stimulation augmented the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in dcSSc B cells (p = 0.0123). The expression of IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) in non-switched memory B cells producing natural autoantibodies was elevated in dcSSc (p = 0.0109), which was enhanced following anti-CD180 antibody treatment (p = 0.0125). Autoantibodies to IFN-Is (IFN-alpha and omega) correlated (dcSSc p = 0.0003, HC p = 0.0192) and were present at similar levels in B cells from dcSSc and HC, suggesting their regulatory role as natural autoantibodies. It can be concluded that factors other than IFN-alpha may contribute to the elevated IFN-I signature of dcSSc B cells, and one possible candidate is B-cell activation via CD180.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is the leading cause of mortality due to a single infectious organism. While generally curable, TB requires a lengthy and complex antibiotic regimen, due in large part to bacteria that can shift to a persistent state in the presence of antibiotic pressure. RelMtb is the primary enzyme regulating the stringent response, which contributes to the metabolic shift of Mtb to a persistent state. Targeting RelMtb with a vaccine to eliminate persistent bacteria through the induction of RelMtb-specific T-cell immunity in combination with antibiotics to kill dividing bacteria has shown promise in model systems. In a mouse model of Mtb infection, a vaccine created by genetically fusing relMtb to the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 3α (MIP3α), a ligand for the CC chemokine receptor type 6 (CCR6) present on immature dendritic cells, has been shown to enhance T-cell responses and accelerate eradication of infection in mouse models compared to a vaccine lacking the chemokine component. In this study, immunogenicity studies in the mouse and rhesus macaque models provide evidence that intranasal administrations of the DNA form of the MipRel vaccine led to enhanced lung infiltration of T cells after a series of immunizations. Furthermore, despite similar T-cell immunity seen in PBMCs between MipRel and Rel vaccinations, lung and bronchoalveolar lavage cell samples are more enriched for cytokine-secreting T cells in MipRel groups compared to Rel groups. We conclude that intranasal immunization with a MIP-3α fusion vaccine represents a novel strategy for use of a simple DNA vaccine formulation to elicit T-cell immune responses within the respiratory tract. That this formulation is immunogenic in a non-human primate model historically viewed as poorly responsive to DNA vaccines indicates the potential for clinical application in the treatment of Mtb infection, with possible application to other respiratory pathogens. Future studies will further characterize the protective effect of this vaccination platform.">

Also, they have the potential to shape the adaptive immunity via a unique crosstalk with the different immune cells.

To decipher the immunological virus-host interactions, two major infection models are being investigated in mice regarding NK cell-mediated recognition: murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). In this review, we recapitulate recent findings regarding the multifaceted role of NK cells in controlling LCMV and MCMV infections and outline the exquisite interplay between NK cells and other immune cells in these two settings. Considering that, infections with MCMV and LCMV recapitulates many physiopathological characteristics of human cytomegalovirus infection and chronic virus infections respectively, this study will extend our understanding of NK cells biology in interactions between the virus and its natural host.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, is a promising treatment modality in oncology that involves augmenting the tumor-attacking capabilities of the immune system. Several preclinical and clinical studies have underscored the transformative potential of ICBs in the context of malignancies. 1 However, the efficacy of ICB therapy is often impeded by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in solid tumors, which are commonly due to a paucity of tumor neoantigens, checkpoint targets, and the inflammatory presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is profoundly immunosuppressive, which is the key reason for the limited clinical efficacy of ICB therapy. Within this milieu, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant myeloid cell subset, and their high infiltration levels have been implicated in mediating resistance to ICB therapy, thereby correlating with adverse prognosis across a spectrum of cancers. 3 Recent advances reported in Nature Cancer have shed light on specific TAM subpopulations that are instrumental in facilitating tumor immune evasion and resistance to ICB therapy.

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) mediate host defense against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and tumors. However, the magnitude of CTL response and their function needed to confer heterosubtypic immunity against influenza virus infection are unknown. We addressed the role of CD8+ T cells in the absence of any cross-reactive antibody responses to influenza viral proteins using an adenoviral vector expressing a 9mer amino acid sequence recognized by CD8+ T cells. Our results indicate that both CD8+ T cell frequency and function are crucial for heterosubtypic immunity. Low morbidity, lower viral lung titers, low to minimal lung pathology, and better survival upon heterosubtypic virus challenge correlated with the increased frequency of NP-specific CTLs. NP-CD8+ T cells induced by differential infection doses displayed distinct RNA transcriptome profiles and functional properties. CD8+ T cells induced by a high dose of influenza virus secreted significantly higher levels of IFN-γ and exhibited higher levels of cytotoxic function. The mice that received NP-CD8+ T cells from the high-dose virus recipients through adoptive transfer had lower viral titers following viral challenge than those induced by the low dose of virus, suggesting differential cellular programming by antigen dose. Enhanced NP-CD8+ T-cell functions induced by a higher dose of influenza virus strongly correlated with the increased expression of cellular and metabolic genes, indicating a shift to a more glycolytic metabolic phenotype. These findings have implications for developing effective T cell vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.


IMPORTANCE
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are an important component of the adaptive immune system that clears virus-infected cells or tumor cells. Hence, developing next-generation vaccines that induce or recall CTL responses against cancer and infectious diseases is crucial. However, it is not clear if the frequency, function, or both are essential in conferring protection, as in the case of influenza. In this study, we demonstrate that both CTL frequency and function are crucial for providing heterosubtypic immunity to influenza by utilizing an Ad-viral vector expressing a CD8 epitope only to rule out the role of antibodies, single-cell RNA-seq analysis, as well as adoptive transfer experiments. Our findings have implications for developing T cell vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract As a major immune cell type in the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages secrete suppressive factors that can inhibit antitumor immunity and promote tumor progression. One approach trying to utilize macrophages for immunotherapy has been to block the CD47-SIRPα axis, which mediates inhibitory signaling, to promote phagocytosis of tumor cells. Many CD47-targeted agents, namely, anti-CD47 antibodies and SIRPα fusion proteins, were associated with a diverse spectrum of toxicities that limit their use in clinical settings. Universal expression of CD47 also leads to a severe “antigen sink” effect of CD47-targeted agents. Given that the CD47 receptor, SIRPα, has a more restricted expression profile and may have CD47-independent functions, targeting SIRPα is considered to have distinct advantages in improving clinical efficacy with a better safety profile. We have developed ES004-B5, a potentially best-in-class pan-allelic human SIRPα-blocking antibody using hybridoma technology. ES004-B5 binds to major human SIRPα variants through a unique epitope with high affinity. By blocking CD47-induced inhibitory “don't-eat-me” signaling, ES004-B5 exerts superior antitumor activity in combination with anti-tumor-associated antigen antibodies in vitro and in vivo. Unlike CD47-targeted agents, ES004-B5 exhibits an excellent safety profile in nonhuman primates. ES004-B5 has potential to be an important backbone for SIRPα-based combination therapy and/or bispecific antibodies, which will likely overcome the limitations of CD47-targeted agents encountered in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="The symbiotic relationship between host and microbiota plays a pivotal role in training and development of the host’s innate and adaptive immune systems. Antigen-specific recognition of microbiota by T cells enforces tolerance at homeostasis. Conversely, dysbiosis—characterized by alterations in microbiota diversity and abundance—leads to imbalanced T cell responses and triggering of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Despite their significance, the identities of immunogenic microbial antigens are still largely enigmatic. Here, we leveraged an in-house developed antigen screening platform, the MCR system 1, to delineate CD4+ T cell reactivity against Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT), —two prominent members of the gut microbiota. T-cell hybridomas reactive to AKK and BT bacteria showed polyreactivity to select microbiota-derived peptides in MCR co-cultures. We discovered 13 novel antigenic epitopes from AKK and 14 from BT. Steady-state T cells recognized these epitopes in an MHC-restricted fashion. Ex vivo stimulation of peptide-specific T cells revealed induction of type 1 and type 17 immune responses, albeit with non-overlapping specificities, contrary to MCR system results. Our findings further demonstrated that most identified epitopes are broadly conserved within the given phylum and originate from both membrane and intracellular proteins. Our work showcases the potential of the MCR system for identifying immunogenic microbial epitopes, providing a valuable resource. Additionally, it indicates the existence of mucosal T cells with a tropism toward broadly conserved bacterial epitopes. Overall, our study forms the basis for decoding antigen specificity in immune system-bacterial interactions, with applications in understanding both microbiome and pathogenic bacterial immunity.">

        <tr id="Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) represents endogenous mechanisms of negative immunoregulation. While the modulation of effector functions has been the major focus of PD-1 research, quick PD-1 upregulation in naïve T cells starting 1 h after priming raised a possibility that PD-1 also affects the development of effector T cells. The role of PD-1 in functional differentiation into Th1 and Th2 has been unclear. In murine naïve CD4+ T cell activation, we found that PD-1 stimulation during the early stage of T cell activation strongly impaired Th2 cell development, while Th1 cell induction was relatively resistant to this immunosuppressive signaling. The steep decline in Th2 cell induction suggested the significance of PD-1 in allergic inflammation. Treatment with anti-human PD-1 agonist antibody inhibited allergic inflammation in human PD-1-knock-in mice as shown by the reduction of Th2 cells, IgE levels and eosinophilic infiltration. This study shows that PD-1 regulates not only the intensity but also the quality of immune response by deviating Th differentiation. PD-1 stimulators are projected to be valuable in suppressing various forms of inflammatory activities, but the efficacy against Th2-dominant immune response may be particularly high.">

Generating effective CD8+ T cell responses may be important for improving vaccination outcomes in vulnerable populations, but neonatal T cells frequently respond differently than adult cells. We sought to understand CD8+ T cell specificity and immunodominance during neonatal influenza infection and how any differences from the adult hierarchy might impact peptide vaccine effectiveness. Neonatal C57BL/6 mice displayed an altered CD8+ T cell immunodominance hierarchy during influenza infection, preferentially responding to an epitope in the influenza protein PA rather than the co-dominant adult response to NP and PA. Heterosubtypic infections in mice first infected as pups also displayed altered immunodominance and reduced protection compared to mice first infected as adults. Adoptive transfer of influenza-infected bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells promoted an NP-specific CD8+ T cell response in influenza-virus-infected pups and increased viral clearance. Finally, pups responded to PA (224–233), but not NP (366–374) during peptide vaccination. PA (224–233)-vaccinated mice were not protected during viral challenge.

        <tr id="Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality. Editor’s summary During embryonic development, macrophages interact with blood stem cells, removing those exhibiting high levels of cellular stress. The surviving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can proliferate and give rise to blood cell linages in adults. Pessoa Rodrigues et al. used zebrafish models and mammalian systems to investigate signals within HSPCs that could prevent macrophages from engulfing them. Molecules associated with innate immune nucleic acid sensing promoted the expression of Beta-2-microglobulin on the surface of HSPCs to increase their survival when they interacted with macrophages. Impairing this pathway decreased the number of distinct stem cell clones in adult zebrafish. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) produce mature blood cells throughout life. During this process, HSPCs engage in interactions with the variety of cells present in the marrow niche, including macrophages. These macrophages mediate a myriad of processes by releasing cytokines and chemokines and patrolling to remove stressed, dead, or aging cells. In this manner, macrophages contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During hematopoiesis, macrophages ensure the quality of normal blood stem cells and determine the number of hematopoietic clones that participate in adult hematopoiesis. They then either engulf a stem cell completely, referred to as “dooming,” or capture portions of the stem cell’s cellular material, referred to as “grooming.” After grooming, the stem cell continues to divide, whereas the doomed HSPC clone is eliminated. RATIONALE Past work has shown that the HSPC-macrophage interaction is mediated by an “eat-me” signal, calreticulin (Calr), on the surface of HSPCs. Surface Calr levels are increased in stem cells with higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this triggers macrophages to engulf and kill stem cells that have high amounts of stress-activated proteins. However, the specific molecular cues that regulate the dooming versus grooming behavior are still unknown. RESULTS To investigate the cues mediating grooming versus dooming, we screened a panel of 1200 bioactive small molecules in human cells and identified 93 compounds that robustly increased surface CALR in a dose-dependent manner. Of these compounds, 22 also facilitated interactions between macrophages and stem cells in zebrafish. Compounds that depended on ROS to increase CALR showed higher dooming ratios and, conversely, animals treated with ROS-independent compounds exhibited a higher probability of grooming events despite increased CALR and increased macrophage–stem cell interactions. To investigate the signals involved in interactions under ROS-independent conditions, we undertook a genome-wide screen in human cells. We identified Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as a CALR inducer in the “don’t eat me” context. Next, we found that TLR3 expression was required for the expression of the “don’t eat me” signal Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). Antibody staining and studies of a b2m knockout zebrafish line showed that b2m on stem cells was required for preventing the macrophage dooming. To determine whether the increased dooming observed in the b2m mutant affected clonal dominance, we generated mosaic deletions using the zebrabow color barcoding system (TWISTR) as a lineage tracer. Mosaic deletion of b2m reduced the number of myeloid clones but increased clonal dominance. The dominant clones in these fish were wild type for b2m that were resistant to dooming and overtook the adult marrow. TLR3 signaling is activated by double-stranded RNA, which can sometimes be found in cells due to the expression of transcripts associated with repetitive elements (REs), including long terminal repeats (LTRs) and endogenous retroviruses. RE expression in HSPCs positively correlated with elevated levels of B2m. Moreover, overexpressing ltr4 in zebrafish led to higher HSPC proliferation, indicative of decreased dooming. Impairing the TLR3-B2M pathway by disrupting the expression of TLR3, IRF3, or B2M expression decreased the number of blood cell clones in zebrafish. Using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor CM272 to promote up-regulation of REs amplified the proliferation of already established HSPC clones in zebrafish embryos. CONCLUSION Our findings support a model in which endogenous TLR3 ligands lead to expression of b2m, thereby providing a blockade against macrophage-induced dooming and determining hematopoietic stem cell clonality by monitoring stem cell quality with macrophages. The balance of Calr and B2m governs the number of long-lived HSC clones that contribute to the adult blood system through macrophage-mediated quality assurance. This sheds light on the intricate interplay between HSPC clonal expansion and immune-regulated cell clearance. We propose that this protective mechanism may also operate in adulthood in response to environmental stress, such as during infections or in clonal stem cell disorders. Manipulating the levels of “don’t eat-me” and “eat-me” signals may have important therapeutic implications for immune therapy by harnessing the macrophage-selective removal of a mutated stem cell clone. ROS and TLR3 signaling mediates the “eat-me” and “don’t eat me” signals that determine stem cell clonal selection by macrophages. Shown is a schematic overview of the proposed model showing the balance between the Calr-mediated “eat-me” and B2m-mediated “don’t eat-me” signals that influence macrophage behavior.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoints are mechanisms that allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and avoid destruction by the body’s immune system. Tumor cells exploit immune checkpoint proteins to inhibit T cell activation, thus enhancing their resistance to immune attacks. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, like nivolumab, work by reactivating these suppressed T cells to target cancer cells. However, this reactivation can disrupt immune balance and cause immune-related adverse events. This report presents a rare case of prurigo nodularis that developed six months after administering nivolumab for lung adenocarcinoma. While immune-related adverse events are commonly linked to T helper-1- or T helper-17-type inflammations, T helper-2-type inflammatory reactions, as observed in our case, are unusual. The PD-1–PD-L1 pathway is typically associated with T helper-1 and 17 responses, whereas the PD-1–PD-L2 pathway is linked to T helper-2 responses. Inhibition of PD-1 can enhance PD-L1 functions, potentially shifting the immune response towards T helper-1 and 17 types, but it may also influence T helper-2-type inflammation. This study reviews T helper-2-type inflammatory diseases emerging from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, highlighting the novelty of our findings.">

These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell-mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co-culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium-throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGFβ type I receptor (TGFβR-1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGFβR-1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGFβR-1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer presents as an immunologically "cold" malignancy, characterized by a lack of response to immunotherapy in the majority of patients. The dysfunction of prostate tumor metabolism is recognized as a critical factor in immune evasion, resulting in reduced effectiveness of immunotherapeutic interventions. Despite this awareness, the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning metabolic dysregulation in prostate cancer and its intricate relationship with immune evasion remain incompletely elucidated. In this study, we introduce the multi-drug resistance protein ABCC4/MRP4 as a key player prominently expressed in prostate cancer, exerting a pivotal role in suppressing the activity of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. Depletion of ABCC4 in prostate cancer cells halts the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a molecule that diminishes the population of CD8+ T cells and curtails their cytotoxic capabilities. Conversely, constraining the activation of PGE2 signaling in CD8+ T cells effectively improved the efficacy of prostate cancer treatment with PD-1 blockade. During this process, downregulation of the JAK1-STAT3 pathway and depolarization of mitochondria emerge as crucial factors contributing to T cell anergy. Collectively, our research identifies the ABCC4-PGE2 axis as a promising target for reversing dysfunction within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and augmenting the suboptimal responsiveness to immunotherapy in prostate cancer.">

        <tr id="Combination therapy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved the prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but many patients still have unsatisfactory outcomes. CD8 T cells are known to exert a pivotal function in the immune response against tumors. Nevertheless, most CD8 T cells in HCC tissues are in a state of exhaustion, losing the cytotoxic activity against malignant cells. Cytokines, mainly secreted by immune cells, play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here, we demonstrated the changes in exhausted CD8T cells during combination therapy by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on tumor samples before and after treatment. Combination therapy exerted a substantial impact on the exhausted CD8T cells, particularly in terms of cytokine expression. CCL5 was the most abundantly expressed cytokine in CD8T cells and exhausted CD8T cells, and its expression increased further after treatment. Subsequently, we discovered the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on CCL5-stimulated Huh7 cells and verified through a series of experiments that this pathway can mediate the resistance of liver cancer cells to lenvatinib. Tissue experiments showed that after combination therapy, the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway was activated, which can benefit the residual tumor cells to survive treatment. Tumor-bearing mouse experiments demonstrated that bergamottin (BGM), a competitive inhibitor of CYP1A1, can enhance the efficacy of both lenvatinib and combination therapy. Our research revealed one mechanism by which hepatoma cells can survive the combination therapy, providing a theoretical basis for the refined treatment of HCC.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant aggravating factor in individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for TB, and HIV-1 target macrophages. Understanding how Mtb subverts these cells may facilitate the identification of new druggable targets. Here, we explored how TB can induce macrophages to form tunneling nanotubes (TNT), promoting HIV-1 spread. We found that TB triggers metabolic rewiring of macrophages, increasing their glycolytic ATP production. Using pharmacological inhibitors and glucose deprivation, we discovered that disrupting aerobic glycolysis significantly reduces HIV-1 exacerbation in these macrophages. Glycolysis is essential for tunneling nanotubes (TNT) formation, which facilitates viral transfer and cell-to-cell fusion and induces the expression of the sialoadhesin Siglec-1, enhancing both HIV-1 binding and TNT stabilization. Glycolysis did not exacerbate HIV-1 infection when TNT formation was pharmacologically prevented, indicating that higher metabolic activity is not sufficient per se to make macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1. Overall, these data might facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting glycolytic activity in TB-induced immunomodulatory macrophages to ultimately halt HIV-1 dissemination in co-infected patients.">

        <tr id="Recent advancements in mucosal immunology have unveiled a complex network of intercellular connections within diverse tissues, shedding light on the unique properties of different cell types. Central to this intricate network is the cytokine IL-33, which has gained significant attention for its critical role in various diseases, from allergy to cancer, triggering type 2 immune responses, among others. Recent research has challenged the prior assumptions attributing IL-33 expression to epithelial cells, highlighting stromal cells as the predominant source in adipose tissue and the lungs. However, in the complex landscape of the intestine, where IL-33 plays a crucial role in mediating immune surveillance and tolerance and is implicated in many gut-related disorders, its primary source, regulation, and main characteristics need more exploration. This study identifies stromal cells as the primary IL-33-expressing cell type in the small intestine. By investigating their transcriptome and intrinsic signaling pathways, we have uncovered a possible role of IL-33+ stromal cells in maintaining the stem cell niche and their potential crosstalk with neurons relevant to the regulation of axonogenesis. Importantly, our experiments have demonstrated that vasoactive intestinal peptide stimulation of a primary intestinal stromal cell culture significantly amplifies IL-33 expression on mRNA and protein level. Therefore, our study represents a significant leap forward in understanding the plethora of interactions IL-33+ intestinal stromal cells maintain in the intestine, paving the way for future investigations into stromal-neuro crosstalk in the gut. These findings hold great promise for developing targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at harnessing the potential of IL-33 across a spectrum of diseases.">

 A major challenge in osteosarcoma (OS) immunotherapy is overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), to restore immune recognition and destruction of tumor cells. One of the key immune cell subsets known to contribute to the immunosuppressive TME are M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Our work aims to identify novel oncolytic virus (OV) combination immunotherapies to induce direct lysis of OS tumor cells, activate immune-mediated destruction of OS, and remodel the immunosuppressive TME. The direct lytic activity of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV; HSV1716) treatment was assessed using LIVE/DEAD flow cytometry and viral replication was measured using standard plaque assay. NK cell degranulation and killing assays were performed by co-culture of OS cell lines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) treated ± oHSV; NK cell degranulation and target cell death was assessed by flow cytometry. TAMs were generated in vitro by co-culture of PBMC with OS cell lines or primary bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for 7 days. Phagocytosis assays were performed by co-culture of TAMs with OS cells using fluorescent cell tracker stains and flow cytometry. Multicellular spheroids were generated by co-culture of firefly luciferase-expressing OS cell lines with CD14+ monocytes and bone marrow derived MSCs for 7 days in low adhesion plates, viability of tumor cells after treatment was assessed by addition of d-luciferin and quantification of luminescence. Treatment of four OS cell lines with oHSV for 72 hours resulted in <20% cell death by direct lysis. However, after treatment with oHSV-GFP, >95% of OS cells were GFP+ and viral titer increased up to 105-fold when compared to viral input. This highlighted high levels of infection and replication of oHSV within OS cell lines, despite limited oncolysis. Moreover, oHSV treatment of PBMC significantly enhanced the immune-mediated killing of OS cell lines, and this was NK cell dependent. Monolayer co-culture of PBMC with OS cell lines or MSC generated TAMs with significantly increased pro-tumor M2-like phenotype (CD14+CD206+CD163+), when compared with PBMC cultured alone, and TAMs suppressed NK cell degranulation against OS cell lines. Treatment of TAMS with oHSV encoding GM-CSF reduced the proportion of M2 TAMs. Moreover, treatment of OS target cells with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) and co-culture with in vitro generated TAMs significantly increased their phagocytic activity. Multicellular spheroids incorporating MSCs and CD14+ monocytes displayed a high degree of resistance against immune-mediated killing, when compared with OS cell line alone as monolayer or spheroid cultures. However, combination of OV with anti-EGFR mAb significantly increased immune-mediated killing against multicellular spheroids. oHSV combination strategies with mAb may be a promising treatment strategy against OS, to exert direct oncolysis, stimulate immune-mediated destruction, and remodel the immunosuppressive TME.

        <tr id="Hepatitis B, caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), often progresses to chronic infection, leading to severe complications, such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic HBV infection is characterized by a complex interplay between the virus and the host immune system, resulting in immune cell exhaustion, a phenomenon commonly observed in chronic viral infections and cancer. This state of exhaustion involves elevated levels of inhibitory molecules, cells, and cell surface receptors, as opposed to stimulatory counterparts. This review aims to elucidate the expression patterns of various co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptors on immune cells isolated from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. By analyzing existing data, the review conducts comparisons between CHB patients and healthy adults, explores the differences between HBV-specific and total T cells in CHB patients, and examines variations between intrahepatic and peripheral immune cells in CHB patients. Understanding the mechanisms underlying immune exhaustion in CHB is crucial for developing novel immunotherapeutic approaches. This detailed analysis sheds light on the immune exhaustion observed in CHB and lays the groundwork for future combined immunotherapy strategies aimed at leveraging checkpoint receptors to restore immune function and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Type I interferons (IFN) are immune-stimulatory cytokines involved in antiviral and antitumor immune responses. They enhance the efficacy of immunogenic anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy by activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Macrophages are one of the most abundant innate immune cells in the immune microenvironment of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) and can exert potent immune-suppressive functions. Here, we investigate the potential of tumoral type I IFNs to repolarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in two murine MBM models and assess the effects of radiotherapy-induced type I IFN on TAMs in a transcriptomic MBM patient dataset. In mice, we describe a proinflammatory M1-like TAM phenotype induced by tumoral IFNβ and identify a myeloid type I IFN-response signature associated with a high M1/M2-like TAM ratio. Following irradiation, patients with MBM displaying a myeloid type I IFN-response signature showed increased overall survival, providing evidence that tumoral IFNβ supports an effective antitumor immune response by re-educating immune-regulatory TAM. These findings uncover type I IFN–inducing therapies as a potential macrophage-targeting therapeutic approach and provide a rationale for combining radiotherapy with concomitant immunotherapy to improve treatment response in patients with MBM. Significance: Our study shows that re-education of tumor-associated macrophages by tumoral IFNβ translates into improved clinical outcome in patients with melanoma brain metastases, providing pathomechanistic insights into synergistic type I interferon–inducing therapies with immunotherapies and warranting investigation of IFNβ as a predictive biomarker for combined radioimmunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The control of bacterial growth is key to the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Granulomas represent independent foci of the host immune response that present heterogeneous capacity for control of bacterial growth. At the whole tissue level, B cells and CD4 or CD8 T cells have an established role in immune protection against TB. Immune cells interact within each granuloma response, but the impact of granuloma immune composition on bacterial replication remains unknown. Here we investigate the associations between immune cell composition, including B cell, CD4, and CD8 T cells, and the state of replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) within the granuloma. A measure of ribosomal RNA synthesis, the RS ratio®, represents a proxy measure of Mtb replication at the whole tissue level. We adapted the RS ratio through use of in situ hybridization, to identify replicating and non-replicating Mtb within each designated granuloma. We applied a regression model to characterize the associations between immune cell populations and the state of Mtb replication within each respective granuloma. In the evaluation of nearly 200 granulomas, we identified heterogeneity in both immune cell composition and proportion of replicating bacteria. We found clear evidence of directional associations between immune cell composition and replicating Mtb. Controlling for vaccination status and endpoint post-infection, granulomas with lower CD4 or higher CD8 cell counts are associated with a higher percent of replicating Mtb. Conversely, changes in B cell proportions were associated with little change in Mtb replication. This study establishes heterogeneity across granulomas, demonstrating that certain immune cell types are differentially associated with control of Mtb replication. These data suggest that evaluation at the granuloma level may be imperative to identifying correlates of immune protection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background and Aim Chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection remains a major public health problem. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2018 Hepatitis B Guidelines provide that CHB individuals not requiring antiviral therapy yet are monitored to determine the need for antiviral therapy in the future; however, these tests do not include measurement of cytokines and immune cell characterization. This case‐control study compared the cytokine and immune checkpoint protein expression profiles between CHB individuals not yet on antiviral treatment and hepatitis B virus (HBV)‐negative individuals. Methods CD4 and CD8 T cells from CHB and HBV‐negative individuals were characterized for immune checkpoint proteins programmed cell death‐1 (PD1), T cell Immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain‐containing protein 3 (TIM‐3), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte‐associated antigen 4 (CTLA‐4) (CD152), and a memory marker CXCR3 (CD183) using flow cytometry. Malaria‐induced cytokine expression levels were determined by stimulating their blood cells with Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain antigens (CSP, AMA‐1, and TRAP) in whole blood assays, and cytokine levels were measured using a 13‐plex Luminex kit. Results HBV‐negative and CHB individuals had comparable levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, a proportion of the CD4+ and CD8+ populations from both groups, which were CXCR3+, expressed PD‐1 and CD152. The ability to produce cytokines in response to malaria antigen stimulation was not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion These findings support excluding CHB individuals from antiviral therapy at this stage of infection. However, CHB individuals require regular monitoring to determine the need for later antiviral treatment.">

        <tr id="Background: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that can cause pulmonary hypertension (PH). Th2 CD4 T cells are necessary for experimental Schistosoma-PH. However, if T cells migrate to the lung to initiate, the localized inflammation that drives vascular remodeling and PH is unknown. Methods: Mice were sensitized to Schistosoma mansoni eggs intraperitoneally and then challenged using tail vein injection. FTY720 was administered, which blocks lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes. T cells were quantified using flow cytometry, PH severity via heart catheterization, and cytokine concentration through ELISA. Results: FTY720 decreased T cells in the peripheral blood, and increased T cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes. However, FTY720 treatment resulted in no change in PH or type 2 inflammation severity in mice sensitized and challenged with S. mansoni eggs, and the number of memory and effector CD4 T cells in the lung parenchyma was also unchanged. Notably, intraperitoneal Schistosoma egg sensitization alone resulted in a significant increase in intravascular lymphocytes and T cells, including memory T cells, although there was no significant change in parenchymal cell density, IL-4 or IL-13 expression, or PH. Conclusion: Blocking T cell migration did not suppress PH following Schistosoma egg challenge. Memory CD4 T cells, located in the lung intravascular space following egg sensitization, appear sufficient to cause type 2 inflammation and PH.">

        <tr id="PRF1 (perforin 1) is a key cytotoxic molecule that plays a crucial role in the killing function of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Recent studies have focused on PRF1’s role in cancer development, progression, and prognosis. Studies have shown that aberrant PRF1 expression has a significant role to play in cancer development and progression. In some cancers, high expression of the PRF1 gene is associated with a better prognosis for patients, possibly because it helps enhance the body’s immune response to tumors. However, some studies have also shown that the absence of PRF1 may make it easier for tumors to evade the body’s immune surveillance, thus affecting patient survival. Furthermore, recent studies have explored therapeutic strategies based on PRF1, such as enhancing the ability of immune cells to kill cancer cells by boosting PRF1 activity. In addition, they have improved the efficacy of immunotherapy by modulating its expression to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment. Based on these findings, PRF1 may be a valuable biomarker both for the treatment of cancer and for its prognosis in the future. To conclude, PRF1 has an important biological function and has clinical potential for the treatment of cancer, which indicates that it deserves more research and development in the future.">

        <tr id="Introduction Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important tropical and neglected disease and represents a serious global health problem. The initial interaction between the phagocytes and the parasite is crucial to determine the pathogen’s capacity to initiate infection and it shapes the subsequent immune response that will develop. While type-1 T-cells induce IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-12 production by monocytes/macrophages to fight the infection, type-2 T-cells are associated with a regulatory phenotype (IL-10 and TGF-β) and successful infection establishment. Recently, our group demonstrated the role of an important Th1/Th17 T-cell population, the mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, in VL. MAIT cells can respond to L. infantum by producing TNF-α and IFN-γ upon MR1-dependent activation. Objective and methods Here, we describe the impact of the MR1-blockage on L. infantum internalization on the functional profile of circulating neutrophils and monocytes as well as the impact of the MR1-blockage on the soluble mediator signatures of in vitro whole blood cultures. Results Overall, our data showed that VL patients presents higher percentage of activated neutrophils than asymptomatic and non-infected controls. In addition, MR1 blockade led to lower TNF-α and TGF-β production by non-activated neutrophils from asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, TNF-α and IL-10 production by monocytes was higher in VL patients. In the analysis of soluble mediators produced in vitro, MR1-blockade induced a decrease of IFN-γ and an increase of IL-10, IL-27 and IL-33 in the cell cultures of AS group, a cytokine pattern associated with type 2 deleterious response. Discussion and conclusion These data corroborate the hypothesis that MR1-restricted responses are associated to a protective role during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Hypertension (HTN) impacts almost half of adults, predisposing them to cardiovascular disease and renal damage. Salt-sensitive HTN (SSHTN) and angiotensin II (A2)-induced HTN (A2HTN) both involve immune system activation and renal innate immune cell infiltration. Subpopulations of activated [Cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38)] innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), play distinct roles in modulating renal function and blood pressure. It is unknown how these cells become CD38+ or which subtypes are pro-hypertensive. When bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs) were grown in granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and treated with salt or A2, CD38+ macrophages and CD38+ DCs increased. The adoptive transfer of GM-CSF-primed BMDMs into mice with either SSHTN or A2HTN increased renal CD38+ macrophages and CD38+ DCs. Flow cytometry revealed increased renal M1 macrophages and type-2 conventional DCs (cDC2s), along with their CD38+ counterparts, in mice with either SSHTN or A2HTN. These results were replicable in vitro. Either salt or A2 treatment of GM-CSF-primed BMDMs significantly increased bone marrow-derived (BMD)-M1 macrophages, CD38+ BMD-M1 macrophages, BMD-cDC2s, and CD38+ BMD-cDC2s. Overall, these data suggest that GM-CSF is necessary for the salt or A2 induction of CD38+ innate immune cells, and that CD38 distinguishes pro-hypertensive immune cells. Further investigation of CD38+ M1 macrophages and CD38+ cDC2s could provide new therapeutic targets for both SSHTN and A2HTN.">

        <tr id="Bone metastases, a common and debilitating consequence of advanced cancers, involve a complex interplay between malignant cells and the bone microenvironment. Central to this interaction are interleukins (ILs), a group of cytokines with critical roles in immune modulation and inflammation. This review explores the dualistic nature of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory interleukins in bone metastases, emphasizing their molecular mechanisms, pathological impacts, and therapeutic potential. Pro-inflammatory interleukins, such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, have been identified as key drivers in promoting osteoclastogenesis, tumor proliferation, and angiogenesis. These cytokines create a favorable environment for cancer cell survival and bone degradation, contributing to the progression of metastatic lesions. Conversely, anti-inflammatory interleukins, including IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, exhibit protective roles by modulating immune responses and inhibiting osteoclast activity. Understanding these opposing effects is crucial for developing targeted therapies aimed at disrupting the pathological processes in bone metastases. Key signaling pathways, including NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and MAPK, mediate the actions of these interleukins, influencing tumor cell survival, immune cell recruitment, and bone remodeling. Targeting these pathways presents promising therapeutic avenues. Current treatment strategies, such as the use of denosumab, tocilizumab, and emerging agents like bimekizumab and ANV419, highlight the potential of interleukin-targeted therapies in mitigating bone metastases. However, challenges such as therapeutic resistance, side effects, and long-term efficacy remain significant hurdles. This review also addresses the potential of interleukins as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, offering insights into patient stratification and personalized treatment approaches. Interleukins have multifaceted roles that depend on the context, including the environment, cell types, and cellular interactions. Despite substantial progress, gaps in research persist, particularly regarding the precise mechanisms by which interleukins influence the bone metastatic niche and their broader clinical implications. While not exhaustive, this overview underscores the critical roles of interleukins in bone metastases and highlights the need for continued research to fully elucidate their complex interactions and therapeutic potential. Addressing these gaps will be essential for advancing our understanding and treatment of bone metastases in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Chronic infection with Schistosoma mansoni parasites is associated with reduced allergic sensitization in humans, while schistosome eggs protects against allergic airway inflammation (AAI) in mice. One of the main secretory/excretory molecules from schistosome eggs is the glycosylated T2-RNAse Omega-1 (ω1). We hypothesized that ω1 induces protection against AAI during infection. Peritoneal administration of ω1 prior to sensitization with Ovalbumin (OVA) reduced airway eosinophilia and pathology, and OVA-specific Th2 responses upon challenge, independent from changes in regulatory T cells. ω1 was taken up by monocyte-derived dendritic cells, mannose receptor (CD206)-positive conventional type 2 dendritic cells (CD206+ cDC2), and by recruited peritoneal macrophages. Additionally, ω1 impaired CCR7, F-actin, and costimulatory molecule expression on myeloid cells and cDC2 migration in and ex vivo, as evidenced by reduced OVA+ CD206+ cDC2 in the draining mediastinal lymph nodes (medLn) and retainment in the peritoneal cavity, while antigen processing and presentation in cDC2 were not affected by ω1 treatment. Importantly, RNAse mutant ω1 was unable to reduce AAI or affect DC migration, indicating that ω1 effects are dependent on its RNAse activity. Altogether, ω1 hampers migration of OVA+ cDC2 to the draining medLn in mice, elucidating how ω1 prevents allergic airway inflammation in the OVA/alum mouse model.">

        <tr id="The programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) immune checkpoint constitutes an inhibitory pathway best known for its regulation of cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cell-mediated immune responses. Engagement of PD-L1 with PD-1 expressed on CD8+ T cells activates downstream signaling pathways that culminate in T cell exhaustion and/or apoptosis. Physiologically, these immunosuppressive effects exist to prevent autoimmunity, but cancer cells exploit this pathway by overexpressing PD-L1 to facilitate immune escape. Intravenously (IV) administered immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that block the interaction between PD-1/PD-L1 have achieved great success in reversing T cell exhaustion and promoting tumor regression in various malignancies. However, these ICIs can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to off-tumor toxicities which limits their therapeutic potential. Therefore, considerable effort has been channeled into exploring alternative delivery strategies that enhance tumor-directed delivery of PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs and reduce irAEs. Here, we briefly describe PD-1/PD-L1-targeted cancer immunotherapy and associated irAEs. We then provide a detailed review of alternative delivery approaches, including locoregional (LDD)-, oncolytic virus (OV)-, nanoparticle (NP)-, and ultrasound and microbubble (USMB)-mediated delivery that are currently under investigation for enhancing tumor-specific delivery to minimize toxic off-tumor effects. We conclude with a commentary on key challenges associated with these delivery methods and potential strategies to mitigate them.">

        <tr id="HIV-induced persistent immune activation is a key mediator of inflammatory comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurocognitive disorders. While a preponderance of data indicate that gut barrier disruption and microbial translocation are drivers of chronic immune activation, the molecular mechanisms of this persistent inflammatory state remain poorly understood. Here, utilizing the nonhuman primate model of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection with suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), we investigated activation of inflammasome pathways and their association with intestinal epithelial barrier disruption (IEBD). Longitudinal blood samples obtained from rhesus macaques with chronic SIV infection and long-term suppressive ART were evaluated for IEBD biomarkers, inflammasome activation (IL-1β and IL-18), inflammatory cytokines, and triglyceride (TG) levels. Activated monocyte subpopulations and glycolytic potential were investigated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). During the chronic phase of treated SIV infection, elevated levels of plasma IL-1β and IL-18 were observed following the hallmark increase in IEBD biomarkers, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP) and LPS-binding protein (LBP). Further, significant correlations of plasma IFABP levels with IL-1β and IL-18 were observed between 10 and 12 months of ART. Higher levels of sCD14, IL-6, and GM-CSF, among other inflammatory mediators, were also observed only during the long-term SIV + ART phase along with a trend of increase in the frequencies of activated CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocyte subpopulations. Lastly, we found elevated levels of blood TG and higher glycolytic capacity in PBMCs of chronic SIV-infected macaques with long-term ART. The increase in circulating IL-18 and IL-1β following IEBD and their significant positive correlation with IFABP suggest a connection between gut barrier disruption and inflammasome activation during chronic SIV infection, despite viral suppression with ART. Additionally, the increase in markers of monocyte activation, along with elevated TG and enhanced glycolytic pathway activity, indicates metabolic remodeling that could fuel metabolic syndrome. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which gut dysfunction and inflammasome activation contribute to HIV-associated metabolic complications, enabling targeted interventions in people with HIV.">

        <tr id="Background Gamma-delta (γδ) T cells are a major immune cell subset in pigs. Approximately 50% of circulating T cells are γδ T cells in young pigs and up to 30% in adult sows. Despite this abundance, the functions of porcine γδ T cells are mostly unidentified. In humans and mice, activated γδ T cells exhibit broad innate cytotoxic activity against a wide variety of stressed, infected, and cancerous cells through death receptor/ligand-dependent and perforin/granzyme-dependent pathways. However, so far, it is unknown whether porcine γδ T cells have the ability to perform cytotoxic functions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of porcine γδ T cells isolated from blood, lung, and nasal mucosa. To further analyze the cytolytic potential of γδ T cells, in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed using purified γδ T cells as effector cells and virus-exposed or mock-treated primary porcine alveolar macrophages as target cells. Results Our results show that only CD2+ γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers (CD16, NKp46, perforin) with higher perforin and NKp46 expression in γδ T cells isolated from lung and nasal mucosa. Moreover, we found that γδ T cells can exhibit cytotoxic functions in a cell-cell contact and degranulation-dependent manner. However, porcine γδ T cells did not seem to specifically target Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus or swine Influenza A Virus-infected macrophages, which may be due to viral escape mechanisms. Conclusion Porcine γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers and can exhibit cytotoxic activity in vitro. The specific mechanisms by which porcine γδ T cells recognize target cells are not fully understood but may involve the detection of cellular stress signals.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cervical cancer has the second-highest mortality rate among malignant tumors of the female reproductive system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade are promising therapeutic agents, but their efficacy when combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has not been fully tested, and how they alter the tumor microenvironment has not been comprehensively elucidated. Methods In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing using 46,950 cells from nine human cervical cancer tissues representing sequential different stages of NACT and PD-1 blockade combination therapy. We delineated the trajectory of cervical epithelial cells and identified the crucial factors involved in combination therapy. Cell–cell communication analysis was performed between tumor and immune cells. In addition, THP-1-derived and primary monocyte-derived macrophages were cocultured with cervical cancer cells and phagocytosis was detected by flow cytometry. The antitumor activity of blocking CD74 was validated in vivo using a CD74 humanized subcutaneous tumor model. Results Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that NACT activated cytokine and complement-related immune responses. Cell–cell communication analysis revealed that after NACT therapy, interaction strength between T cells and cancer cells decreased, but intensified between macrophages and cancer cells. We verified that macrophages were necessary for the PD-1 blockade to exert antitumor effects in vitro. Additionally, CD74-positive macrophages frequently interacted with the most immunoreactive epithelial subgroup 3 (Epi3) cancer subgroup during combination NACT. We found that CD74 upregulation limited phagocytosis and stimulated M2 polarization, whereas CD74 blockade enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, decreasing cervical cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions Our study reveals the dynamic cell–cell interaction network in the cervical cancer microenvironment influenced by combining NACT and PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, blocking tumor-associated macrophage-derived CD74 could augment neoadjuvant therapeutic efficacy.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease with unclear pathogenesis and no effective treatments. We aimed to investigate a novel mechanistic theory and treat HAM patients with rituximab, which can deplete CD20+ B lymphocytes in circulation.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data was analyzed to identify HTLV-1-associated B cells and their effect on T cells. An observational analysis of our HAM cohort was conducted to elucidate changes in the immunological microenvironment of these patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HAM patients were isolated to explore the efficacy of B cell depletion in vitro. To assess the effect of B-cell depletion on HAM patients, eligible participants in our cohort received rituximab therapy (NCT04004819).


RESULTS
ScRNA-seq results suggest a significant effect of HTLV-1-associated B cells on T cells. Additionally, HTLV-1 was found to infect B cells and depletion of B cells inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Number of B cells in HAM patients had positive correlation with the proviral load and infected cell counts. Depletion of B cells led to a reduction in HTLV-1 proviral load in vitro. Furthermore, in clinical trial, 14 HAM patients were enrolled. Three patients (21.4%) who received rituximab failed to achieve remission, compared to 24 (85.7%) patients received any other therapy that failed to achieve remission. With a low level of circulating B cells, the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in CD4+ T cells fell.


INTERPRETATION
This study provided evidence that depleting B-lymphocytes is an innovative strategy for treating patients with HAM and broadens the understanding of the role of B cells in infectious immunity.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Cystatin F (CstF) is a protease inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, including those involved in activating the perforin/granzyme cytotoxic pathways. It is targeted at the endolysosomal pathway but can also be secreted to the extracellular milieu or endocytosed by bystander cells. CstF was shown to be significantly increased in tuberculous pleurisy, and during HIV coinfection, pleural fluids display high viral loads. In human macrophages, our previous results revealed a strong upregulation of CstF in phagocytes activated by interferon γ or after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). CstF manipulation using RNA silencing led to increased proteolytic activity of lysosomal cathepsins, improving Mtb intracellular killing. In the present work, we investigate the impact of CstF depletion in macrophages during the coinfection of Mtb-infected phagocytes with lymphocytes infected with HIV. The results indicate that decreasing the CstF released by phagocytes increases the major pro-granzyme convertase cathepsin C of cytotoxic immune cells from peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes. Consequently, an observed augmentation of the granzyme B cytolytic activity leads to a significant reduction in viral replication in HIV-infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Ultimately, this knowledge can be crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches to control both pathogens based on manipulating CstF.">

        <tr id="Alloreactive memory T cells have been implicated as central drivers of transplant rejection. Perplexingly, innate cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-12, are also associated with rejection of organ transplants. However, the pathways of innate immune activation in allogeneic transplantation are unclear. While the role of microbial and cell death products has been previously described, we identified alloreactive memory CD4 T cells as the primary triggers of innate inflammation. Memory CD4 T cells engaged MHC II-mismatched dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the production of innate inflammatory cytokines. This innate inflammation was independent of several pattern recognition receptors and was primarily driven by TNF superfamily ligands expressed by alloreactive memory CD4 T cells. Blocking of CD40L and TNFα resulted in dampened inflammation, and mice genetically deficient in these molecules exhibited prolonged survival of cardiac allografts. Furthermore, myeloid cell and CD8 T cell infiltration into cardiac transplants was compromised in both CD40L- and TNFα-deficient recipients. Strikingly, we found that priming of naive alloreactive CD8 T cells was dependent on licensing of DCs by memory CD4 T cells. This study unravels the key mechanisms by which alloreactive memory CD4 T cells contribute to destructive pathology and transplant rejection.">

        <tr id="Cellular senescence has been increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer, reflecting its association with aging and inflammation, its role as a response to deregulated proliferation and oncogenic stress, and its induction by cancer therapies. While therapy-induced senescence (TIS) has been linked to resistance, recurrence, metastasis, and normal tissue toxicity, TIS also has the potential to enhance therapy response and stimulate anti-tumor immunity. In this review, we examine the Jekyll and Hyde nature of senescent cells (SnCs), focusing on how their persistence while expressing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) modulates the tumor microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Through the SASP, SnCs can mediate both resistance and response to cancer therapies. To fulfill the unmet potential of cancer immunotherapy, we consider how SnCs may influence tumor inflammation and serve as an antigen source to potentiate anti-tumor immune response. This new perspective suggests treatment approaches based on TIS to enhance immune checkpoint blockade. Finally, we describe strategies for mitigating the detrimental effects of senescence, such as modulating the SASP or targeting SnC persistence, which may enhance the overall benefits of cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer. CRC has no apparent symptoms in the early stages of disease, and most patients receive a confirmed diagnosis in the middle or late disease stages. The incidence of CRC continues to increase, and the affected population tends to be younger. Therefore, determining how to achieve an early CRC diagnosis and treatment has become a top priority for prolonging patient survival. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a group of bone marrow-derived immuno-negative regulatory cells that are divided into two subpopulations, polymorphonuclear-MDSCs and monocytic-MDSCs, based on their phenotypic similarities to neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. These cells can inhibit the immune response and promote cancer cell metastasis in the tumour microenvironment (TME). A large aggregation of MDSCs in the TME is often a marker of cancer and a poor prognosis in inflammatory diseases of the intestine (such as colonic adenoma and ulcerative colitis). In the present review, the phenotypic classification of MDSCs in the CRC microenvironment are first discussed. Then, the amplification, role and metastatic mechanism of MDSCs in the CRC TME are described, focusing on genes, gene modifications, proteins and the intestinal micro-environment. Finally, the progress in CRC-targeted therapies that aim to modulate the quantity, function and structure of MDSCs are summarized in the hope of identifying potential screening markers for CRC and improving CRC prognosis and therapeutic options.">

        <tr id="One of major breakthroughs in immunotherapy against tumor is from blocking immune checkpoint molecules on tumor and reactive T cells. The development of CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockage antibodies has triggered to search for additional effective therapeutic strategies. This causes recent findings that blocking the interaction of checkpoint molecule NKG2A in NK and CD8 T cells with HLA-E in tumors is effective in defensing tumors. Interestingly, gut microbiota also affects this immune checkpoint immunotherapy against tumor. Gut microbiota such as bacteria can contribute to the regulation of host immune response and homeostasis. They not only promote the differentiation and function of immunosuppressive cells but also the inflammatory cells through the metabolites such as tryptophan (Trp) and bile acid (BA) metabolites as well as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). These gut microbiota metabolites (GMMs) educated immune cells can affect the differentiation and function of effective CD8 and NK cells. Notably, these metabolites also directly affect the activity of CD8 and NK cells. Furthermore, the expression of CD94/NKG2A in the immune cells and/or their ligand HLA-E in the tumor cells is also regulated by gut microbiota associated immune factors. These findings offer new insights for the clinical application of gut microbiota in precise and/or personalized treatments of tumors. In this review, we will discuss the impacts of GMMs and GMM educated immune cells on the activity of effective CD8 and NK cells and the expression of CD94/NKG2A in immune cells and/or their ligand HLA-E in tumor cells.">

        <tr id="Discovered over 4 decades ago in the supernatants of activated T cells, interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a potent pleiotropic cytokine involved in the regulation of immune responses. It is required for effector T cell expansion and differentiation as well as for peripheral tolerance induced by regulatory T cells. High-dose IL-2 treatment was the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, achieving single agent complete and durable responses, albeit only in a small proportion of patients. The therapeutic potential of wild type IL-2 is clinically limited by its short half-life and severe vascular toxicity. Moreover, the activation of regulatory T cells and the terminal differentiation of effector T cells on IL-2 pose additional restrictions. To overcome the toxicity of IL-2 in order to realize its full potential for patients, several novel engineering strategies are being developed and IL-2 based immunotherapy for cancer has emerged as a burgeoning field of clinical and experimental research. In addition, combination of IL-2 with PD-1/L1 pathway blockade shows vastly improved anti-tumor efficacy over either monotherapy in preclinical tumor models. In this review we discuss the biological characteristics of IL-2 and its receptors, as well as its efficacy and treatment limiting toxicities in cancer patients. We also explore the efforts aimed at developing novel and safer IL-2 therapies to harness the full therapeutic potential of this cytokine.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly lethal and resistant to immunotherapy. Although immune recognition can be enhanced with immunomodulatory agents including checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines, few patients experience clinical efficacy because the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) is dominated by immunosuppressive myeloid cells that impose T cell inhibition. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) was reported to downregulate metabolic regulators arginase and iNOS in immunosuppressive myeloid cells and enhance immunity against immune-sensitive tumors including head and neck cancers. We show for the first time that combining a PDE5 inhibitor, tadalafil, with a mesothelin-specific vaccine, anti-PD1, and anti-CTLA4 yields antitumor efficacy even against immune-resistant PDAC. To determine immunologic advantages conferred by tadalafil, we profiled the TiME using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA analysis with Domino to infer intercellular signaling. Our analyses demonstrated that tadalafil reprograms myeloid cells to be less immunosuppressive. Moreover, tadalafil synergized with the vaccine, enhancing T cell activation including mesothelin-specific T cells. Tadalafil treatment was also associated with myeloid-T cell signaling axes important for antitumor responses (e.g., Cxcr3, Il12).

        <tr id="Sepsis is a complex condition of inflammatory and immune dysregulation, triggered by severe infection. In survivors, chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation linger, facilitating the emergence of infections. CD8 dysfunction contributes to immunosuppression in sepsis survivors. We devised an animal model that enabled us to identify and analyze CD8-intrinsic defects induced by sepsis. We adoptively transferred CD45.1 CD8 OT-I T cells into CD45.2 congenic mice and subjected them to cecal ligature and puncture, to induce abdominal sepsis. One month later, we isolated the transferred CD8 cells. Surface marker expression confirmed they had not been activated through the TCR. CD8 OT-I T cells isolated from septic (or sham-operated) mice were transferred to second recipients, which were challenged with OVA-expressing Listeria monocytogenes. We compared effector capacities between OT-I cells exposed to sepsis and control cells. Naive mice that received OT-I cells exposed to sepsis had higher bacterial burden and a shorter survival when challenged with OVA-expressing L. monocytogenes. OT-I cells isolated from septic mice produced less IFN-γ but had conserved activation, expansion potential, and cytotoxic function. We observed lower transcript levels of IFN-γ and of the long noncoding RNA Ifng-as1, a local regulator of the epigenetic landscape, in cells exposed to sepsis. Accordingly, local abundance of a histone modification characteristic of active promoter regions was reduced in sepsis-exposed CD8 T cells. Our results identify a mechanism through which inflammation in the context of sepsis affects CD8 T cell function intrinsically.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Mucosal enrichment of the Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC) pathotype and the expansion of pathogenic IFNγ-producing Th17 (pTh17) cells have been linked to Crohn’s Disease (CD) pathogenesis. However, the molecular pathways underlying the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell transdifferentiation in CD patients remain elusive. To this aim, we created and functionally screened a transposon AIEC mutant library of 10.058 mutants to identify the virulence determinants directly implicated in triggering IL-23 production and pTh17 cell generation. pTh17 cell transdifferentiation was assessed in functional assays by co-culturing AIEC-infected human dendritic cells (DCs) with autologous conventional Th17 (cTh17) cells isolated from blood of Healthy Donors (HD) or CD patients. AIEC triggered IL-23 hypersecretion and transdifferentiation of cTh17 into pTh17 cells selectively through the interaction with CD-derived DCs. Moreover, the chronic release of IL-23 by AIEC-colonized DCs required a continuous IL-23 neutralization to significantly reduce the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell differentiation. The multi-step screenings of the AIEC mutant’s library revealed that deletion of ybaT or rfaP efficiently hinder the IL-23 hypersecretion and hampered the AIEC-dependent skewing of protective cTh17 into pathogenic IFNγ-producing pTh17 cells. Overall, our findings indicate that ybaT (inner membrane transport protein) and rfaP (LPS-core heptose kinase) represent novel and attractive candidate targets to prevent chronic intestinal inflammation in CD.">

Unraveling the mechanisms underlying treatment response for targeted therapeutics in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients is challenging due to the limited understanding of diverse responses of circulating immune cells, particularly B cells. We investigated B lymphocyte dynamics during anti-BAFF treatment, utilizing longitudinal single-cell transcriptome data.


METHODS
We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on PBMCs in four Korean SLE patients before and after belimumab treatment at the following time points: 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.


RESULTS
Analyzing over 73 000 PBMCs, we identified 8 distinct subsets of B cells and plasmablasts and analyzed dynamic changes within these cell subsets: initial declines in naive and transitional B cells followed by an increase at three months, contrasted by an initial increase and subsequent decrease in memory B cells by the third month. Meanwhile, plasmablasts exhibited a consistent decline throughout treatment. B cell activation pathways, specifically in naive and memory B cells, were downregulated during the third and sixth months. These findings were validated at the protein level throughout the first four weeks of treatment using flow cytometry. Comparative analysis with bulk transcriptome data from 22 Japanese SLE patients showed increased NR4A1 expression six months post-belimumab treatment, indicating its role in restricting self-reactive B cells, thereby contributing to the biological responses of anti-BAFF treatment.


CONCLUSION
The observed B cell dynamics provided insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of anti-BAFF in SLE patients. Furthermore, it underscores the need for research in predicting drug responses based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma IDH-wildtype is highly immune suppressive and is characterized by a strong component of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). To interfere with the immune suppressive functions of MDSCs, a comprehensive understanding on how MDSCs acquire their suppressive phenotype is essential. Previously, we and others have shown a distinct Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptor expression profile for MDSCs in glioblastoma. Siglec receptors can transmit inhibitory signals comparable to PD-1 and are suggested to act as glyco-immune checkpoints. Here, we investigated how glioma specific Siglec-sialic acid interactions influence myeloid immune suppressive functions. Co-culturing monocytes with glioblastoma cells induced CD163 expression on the monocytes. Upon desialylation of the glioblastoma cells, this induction of CD163 was hampered, and furthermore, the monocytes were now able to secrete higher amounts of IL-6 and TNFα compared to fully sialylated glioblastoma cells. Additionally, Siglec-specific triggering using anti-Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 antibodies displayed a decreased TNFα secretion by the monocytes, validating the role of the Siglec–Sialic axis in the co-culture experiments. Together, our results demonstrate that glioblastoma cells induce a myeloid immune-suppressive phenotype that could be partly rescued by lowering the glioblastoma-associated sialic acid levels. This manuscript supports further research of the Siglec–Sialic acid axis in the context of glioblastoma and its potential to improve clinical outcome.">

        <tr id="Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare disease characterized by malignant cells derived from the epithelial cells of the biliary duct system. Despite extensive treatments, the prognosis for CCA remains poor, emphasizing the critical need for the development of novel treatments. Considerable attention has been directed towards innate immune effector cells, which can recognize tumor cells independently of the major histocompatibility complex, laying the foundation for the development of off-the-shelf drugs. In this study, we cultured innate immune cells obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy adults and conducted a comparative analysis of the effector functions against CCA cell lines by Vδ2 γδ T cells and NK cells. This analysis was performed using standard short- and long-term cytotoxicity assays, as well as ELISA for IFN-γ. Vδ2 γδ T cells demonstrated cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production in response to CCA cells in a TCR-dependent manner, particularly in the presence of tetrakis-pivaloyloxymethyl 2-(thiazole-2-ylamino)ethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate, a bisphosphonate prodrug. In contrast, direct killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity were relatively slow and weak. Conversely, NK cells displayed potent, direct cytotoxicity against CCA cells. In summary, both Vδ2 γδ T cells and NK cells show promise as innate immune effector cells for adoptive transfer therapy in the context of CCA.">

        <tr id="Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) greatly contribute to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance of cancer. However, its underlying mechanisms and whether TAMs can be promising targets to overcome ICI resistance remain to be unveiled. Through integrative analysis of immune multiomics data and single‐cell RNA‐seq data (iMOS) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lymphotoxin β receptor (LTBR) is identified as a potential immune checkpoint of TAMs, whose high expression, duplication, and low methylation are correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Immunofluorescence staining shows that the infiltration of LTBR+ TAMs is associated with LUAD stages, immunotherapy failure, and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, LTΒR maintains immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype of TAMs by noncanonical nuclear factor kappa B and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathways. Macrophage‐specific knockout of LTBR hinders tumor growth and prolongs survival time via blocking TAM immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype. Moreover, TAM‐targeted delivery of LTΒR small interfering RNA improves the therapeutic effect of ICI via reversing TAM‐mediated immunosuppression, such as boosting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and inhibiting granulocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells infiltration. Taken together, we bring forth an immune checkpoint discovery pipeline iMOS, identify LTBR as a novel immune checkpoint of TAMs, and propose a new immunotherapy strategy by targeting LTBR+ TAMs.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects a wide range of cell types in the body, including a variety of epithelial cell types. Despite the significance of epithelial cells during infection, HCMV has been difficult to study in epithelial cells. In this study, we examined HCMV infection in mammary and prostate epithelial cell lines, finding that the virus establishes a semi-permissive, biosynthetically abortive state. Building on previous work, we hypothesized that shifting epithelial cells to a mesenchymal cell state would restore HCMV biosynthesis and progeny production. To test this hypothesis, we induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using TGF-β and the EMT-transcription factor (EMT-TF) SNAIL. We found that shifting strongly epithelial cell lines to a mesenchymal cell state shifted HCMV infection from a semi-permissive to fully permissive state. This effect appeared to involve two distinct mechanisms: EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral entry and EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral mRNA translation. Although the precise mechanisms remain elusive, our findings identify the epithelial-mesenchymal cell state axis as an important regulator of HCMV infection and provide new insights into how cellular differentiation states influence viral replication. They also raise the possibility that the EMT pathway, a fundamental pathway involved in development and cancer metastasis, could regulate HCMV infection in-vivo, potentially contributing to viral persistence or pathogenesis in epithelial tissues.">

IL-15 stimulation of CD8α– NK cells induced CD8α expression via the RUNX3 transcription factor, driving formation of a unique induced CD8α (iCD8α+) population. iCD8α+ NK cells displayed higher proliferation, metabolic activity, and antitumor cytotoxic function compared with preexisting CD8α+ and CD8α– subsets. Therefore, CD8α expression can be used to define a potential dynamic spectrum of NK cell expansion and function.

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a life-threatening complication frequently occurring following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Since gut microbiota and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are believed to play roles in GvHD prevention, we investigated whether DP8a Tregs, which we have previously described to harbor a TCR-specificity for the gut commensal Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, could protect against GvHD, thereby linking microbiota and its effect on GvHD. We observed a decrease in CD73+ DP8α Treg frequency in allo-HSCT patients at 1-month post-transplantation, which was associated with aGvHD development at 1-month post-transplantation, as compared to aGvHD-free patients, without being correlated to hematological disease's relapse. Importantly, CD73 activity was shown to be critical for DP8αTreg suppressive function. Moreover, the frequency of host-reactive DP8α Tregs was also lower in aGvHD patients, as compared to aGvHD-free patients, which could embody a protective mechanism responsible for the maintenance of these cell subset in GvHD-free patients. We also showed that human DP8α Tregs protected mice against xeno-GvHD through limiting deleterious inflammation and preserving gut integrity. Altogether, these results demonstrated that human DP8α Tregs mediate aGvHD prevention in a CD73-dependent manner, likely through host-reactivity, advocating for the use of these cells for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to preclude aGvHD-related inflammation.">

Mounting evidence suggests involvement of peripheral immune cells in PD pathogenesis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the potential role of peripheral immune secreted cytokines in modulating midbrain astrocyte reactivity. Human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes were exposed to 5% and 10% CD4+ T cell conditioned media (CD4CM) for 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days to assess chronic exposure. Additionally, astrocytes were exposed to the Th17 cell cytokine, IL-17A (10 ng/mL), alone and in combination with TNF-α (0.3 ng/mL) to assess potential synergistic effects of both cytokines at 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days. CD4CM induced acute and chronic alterations in midbrain astrocytes. Increased NFκB translocation to the nucleus, increased expression of the pro-inflammatory genes, IL-1β, CXCL10 at 24 h, C3, LCN2, IL-6 at 24 and 48 h, as well as an increase in their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CXCL10 at both these time points were observed. A synergistic response to the combination of IL-17A and TNF-α on increasing inflammatory gene expression and cytokine release occurred. IL-17A and TNF-α increased intensity of S100β at 24 h, decreased nuclear area and increased circularity of astrocytes at 72 h. A synergistic effect on γH2AX intensity at 72 h and an increase in LDH release at 7 days was observed. Our results demonstrate that IL-17A and TNF-α act synergistically, enhancing midbrain astrocyte reactivity to a similar degree as CD4CM. This highlights the importance of the peripheral immune secreted cytokines in increasing the reactivity status of midbrain astrocytes, implicating their role in PD.">

Our research focused on the mitochondrial activity and CXCR4 expression in CD11c+ B cells from lupus patients after ex vivo stimulation with a TLR9 agonist, CpG-oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN). We also evaluated the response of CD11c+ B cells in ODN-injected mice. Post-ex vivo ODN stimulation, we observed an increase in the proportion of CD11chi cells, with elevated mitochondrial activity and CXCR4 expression in CD11c+ B cells from lupus patients. In vivo experiments showed similar patterns, with TLR9 stimulation enhancing mitochondrial and CXCR4 activities in CD11chi B cells, leading to the generation of anti-dsDNA plasmablasts. The CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 and the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor IM156 significantly reduced the proportion of CD11c+ B cells and autoreactive plasmablasts. These results underscore the pivotal roles of mitochondria and CXCR4 in the production of autoreactive plasmablasts.">

        <tr id="The use of antitumor drugs represents a reliable strategy for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, drug resistance has become increasingly common and contributes to tumor metastasis and local recurrence. The tumor immune microenvironment (TME) consists of immune cells, cytokines and immunomodulators, and collectively they influence the response to treatment. Epigenetic changes including DNA methylation and histone modification, as well as increased drug exportation have been reported to contribute to the development of drug resistance in cancers. In the past few years, the majority of studies on tumors have only focused on the development and progression of a tumor from a mechanistic standpoint; few studies have examined whether the changes in the TME can also affect tumor growth and drug resistance. Recently, emerging evidence have raised more concerns regarding the role of TME in the development of drug resistance. In the present review, it was discussed how the suppressive TME adapts to drug resistance characterized by the cooperation of immune cells, cytokines, immunomodulators, stromal cells and extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it was reviewed how these immunological or metabolic changes alter immuno-surveillance and thus facilitate tumor drug resistance. In addition, potential targets present in the TME for developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve individualized therapy for cancer treatment were revealed.">

        <tr id="The relationship between chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection and natural killer (NK) cell dysfunction is well-established, but the specific role of HBV viral antigens in driving NK cell impairment in patients with CHB remains unclear. This study investigates the modulatory effects of hepatitis B virus subviral particles (HBVsvp, a representative model for HBsAg) on the phenotypic regulation (activating and inhibitory receptors), cytokine production and cytotoxic potential of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived natural killer cells (PBMCs-derived NK cell), which contributes to NK cell dysfunction in CHB infection, potentially serving as an effective HBV immune evasion strategy by the virus.NK cells were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with CHB (n=5) and healthy individuals (n=5), stimulated with HBVsvp. Subsequent flow cytometric characterization involved assessing changes in activating (NKp46 and NKG2D) and inhibitory (CD94) receptors expression, quantifying TNF-α and IFN- γ cytokine secretion, and evaluating the cytotoxic response against HepG2.2.15 cells with subsequent HBVsvp quantification.In CHB patients, in vitro exposure of PBMCs-derived NK cell with HBVsvp (represent HBsAg model) significantly reduced NK cell-activating receptors expression (P = 0.022), increased expression of CD94 + NK cells (p = 0.029), accompanied with a reduced TNF-α - IFN-γ cytokine levels, and impaired cytotoxic capacity (evidenced by increased cell proliferation and elevated HBVsvp levels in co-cultures with HepG2.2.15 cells in a time-dependent), relative to healthy donors.These findings suggest that HBVsvp may induce dysfunctional NK cell responses characterized by phenotypic imbalance with subsequent reduction in cytokine and cytotoxic levels, indicating HBVsvp immunosuppressive effect that compromises antiviral defense in CHB patients. These data enhance our understanding of NK cell interactions with HBsAg and highlight the potential for targeting CD94 inhibitory receptors to restore NK cell function as an immunotherapeutic approach. Further clinical research is needed to validate these observations and establish their utility as reliable biomarkers.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. The role of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in pediatric COVID-19 patients remains unclear.


METHODS
We isolated EVs from healthy controls (n = 13) and pediatric COVID-19 patients (n = 104) with varying severity during acute and convalescent phases using serial ultracentrifugation. EV effects on healthy PBMCs, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocytes were assessed through in vitro assays, flow cytometry, and ELISA.


RESULTS
Our findings indicate that COVID-19 severity correlates with diverse immune responses. Severe acute cases exhibited increased cytokine levels, decreased IFNγ levels, and lower CD4+ T cell and monocyte counts, suggesting immunosuppression. EVs from severe acute patients stimulated healthy cells to express higher PDL1, increased Th2 and Treg cells, reduced IFNγ secretion, and altered Th1/Th17 ratios. Patient-derived EVs significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (p < .001 for mild, p = .0025 for severe cases) and decreased CD4+ T cell (p = .043) and monocyte (p = .033) populations in stimulated healthy PBMCs.


CONCLUSION
This study reveals the complex relationship between immunological responses and EV-mediated effects, emphasizing the impact of COVID-19 severity. We highlight the potential role of plasma-derived EVs in early-stage immunosuppression in severe COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the main residents in the bone marrow (BM) and have an essential role in the regulation of haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation and proliferation. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a group of myeloid disorders impacting haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSCPs) that are characterised by BM failure, ineffective haematopoiesis, cytopenia, and a high risk of transformation through the expansion of MDS clones together with additional genetic defects. It has been indicated that MSCs play anti-tumorigenic roles such as in cell cycle arrest and pro-tumorigenic roles including the induction of metastasis in MDS and leukaemia. Growing evidence has shown that MSCs have impaired functions in MDS, such as decreased proliferation capacity, differentiation ability, haematopoiesis support, and immunomodulation function and increased inflammatory alterations within the BM through some intracellular pathways such as Notch and Wnt and extracellular modulators abnormally secreted by MSCs, including increased expression of inflammatory factors and decreased expression of haematopoietic factors, contributing to the development and progression of MDSs. Therefore, MSCs can be targeted for the treatment of MDSs and leukaemia. However, it remains unclear what drives MSCs to behave abnormally. In this review, dysregulations in MSCs and their contributions to myeloid haematological malignancies will be discussed.">

Pharmacological inhibition as well as the short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor hindered memory transition and limited the homeostatic turnover of the activated CD8+ T cells. Dexamethasone exposure of CD8+ T cells expanded during a resolving infection with influenza A virus or a γ-herpesvirus promoted conversion of effector cells into memory cells by modulating cellular metabolism and lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Reduced reactive oxygen species levels in the responding effector cells upregulated Bcl2 and enhanced survival. The generated virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells were efficiently recalled following challenge of animals with a secondary infection to control it better. The memory-enhancing effect was predominantly evident at low doses of dexamethasone. Therefore, controlled glucocorticoid signaling within the effector CD8+ T cells is crucial for optimal memory differentiation.">

        <tr id="Drugs that target immune checkpoint have become the most popular weapon in cancer immunotherapy, yet only have practical benefits for a small percentage of patients. Tumor cells constantly interact with their microenvironment, which is made up of a variety of immune cells as well as endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Immune checkpoint expression and blocked signaling of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are key to tumor progression. In this study, we perform deliberation convolution on the TCGA database for human lung, breast, and colorectal cancer to infer crosstalk between immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) and ligands (ICLs) in TME of pan-carcinogenic solid tumor types, validated by flow cytometry. Analysis of immune checkpoints showed that there was little variation between different tumor types. It showed that CD160, LAG3, TIGIT were found to be highly expressed in CD8+ T cells instead of CD4+ T cells, PD-L1, PD-L2, CD86, LGALS9, TNFRSF14, LILRB4 and other ligands were highly expressed on macrophages, FVR, NECTIN2, FGL1 were highly expressed on Epithelial cells, CD200 was highly expressed in Endothelial cells, and CD80 was highly expressed in CD8 High expression on T cells. Overall, our study provides a new resource for the expression of immune checkpoints in TME on various types of cells. Significance: This study provides immune checkpoint expression of immune cells of multiple cancer types to infer immune mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and provide ideas for the development of new immune checkpoint-blocking drugs.">

While DCs are believed to play a pivotal role in generating anti-tumor T-cell responses, the importance of DCs in the protection from the progression of tumors remains elusive. Here, we show how the constitutive deficiency of CD11chi DCs influences the progression of tumors with the use of binary transgenic mice with constitutive loss of CD11chi DCs. Constitutive loss of CD11chi DCs not only enhances the progression of tumors but also reduces the responses of Ag-specific T cells. Furthermore, the congenital deficiency of CD11chi DCs generates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that correlates with the marked accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and the prominent productions of immunosuppressive mediators. Thus, our findings suggest that CD11chi DCs are crucial for generating anti-tumor T-cell responses and immunogenic TME to suppress the development of tumors.">

        <tr id="CD8 T cells are the predominant effector cells of adaptive immunity in preventing cytomegalovirus (CMV) multiple-organ disease caused by cytopathogenic tissue infection. The mechanism by which CMV-specific, naïve CD8 T cells become primed and clonally expand is of fundamental importance for our understanding of CMV immune control. For CD8 T-cell priming, two pathways have been identified: direct antigen presentation by infected professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs) and antigen cross-presentation by uninfected pAPCs that take up antigenic material derived from infected tissue cells. Studies in mouse models using murine CMV (mCMV) and precluding either pathway genetically or experimentally have shown that, in principle, both pathways can congruently generate the mouse MHC/H-2 class-I-determined epitope-specificity repertoire of the CD8 T-cell response. Recent studies, however, have shown that direct antigen presentation is the canonical pathway when both are accessible. This raised the question of why antigen cross-presentation is ineffective even under conditions of high virus replication thought to provide high amounts of antigenic material for feeding cross-presenting pAPCs. As delivery of antigenic material for cross-presentation is associated with programmed cell death, and as CMVs encode inhibitors of different cell death pathways, we pursued the idea that these inhibitors restrict antigen delivery and thus CD8 T-cell priming by cross-presentation. To test this hypothesis, we compared the CD8 T-cell responses to recombinant mCMVs lacking expression of the apoptosis-inhibiting protein M36 or the necroptosis-inhibiting protein M45 with responses to wild-type mCMV and revertant viruses expressing the respective cell death inhibitors. The data reveal that increased programmed cell death improves CD8 T-cell priming in mice capable of antigen cross-presentation but not in a mutant mouse strain unable to cross-present. These findings strongly support the conclusion that CMV cell death inhibitors restrict the priming of CD8 T cells by antigen cross-presentation.">

        <tr id="Background: Exosomal programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), an exosomal membrane protein found in many tumor types, is reckoned to help regulate the immune microenvironment. However, the functions and the mechanisms underlying the exosome-mediated regulation of the immune microenvironment in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unknown. Methods: Western blotting was used to investigate the levels of exosomal PD-L1 in the peripheral blood of patients with CRC and healthy controls. A CRC mouse model was constructed by administering 10 mg/kg azoxymethane (AOM) and dextrane sodium sulfate (DSS) intraperitoneally. The mice were then administered the control or CRC-derived exosomes to examine the regulatory effect of the exosomes on macrophage infiltration and CRC development. In vitro studies, using a coculture system, and flow cytometry analysis were conducted to examine the relationship between the regulatory effect of CRC-derived exosomes on CD4+ T cells and tumor-associated macrophages. RNA-seq and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to investigate the mechanisms underlying the regulatory effect of the CRC-derived exosomes on macrophage proliferation and the regulation of the immune microenvironment during CRC development. Results: In patients with CRC, higher levels of exosomal PD-L1 were associated with a more severe form of disease. The treatment of mice with AOM/DSS-induced CRC with CRC-derived exosomes resulted in high levels of macrophage proliferation, increased PD-L1 levels in macrophages, and accelerated CRC progression. Importantly, analysis of an in vitro coculture system and flow cytometry analysis showed that the CRC-derived exosomes transported PD-L1 into macrophages and impaired CD4+ T cell function. Preliminary data suggest that the NF-κb signaling pathway regulates the function of CRC-derived exosomal PD-L1-dependent macrophages. Conclusion: CRC-derived exosomes induce the proliferation of macrophages and increase their PD-L1 levels. They also impair CD4+ T cell function and promote CRC progression. Our findings reveal a novel exosomal PD-L1-mediated crosstalk between the CRC cells and immune cells in the CRC microenvironment.">

The malignant behavior of GBM is manifested in a tumor which is highly invasive, resistant to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, and strongly immunosuppressive. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been introduced in the clinic and have yielded promising results in certain cancers. GBM, however, is largely refractory to these treatments. The immune checkpoint CD47 has recently gained attention as a potential target for intervention as it conveys a “don’t eat me” signal to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) via the inhibitory SIRP alpha protein. In preclinical models, the administration of anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies has shown impressive results with GBM and other tumor models. Several well-characterized oncogenic pathways have recently been shown to regulate CD47 expression in GBM cells and glioma stem cells (GSCs) including Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) beta catenin. Other macrophage pathways involved in regulating phagocytosis including TREM2 and glycan binding proteins are discussed as well. Finally, chimeric antigen receptor macrophages (CAR-Ms) could be leveraged for greatly enhancing the phagocytosis of GBM and repolarization of the microenvironment in general. Here, we comprehensively review the mechanisms that regulate the macrophage phagocytosis of GBM cells.">

        <tr id="HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a progressive demyelinating disease of the spinal cord due to chronic inflammation. Hallmarks of disease pathology include dysfunctional anti-viral responses and the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells and HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in the central nervous system. HAM/TSP individuals exhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with elevated co-expression of multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs), but ICP blockade strategies can only partially restore CD8+ T-cell effector function. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles, can enhance the spread of viral infections and blunt anti-viral responses. Here, we evaluated the impact of exosomes isolated from HTLV-1-infected cells and HAM/TSP patient sera on dendritic cell (DC) and T-cell phenotypes and function. We observed that exosomes derived from HTLV-infected cell lines (OSP2) elicit proinflammatory cytokine responses in DCs, promote helper CD4+ T-cell polarization, and suppress CD8+ T-cell effector function. Furthermore, exosomes from individuals with HAM/TSP stimulate CD4+ T-cell polarization, marked by increased Th1 and regulatory T-cell differentiation. We conclude that exosomes in the setting of HAM/TSP are detrimental to DC and T-cell function and may contribute to the progression of pathology with HTLV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="The interplay between immune components and the epithelium plays a crucial role in the development and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Natural killer (NK) cells, one of the main tumor-killing immune cell populations, have received increasing attention in HNSCC immunotherapy. In this review, we explore the mechanism underlying the interplay between NK cells and HNSCC. A series of immune evasion strategies utilized by cancer cells restrict HNSCC infiltration of NK cells. Overcoming these limitations can fully exploit the antineoplastic potential of NK cells. We also investigated the tumor-killing efficacy of NK cell-based immunotherapies, immunotherapeutic strategies, and new results from clinical trials. Notably, cetuximab, the most essential component of NK cell-based immunotherapy, inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway and activates the immune system in conjunction with NK cells, inducing innate effector functions and improving patient prognosis. In addition, we compiled information on other areas for the improvement of patient prognosis using anti-EGFR receptor-based monoclonal antibody drugs and the underlying mechanisms and prognoses of new immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of HNSCC.">

        <tr id="Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of S1 and receptor binding domain protein-specific B cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients with different clinical manifestations. This study aimed to evaluate the role and developmental pathway of atypical memory B cells (MBCs) in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The results revealed a proinflammatory signature across B cell subsets associated with disease severity, as evidenced by the upregulation of genes such as GADD45B, MAP3K8, and NFKBIA in critical and severe individuals. Furthermore, the analysis of atypical MBCs suggested a developmental pathway similar to that of conventional MBCs through germinal centers, as indicated by the expression of several genes involved in germinal center processes, including CXCR4, CXCR5, BCL2, and MYC. Additionally, the upregulation of genes characteristic of the immune response in COVID-19, such as ZFP36 and DUSP1, suggested that the differentiation and activation of atypical MBCs may be influenced by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and that these genes may contribute to the immune response for COVID-19 recovery. Our study contributes to a better understanding of atypical MBCs in COVID-19 and the role of other B cell subsets across different clinical manifestations.">

        <tr id="The mononuclear phagocyte system includes monocytes, macrophages, some dendritic cells, and multinuclear giant cells. These cell populations display marked heterogeneity depending on their differentiation from embryonic and bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors, tissue location, and activation. They contribute to tissue homeostasis by interacting with local and systemic immune and non-immune cells through trophic, clearance, and cytocidal functions. During evolution, they contributed to the innate host defense before effector mechanisms of specific adaptive immunity emerged. Mouse macrophages appear at mid-gestation and are distributed throughout the embryo to facilitate organogenesis and clear cells undergoing programmed cell death. Yolk sac, AGM, and fetal liver-derived tissue-resident macrophages persist throughout postnatal and adult life, supplemented by bone marrow-derived blood monocytes, as required after injury and infection. Nobel awards to Elie Metchnikoff and Paul Ehrlich in 1908 drew attention to cellular phagocytic and humoral immunity, respectively. In 2011, prizes were awarded to Jules Hoffmann and Bruce Beutler for contributions to innate immunity and to Ralph Steinman for the discovery of dendritic cells and their role in antigen presentation to T lymphocytes. We trace milestones in the history of mononuclear phagocyte research from the perspective of Nobel awards bearing directly and indirectly on their role in cellular immunity.">

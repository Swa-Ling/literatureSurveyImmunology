        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections such as influenza A virus. This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.">

        <tr id="Yellow fever vaccination provides long-lasting protection and is a unique model for studying the immune response to an acute RNA virus infection in humans. To elucidate the early innate immune events preceding the rapid generation of protective immunity, we performed transcriptome analysis of human blood dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte subpopulations before and 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after vaccination. We detected temporary upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in all DC and monocyte subsets on day 3 and 7 after vaccination as well as cell type specific responses and temporal dynamics. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed rapid appearance of activated DC and monocyte clusters dominated by ISGs, inflammatory chemokines and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation. This was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in a large cohort of vaccinees. We identified SIGLEC1/CD169 upregulation as a sensitive indicator of the transient IFN-induced activation state elicited in DCs and monocytes by YF17D vaccination correlating with early protective IgM antibody responses.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis, caused by M.tuberculosis (Mtb), remains an enduring global health challenge, especially given the limited efficacy of current therapeutic interventions. Much of existing research has focused on immune failure as a driver of tuberculosis. However, the crucial role of host macrophage biology in controlling the disease remains underappreciated. While we have gained deeper insights into how alveolar macrophages (AMs) interact with Mtb, the precise AM subsets that mediate protection and potentially prevent tuberculosis progression have yet to be identified. In this study, we employed multi-modal scRNA-seq analyses to evaluate the functional roles of diverse macrophage subpopulations across different infection timepoints, allowing us to delineate the dynamic landscape of controller and permissive AM populations during the course of infection. Our analyses at specific time-intervals post-Mtb challenge revealed macrophage populations transitioning between distinct anti- and pro-inflammatory states. Notably, early in Mtb infection, CD38− AMs showed a muted response. As infection progressed, we observed a phenotypic shift in AMs, with CD38+ monocyte-derived AMs (moAMs) and a subset of tissue-resident AMs (TR-AMs) emerging as significant controllers of bacterial growth. Furthermore, scATAC-seq analysis of naïve lungs demonstrated that CD38+ TR-AMs possessed a distinct chromatin signature prior to infection, indicative of epigenetic priming and predisposition to a pro-inflammatory response. BCG intranasal immunization increased the numbers of CD38+ macrophages, substantially enhancing their capability to restrict Mtb growth. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal, dynamic roles of different macrophage subsets in TB infection and reveal rational pathways for the development of improved vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus. Previous studies have shown antibody Fc effector functions are critical for optimal monoclonal antibody-mediated protection against alphaviruses; however, the requirement of Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) for protection during natural infection has not been evaluated. Here, we showed mice lacking activating FcγRs (FcRγ-/-) developed prolonged clinical disease with more virus in joint-associated tissues. Viral clearance was associated with anti-MAYV cell surface binding rather than neutralizing antibodies. Lack of Fc-FcγR engagement increased the number of monocytes through chronic timepoints. Single cell RNA sequencing showed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes in joint-associated tissue with increased MAYV RNA present in FcRγ-/- monocytes and macrophages. Transfer of FcRγ-/- monocytes into wild type animals was sufficient to increase virus in joint-associated tissue. Overall, this study suggests that engagement of antibody Fc with activating FcγRs promotes protective responses during MAYV infection and prevents monocytes from being potential targets of infection.">

        <tr id="The adjuvant AS01 plays a key role in the immunogenicity of several approved human vaccines with demonstrated high efficacy. Its adjuvant effect relies on activation of the innate immune system. However, specific effects of AS01-adjuvanted vaccines on innate cell function and epigenetic remodeling, as described for Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and influenza vaccines, are still unknown. We assessed the long-term functional and epigenetic changes in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells induced by a model vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen and AS01 in healthy adults (NCT01777295). The AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, but not an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine, increased the number of circulating monocytes and their expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–DR, which correlated with the magnitude of the memory CD4+ T cell response. Single-cell analyses revealed epigenetic alterations in monocyte and dendritic cell subsets, affecting accessibility of transcription factors involved in cell functions including activator protein-1 (AP-1), GATA, C/EBP, and interferon regulatory factor. The functional changes were characterized by a reduced proinflammatory response to Toll-like receptor activation and an improved response to interferon-γ, a cytokine critical for the adjuvant’s mode of action. Epigenetic changes were most evident shortly after the second vaccine dose in CD14+ monocytes, for which accessibility differences of some transcription factors could persist for up to 6 months postvaccination. Together, we show that reprogramming of monocyte subsets occurs after vaccination with an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, an effect that may contribute to the impact of vaccination beyond antigen-specific protection. An AS01-adjuvanted vaccine for hepatitis B virus modifies the epigenetic landscape of monocytes isolated from clinical study participants. Editor’s summary Most vaccines based on recombinant antigens rely on coadministration with an adjuvant to elicit a robust immune response. Although adjuvants are needed for many vaccines, it is less clear which adjuvant(s) should be paired with each immunogen. In two papers, Bechtold et al. and Arunachalam et al. performed comparative analyses to assess the effect of different adjuvants on the immune response. Bechtold et al. showed that an AS01-adjuvanted hepatitis B virus vaccine, which induces robust CD4+ T cell responses against the vaccine antigen, also elicited trained immunity in human recipients, which was not observed in an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine. Arunachalam et al. found that Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum adjuvantation induced robust immune responses to the R21 malaria vaccine in nonhuman primates, but a third comparator, GLA-LSQ, elicited a lower magnitude of response that was short lived. Although Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum induced robust and durable antibody responses, they elicited distinct innate immune responses, demonstrating that multiple innate immune mechanisms can program durable vaccine-induced immunity. These head-to-head comparisons in both humans and nonhuman primates demonstrate that selecting an adjuvant should be done carefully and that different adjuvants have distinct effects on both innate and adaptive immunity. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="The severity of COVID-19 is linked to excessive inflammation. Neutrophils represent a critical arm of the innate immune response and are major mediators of inflammation, but their role in COVID-19 pathophysiology remains poorly understood. We conducted transcriptomic profiling of neutrophils obtained from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, as well as from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, in comparison to non-infected healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the inflammasome formation potential in neutrophils from patients and mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), consisting mainly of mature neutrophils, revealed a striking type I interferon (IFN-I) gene signature in severe COVID-19 patients, contrasting with mild COVID-19 and healthy controls. Notably, low-density granulocytes (LDGs) from severe COVID-19 patients exhibited an immature neutrophil phenotype and lacked this IFN-I signature. Moreover, PMNs from severe COVID-19 patients showed heightened nigericin-induced caspase1 activation, but reduced responsiveness to exogenous inflammasome priming. Furthermore, IFN-I emerged as a priming stimulus for neutrophil inflammasomes. These findings suggest a potential role for neutrophil inflammasomes in driving inflammation during severe COVID-19. Altogether, these findings open promising avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate the pathological processes associated with the disease.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.">

Despite their importance, their physiological role in the upper respiratory tract, the first site of contact with IAV, remains unclear. Here, we find that, after IAV infection, antigen-specific CD4 TRM persist in the nasal tissue (NT) compartment and play a prime role in local viral clearance. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that NT CD4 TRM are heterogeneous and transcriptionally distinct as compared to their lung counterparts. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the CXCR6- CXCL16 axis is involved in CD4 TRM residency in the NT. Furthermore, we show that the NT of mice and humans contains a high frequency of IL-17-producing CD4 TRM that aid in local viral clearance and in reducing tissue damage. Collectively, our results support a robust physiological role for nasal tissue CD4 TRM in preventing IAV infection.">

Yet, little is known about the composition and spatial organisation of the TME that could explain the different prognoses for lung cancer patients. Using spatial multi-omics analyses, we show that LUAD and LUSC have distinct TMEs and that neutrophil-enriched tumors are associated with worse survival, while the accumulation of myeloid-instructed CD14+ T cells in the tumor core was associated with prolonged patient survival. CD14+CD4+ T cells express prototypic markers of myeloid cells and were found to be clonally expanded tumor-specific activated T cells. TNFα signaling was activated in tumors with high infiltration of CD14+CD4+ T cells in the tumor core.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) presented clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Lack of ICI efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells that create the “cold” tumor microenvironment (TME) impeding infiltration and activation of effector T cells. We developed a designer RGD peptide that hindered glioma-instigated, integrin-mediated pro-tumoral reprogramming of myeloid cells and blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in co-cultures in vitro. Intratumorally-delivered RGD alone did not reduce glioma growth in syngeneic mice but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and led to peritumoral blood vessels normalization. Furthermore, combining RGD with immunotherapy using PD-1 blockade reduced tumor growth, led to upsurge of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depleted regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, consistently with the restored “hot” inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. RGD modified the phenotypes of myeloid cells in human gliomas in nude mice. Thus, combining the integrin blockade with ICI reinvigorates antitumor immunity and paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.">

        <tr id="The lung is constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and particles that can cause alveolar damage. Hence, appropriate repair responses are essential for gas exchange and life. Here, we deciphered the spatiotemporal trajectory and function of an atypical population of macrophages after lung injury. Post–influenza A virus (IAV) infection, short-lived monocyte-derived Ly6G-expressing macrophages (Ly6G+ Macs) were recruited to the alveoli of lung perilesional areas. Ly6G+ Macs engulfed immune cells, exhibited a high metabolic potential, and clustered with alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2s) in zones of active epithelial regeneration. Ly6G+ Macs were partially dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 receptor signaling and were essential for AT2-dependent alveolar regeneration. Similar macrophages were recruited in other models of injury and in the airspaces of lungs from patients with suspected pneumonia. This study identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G+ Macs as a spatially restricted, short-lived macrophage subset promoting epithelial regeneration postinjury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target for treating lung damage. Short-lived perilesional Ly6G+ macrophages license alveolar epithelial regeneration after viral-triggered lung injury. Editor’s summary Respiratory virus infections can cause long-lasting lung damage, but how specific lung myeloid cell populations contribute to postinfection recovery is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, Ruscitti et al. identified a distinct population of Ly6G+ monocyte-derived macrophages that emerges during the early recovery phase after viral-triggered lung injury. Ly6G+ lung macrophages were short lived and highly phagocytic and populated the alveoli within perilesional areas undergoing regeneration. Genetically engineered mice lacking lung Ly6G+ macrophages displayed impaired epithelial regeneration after influenza infection. Together, these findings identify a previously unappreciated population of reparative lung macrophages that could be targeted therapeutically to treat lung damage. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Atherosclerotic plaques are defined by the accumulation of lipids and immune cells beneath the endothelium of the arterial intima. CD8 T cells are among the most abundant immune cell types in plaque, and conditions linked to their activation correlate with increased levels of cardiovascular disease. As lethal effectors of the immune response, CD8 T cell activation is suppressed at multiple levels. These checkpoints are critical in dampening autoimmune responses, and limiting damage in cardiovascular disease. Endothelial cells are well known for their role in recruiting CD8 T and other hematopoietic cells to low and disturbed flow (LDF) arterial regions that develop plaque, but whether they locally influence CD8 effector functions is unclear. Here, we show that endothelial cells can actively suppress CD8 T cell responses in settings of chronic plaque inflammation, but that this behavior is governed by expression of the RNA-binding protein Embryonic Lethal, Abnormal Vision-Like 1 (Elavl1). In response to immune cell recruitment in plaque, the endothelium dynamically shifts splicing of pre-mRNA and their translation to enhance expression of immune-regulatory proteins including C1q and CD27. This program is immuno-suppressive, and limited by Elavl1. We show this by Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2-mediated deletion of Elavl1 (ECKO), and analysis of changes in translation by Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP). In ECKO mice, the translational shift in chronic inflammation is enhanced, leading to increased ribosomal association of C1q components and other critical regulators of immune response and resulting in a ∼70% reduction in plaque CD8 T cells. CITE-seq analysis of the remaining plaque T cells shows that they exhibit lower levels of markers associated with T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, survival, and activation. To understand whether the immunosuppressive mechanism occurred through failed CD8 recruitment or local modulation of T cell responses, we used a novel in vitro co-culture system to show that ECKO endothelial cells suppress CD8 T cell expansion—even in the presence of wild-type myeloid antigen-presenting cells, antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and antigen. Despite the induction of C1q mRNA by T cell co-culture in both wild-type and ECKO endothelial cells, we find C1q protein abundantly expressed only in co-culture with ECKO cells. Together, our data define a novel immune-suppressive transition in the endothelium, reminiscent of the transition of T cells to T-regs, and demonstrate the regulation of this process by Elavl1.">

        <tr id="Waning immunity and the emergence of immune evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants jeopardize vaccine efficacy leading to breakthrough infections. We have previously shown that innate immune cells play a critical role in controlling SARS-CoV-2. To investigate the innate immune response during breakthrough infections, we modeled breakthrough infections by challenging low-dose vaccinated mice with a vaccine-mismatched SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. We found that low-dose vaccinated infected mice had a 2-log reduction in lung viral burden, but increased immune cell infiltration in the lung parenchyma, characterized by monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and eosinophils. Single cell RNA-seq revealed viral RNA was highly associated with eosinophils that corresponded to a unique IFN-γ biased signature. Antibody-mediated depletion of eosinophils in vaccinated mice resulted in increased virus replication and dissemination in the lungs, demonstrating that eosinophils in the lungs are protective during SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. These results highlight the critical role for the innate immune response in vaccine mediated protection against SARS-CoV-2.">

However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in virus control. However, it has remained largely unclear whether NK cell mobilization in SARS-CoV-2 infections is beneficial or pathologic. To address this deficit, we employed a validated experimental NK cell depletion non-human primate (NHP) model with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant B.1.617.2 challenge. Viral loads (VL), NK cell numbers, activation, proliferation, and functional measures were evaluated in blood and tissues. In non-depleted (control) animals, infection rapidly induced NK cell expansion, activation, and increased tissue trafficking associated with VL. Strikingly, we report that experimental NK cell depletion leads to higher VL, longer duration of viral shedding, significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, and overt lung damage. Overall, we find the first significant and conclusive evidence for NK cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and disease pathology. These data indicate that adjunct therapies for infection could largely benefit from NK cell-targeted approaches.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Secondary bacterial infection, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is one of the most frequent and severe complications of influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pneumonia. Phenotyping of the pulmonary innate immune landscape after IAV infection revealed a significant depletion of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophage (TR-AM) population at day 7, which was associated with increased susceptibility to Spn outgrowth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TR-AM depletion, and to define putative targets for treatment, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and cell-specific PCR profiling in an unbiased manner, using in vivo models of IAV infection and IAV/Spn co-infection. The TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) ligand-receptor axis was revealed as the driving force behind post-influenza TR-AM death during the early infection phase, enabling the transition to pneumococcal pneumonia, while intrapulmonary transfer of genetically modified TR-AMs and antibody-mediated neutralization of specific pathway components alleviated disease severity. With a mainly neutrophilic expression and a high abundance in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of patients with severe virus-induced ARDS, TNFSF14 emerged as a novel determinant of virus-driven lung injury. Targeting the TNFSF14-mediated intercellular communication network in the virus-infected lung can, therefore, improve host defense, minimizing the risk of subsequent bacterial pneumonia, and ameliorating disease outcome.">

        <tr id="Current rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatments do not restore immune tolerance. Investigating dendritic cell (DC) populations in human synovial tissue (ST) may reveal pathways to re-instate tolerance in RA. With single-cell and spatial-transcriptomics of synovial tissue biopsies, validated by micro co-culture systems, we identified condition and niche-specific myeloid DC clusters with distinct differentiation trajectories and functions. Healthy synovium contains a unique tolerogenic AXLpos DC2 cluster in the superficial sublining layer. In active RA, a macrophage-rich lining-layer niche becomes populated with inflammatory DC3 clusters that specifically activate memory CCL5pos TEM and CCL5posCXCL13pos TPH, promoting synovitis. In the sublining lymphoid niche, CCR7pos DC2 mReg specifically interact with naïve-T-cells, potentially driving the local expansion of new effector T-cells. Sustained remission sees the resolution of these niches but lacks the recovery of tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, indicating latent potential for disease flare. A human RA disease-flare model showed that the activation of blood predecessor of ST-DC3 clusters precedes the onset of inflammation in joints. Therapeutic strategies targeting pathogenic ST-DC3 clusters, or reinstating tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, may restore immune homeostasis in RA. In brief Deconstruction of human RA synovium, using single-cell spatial transcriptomics and micro-culture systems, reveals distinct neighbourhoods within the synovial architecture across health, and RA patients with active disease or sustained remission. Discrete niches are identified that contain distinct myeloid DC clusters that differ in frequency, differentiation trajectories, and effector functions. Highlights Human RA synovium exhibits condition and niche specific myeloid DC clusters that vary in their tissue differentiation trajectories and functions.

Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of brain CD8+ T cells from T. gondii-infected mice showed heterogeneous expression of the transcriptional regulator Id2, correlating with different functional states.

Furthermore, loss of Id2 in brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells led to the accumulation of exhausted PD1+Tox+CD8+ Trm cells, while Id2 overexpression repressed T cell exhaustion. Overall, our study shows that Id2 levels dictate the acquisition of effector vs. exhausted phenotypes in CD8+ Trm during chronic CNS infection.

        <tr id="T cells and structural cells coordinate appropriate inflammatory responses and restoration of barrier integrity following insult. Dysfunctional T cell activity precipitates tissue pathology that occurs alongside disease- associated alterations of structural cell subsets, but the mechanisms by which T cells promote these changes remain unclear. We show that subsets of circulating and skin-resident CD4+ T cells promote distinct transcriptional outcomes in human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts that correspond with divergent T cell cytokine production. Using these transcriptional signatures, we identify T cell-dependent outcomes associated with inflammatory skin disease, including a set of Th17 cell-induced genes in keratinocytes that are enriched in the skin during psoriasis and normalized by anti-IL-17 therapy, and a skin- resident T cell-induced gene module enriched in scleroderma-associated fibroblasts. Interrogating clinical data using T cell-derived structural cell gene networks enables investigation of the immune-dependent contribution to inflammatory disease and the heterogeneous patient response to biologic therapy.">

Here, we utilized the GeoMx spatial multi-omics platform to analyze immune cell changes in COVID-19 pancreatic autopsy samples, revealing an accumulation of proinflammatory macrophages. Single cell RNA-seq analysis of human islets exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or Coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) viruses identified activation of proinflammatory macrophages and β cell pyroptosis. To distinguish viral versus proinflammatory macrophage-mediated β cell pyroptosis, we developed human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived vascularized macrophage-islet (VMI) organoids. VMI organoids exhibited enhanced marker expression and function in both β cells and endothelial cells compared to separately cultured cells. Notably, proinflammatory macrophages within VMI organoids induced β cell pyroptosis. Mechanistic investigations highlighted TNFSF12-TNFRSF12A involvement in proinflammatory macrophage-mediated β cell pyroptosis. This study established hPSC- derived VMI organoids as a valuable tool for studying immune cell-mediated host damage and uncovered mechanism of β cell damage during viral exposure.">

        <tr id="Abstract The regulation of inflammation is a critical aspect of disease tolerance and naturally acquired clinical immunity to malaria. Here, we demonstrate using RNA sequencing and epigenetic landscape profiling by cytometry by time-of-flight, that the regulation of inflammatory pathways during asymptomatic parasitemia occurs downstream of pathogen sensing—at the epigenetic level. The abundance of certain epigenetic markers (methylation of H3K27 and dimethylation of arginine residues) and decreased prevalence of histone variant H3.3 correlated with suppressed cytokine responses among monocytes of Ugandan children. Such an epigenetic signature was observed across diverse immune cell populations and not only characterized active asymptomatic parasitemia but also correlated with future long-term disease tolerance and clinical immunity when observed in uninfected children. Pseudotime analyses revealed a potential trajectory of epigenetic change that correlated with a child's age and recent parasite exposure and paralleled the acquisition of clinical immunity. Thus, our data support a model whereby exposure to Plasmodium falciparum induces epigenetic changes that regulate excessive inflammation and contribute to naturally acquire clinical immunity to malaria.">

        <tr id="Background Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can reduce severity of subsequent LRTIs but have also been linked to respiratory allergy development and exacerbation. Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, exhibit altered gene expression in response to various neurological conditions. This study investigates the relationship between West Nile Virus infection and microglial senescence, focusing on the role of LGALS3BP, a protein implicated in both antiviral responses and aging. Using spatial transcriptomics, RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we characterized changes in microglial gene signatures in adult and aged mice following recovery from WNV encephalitis. Additionally, we analyzed Lgals3bp expression and generated Lgals3bp-deficient mice to assess the impact on neuroinflammation and microglial phenotypes. Our results show that WNV-activated microglia share transcriptional signatures with aged microglia, including upregulation of genes involved in interferon response and inflammation. Lgals3bp was broadly expressed in the CNS and robustly upregulated during WNV infection and aging. Lgals3bp-deficient mice exhibited reduced neuroinflammation, increased homeostatic microglial numbers, and altered T cell populations without differences in virologic control or survival. These data indicate that LGALS3BP has a role in regulating neuroinflammation and microglial activation and suggest that targeting LGALS3BP might provide a potential route for mitigating neuroinflammation-related cognitive decline in aging and post-viral infections.">

        <tr id="Local inflammation in the pancreas is transient but imprints a durable epigenetic memory on epithelial cells, making them more amenable to oncogenic transformation. However, it is unclear whether epithelial cell heterogeneity is impacted by acute pancreatitis (AP) or whether population dynamics during regeneration contributes to the establishment of inflammation memory. To tackle those questions, we deployed experimental pancreatitis in mice and performed paired sequencing of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles at single nucleus resolution. We documented cell type abundance but also applied integrative analyses to infer phenotypically-distinct clusters of mesenchymal and exocrine cells. We found that AP perturbs a subset of “idling” acinar cells, which separate from more canonical “secretory” acini based on a more diversified proteome, which include elevated expression of signal transduction receptors. We linked acinar cell heterogeneity to epigenetic differences that also endow idling cells with superior plasticity. These constitute about 40% of acinar cells but can proliferate and skew their phenotype in response to AP. This leads to a remarkable recovery of pancreas histology and function, but also to the dissemination of idling-like features across the exocrine parenchyma. Mechanistically, idling acinar cells are characterized by enhanced transcriptional activity and protein synthesis. After recovery from pancreatitis, acini show elevation of both and establishment of chronic Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). We finally demonstrated that AP-primed pancreata show signs of elevated UPR and that ER stress promotes acinar cell metaplasia. Our data interrogate phenotypical dynamics during tissue regeneration to identify cell states amenable to epigenetic imprinting. They also suggest that UPR-alleviating strategies might curtail the risk of developing pancreatic cancer for individuals who experiences AP.">

        <tr id="In murine models of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), parasitization of resident Kupffer cells (resKCs) is responsible for early growth of Leishmania infantum in the liver, which leads to granuloma formation and eventual parasite control. We employed the chronic VL model, and revealed an open niche established by KCs death and their migration outside of the sinusoids, resulting in their gradual replacement by monocyte-derived KCs (moKCs). While early granulomas were composed of resKCs, late granulomas were found outside of the sinusoids and contained resKC-derived macrophages, and monocyte-derived macrophages (momacs). ResKCs and moKCs within the sinusoids were identified as homeostatic/regulatory cells, while resKC-derived macrophages and momacs within late granulomas were pro-inflammatory. Despite the infection being largely confined to the resKC-derived macrophages, in the absence of monocyte recruitment, parasite control was strongly compromised. Macrophage heterogeneity, involving migration and reprogramming of resKCs, along with recruitment of monocyte-derived cells, is a hallmark of granuloma maturation and hepatic immunity in VL.">

        <tr id="IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells are required for protection against lethal Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections. However, the ability of CD4+ T cells to suppress Mtb growth cannot be fully explained by IFN-γ or other known T cell products. In this study, we show that CD4+ T cell-derived IFN-γ promoted the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to the lungs of Mtb-infected mice. Although the recruited MDMs became quickly and preferentially infected with Mtb, CD4+ T cells rapidly disinfected the MDMs. Clearance of Mtb from MDMs was not explained by IFN-γ, but rather by MHCII-mediated cognate interactions with CD4+ T cells. These interactions promoted MDM expression of glycolysis genes essential for Mtb control. Thus, by recruiting MDMs, CD4+ T cells initiate a cycle of bacterial phagocytosis, Mtb antigen presentation and disinfection in an attempt to clear the bacteria from the lungs.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

We observed a paradoxical benefit that contrasted with IL-2’s typical role in boosting T cell activity: targeted IL-2 delivery to CD8+ T cells led to reduced hyperinflammation and disease severity. Our results demonstrated that IL-2 induced exhaustion in overactive CD8+ T cells, thus mitigating hyperinflammation.

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

        <tr id="Schistosomiasis is an infection caused by contact with Schistosoma-contaminated water and affects more than 230 million people worldwide with varying morbidity. The roles of T helper 2 (TH2) cells and regulatory immune responses in chronic infection are well documented, but less is known about human immune responses during acute infection. Here, we comprehensively map immune responses during controlled human Schistosoma mansoni infection using male or female cercariae. Immune responses to male or female parasite single-sex infection were comparable. An early TH1-biased inflammatory response was observed at week 4 after infection, which was particularly apparent in individuals experiencing symptoms of acute schistosomiasis. By week 8 after infection, inflammatory responses were followed by an expansion of TH2 and regulatory cell subsets. This study demonstrates the shift from TH1 to both TH2 and regulatory responses, typical of chronic schistosomiasis, in the absence of egg production and provides immunological insight into the clinical manifestations of acute schistosomiasis. Single-sex (egg-free) Schistosoma mansoni infection induces initial type 1 responses in symptomatic participants that mature to type 2. Editor’s summary Schistosomiasis infection causes more than 230 million infections worldwide, but immune responses during acute infection are not well understood. To better observe these responses, Houlder et al. used controlled human Schistosoma mansoni infections with either male or female cercaria-stage parasites. T helper 1 (TH1) cell–biased inflammatory responses dominated at early time points (4 weeks after infection), and male and female parasites induced similar responses. At 8 weeks after infection, TH2 and regulatory cell responses were more dominant and were consistent with responses seen during chronic infection. These results highlight the shift in immune responses occurring over the course of infection. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="In chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), tissue-resident self-reactive T cells perpetuate disease. The specific tissue factors governing the persistence and continuous differentiation of these cells remain undefined but could represent attractive therapeutic targets. In a model of chronic CNS autoimmunity, we find that oligodendrocyte-derived interleukin-33 (IL-33), an alarmin, is key for locally regulating the pathogenicity of self-reactive CD8+ T cells. The selective ablation of IL-33 from neo-self-antigen-expressing oligodendrocytes mitigates CNS disease. In this context, fewer self-reactive CD8+ T cells persist in the inflamed CNS, and the remaining cells are largely locked into a stem-like precursor program, failing to form TCF-1low effector progeny. Importantly, interventional IL-33 blockade by locally administered somatic gene therapy reduces T cell infiltrates and improves the disease course. Our study identifies oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 as a druggable tissue factor regulating the differentiation and survival of self-reactive CD8+ T cell in the inflamed CNS. This finding introduces tissue factors as a novel category of immune targets for treating chronic CNS autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Immune checkpoint blockade has shown remarkable efficacy across various cancers but has failed to improve outcomes in patients with relapsed medulloblastoma (MB). While it is thought that the cold, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of MB accounts for this poor efficacy, the precise mechanisms contributing to immune suppression in this context remain unclear. In this study, we explore the immune landscape of MB using a previously unexplored syngeneic mouse model. Our study demonstrates that this model faithfully recapitulates the cold, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment observed in human disease. Importantly, our research uncovers mechanisms employed by myeloid cells and tumor cells to evade immune detection while highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting V-domain Ig Suppressor of T-cell Activation (VISTA), a novel inhibitory immune checkpoint, to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Abstract Background: Relapsed medulloblastoma (MB) poses a significant therapeutic challenge due to its highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have struggled to mitigate this challenge, largely due to low T-cell infiltration and minimal PD-L1 expression. Identifying the mechanisms driving low T-cell infiltration is crucial for developing more effective immunotherapies. Methods: We utilize a syngeneic mouse model to investigate the tumor immune microenvironment of MB and compare our findings to transcriptomic and proteomic data from human MB. Results: Flow cytometry reveals a notable presence of CD45hi/CD11bhi macrophage-like and CD45int/CD11bint microglia-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), alongside regulatory T-cells (Tregs), expressing high levels of the inhibitory checkpoint molecule VISTA. Compared to sham control mice, the CD45hi/CD11bhi compartment significantly expands in tumor-bearing mice and exhibits a myeloid-specific signature composed of VISTA, CD80, PD-L1, CTLA-4, MHCII, CD40, and CD68. These findings are corroborated by proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of human MB samples. Immunohistochemistry highlights an abundance of VISTA-expressing myeloid cells clustering at the tumor–cerebellar border, while T-cells are scarce and express FOXP3. Additionally, tumor cells exhibit immunosuppressive properties, inhibiting CD4 T-cell proliferation in vitro. Identification of VISTA’s binding partner, VSIG8, on tumor cells, and its correlation with increased VISTA expression in human transcriptomic analyses suggests a potential therapeutic target. Conclusions: This study underscores the multifaceted mechanisms of immune evasion in MB and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting the VISTA–VSIG axis to enhance anti-tumor responses.">

        <tr id="Virus-induced cell death is a key contributor to COVID-19 pathology. Cell death induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well studied in myeloid cells but less in its primary host cell type, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing human airway epithelia (HAE). SARS-CoV-2 induces apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis in HAE organotypic cultures. Single-cell and limiting-dilution analysis revealed that necroptosis is the primary cell death event in infected cells, whereas uninfected bystanders undergo apoptosis, and pyroptosis occurs later during infection. Mechanistically, necroptosis is induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA–binding protein 1 (ZBP1) in HAE and lung tissues from patients with COVID-19. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, which causes more severe disease than Omicron (B1.1.529) in humans, is associated with orders of magnitude–greater Z-RNA/ZBP1 interactions, necroptosis, and disease severity in animal models. Thus, Delta induces robust ZBP1-mediated necroptosis and more disease severity. Z-RNA/ZBP1–induced necroptosis is an initiating cell death event that occurs markedly more with Delta than Omicron infection. Editor’s summary SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers multiple cell death pathways that contribute to disease severity. Here, Liang et al. characterized cell death mechanisms in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–expressing cells and primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in autopsied lungs from patients with COVID-19. Necroptosis was the primary form of cell death and was induced by viral Z-RNA binding to Z-DNA binding protein-1 (ZBP-1). Infected and bystander cells underwent apoptosis, but limiting dilution analysis showed that apoptosis was a bystander effect. The Delta variant induced much greater Z-RNA/ZBP-1 interactions and necroptosis compared with Omicron, thus suggesting a mechanism associated with greater disease severity (see related Focus by Wong and Perlman). —Christiana N.

        <tr id="Soil-transmitted helminths are one of the most common infections across the world, yet how to promote an effective humoral response to helminths is not well understood. To ensure the most effective response, molecular programs underpin the specialization of antibody effector subtype to microenvironmental signals. Here, we identify the methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) as a key target to promote IgA-driven responses. Mll1 was increased in germinal center (GC) B cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues, and the absence of MLL1 in mature B cells led to significant reductions in GCs, IgG1 and IgE in response to the helminth Trichuris muris. Yet, worm expulsion occurred more rapidly in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice compared to control mice in the first two weeks of infection. Accelerated worm clearance correlated with significantly elevated IgA+ plasma cells (PC), serum IgA and fecal IgA in in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice. Stimulation of B cells in vitro confirmed that Mll1-deficiency accelerated the formation of IgA+ PC and that this effect was B cell-intrinsic. CCR9 was identified as a key MLL1-regulated molecule by RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry. Correspondingly, Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice infected with either T. muris or the bacterium C. rodentium significant increased IgA+CCR9+ PC localized in the large intestine. This tailoring of the B cell response to promote IgA-secreting PC correlated to a healthier microbiome in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice, compared to control mice. Thus, this study reveals MLL1 as a key target to tailor B cell responses to helminth infections, which may aid the development of effective mucosal vaccines or new targeted treatments. Significance statement Diseases caused by infections, such as soil-transmitted helminth infections or bacterial infections, continue to pose a major human health problem worldwide. One key reason why soil-transmitted helminths continue to cause long-term health and economic burdens is the lack of an effective vaccine for human use. Antibody responses underpin most successful vaccine designs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how B cell responses are regulated to produce tailored antibody to different pathogens is critical for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines. This study uncovered MLL1 as a novel therapeutic target to promote IgA-producing plasma cells, opening new avenues of investigation into how effective and tailored antibody responses may be produced in response to bacterial or helminth infection.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial in initiating and shaping both innate and adaptive immune responses. Clinical studies and experimental models have highlighted their significant involvement in various autoimmune diseases, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets. Nicotinamide (NAM), a form of vitamin B3, with its anti-inflammatory properties, has been suggested, while the involvement of NAM in DCs regulation remains elusive. Here, through analyzing publicly available databases, we observe substantial alterations in NAM levels and NAM metabolic pathways during DCs activation. Furthermore, we discover that NAM, but not Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN), significantly inhibits DCs over-activation in vitro and in vivo. The suppression of DCs hyperactivation effectively alleviates symptoms of psoriasis. Mechanistically, NAM impairs DCs activation through a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs)-NF-κB dependent manner. Notably, phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) and PARPs are significantly upregulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated DCs and psoriasis patients; elevated NAMPT and PARPs expression in psoriasis patients correlates with higher psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) scores. In summary, our findings underscore the pivotal role of NAM in modulating DCs functions and autoimmune disorders. Targeting the NAMPT-PARP axis emerges as a promising therapeutic approach for DC-related diseases.">

        <tr id="Coxsackievirus B (CVB) infection has long been considered an environmental factor precipitating Type 1 diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disease marked by loss of insulin-producing β cells within pancreatic islets. Previous studies have shown CVB infection negatively impacts islet function and viability but do not report on how virus infection individually affects the multiple cell types present in human primary islets. Therefore, we hypothesized that the various islet cell populations have unique transcriptional responses to CVB infection. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on human cadaveric islets treated with either CVB or poly(I:C), a viral mimic, for 24 and 48 hours. Our global analysis reveals CVB differentially induces dynamic transcriptional changes associated with multiple cell processes and functions over time whereas poly(I:C) promotes an immune response that progressively increases with treatment duration. At the single-cell resolution, we find CVB infects all islet cell types at similar rates yet induces unique cell-type specific transcriptional responses with β, α, and ductal cells having the strongest response. Sequencing and functional data suggest that CVB negatively impacts mitochondrial respiration and morphology in distinct ways in β and α cells, while also promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species. We also observe an increase in the expression of the long-noncoding RNA MIR7-3HG in β cells with high viral titers and reveal its knockdown reduces gene expression of viral proteins as well as apoptosis in stem cell-derived islets. Together, these findings demonstrate a cell-specific transcriptional, temporal, and functional response to CVB infection and provide new insights into the relationship between CVB infection and T1D.">

        <tr id="The successful development of germinal centers (GC) relies heavily on innate mechanisms to amplify the initial inflammatory cascade. In addition to their role in antigen presentation, innate cells are essential for the redirection of circulating lymphocytes toward the draining lymph node (dLN) to maximize antigen surveillance. Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) and its receptors (S1PR1-5) affect various aspects of immunity; however, the role of S1PR4 in regulating an immune response is not well understood. Here we use a footpad model of localized TH1 inflammation to carefully monitor changes in leukocyte populations within the blood, the immunized tissue, and the dLN. Within hours of immunization, neutrophils failed to adequately mobilize and infiltrate into the footpad tissue of S1PR4-/- mice, thereby diminishing the local vascular changes thought to be necessary for redirecting circulating cells toward the inflamed region. Neutrophil depletion with anti-Ly6G antibodies significantly reduced early tissue edema as well as the redirection and initial accumulation of naïve lymphocytes in dLN of WT mice, while the effects were less prominent or absent in S1PR4-/- dLN. Adoptive transfer experiments further demonstrated that the lymphocyte homing deficiencies in vivo were not intrinsic to the donor S1PR4-/- lymphocytes, but were instead attributed to differences within the S1PR4-deficient host. Reduced cell recruitment in S1PR4-/- mice would seed the dLN with fewer antigen-respondent lymphocytes and indeed, dLN hypertrophy at the peak of the immune response was severely diminished, with attenuated GC and activation pathways in these mice. Histological examination of the S1PR4-/- dLN also revealed an underdeveloped vascular network with reduced expression of the leukocyte tethering ligand, PNAd, within high endothelial venule regions, suggesting inadequate growth of the dLN meant to support a robust GC response. Thus, our study reveals that S1PR4 may link early immune modulation by neutrophils to the initial recruitment of circulating lymphocytes and downstream expansion and maturation of the dLN, thereby contributing to optimal GC development during an adaptive response.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs) are highly abundant myeloid cells in gliomas, with their phenotype and immune response determined by ontogeny and microenvironment. TAMs display distinctive transcriptional programs according to the IDH mutation status but the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. Herein, we uncover that CD11B+ myeloid cells in human IDHmut gliomas exhibit DNA hypermethylation predominantly at distal enhancers. This hypermethylation was linked to decreased expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses and glycolytic metabolism, and the inactivation of transcription factors that regulate microglial responses to environmental stimuli. Prolonged exposure of human primary microglia to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) inhibited TET-mediated 5mC oxidation, resulting in a reduced accumulation of global 5hmC levels. We confirmed high 5mC/5hmC ratios at lineage-specific enhancers, by analyzing CpGs at single-base resolution. D-2HG-treated microglia show reduced proinflammatory capacity and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, consistent with the remodeled enhancer landscape. Conversely, depletion of D-2HG following treatment of a glioma patient with an IDH mutant inhibitor was associated with enhanced microglial responses, as assessed by snRNA-seq. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the hyporesponsive state of microglia in IDHmut gliomas and support the concept that oncometabolites may disrupt the function of immune cells residing in the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Lower respiratory tract infections are common in malaria-endemic areas, and there is some evidence that co-infections between various bacteria/viruses and Plasmodium may affect disease prognosis. In this study, we report the novel finding that co-infection with influenza/A/X31 protects mice from death by Plasmodium berghei NK65-Edinburgh, a model of severe malarial pulmonary leak which underpins malaria-associated acute lung injury (MA-ALI) and malaria-associated acute respiratory distress (MA-ARDS). Co-infected mice exhibit equivalent parasitemia as mice with malaria only, suggesting that the survival phenotype is due to differences in immune kinetics. We demonstrated that the pulmonary leak typical of PbE is attenuated in co-infected mice without alteration in CD8 T cell activation and recruitment to the lung. Upon further examination of the immune response to influenza/A/X31 we identified a population of arginase 1-expressing alveolar macrophages that traffic to the lungs early during infection. In vitro these macrophages inhibit CD8 T cell activation and proliferation better than non-arginase expressing cells. Removal of arginase-1 expressing alveolar macrophages in vivo via administration of the antimetabolite gemcitabine removed the protective effects of influenza/A/X31co-infection on MA-ALI. This study opens a route to better understanding of how to modulate the immunopathology observed in pulmonary leak associated with severe malaria, which must be achieved to rationally design therapeutic interventions for MA-ARDS / MA-ALI.">

        <tr id="Ozone (O3) inhalation triggers asthmatic airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), but the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Previously, we developed a murine model of dust mite, ragweed, and aspergillus (DRA)-induced allergic lung inflammation followed by O3 exposure for mechanistic investigation. The present study used single cell RNA-sequencing for unbiased profiling of immune cells within the lungs of mice exposed to DRA, O3, or DRA+O3, to identify the components of the immune cell niche that contribute to AHR. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) had the greatest number of differentially expressed genes following DRA+O3, most of which were unique to the 2-hit exposure. Following DRA+O3, AMs activated transcriptional pathways related to cholesterol biosynthesis, degradation of the extracellular matrix, endosomal TLR processing, and various cytokine signals. We also identified AM and monocyte subset populations that were unique to the DRA+O3 group. These unique AMs activated gene pathways related to inflammation, sphingolipid metabolism, and bronchial constriction. The unique monocyte population had a gene signature that suggested phospholipase activation and increased degradation of the extracellular matrix. Flow cytometry analysis of BAL immune cells showed recruited monocyte-derived AMs after DRA and DRA+O3, but not after O3 exposure alone. O3 alone increased BAL neutrophils but this response was attenuated in DRA+O3 mice. DRA-induced changes in the airspace immune cell profile were reflected in elevated BAL cytokine/chemokine levels following DRA+O3 compared to O3 alone. The present work highlights the role of monocytes and AMs in the response to O3 and suggests that the presence of distinct subpopulations following allergic inflammation may contribute to O3-induced AHR.">

        <tr id="Introduction Biological processes such as aging, carcinogenesis, and immune response rely on the ability to maintain or rapidly expand cell populations. The fitness of the involved cells is constrained by their replicative potential, which is reflected in the cellular telomere content. Method We apply TelomereHunter to scATAC-seq data to determine telomere content on single-cell level, in a hematopoietic dataset consisting of 35,139 cells from samples of basal cell carcinoma patients receiving programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade treatment. Integrating information from open-chromatin-based signatures to assess cell identity, we characterize the heterogeneity of telomere length for individual cell populations pre- and post-immunotherapy. Results The extracted telomeric reads reflect the expected telomereome-to-genome fraction. Telomere content distributions differ significantly between cell populations, and the median telomere content in intermediate and terminal exhausted CD8+ T-cells pre-treatment is significantly correlated to response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Likewise, telomere content correlates with post-treatment cell proliferation in terminally exhausted and T follicular helper cells from responding patients. Conclusion Telomere content measurement from scATAC-seq data has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to detect significant differences between cell types. Furthermore, the telomere content of CD8+ exhausted T-cells pre-treatment is a putative biomarker for successful PD-1-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background The occurrence of peritoneal metastasis (PM) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) has a dismal prognosis. There is often limited response to systemic- and immunotherapy, even in microsatellite unstable (MSI) CRC. To overcome therapy resistance, it is critical to understand local immune environment in the peritoneal cavity, and to develop models to study anti-tumor immune responses. Here, we defined the peritoneal immune system (PerIS) in PM-CRC patients and evaluate the pre-clinical potential of a humanized immune system (HIS) mouse model for PM-CRC. Methods We studied the human PerIS in PM-CRC patients (n=20; MSS 19/20; 95%) and in healthy controls (n=3). HIS mice (NODscid gamma background; n=18) were generated, followed by intraperitoneal injection of either saline (HIS control; n=3) or human MSS/MSI CRC cell lines HUTU80, MDST8 and HCT116 (HIS-PM, n=15). Immune cells in peritoneal fluid and peritoneal tumors were analyzed using cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Results The human and HIS mouse homeostatic PerIS was equally populated by NK cells and CD4+- and CD8+ T cells, however differences were observed in macrophage and B cell abundance. In HIS mice, successful peritoneal engraftment of both MSI and MSS tumors was observed (15/15; 100%). Both in human PM-CRC and in the HIS mouse PM-CRC model, we observed that MSS PM-CRC triggered a CD4+ Treg response in the PerIS, while MSI PM-CRC drives CD8+ TEMs responses. Conclusion In conclusion, T cell responses in PM-CRC in HIS mice mirror those in human PM-CRC, making this model suitable to study antitumor T cell responses in PM-CRC.">

        <tr id="Due to the historical dogma, that host defense against intracellular pathogens is mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence suggests a more complex and multifaceted role for B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. They accumulate at the side of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity continue to be unraveled. Apart from antibodies, B cells produce a wide range of cytokines, which can influence the local immune response. Here we addressed the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10) secreting B cells in long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Our research highlights the previously unknown role of B cell-derived IL-10 as a negative regulator of protective immunity in TB. For the first time, we demonstrate that mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 show increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, as evidenced by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was accompanied by male-specific immune alterations, indicating a previously unknown sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key effectors in co-ordinating inflammatory and immune responses to threats to the host. How macrophages decipher diverse danger signals to tailor inflammatory responses remains an unanswered question. Cell volume control is critical for normal cellular function. Disturbances in extracellular and intracellular homeostasis induce changes in cell volume, but the impact of disruptions in cell volume in controlling macrophage inflammatory responses is poorly understood. Here, we discover that macrophages use cell volume control as a bona fide danger sensing mechanism to promote and augment inflammatory responses. Using macrophages deficient in the volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), which lack cell volume control under hypo-osmotic conditions, we show that disruptions in cell volume are sensed by macrophages to drive a large transcriptomic response and induction of inflammation. Cell volume disruption, particularly loss of cell volume control, induces type I interferon signalling through a DNA– and STING-dependent mechanism, but independent of cGAS and 2’3’cGAMP transport. Further, we found that cell volume changes synergise with diverse pathogen-mediated signalling to augment type I interferon responses and exacerbate the cytokine storm in a mouse model of hyperinflammation. Our findings highlight cell volume as an important regulator in shaping inflammatory responses, adding to our understanding of how macrophages sense complex danger signals and threats.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT In vitro studies are crucial for our understanding of the human macrophage immune functions. However, traditional in vitro culture media poorly reflect the metabolic composition of blood, potentially affecting the outcomes of these studies. Here, we analyzed the impact of a physiological medium on human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophages (iPSDM) function. Macrophages cultured in a human plasma-like medium (HPLM) were more permissive to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) replication and showed decreased lipid metabolism with increased metabolic polarization. Functionally, we discovered that HPLM-differentiated macrophages showed different metabolic organelle content and activity. Specifically, HPLM-differentiated macrophages displayed reduced lipid droplet and peroxisome content, increased lysosomal proteolytic activity, and increased mitochondrial activity and dynamics. Inhibiting or inducing lipid droplet formation revealed that lipid droplet content is a key factor influencing macrophage permissiveness to Mtb. These findings underscore the importance of using physiologically relevant media in vitro for accurately studying human macrophage function. IMPORTANCE This work compellingly demonstrates that the choice of culture medium significantly influences M. tuberculosis replication outcomes, thus emphasizing the importance of employing physiologically relevant media for accurate in vitro host-pathogen interaction studies. We anticipate that our work will set a precedent for future research with clinical relevance, particularly in evaluating antibiotic efficacy and resistance in cellulo.">

B cells have been identified as critical antigen presenting cells and their specificity drives disease progression. More recently, they have also been shown to have the capacity to develop into suppressive, regulatory B cells that ameliorate autoimmune disease in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. In these models, signaling through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) drives a glycolytic flux that facilitates expansion of regulatory B cells. Here we examine the relationship between B cell development, cellular metabolism, and HIF-1α to reveal that in a mouse model of autoimmune diabetes, B cells have distinct metabolic characteristics that change with disease progression. Further, response to hypoxia in autoimmune B cells is distinct from the response by non-autoimmune control B cells. Together, these data suggest that dysregulated HIF signaling may drive T1D progression and activation of HIF-1α to expand regulatory B cell populations may be a viable option for immune modulation.">

        <tr id="Fibrosis in the lung is thought to be driven by epithelial cell dysfunction and aberrant cell-cell interactions. Unveiling the molecular mechanisms of cellular plasticity and cell-cell interactions is imperative to elucidating lung regenerative capacity and aberrant repair in pulmonary fibrosis. By mining publicly available RNA-Seq data sets, we identified loss of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) as a candidate contributor to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We used conditional KO mice, scRNA-Seq, lung organoids, small-molecule inhibition, and potentially novel gene manipulation methods to investigate the role of CEBPA in lung fibrosis and repair. Long-term (6 months or more) of Cebpa loss in AT2 cells caused spontaneous fibrosis and increased susceptibility to bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Cebpa knockout (KO) in these mice significantly decreased AT2 cell numbers in the lung and reduced expression of surfactant homeostasis genes, while increasing inflammatory cell recruitment as well as upregulating S100a8/a9 in AT2 cells. In vivo treatment with an S100A8/A9 inhibitor alleviated experimental lung fibrosis. Restoring CEBPA expression in lung organoids ex vivo and during experimental lung fibrosis in vivo rescued CEBPA deficiency–mediated phenotypes. Our study establishes a direct mechanistic link between CEBPA repression, impaired AT2 cell identity, disrupted tissue homeostasis, and lung fibrosis.">

        <tr id="The ability of an organism to overcome infectious diseases has traditionally been linked to killing invading pathogens. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that, apart from restricting pathogen loads, organismal survival is coupled to an additional yet poorly understood mechanism called disease tolerance. Here we report that p16High immune cells play a key role in establishing disease tolerance. We found that the FDA-approved BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a potent and rapid inducer of p16High immune subsets both in mice and humans. In turn, p16High immune cells were indispensable for counteracting different lethal conditions, including LPS-induced sepsis, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and ionizing irradiation. Mechanistically, we propose that activation of TLR7 or a low physiological activity of STING is sufficient to induce p16High immune subset that, in turn, establishes a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance. Furthermore, containing these signals within a beneficial range by deleting MDA5 that appeared sufficient to maintain a low activity of STING, induces p16High immune cells and delays organ deterioration upon aging with improved healthspan. Our data highlight the beneficial role of p16High immune subsets in establishing a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance.">

        <tr id="T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells can counteract the B cell helper activity of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and hinder the production of antibodies against self-antigens or allergens. A mechanistic understanding of the cytokines initiating the differentiation of human regulatory T (Treg) cells into Tfr cells is still missing. Herein, we report that low doses of the pro-Tfh cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) drive the induction of a Tfr cell program on activated human Treg cells while also preserving their regulatory function. Mechanistically, we found that IL-12 led to STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) phosphorylation and binding to IL-12–driven follicular signature genes. Patients with inborn errors of immunity in the IL12RB1 gene presented with a strong decrease in circulating Tfr cells and produced higher levels of anti-actin autoantibodies in vivo. Overall, this study unveils IL-12 as an inducer of Tfr cell differentiation in vivo and provides an approach for the in vitro generation of human Tfr-like cells. IL-12 promotes the acquisition of a follicular program in human regulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells balance the activity of T follicular helper cells and suppress B cell responses to self-antigens and allergens. However, the key signals involved in Tfr cell differentiation, particularly in humans, remain incompletely understood. By screening the effects of multiple cytokines on human regulatory T cells, Castaño et al. identified interleukin-12 (IL-12) as the most potent inducer of Tfr cell differentiation in vitro. IL-12 promoted the acquisition of a follicular gene expression program and STAT4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4) binding at signature follicular loci. In addition, patients bearing mutations in the IL12RB1 gene displayed a strong decrease in circulating Tfr cells. Together, these findings identify IL-12 as a driver of human Tfr cell differentiation, thus enabling their in vitro generation. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Abundant infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor stroma plays a pivotal role in inducing immune escape in pancreatic cancer (PC). Lactate serves as a direct regulator of macrophage polarization and functions, although the precise regulation mechanism remain inadequately understood. Our study revealed that PC cells promote macrophage polarization towards the M2d phenotype through high lactate secretion. M2d is characterized by elevated secretion of IL-10 and VEGF-A, which diminish CD8+ T cells cytotoxicity and promote tumor neoangiogenesis simultaneously. Additionally, we identify 2,5'-oligoadenylate synthase 3 (OAS3) as an essential regulator of M2d polarization, upregulated by PC cells via lactate/METTL3/OAS3 axis. METTL3 mediated m6A modification on OAS3 mRNA correlates with increased OAS3 expression in TAMs, which is associated with poorer prognosis in PC patients. OAS3 deficiency in macrophages substantially impairs IL-10highVEGF-AhighM2d polarization and their pro-tumor functions while enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine (Gem) and anti-PD-L1 mAb in humanized mouse models. In conclusion, OAS3 presents as a promising immune therapeutic target for reversing IL-10highVEGF-AhighM2d infiltration and restoring CD8+ T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity in pancreatic cancer.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Rat post-mitotic septal (SEP) neurons, engineered to conditionally proliferate at 330C, differentiate when arrested at 37.50C and can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine independent cDNA libraries were made to follow arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses in normal (Nl) uninfected and CJ agent infected SEP cells. Proliferating Nl versus latently infected (CJ-) cells showed few RNA-seq differences. However arrest induced major changes. Normal cells displayed a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts. Additionally, known neuron differentiation transcripts, e.g., Agtr2, Neuregulin-1, GDF6, SFRP4 and Prnp were upregulated. These Nl neurons also displayed many activated IFN innate immune genes, e.g., OAS1, RTP4, ISG20, GTB4, CD80 and cytokines, complement, and clusterin (CLU) that binds to misfolded proteins. In contrast, arrested highly infectious CJ+ cells (10 logs/gm) downregulated many replication controls. Furthermore, arrested CJ+ cells suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ agent infection. CJ+ cells also enhanced IFN stimulated pathways, and analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts, e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin). These data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection can enhance and expand anti-viral responses; 3) latent CJ infection epigenetically imprints many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. CJ+ brain microglia, white blood cells and intestinal myeloid cells with shared transcripts may be stimulated to educe latent CJD infections that can be clinically silent for >30 years.">

        <tr id="Stem-like progenitors are a critical subset of cytotoxic T cells that self-renew and give rise to expanded populations of effector cells critical for successful checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Emerging evidence suggests that the tumor-draining lymph nodes can support the continuous generation of these stem-like cells that replenish the tumor sites and act as a critical source of expanded effector populations, underlining the importance of understanding what factors promote and maintain activated T cells in the stem-like state. Using advanced 3D multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, here we identified antigen-presentation niches in tumor-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance, and affinity evolution of a unique population of TCF-1+PD-1+SLAMF6hi stem-like CD8+ T cells. Our results show that contrary to the prevailing view that persistent TCR signaling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement well beyond the initial priming phase sustained the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway plays a central role in this process by mediating the fine-tuning of TCR and co-stimulatory signal input that enables selective expansion of high affinity TCR stem-like clones, enabling them to act as a renewable source of high affinity effector cells. PD-1 checkpoint blockade disrupts this fine tuning of input signaling, leading to terminal differentiation to the effector state or death of the most avid anti-tumor stem-like cells. Our results thus reveal an unexpected relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative feedback regulatory loop, and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumor effect that comes at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high affinity stem-like precursors.">

T cells are major IL-32 producers in these diseases and key mediators of pathogen and tumor elimination but also autoimmune destruction. However, their contribution to IL-32 biology during immune responses is hardly understood due to several isoforms with divergent inflammatory properties. Here, we identified IL-32β as the predominant isoform in various T cell subsets of healthy individuals and breast cancer patients with the highest levels detected in intratumoral regulatory T cells. We show that IL-32β is induced by IL-2 but IL-32β release requires T Cell Receptor rather than IL2R stimulation. Using inhibitors of protein secretion pathways and serial (ultra)centrifugation of T cell supernatants, we demonstrate that T cells actively secrete IL-32β unconventionally, as a free protein and, to a minor degree, through exosomes. Thus, our data identify activated T cells as major IL-32β secretors in health and cancer.">

        <tr id="Current HIV-1 therapeutic vaccines do not generate T-cell immune responses in people with HIV-1 (PWH) able to eradicate the virus or to broadly control viral replication. The expression of inhibitory receptors (IRs) may limit vaccine efficacy by reducing specific effector functions in vaccine-induced T-cells. Recently, the clinical use of antibodies targeting IRs or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has demonstrated remarkable success in cancer remission. Therefore, there is a potential benefit of using ICB in PWH to improve the effectiveness of vaccine-induced T-cell responses. Here, we evaluated functional changes in vaccine-induced HIV-specific CD8⁺ T-cell responses by in-vitro PD-1 and TIM-3 blockade during immune stimulation in PWH early ART-treated and vaccinated (Etvac). We compared Etvac to PWH early ART-treated (Et) and chronic ART-treated PWH (Chro). Our results demonstrate a significant increase in the functional responses of vaccine-induced HIV-1-specific CD8⁺ T-cells upon PD-1 but not TIM-3 blockade in cellular proliferation, IFNγ production, and activation. Although no effect was found in Et, similar findings were obtained in HIV-1-specific CD8⁺ T-cells in Chro for combined PD-1/TIM-3 blockade. Moreover, we identify in Etvac a direct association between PD-1 expression in CD8+ T cells and in vitro response to anti-PD-1 treatment. Our findings support the potential adjuvant effect of PD-1 blockade to improve HIV-1 therapeutic vaccine efficacy in early ART-treated PWH for future human studies.">

To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs.">

        <tr id="The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to foreign antigens in food and commensal microbes with potential to induce adaptive immune responses. Peripherally induced T regulatory (pTreg) cells are essential for mitigating inflammatory responses to these agents1–4. While RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells (RORγt-APCs) were shown to program gut microbiota-specific pTregs5–7, understanding of their characteristics remains incomplete, and the APC subset responsible for food tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that RORγt-APCs are similarly required for differentiation of food antigen-specific pTregs and establishment of oral tolerance. The ability of these cells to direct both food and microbiota-specific pTreg cell differentiation is contingent on expression of RORγt and on a unique cis-regulatory element within the Rorc gene locus (Rorc(t) +7kb). Absent this +7kb element, there was a notable increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 (Th2) cells in lieu of pTregs, leading to compromised tolerance in a mouse asthma model. By employing single-cell analyses across these models, as well as freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, we identified a rare subset of evolutionarily conserved APCs that are dependent on RORγt, uniquely express the Prdm16 transcription factor, and are endowed with essential mediators for inducing pTreg cell differentiation. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of how RORγt-APCs develop and how they regulate T cell responses to food and microbial antigens could offer new insights into developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as organ transplant tolerance.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The Hodgkin and Reed – Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) actively modify the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) attracting immunosuppressive cells and expressing inhibitory molecules. A high frequency of myeloid cells in the TME is correlated with an unfavorable prognosis, but more specific and rare cell populations lack precise markers. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been identified in the peripheral blood of cHL patients, where they appear to be correlated with disease aggressiveness. TNFRSF9 (CD137) is a T cell co-stimulator expressed by monocytic and dendritic cells. Its expression has also been described in HRS cells, where it is thought to play a role in reducing antitumor responses. Here, we perform qualitative and quantitative analyses of lymphocytic and MDSC subtypes and determine the CD137 cell distribution in cHL primary tumors using multiplex immunofluorescence and automated multispectral imaging. The results were correlated with patients’ clinical features. Cells were stained with specific panels of immune checkpoint markers (PD-1, PD-L1, CD137), tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (CD3, PD-1), and monocytic cells/MDSCs (CD68, CD14, CD33, Arg-1, CD11b). This approach allowed us to identify distinct phenotypes and to analyze spatial interactions between immune subpopulations and tumor cells. The results confirm CD137 expression by T, monocytic and HRS cells. In addition, the expression of CD137, T exhausted cells, and monocytic MDSCs (m-MDSCs) in the vicinity of malignant HRS cells were associated with a worse prognosis. Our findings reveal new elements of the TME that mediate immune escape, and confirm CD137 as a candidate target for immunotherapy in cHL.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) show signs of low-grade inflammation, which is related to the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the underlying triggers remain unknown. The gut microbiota is a plausible source as it comprises pro-inflammatory bacteria, bacterial metabolites and viruses, including (bacterio)phages. These prokaryotic viruses have been shown to mediate inflammatory responses in gastrointestinal disease. Given the differences in phage populations in healthy individuals versus those with cardiometabolic diseases such as T2D, we here questioned whether phages from T2D individuals would have increased immunogenic potential. To address this, we isolated intestinal phages from a fresh stool sample of healthy controls and individuals with newly diagnosed, treatment-naive T2D. Phages were purified using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation and incubated with healthy donor dendritic cells (DCs) and autologous T cells. Donors with T2D had slightly higher free viral particle numbers compared to healthy controls (p = .1972), which has been previously associated with disease states. Further, phages from T2D induced a higher inflammatory response in DCs and T cells than phages from HC. For example, the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on DCs (p < .001) and interferon-y secretion from T cells (p < .01) were increased when comparing the two groups. These results suggest that phages might play a role in low-grade inflammation in T2D individuals.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the leading causes of death due to an infectious agent. Coinfection with HIV exacerbates Mtb infection outcomes in people living with HIV (PLWH). Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the only approved TB vaccine, is effective in infants, but its efficacy in adolescents and adults is limited. Here, we investigated the immune responses elicited by BCG administered via intravenous (IV) or intradermal (ID) routes in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)-infected Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM) without the confounding effects of Mtb challenge. We assessed the impact of vaccination on T cell responses in the airway, blood, and tissues (lung, thoracic lymph nodes, and spleen), as well as the expression of cytokines, cytotoxic molecules, and key transcription factors. Our results showed that IV BCG induces a robust and sustained immune response, including tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells in lungs, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8αβ+ T cells expressing multiple cytokines, and CD8αβ+ T cells and NK cells expressing cytotoxic effectors in airways. We also detected higher levels of mycobacteria-specific IgG and IgM in the airways of IV BCG-vaccinated MCM. Although IV BCG vaccination resulted in an influx of TRM cells in lungs of MCM with controlled SIV replication, MCM with high plasma SIV RNA (>105 copies/mL) typically displayed reduced T cell responses, suggesting that uncontrolled SIV or HIV replication would have a detrimental effect on IV BCG-induced protection against Mtb.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell engagers (TCEs) are becoming an integral class of biological therapeutic owing to their highly potent ability to eradicate cancer cells. Nevertheless, the widespread utility of classical CD3-targeted TCEs has been limited by narrow therapeutic index (TI) linked to systemic CD4+ T cell activation and aberrant cytokine release. One attractive approach to circumvent the systemic activation of pan CD3+ T cells and reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome is to redirect specific subsets of T cells. A promising strategy is the use of peptide-major histocompatibility class I bispecific antibodies (pMHC-IgGs), which have emerged as an intriguing modality of TCE, based on their ability to selectively redirect highly reactive viral-specific effector memory cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to eliminate cancer cells. However, the relatively low frequency of these effector memory cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may hamper their redirection as effector cells for clinical applications. To mitigate this potential limitation, we report here the generation of a pMHC-IgG derivative known as guided-pMHC-staging (GPS) carrying a covalent fusion of a monovalent interleukin-2 (IL-2) mutein (H16A, F42A). Using an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) arm as a proof-of-concept, tumor-associated antigen paired with a single-chain HLA-A *02:01/CMVpp65 pMHC fusion moiety, we demonstrate in vitro that the IL-2-armored GPS modality robustly expands CMVpp65-specific CD8+ effector memory T cells and induces potent cytotoxic activity against target cancer cells. Similar to GPS, IL-2-armored GPS molecules induce modulated T cell activation and reduced cytokine release profile compared to an analogous CD3-targeted TCE. In vivo we show that IL-2-armored GPS, but not the corresponding GPS, effectively expands grafted CMVpp65 CD8+ T cells from unstimulated human PBMCs in an NSG mouse model. Lastly, we demonstrate that the IL-2-armored GPS modality exhibits a favorable developability profile and monoclonal antibody-like pharmacokinetic properties in human neonatal Fc receptor transgenic mice. Overall, IL-2-armored GPS represents an attractive approach for treating cancer with the potential for inducing vaccine-like antiviral T cell expansion, immune cell redirection as a TCE, and significantly widened TI due to reduced cytokine release.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath, leading to irreversible and progressive functional deficits in patients. Pre-clinical studies involving the use of neural stem cells (NSCs) have already demonstrated their potential in neuronal regeneration and remyelination. However, the exclusive application of cell therapy has not proved sufficient to achieve satisfactory therapeutic levels. Recognizing these limitations, there is a need to combine cell therapy with other adjuvant protocols. In this context, extracellular vesicles (EVs) can contribute to intercellular communication, stimulating the production of proteins and lipids associated with remyelination and providing trophic support to axons. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of NSCs and EVs derived from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. OPCs were differentiated from NSCs and had their identity confirmed by gene expression analysis and immunocytochemistry. Exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and characterized by Western, transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Experimental therapy of C57BL/6 mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were grouped in control, treated with NSCs, treated with OPC-derived EVs and treated with a combination of both. The treatments were evaluated clinically using scores and body weight, microscopically using immunohistochemistry and immunological profile by flow cytometry. The animals showed significant clinical improvement and weight gain with the treatments. However, only the treatments involving EVs led to immune modulation, changing the profile from Th1 to Th2 lymphocytes. Fifteen days after treatment revealed a reduction in reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in the groups treated with EVs. However, there was no reduction in demyelination. The results indicate the potential therapeutic use of OPC-derived EVs to attenuate inflammation and promote recovery in EAE, especially when combined with cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Mucosal immunity plays a crucial role in defending against coronaviruses, particularly at respiratory sites, serving as the first line of defense against viral invasion and replication. Coronaviruses have developed various immune evasion strategies at the mucosal immune system, hindering the recognition of infected cells and evading antibody responses. Understanding the immune mechanisms and responses is crucial for developing effective vaccines and therapeutics against coronaviruses. The role of mucosal immunity in COVID-19 is significant, influencing both local and systemic immune responses to the virus. Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Mucosally delivered vaccines and those under clinical trials are being compared and contrasted to understand their effectiveness in inducing mucosal immunity against coronaviruses. A greater understanding of lung tissue-based immunity may lead to improved diagnostic and prognostic procedures and novel treatment strategies aimed at reducing the disease burden of community-acquired pneumonia, avoiding the systemic manifestations of infection and excess morbidity and mortality. This comprehensive review article outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. It also proposes that there is a significant role for mucosal immunity and for secretory as well as circulating IgA antibodies in COVID-19, and that it is important to elucidate this in order to comprehend especially the asymptomatic and mild states of the infection, which appear to account for the majority of cases. Moreover, it is possible that mucosal immunity can be exploited for beneficial diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic purposes. The findings from recent studies on mucosal immunity in COVID-19 can be used to develop effective vaccines and treatments that can effectively target both mucosal and systemic immune responses.">

Interferons(IFNs) have been identified as cornerstones of epithelial cell-intrinsic defense against such pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA transcripts (>200 nt) not translated into protein and represent a critical regulatory component of mucosal defense. We report here that lncRNA Nostrill facilitates IFN-γ-stimulated intestinal epithelial cell-intrinsic defense against infection by Cryptosporidium, an important opportunistic pathogen in AIDS patients and a common cause of diarrhea in young children. Nostrill promotes transcription of a panel of genes controlled by IFN-γ through facilitating Stat1 chromatin recruitment and thus, enhances expression of several genes associated with cell-intrinsic defense in intestinal epithelial cells in response to IFN-γ stimulation, including Igtp, iNos, and Gadd45g. Induction of Nostrill enhances IFN-γ-stimulated intestinal epithelial defense against Cryptosporidium infection, which is associated with an enhanced autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells. Our findings reveal that Nostrill enhances the transcription of a set of genes regulated by IFN-γ in intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, induction of Nostrill facilitates the IFN-γ-mediated epithelial cell-intrinsic defense against cryptosporidial infections.">

        <tr id="Young children, especially those aged 4 months to 2 years of age, frequently exhibit severe morbidity during respiratory viral infections. For influenza infections, macrophages/monocytes serve as front line defenses against early viral replication in the lungs until the adaptive immune system arrives to clear virus. However, infiltrating inflammatory monocytes are a significant cause of influenza induced lung pathology/morbidity. We utilized a young murine model of respiratory viral infections using 21-day-old mice to investigate the mechanisms driving the heightened influenza induced morbidity observed in human young children. We hypothesized that macrophages/monocytes responses to influenza would diverge between young and older mice despite our evidence that macrophages from both groups appear to control viral replication at similar rates. While inflammatory monocyte infiltration contributed to influenza induced morbidity/lung inflammation in adults, they did not appear to contribute to morbidity in young mice. Instead, young mice appeared to develop lung inflammation through a lack of interferon gamma (IFNψ) and infection of macrophage populations. In contrast, adult mice controlled early viral replication through macrophage populations (alveolar, interstitial, and inflammatory) and inflammatory monocytes. While intrinsic limitations in anti-viral cytokine responses, especially IFNψ, characterized the macrophage response to viral infection in young mice, the innate immune response to infection appears diminished compared to adults. This study highlights the intrinsic limitations in macrophage effector functions that may arise in young children but that also contribute to disease pathology.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can increase the risk of neuroinflammation, and subsequent neurodegenerative diseases. Certain IAV strains, such as avian H7N7 subtype, possess neurotropic properties, enabling them to directly invade the brain parenchyma and infect neurons and glia cells. Host sex significantly influences the severity of IAV infections. Studies indicate that females of the reproductive age exhibit stronger innate and adaptive immune responses to IAVs compared to males. This heightened immune response correlates with increased morbidity and mortality, and potential neuronal damage in females. Understanding the sex-specific neurotropism of IAV and associated mechanisms leading to adverse neurological outcomes is essential. Our study reveals that primary hippocampal cultures from female mice show heightened interferon-β and pro-inflammatory chemokine secretion following neurotropic IAV infection. We observed sex-specific differences in microglia activation: both sexes showed a transition into a hyper-ramified state, but only male-derived microglia exhibited an increase in amoeboid-shaped cells. These disparities extended to alterations in neuronal morphology. Neurons derived from female mice displayed increased spine density within 24 h post-infection, while no significant change was observed in male cultures. This aligns with sex-specific differences in microglial synaptic pruning. Data suggest that amoeboid-shaped microglia preferentially target postsynaptic terminals, potentially reducing neuronal hyperexcitability. Conversely, hyper-ramified microglia may focus on presynaptic terminals, potentially limiting viral spread. In conclusion, our findings underscore the utility of primary hippocampal cultures, incorporating microglia, as an effective model to study sex-specific, virus-induced effects on brain-resident cells.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant aggravating factor in individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for TB, and HIV-1 target macrophages. Understanding how Mtb subverts these cells may facilitate the identification of new druggable targets. Here, we explored how TB can induce macrophages to form tunneling nanotubes (TNT), promoting HIV-1 spread. We found that TB triggers metabolic rewiring of macrophages, increasing their glycolytic ATP production. Using pharmacological inhibitors and glucose deprivation, we discovered that disrupting aerobic glycolysis significantly reduces HIV-1 exacerbation in these macrophages. Glycolysis is essential for tunneling nanotubes (TNT) formation, which facilitates viral transfer and cell-to-cell fusion and induces the expression of the sialoadhesin Siglec-1, enhancing both HIV-1 binding and TNT stabilization. Glycolysis did not exacerbate HIV-1 infection when TNT formation was pharmacologically prevented, indicating that higher metabolic activity is not sufficient per se to make macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1. Overall, these data might facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting glycolytic activity in TB-induced immunomodulatory macrophages to ultimately halt HIV-1 dissemination in co-infected patients.">

        <tr id="Taxanes are widely used in chemotherapy, but primary and acquired resistance limit the clinical efficacy. Studies have shown tumor interaction with macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a significant role in taxane resistance, yet therapeutic strategies that directly deplete or repolarize macrophages are challenging and with considerable risk of side effects. Here we uncovered that tumor-macrophage interaction can be selectively targeted by inhibiting post-mitotic NOTCH2-JAG1 juxtacrine signaling in the TME, which strongly sensitizes paclitaxel response. Using translatome profiling, we found significant NOTCH2 upregulation during paclitaxel-induced prolonged mitosis. NOTCH2 was subsequently activated in the post-mitotic G1 phase by JAG1 expressed on the neighboring macrophages and tumor cells, which promoted tumor cell survival and upregulated cytokines that recruited JAG1-expressing macrophages, thus generating a positive feedback loop that further enhanced the pro-tumor NOTCH2 activity. By targeting this NOTCH2-JAG1 axis using NOTCH2 shRNA or a pan-NOTCH inhibitor, macrophage recruitment and paclitaxel resistance were significantly attenuated in multiple mouse tumor models of ovarian cancer. Clinical samples from paired primary and recurrent ovarian cancer patients also showed significant correlation of higher NOTCH2 expression with worse prognosis. Our results thus point to combining NOTCH2 inhibitor with taxane as an effective therapeutic strategy to selectively disrupt tumor-macrophage interaction in the TME and overcome macrophage-mediated taxane resistance in NOTCH2-positive tumors.">

        <tr id="Alterations in the lung microbiome frequently accompany adverse pulmonary outcomes. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) markedly affects the lung microbiome corresponding with a high incidence of post-HCT pulmonary complications. In a preclinical mouse model of HCT, we observed a reduction in Lactobacillus johnsonii within the lung microbiome following transplantation. Intranasal administration of live or heat-killed (HK) L. johnsonii at low doses reduced gammaherpesvirus-induced pulmonary fibrosis in HCT mice, in which IL-17A plays an essential role. HK L. johnsonii treatment of HCT mice suppressed inflammatory cytokine production by lung macrophages and decreased Il17a expression in T helper 17 (Th17) cells. HK L. johnsonii increased PD-L1 expression on the surface of type II conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in HCT mice and in vitro in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). HK L. johnsonii-exposed BMDCs also inhibited IL-17A secretion from co-cultured Th17 cells in a PD-1-dependent manner. Notably, when HK L. johnsonii was administered to HCT mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells from PD-1 knockout (KO) mice, which lack a PD-L1 mediated response, HK L. johnsonii-mediated reduction of pulmonary fibrosis was negated. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that HK L. johnsonii mitigates herpesvirus-induced pulmonary fibrosis in HCT mice by modulating cDC2 surface expression of PD-L1, which subsequently suppresses Il17a expression in Th17 cells, pointing towards a potential postbiotic-based strategy for immunomodulation to address pulmonary complications of HCT.">

Mechanistically, iNKT cells respond to disseminating cancer cells by producing the fibrogenic cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 in a TCR-independent manner. Selective abrogation of IL-4 and IL-13 sensing in hepatic stellate cells prevented their transdifferentiation into extracellular matrix-producing myofibroblasts, which hindered metastatic outgrowth of disseminated cancer cells.

        <tr id="Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potential cancer therapeutic that induces apoptosis in cancer cells while sparing the non-malignant cells in preclinical models. However, its efficacy in clinical trials has been limited, suggesting unknown modulatory mechanisms responsible for the lack of TRAIL activity in patients. Here, we hypothesized that TRAIL treatment elicits transcriptional changes in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells that alter the immune milieu. To test this, we performed an RNAseq analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with TRAIL, followed by validation in additional TNBC cell lines. TRAIL significantly induces expression of multiple cytokines such as CXCLs 1, 2, 3, 8,11 and IL-6, which are known to modify neutrophil function. Mechanistically, the induction of these cytokines was predominantly mediated by death receptor 5, caspase 8 (but not caspase 8 enzymatic activity), and the non-canonical NFKB2 pathway. The cytokines produced by the TRAIL-treated TNBC cells enhanced chemotaxis of healthy human donor isolated neutrophils. In vivo, TRAIL treated TNBC murine xenograft tumors showed activation of the NFKB2 pathway, elevated production of CXCLs and IL-6, and increased neutrophil recruitment into the tumors. Moreover, donor isolated neutrophils preincubated in supernatants from TRAIL-treated TNBC cells exhibited impaired cytotoxic effect against TNBC cells. Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils incubated with either TRAIL alone or supernatant of TRAIL-treated TNBC cells revealed increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, immune modulatory genes, immune checkpoint genes, and genes implicated in delayed neutrophil apoptosis. Functional studies with these neutrophils confirmed their suppressive effect on T cell proliferation and an increase in Treg suppressive phenotype. Collectively, our study demonstrates a novel role of TRAIL-induced NFKB2-dependent cytokine production that promotes neutrophil chemotaxis and immune suppression.">

        <tr id="Biliary atresia (BA) is a leading cause of liver failure in infants. Despite effective surgical drainage, patients with BA exhibit attenuated immune responses to childhood vaccines, suggesting there are long-lasting alterations to immune function. The perinatal liver is home to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and serves as the epicenter for rapidly progressive and significantly morbid inflammatory diseases like BA. We have previously established the role of neonatal myeloid progenitors in the pathogenesis of perinatal liver inflammation (PLI) and hypothesize that PLI leads to long-term changes to HSPCs in mice that recovered from PLI. To test this hypothesis, we compared the changes that occur to HSPCs and mature myeloid populations in the bone marrow of adult mice during homeostasis and during PLI. Our results demonstrate that HSPCs from animals that recover from PLI (“PLI-recovered”) undergo long-term expansion with a reduced proliferative capacity. Notably, PLI leads to persistent activation of common myeloid progenitors through the involvement of CXCL10 and its canonical receptor, CXCR3. Our data suggests that the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis may mediate the changes in HSPCs that lead to altered immune function observed in BA, providing support for a targetable pathway to mitigate the detrimental long-term immune effects observed in patients with BA.">

        <tr id="Background Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) are pivotal in B cell responses. Activation of the purinergic receptor P2X7 on Tfh cells regulates their activity. We investigated the ATP-P2X7R axis in circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells during Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. Methods We analyzed two cohorts: children with RSV infection (moderate, n=30; severe, n=21) and healthy children (n=23). We utilized ELISA to quantify the levels of PreF RSV protein-specific IgG antibodies, IL-21 cytokine, and soluble P2X7R (sP2X7R) in both plasma and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Additionally, luminometry was employed to determine ATP levels in plasma, NPA and supernatant culture. The frequency of cTfh cells, P2X7R expression, and plasmablasts were assessed by flow cytometry. To evaluate apoptosis, proliferation, and IL-21 production by cTfh cells, we cultured PBMCs in the presence of Bz-ATP and/or P2X7R antagonist (KN-62) and a flow cytometry analysis was performed. Results In children with severe RSV disease, we observed diminished titers of neutralizing anti-PreF IgG antibodies. Additionally, severe infections, compared to moderate cases, were associated with fewer cTfh cells and reduced plasma levels of IL-21. Our investigation revealed dysregulation in the ATP-P2X7R pathway during RSV infection. This was characterized by elevated ATP levels in both plasma and NPA samples, increased expression of P2X7R on cTfh cells, lower levels of sP2X7R, and heightened ATP release from PBMCs upon stimulation, particularly evident in severe cases. Importantly, ATP exposure decreased cTfh proliferative response and IL-21 production, while promoting their apoptosis. The P2X7R antagonist KN-62 mitigated these effects. Furthermore, disease severity positively correlated with ATP levels in plasma and NPA samples and inversely correlated with cTfh frequency. Conclusion Our findings indicate that activation of the ATP-P2X7R pathway during RSV infection may contribute to limiting the cTfh cell compartment by promoting cell death and dysfunction, ultimately leading to increased disease severity.">

We identified granzyme K, a product made by cytotoxic cells including NKT cells, is linked to induction of Th1-associated antibodies during primary dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. We examined the role of NKT cells in vivo using DENV-infected mice lacking CD1d-dependent (CD1ddep) NKT cells. In CD1d-KO mice, Th1-polarized immunity and infection resolution were impaired, which was dependent on intrinsic NKT cell production of IFN-γ, since it was restored by adoptive transfer of WT but not IFN-γ-KO NKT cells. Furthermore, NKT cell deficiency triggered immune bias, resulting in higher levels of Th2-associated IgG1 than Th1-associated IgG2a, which failed to protect against a homologous DENV re-challenge and promoted antibody-dependent enhanced disease during secondary heterologous infections. Similarly, Th2-immunity, typified by a higher IgG4:IgG3 ratio, was associated with worsened human disease severity during secondary infections. Thus, CD1ddep NKT cells establish Th1 polarity during the early innate response to DENV, which promotes infection resolution, memory formation and long-term protection from secondary homologous and heterologous infections. These observations illustrate how early innate immune responses during primary infections can influence secondary infection outcomes.">

Given the involvement of the CD27 pathway in the pathophysiology of various T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory, autoimmune, and lymphoproliferative diseases, we examined the impact of AZM on CD27 regulation and potential consequences on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotypes. Using cellular immunology approaches on healthy donors’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we demonstrate AZM-mediated downregulation of surface CD27 expression as well as its extracellular release as soluble CD27. Notably, AZM-exposed CD27high (hi) cells were defective in their ability to expand compared to CD27intermediate (Int) and CD27low (lo) subsets. The defective CD27hi subset expansion was found to be associated with impaired cell proliferation and cell division. At the molecular level, the CD27hi subset exhibited lower mTOR activity than other subsets. Functionally, AZM treatment resulted in marked depletion of helper CD4+ (Th1) and cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte (Tc1)-associated CXCR3+CD27hi effector cells and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ production. These findings provide mechanistic insights on immunomodulatory features of AZM on T-lymphocyte by altering the CD27 pathway.

Improving myelin restoration is essential to prevent neurodegeneration and the associated disability in MS patients. However, remyelinating therapies are failing in clinical trials, in part, due to the absence of classifying biomarkers of different endogenous regenerative capacities amongst enrolled patients. We previously reported that circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) at the onset of the murine model of MS experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are associated with milder disease courses and less degree of demyelination and axonal damage in spinal cord lesions, while at peak are indicative of a better symptom recovery. Moreover, M-MDSCs are able to promote in vitro oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation towards mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) through the release of the soluble factor osteopontin. Results Here, we show a relationship between disease severity and a gradient of OPCs between the rim and the core in mixed active-inactive lesions of MS patients, along with a positive correlation between M-MDSC density and OPC abundance in the same lesions. We also show that EAE disease severity negatively influences the density of total and newly generated OPCs found associated to the demyelinated lesions of the spinal cord at the peak of the disease. In addition, disease severity also impacts the abundance of newly generated OLs originated either during the effector phase or during the early recovery phase. We also demonstrate the positive association between infiltrated M-MDSCs and the abundance of OPCs in the periplaque of demyelinating lesions at the peak of EAE. Interestingly, circulating M-MDSCs at EAE onset and peak of the disease are directly associated to a higher density of newly generated OLs in the plaque and periplaque, respectively. Conclusion Disease severity clearly impacts oligodendrocyte generation during a neuroinflammatory insult like EAE. Our results set the basis for further studies on M-MDSCs as a promising new biomarker that identify a CNS prone to the generation of new OLs that may contribute to restore myelin.">

        <tr id="Liver fibrosis associated with increased mortality is caused by activation of hepatic stellate cells and excessive production and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to fibrotic insults. It has been shown that in addition to liver inflammation, systemic inflammation also contributes to liver fibrogenesis. A deeper understanding of mechanisms that control liver fibrotic response to intra- and extra-hepatic inflammation is essential to develop novel clinical strategies against this disease. Extracellular vesicles (EV) have been recognized as immune mediators that facilitate activation of hepatic stellate cells. In inflammatory diseases, activated neutrophils release neutrophil elastase (NE) bound to EV, which has been identified as a significant contributor to inflammation by promoting immune cell activation. Here, we aimed to explore the role of inflammation derived plasma EV-associated NE in liver fibrogenesis and its potential mechanisms. We show EV-associated NE induces activation, proliferation and migration of hepatic stellate cells by promoting activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This effect did not occur through EV without surface NE, and Sivelestat, a NE inhibitor, inhibited activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway mediated by EV-associated NE. Moreover, we found plasma EV-associated NE increases deposition of collagen1 and α-smooth muscle actin in the liver of a mouse model of liver fibrosis (Mdr2-/-). Notably, this effect does not occur in control mice without preexisting liver disease. These data suggest that EV-associated NE is a pro-fibrogenic factor for hepatic stellate cell activation via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in pre-existing liver injuries. Inhibition of the plasma EV-associated NE in inflammatory conditions may be a therapeutic target for liver fibrosis in patients with inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Aberrant activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway causes autoimmunity in humans and mice; however, the exact mechanism by which the cGAS-STING pathway initiates adaptive immunity and tissue pathology is still not fully understood. Here, we used a cGAS knockin (KI) mouse model that develops systemic autoimmunity. In the lungs of cGAS-KI mice, blood vessels were enclosed by organized lymphoid tissues that resemble tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). Cell-intrinsic cGAS induction promoted up-regulation of CCR5 in CD8+ T cells and led to CCL5 production in vascular endothelial cells. Peripheral CD8+ T cells were recruited to the lungs and produced CXCL13 and interferon-γ. The latter triggered endothelial cell death, potentiated CCL5 production, and was essential for TLS establishment. Blocking CCL5 or CCR5, or depleting CD8+ T cells, impaired TLS formation. cGAS-mediated TLS formation also enhanced humoral and antitumor responses. These data demonstrate that cGAS signaling drives a specialized lymphoid structure that underlies autoimmune tissue pathology. cGAS initiates pulmonary TLS formation, which is dependent on the CCL5-CCR5 axis between endothelial cells and T cells. Editor’s summary Overactivation of the innate immune sensing cGAS-STING pathway can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. To investigate how cGAS hyperactivation drives lung inflammation, Zhao et al. generated a cGAS conditional knockin mouse model. Hyperactivation of cGAS resulted in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the lung, which enhanced antibody responses and antitumor immunity. CCL5-producing endothelial cells in the lung promoted CD8+ T cell recruitment to TLSs via CCR5 signaling, which was induced by T cell–intrinsic cGAS expression. Blocking CCR5/CCL5 impaired TLS formation, suggesting that CCR5/CCL5 could be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity or to enhance antitumor immunity. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus and the leading cause of infectious disease related birth defects worldwide. How the immune response modulates the risk of intrauterine transmission of HCMV after maternal infection remains poorly understood. Maternal T cells likely play a critical role in preventing infection at the maternal-fetal interface and limiting spread across the placenta, but concerns exist that immune responses to infection may also cause placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a guinea pig model of primary cytomegalovirus infection. Monoclonal antibodies specific to guinea pig CD4 and CD8 were used to deplete T cells in non- pregnant and in pregnant guinea pigs after mid-gestation. CD4+ T cell depletion increased the severity of illness, caused significantly elevated viral loads, and increased the rate of congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection relative to animals treated with control antibody. CD8+ T cell depletion was comparably well tolerated and did not significantly affect the weight of infected guinea pigs or viral loads in their blood or tissue. However, significantly more viral genomes and transcripts were detected in the placenta and decidua of CD8+ T cell depleted dams post-infection. This study corroborates earlier findings made in nonhuman primates that maternal CD4+ T cells play a critical role in limiting the severity of primary CMV infection during pregnancy while also revealing that other innate and adaptive immune responses can compensate for an absent CD8+ T cell response in α-CD8-treated guinea pigs. Author Summary Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is a leading cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes and preventable disability in children. Using guinea pigs, a well-established small animal model of congenital infection and intrauterine development, this study tested how depleting T cells affects the course of primary cytomegalovirus infections. Severe illness and high rates of congenital infection were observed when helper CD4+ T cells were depleted. The depletion of killer CD8+ T cells did not affect the severity of disease or the rate of congenital infection but did increase the amount of virus that was detected in the placenta. A greater understanding how an immune response can prevent the infection of the placenta and developing offspring is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic development. This study not only describes a new reagent that can be used to study the guinea pig immune system but also sheds new light in how adaptive immunity regulates congenital viral infection.">

The initial site of virus replication is the mosquito biting site in the host skin, yet the role of host skin bacteria remains unclear. Here, we observed accelerated progression of Zika virus (ZIKV)-induced disease in mice with depleted skin bacteria by topical antibiotic treatment prior to ZIKV infection. Increased viral loads in the blood, draining lymph node, spleen and brain of antibiotic-treated mice suggested faster ZIKV dissemination. Flow cytometry revealed increased frequencies of T cells in the lymph nodes, along with enhanced activation of T cells in the brain upon antibiotic treatment. The antibiotic-induced phenotype was rescued by restoring the skin bacteria prior to infection. Our findings demonstrate an increased susceptibility to ZIKV infection in mice with depleted skin microbiomes, suggesting a potential role of skin bacteria in modulating the infection outcome.">

        <tr id="Measles virus (MeV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus transmitted via aerosols. To understand how MeV exits the airways of an infected host, we use unpassaged primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE). MeV typically remains cell-associated in HAE and forms foci of infection, termed infectious centers, by directly spreading cell-to-cell. We previously described the phenomenon in which infectious centers detach en masse from HAE and remain viable. Here we investigate the mechanism of this cellular detachment. Via immunostaining, we observed loss of tight junction and cell adhesion proteins within infectious centers. These morphological changes indicate activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT can contribute to wound healing in respiratory epithelia by mobilizing nearby cells. Inhibiting TGF-β, and thus EMT, reduced infectious center detachment. Compared to uninfected cells, MeV-infected cells also expressed increased levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a regulator of live cell extrusion. Live cell extrusion encourages cells to detach from respiratory epithelia by contracting the actomyosin of neighboring cells. Inhibition or induction of live cell extrusion impacted infectious center detachment rates. Thus, these two related pathways contributed to infectious center detachment in HAE. Detached infectious centers contained high titers of virus that may be protected from the environment, allowing the virus to live on surfaces longer and infect more hosts. This mechanism may contribute to the highly contagious nature of MeV. IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV) is an extremely contagious respiratory pathogen that continues to cause large, disruptive outbreaks each year. Here, we examine a phenomenon that may help explain the contagious nature of MeV: detachment of MeV-infected cells. MeV spreads cell-to-cell in human airway epithelial cells (HAE) to form groups of infected cells, termed “infectious centers”. We reported that infectious centers ultimately detach from HAE as a unit, carrying high titers of virus. Viral particles within cells may be more protected from environmental conditions, such as ultraviolet radiation and desiccation. We identified two host pathways, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and live cell extrusion, that contribute to infectious center detachment. Perturbing these pathways altered the kinetics of infectious centers detachment. These pathways influence one another and contribute to epithelial wound healing, suggesting infectious center detachment may be a usurped consequence of the host’s response to infection that benefits MeV by increasing its transmissibility between hosts.">

        <tr id="Introduction Exosomes produced by the protozoan parasite Leishmania (LeishEXO) are well-established drivers of virulence, though mechanisms underlying their exacerbation of experimental leishmaniasis remain elusive. Expression of Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a protein implicated in exosome-mediated pathologies and viral internalization, has been shown to correlate with cutaneous leishmaniasis severity. Given ANXA1’s regulation of myeloid cells – the canonical hosts for Leishmania – we studied the potential role of ANXA1 and its receptors FPR1/2 in exerting LeishEXO’s effects. Methods Murine and in vitro ANXA1-/- models were used to study the generation of protective TH1 responses during experimental L. major infection with and without LeishEXO. Recruitment of inflammatory cells was assessed using a peritoneal cell recruitment assay and immunophenotyping, and production of inflammatory mediators was measured using a cytokine and chemokine array. Treatment of experimental models with FPR2 antagonist WRW4 and FPR1/2 agonist WKYMVm was used to delineate the role of the FPR/ANXA1 axis in LeishEXO-mediated hyperpathogenesis. Results We established that ANXA1 deficiency prohibits LeishEXO-mediated pathogenesis and myeloid cell infection, with minimal alterations to adaptive and innate immune phenotypes. FPR2 blockade with WRW4 similarly inhibited leishmanial hyperpathogenesis, while direct activation of FPRs with WKYMVm enhanced infection and recapitulated the LeishEXO-mediated phenotype. This research describes LeishEXO’s utilization of the ANXA1/FPR axis to facilitate parasitic internalization and pathogenesis, which may be leveraged in the development of therapeutics for leishmaniasis.">

Trm cells are also capable of mediating autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, wherein autoreactive Trm cells are aberrantly activated. To quickly combat infections, activated Trm cells can stimulate the influx and activation of memory T cells and innate immune cells. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the inflammatory responses that Trm cell populations can induce, specifically in the activation of the innate profile. Most studies to date have utilized a reductionist approach to examine single Trm populations, specific pathogens, and defined tissues. Herein, we adopted a more holistic approach utilizing barrier-free ‘dirty’ mice to profile activated innate cells attracted to the skin in the presence of quiescent cutaneous Trm cells. Notably, dirty mice are a more human predictive model due to having a diverse microbial experience that leads to the development of a complete complement of Trm cells in the skin. We demonstrate that in the dirty mouse model mice have a significant reduction in cutaneous neutrophils and monocytes compared to SPF mice following local treatment with two separate innate stimuli. These findings reveal that cutaneous Trm cells have the capacity to temper the innate immune response and further substantiate the implication that Trm cells are heterogenous in their functions depending in large part on their tissue residency. However, in an autoimmune microenvironment Trm cells are capable of recruiting innate cells to the site of an exposure to a damage-associated molecular pattern. Likely due to the imbalance of IL-17 and IFN-γ.">

Furthermore, CAR T cells have not been curative against solid cancers and several hematological malignancies such as T cell lymphomas, which have very poor prognoses. One of the main barriers to the clinical success of adoptive T cell immunotherapies is CAR T cell dysfunction and lack of expansion and/or persistence after infusion. In this study, we found that CD5 inhibits CAR T cell activation and that knockout (KO) of CD5 using CRISPR-Cas9 enhances the antitumor effect of CAR T cells in multiple hematological and solid cancer models. Mechanistically, CD5 KO drives increased T cell effector function with enhanced cytotoxicity, in vivo expansion, and persistence, without apparent toxicity in preclinical models. These findings indicate that CD5 is a critical inhibitor of T cell function and a potential clinical target for enhancing T cell therapies. Deleting CD5 with CRISPR-Cas9 enhances T cell activation and proliferation, boosting their antitumor effects in multiple tumor models. Editor’s summary The currently available chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have had limited efficacy for a wide range of solid cancers and hematological malignancies, due in part to CAR T cell dysfunction. The scavenger receptor CD5 associates with the T cell receptor (TCR) and inhibits T cell function. Patel et al. show that genetic deletion of CD5 in CAR and TCR T cells enhances expansion, persistence, and cytotoxicity and is effective in preclinical solid tumor and hematological malignancy models. These results suggest that CD5 may be a critical negative regulator of CAR T cells that can be therapeutically targeted. —Christiana Fogg">

While the evolution of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to avoid humoral immunity is well characterized, relatively little is known about the evolution of innate immune antagonism phenotypes in these viruses. Numerous studies have established that only a small subset of infected cells is responsible for initiating the type I and type III interferon (IFN) response during IAV infection, emphasizing the importance of single cell studies to accurately characterize the IFN response during infection. We developed a flow cytometry-based method to examine transcriptional changes in IFN and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression at the single cell level. We observed that NS segments derived from seasonal H3N2 viruses are more efficient at antagonizing IFN signaling but less effective at suppressing IFN induction, compared to the pdm2009 H1N1 lineage. We compared a collection of NS segments spanning the natural history of the current seasonal IAV lineages and demonstrate long periods of stability in IFN antagonism potential, punctuated by occasional phenotypic shifts. Altogether, our data reveal significant differences in how seasonal and pandemic H1N1 and H3N2 viruses antagonize the human IFN response at the single cell level.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immune checkpoint (IC) blockade and adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T-cells (ACT) are two major strategies to treat metastatic melanoma. Their combination can potentiate T-cell activation in the suppressive tumor microenvironment, but the autoimmune adverse effects associated with systemic injection of IC blockers persist with this strategy. ACT of tumor-reactive T-cells defective for IC expression would overcome this issue. For this purpose, PD-1 and TIGIT appear to be relevant candidates, because their co-expression on highly tumor-reactive lymphocytes limits their therapeutic efficacy within the tumor microenvironme,nt. Our study compares the consequences of PDCD1 or TIGIT genetic deletion on anti-tumor properties and T-cell fitness of melanoma-specific T lymphocytes. Transcriptomic analyses revealed down-regulation of cell cycle-related genes in PD-1KO T-cells, consistent with biological observations, whereas proliferative pathways were preserved in TIGITKO T-cells. Functional analyses showed that PD-1KO and TIGITKO T-cells displayed superior antitumor reactivity than their wild-type counterpart in vitro and in a preclinical melanoma model using immunodeficient mice. Interestingly, it appears that TIGITKO T-cells were more effective at inhibiting tumor cell proliferation in vivo, and persist longer within tumors than PD-1KO T-cells, consistent with the absence of impact of TIGIT deletion on T-cell fitness. Taken together, these results suggest that TIGIT deletion, over PD-1 deletion, in melanoma-specific T-cells is a compelling option for future immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Children living with HIV have a higher risk of developing tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Gamma delta (γδ) T cells in the context of HIV/Mtb coinfection have been understudied in children, despite in vitro evidence suggesting γδ T cells assist with Mtb control. We investigated whether boosting a specific subset of γδ T cells, phosphoantigen-reactive Vγ9+Vδ2+ cells, could improve TB outcome using a nonhuman primate model of pediatric HIV/Mtb coinfection. Juvenile Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), equivalent to 4–8-year-old children, were infected intravenously (i.v.) with SIV. After 6 months, MCM were coinfected with a low dose of Mtb and then randomized to receive zoledronate (ZOL), a drug that increases phosphoantigen levels, (n=5; i.v.) at 3- and 17-days after Mtb accompanied by recombinant human IL-2 (s.c.) for 5 days following each ZOL injection. A similarly coinfected MCM group (n=5) was injected with saline as a control. Vγ9+Vδ2+ γδ T cell frequencies spiked in the blood, but not airways, of ZOL+IL-2-treated MCM following the first dose, however, were refractory to the second dose. At necropsy eight weeks after Mtb, ZOL+IL-2 treatment did not reduce pathology or bacterial burden. γδ T cell subset frequencies in granulomas did not differ between treatment groups. These data show that transiently boosting peripheral γδ T cells with ZOL+IL-2 soon after Mtb coinfection of SIV-infected MCM did not improve Mtb host defense.">

        <tr id="Hypomethylating agents are used as frontline therapy for myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS), but clinical response is unpredictable. To determine whether response was associated with in vivo dynamics of DNA hypomethylation, we conducted a phase 2 trial for MDS using both injection and oral azacitidine (AZA). We established that global DNA methylation levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells were comparable in AZA responders and non-responders during their course of treatment. However, there were distinct baseline and early drug induced differences in CpG methylation in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in responders compared to non-responders that overlapped with regulatory regions of genes associated with tissue patterning, cell migration and myeloid differentiation. Following six cycles of therapy when clinical response typically manifests, differential hypomethylation in responder HSPCs pointed to marrow adaptation as a driver of enhanced haematopoiesis. Taken together, CpG methylation differences in HSPCs may explain variable response to AZA.">

The use of antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and organ support therapy has limited prognostic benefit in patients with sepsis, and its incidence is not diminishing, which is attracting increased attention in medicine. Sepsis remains one of the most debilitating and expensive illnesses. One of the main reasons of septic mortality is now understood to be disruption of immune homeostasis. Immunotherapy is revolutionizing the treatment of illnesses in which dysregulated immune responses play a significant role. This “trained immunity”, which is a potent defense against infection regardless of the type of bacteria, fungus, or virus, is attributed to the discovery that the innate immune cells possess immune memory via metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming. Here we reviewed the immunotherapy of innate immune cells in sepsis, the features of trained immunity, and the relationship between trained immunity and sepsis.">

Further phenotypical analysis confirmed the granulocytic-like features of this monocyte subpopulation that is associated with an increase in granulocyte–monocyte precursors (GMPs) in the PB of these patients (pts). Mechanistically, this granulocyte-like monocyte population suppressed NK cell activity by inducing TIGIT and engaging NKp30. Accordingly, an increased frequency of TIGIT+ NK cells with impaired functions was found in both the PB and tumoral tissue of CRC pts. Collectively, we provided new mechanistic explanations for tumor immune escape occurring in CRC by showing the increase in this new kind of MDSC, in both PB and CRC tissue, which is able to significantly impair the effector functions of NK cells, thereby representing a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains an international health problem caused by the recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of May 2024, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 775 million cases and over 7 million deaths globally. Despite current vaccination programs, infections are still rapidly increasing, mainly due to the appearance and spread of new variants, variations in immunization rates, and limitations of current vaccines in preventing transmission. This underscores the need for pan-variant antivirals and treatments. The interferon (IFN) system is a critical element of the innate immune response and serves as a frontline defense against viruses. It induces a generalized antiviral state by transiently upregulating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). To gain a deeper comprehension of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, its connection to COVID-19 pathogenesis, and the potential therapeutic implications, this review provides a detailed overview of fundamental aspects of the diverse ISGs identified for their antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. It emphasizes the importance of these proteins in controlling viral replication and spread. Furthermore, we explore methodological approaches for the identification of ISGs and conduct a comparative analysis with other viruses. Deciphering the roles of ISGs and their interactions with viral pathogens can help identify novel targets for antiviral therapies and enhance our preparedness to confront current and future viral threats.">

L-phenylalanine also restrains memory CD4+T proliferation in an IL4I1-dependent manner and inhibits Th2 cell proliferation and differentiation. RNA-sequencing, metabolomics, flow cytometry and proteomics, validated in vitro and across patients’ cohorts, revealed an impairment in LAT1-dependent transport of L-phenylalanine into Th2 cells in allergy with an increase in its intracellular processing, accompanied by an expansion of pathogenic Th2 cells. Thus, our study identifies L-phenylalanine as a checkpoint in the development, energy metabolism and function of Th2 cells.">

To simulate lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in senescent human patients, 80‐week‐old male hamsters are intranasally inoculated with different doses of SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.5 variant. Exposure to a low dose of the Omicron BA.5 variant results in early activation of the innate immune response, followed by rapid viral clearance and minimal lung damage. However, a high dose of BA.5 results in impaired interferon signaling, cytokine storm, uncontrolled viral replication, and severe lung injury. To decrease viral load and reverse the deterioration of COVID‐19, a new bio‐mimic decoy called CoVR‐MV is used as a preventive or therapeutic agent. Administration of CoVR‐MV as a preventive or therapeutic intervention in the early stages of infection can effectively suppress viral load, regulate the immune response, and rescue animals from death and critical illness. These findings underscore the risk associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.5 exposure in senescent hamsters and highlight the importance of early intervention to prevent disease progression.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer of stem cells originating in the bone marrow. Increasing evidence suggests that AML survival and relapse are controlled by genetic alterations, as well as a functional interaction between the tumor and the immune system. In this review, we will discuss the biology of immune evasion in AML and explore the current landscape of immune-based therapies. We argue that a better understanding of the immune microenvironment in AML could help predict responses to immunotherapy and guide decisions for future treatment. Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex hematopoietic clonal disorder with limited curative options beyond stem cell transplantation. The success of transplant is intimately linked with the graft versus leukemia effect from the alloreactive donor immune cells including, T and NK cells. The immune system plays a dynamic role in leukemia survival and resistance. Despite our growing understanding of the immune microenvironment, responses to immune-based therapies differ greatly between patients. Herein, we review the biology of immune evasion mechanisms in AML, discuss the current landscape of immunotherapeutic strategies, and discuss the implications of therapeutic targets. This review focuses on T and NK cell-based therapy, including modified and non-modified NK cells, CAR-T and CAR-NK cells, antibodies, and checkpoint blockades. Understanding the complex interchange between immune tolerance and the emergence of tumor resistance will improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects a wide range of cell types in the body, including a variety of epithelial cell types. Despite the significance of epithelial cells during infection, HCMV has been difficult to study in epithelial cells. In this study, we examined HCMV infection in mammary and prostate epithelial cell lines, finding that the virus establishes a semi-permissive, biosynthetically abortive state. Building on previous work, we hypothesized that shifting epithelial cells to a mesenchymal cell state would restore HCMV biosynthesis and progeny production. To test this hypothesis, we induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using TGF-β and the EMT-transcription factor (EMT-TF) SNAIL. We found that shifting strongly epithelial cell lines to a mesenchymal cell state shifted HCMV infection from a semi-permissive to fully permissive state. This effect appeared to involve two distinct mechanisms: EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral entry and EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral mRNA translation. Although the precise mechanisms remain elusive, our findings identify the epithelial-mesenchymal cell state axis as an important regulator of HCMV infection and provide new insights into how cellular differentiation states influence viral replication. They also raise the possibility that the EMT pathway, a fundamental pathway involved in development and cancer metastasis, could regulate HCMV infection in-vivo, potentially contributing to viral persistence or pathogenesis in epithelial tissues.">

        <tr id="Nearly six million people worldwide have died from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although COVID-19 vaccines are largely successful in reducing the severity of the disease and deaths, the decline in vaccine-induced immunity over time and the continuing emergence of new viral variants or mutations underscore the need for an alternative strategy for developing broad-spectrum host-mediated therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. A key feature of severe COVID-19 is dysregulated innate immune signaling, culminating in a high expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and a lack of antiviral interferons (IFNs), particularly type I (alpha and beta) and type III (lambda). As a natural host defense, the myeloid differentiation primary response protein, MyD88, plays pivotal roles in innate and acquired immune responses via the signal transduction pathways of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a type of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). However, recent studies have highlighted that infection with viruses upregulates MyD88 expression and impairs the host antiviral response by negatively regulating type I IFN. Galectin-3 (Gal3), another key player in viral infections, has been shown to modulate the host immune response by regulating viral entry and activating TLRs, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and NF-κB, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributing to the overall inflammatory response, the so-called “cytokine storm”. These studies suggest that the specific inhibition of MyD88 and Gal3 could be a promising therapy for COVID-19. This review presents future directions for MyD88- and Gal3-targeted antiviral drug discovery, highlighting the potential to restore host immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="Cell plasticity (CP), describing a dynamic cell state, plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis during organ morphogenesis, regeneration and damage-to-repair biological process. Single-cell-omics datasets provide unprecedented resource to empowers analysis on CP. Hematopoiesis offers fertile opportunities to develop quantitative methods for understanding CP with rich supports from experimental ground-truths. In this study we generated high-quality lineage-negative (Lin−) single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets under various conditions and introduced a working pipeline named Snapdragon to interrogate naïve and disturbed plasticity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with mutational or environmental challenges. Utilizing embedding methods UMAP or FA, a continuum of hematopoietic development is visually observed in wildtype where the pipeline confirms a very low Proportion of hybrid-cells (Phc, with bias range: 0.4-0.6) on a transition trajectory. Upon Tet2 mutation, a driver of leukemia, or treatment of DSS, an inducer of colitis, Phc is increased and plasticity of HSPCs was enhanced. Quantitative analysis indicates that Tet2 mutation enhances HSC self-renewal capability while DSS treatment results in an enhanced myeloid-skewing trajectory, suggesting their similar but different consequences. We prioritized several transcription factors (i.e the EGR family) and signaling pathways (i.e. receptors IL1R1 and ADRB, inflammation and sympathy-sensing respectively) which are responsible for Phc alterations. CellOracle-based simulation suggests that knocking-out EGR regulons or pathways of IL1R1 and ADRB partially reverses Phc promoted by Tet2 mutation and inflammation. In conclusion, the study provides high-quality datasets with single-cell transcriptomic matrices for diversified hematopoietic simulations and a computational pipeline Snapdragon for quantifying disturbed Phc and CP. (247 words) Highlights To guide CP analysis, we introduce a quantizable parameter Phc and a pipeline Snapdragon, which discriminate naive and disturbed hematopoiesis; The Snapdragon pipeline analysis on Tet2+/-Lin− cells demonstrates many novel insights, including enhanced HSC plasticity and increased PHC; similar trends are observed in inflammatory Lin− cells; Regulon analysis suggests that transcriptional factor EGR1 is significantly activated to elevated the HSC plasticity and change hematopoietic trajectory; Stress-response-related signaling pathways mediated by receptors IL1R1 or ADRB were obviously activated in the challenged hematopoiesis; CellOracle-based simulation suggests that knocking-out EGR regulons or pathways of IL1R1 and ADRB partially reverses Phc promoted by Tet2 mutation and inflammation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Liver metastases (LM) remain a major cause of cancer-related death and are a major clinical challenge. LM and the female sex are predictors of a poorer response to immunotherapy but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported on a sexual dimorphism in the control of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of colorectal carcinoma liver metastases (CRCLM) and identified estrogen as a regulator of an immunosuppressive TME in the liver. Here we aimed to assess the effect of estrogen deprivation on the cytokine/chemokine profile associated with CRCLM, using a multiplex cytokine array and the RNAscope technology, and its effects on the innate and adaptive immune responses in the liver. We also evaluated the benefit of combining the selective estrogen-receptor degrader Fulvestrant with immune checkpoint blockade for the treatment of CRCLM. We show that estrogen depletion altered the cytokine/chemokine repertoire of the liver, decreased macrophage polarization, as reflected in reduced accumulation of tumor infiltrating M2 macrophages and increased the accumulation of CCL5+/CCR5+ CD8+ T and NKT cells in the liver TME. Similar results were obtained in a murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model. Importantly, treatment with Fulvestrant also increased the accumulation of CD8+CCL5+, CD8+CCR5+ T and NK cells in the liver TME and enhanced the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD1 immunotherapy, resulting in a significant reduction in the outgrowth of LM. Taken together, our results show that estrogen regulates immune cell recruitment to the liver and suggest that inhibition of estrogen action could potentiate the tumor-inhibitory effect of immunotherapy in hormone-independent and immunotherapy-resistant metastatic cancer. Significance: The immune microenvironment of the liver plays a major role in controlling the expansion of hepatic metastases and is regulated by estrogen. We show that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with an estrogen receptor degrader potentiated an anti-metastatic effect of immunotherapy. Our results provide mechanistic insight into clinical findings and a rationale for evaluating the efficacy of combination anti-estrogen and immunotherapy for prevention and/or treatment of hepatic metastases in female patients.">

        <tr id="Background Gamma-delta (γδ) T cells are a major immune cell subset in pigs. Approximately 50% of circulating T cells are γδ T cells in young pigs and up to 30% in adult sows. Despite this abundance, the functions of porcine γδ T cells are mostly unidentified. In humans and mice, activated γδ T cells exhibit broad innate cytotoxic activity against a wide variety of stressed, infected, and cancerous cells through death receptor/ligand-dependent and perforin/granzyme-dependent pathways. However, so far, it is unknown whether porcine γδ T cells have the ability to perform cytotoxic functions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of porcine γδ T cells isolated from blood, lung, and nasal mucosa. To further analyze the cytolytic potential of γδ T cells, in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed using purified γδ T cells as effector cells and virus-exposed or mock-treated primary porcine alveolar macrophages as target cells. Results Our results show that only CD2+ γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers (CD16, NKp46, perforin) with higher perforin and NKp46 expression in γδ T cells isolated from lung and nasal mucosa. Moreover, we found that γδ T cells can exhibit cytotoxic functions in a cell-cell contact and degranulation-dependent manner. However, porcine γδ T cells did not seem to specifically target Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus or swine Influenza A Virus-infected macrophages, which may be due to viral escape mechanisms. Conclusion Porcine γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers and can exhibit cytotoxic activity in vitro. The specific mechanisms by which porcine γδ T cells recognize target cells are not fully understood but may involve the detection of cellular stress signals.">

        <tr id="Stem-like CD8+ T cells (TSL) are a subset of immune cells with superior persistence and antitumor immunity. They are TCF1+ PD-1+ and important for the expansion of tumor specific CD8+ T cells in response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. In acute infections, naïve CD8+ T cells differentiate into effector and memory CD8+ T cells; in cancer and chronic infections, persistent antigen stimulation can lead to T cell exhaustion. Recent studies have highlighted the dichotomy between late dysfunctional (or exhausted) T cells (TLD) that are TCF1– PD-1+ and self-renewing TCF1+ PD-1+ TSL from which they derive. TCF1+ TSL cells are considered to have stem cell-like properties akin to memory T cell populations and can give rise to cytotoxic effector and transitory T cell phenotypes (TTE) which mediate tumor control. In this review, we will discuss recent advances made in research on the formation and expansion of TSL, as well as distinct niches required for their differentiation and maintenance in the setting of cancer. We will also discuss potential strategies to generate these cells, with clinical implications for stemness enhancement in vaccine design, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and adoptive T cell therapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process that gets skewed toward myelopoiesis. This restrains lymphopoiesis, but the role of lymphocytes in this process is not well defined. To unravel the intricacies of neutrophil responses in COVID-19, we performed bulk RNAseq on neutrophils from healthy controls and COVID-19 patients. Principal component analysis revealed distinguishing neutrophil gene expression alterations in COVID-19 patients. ICU and ward patients displayed substantial transcriptional changes, with ICU patients exhibiting a more pronounced response. Intriguingly, neutrophils from COVID-19 patients, notably ICU patients, exhibited an enrichment of immunoglobulin (Ig) and B cell lineage-associated genes, suggesting potential lineage plasticity. We validated our RNAseq findings in a larger cohort. Moreover, by reanalyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data on human bone marrow (BM) granulocytes, we identified the cluster of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP) enriched with Ig and B cell lineage-associated genes. These cells with lineage plasticity may serve as a resource depending on the host’s needs during severe systemic infection. This distinct B cell subset may play a pivotal role in promoting myelopoiesis in response to infection. The scRNAseq analysis of BM neutrophils in infected mice further supported our observations in humans. Finally, our studies using an animal model of acute infection implicate IL-7/GM-CSF in influencing neutrophil and B cell dynamics. Elevated GM-CSF and reduced IL-7 receptor expression in COVID-19 patients imply altered hematopoiesis favoring myeloid cells over B cells. Our findings provide novel insights into the relationship between the B-neutrophil lineages during severe infection, hinting at potential implications for disease pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE This study investigates the dynamics of hematopoiesis in COVID-19, focusing on neutrophil responses. Through RNA sequencing of neutrophils from healthy controls and COVID-19 patients, distinct gene expression alterations are identified, particularly in ICU patients. Notably, neutrophils from COVID-19 patients, especially in the ICU, exhibit enrichment of immunoglobulin and B cell lineage-associated genes, suggesting potential lineage plasticity. Validation in a larger patient cohort and single-cell analysis of bone marrow granulocytes support the presence of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors with B cell lineage-associated genes. The findings propose a link between B-neutrophil lineages during severe infection, implicating a potential role for these cells in altered hematopoiesis favoring myeloid cells over B cells. Elevated GM-CSF and reduced IL-7 receptor expression in stress hematopoiesis suggest cytokine involvement in these dynamics, providing novel insights into disease pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="CD36 expression in both immune and non-immune cells is known to be directly involved in cancer metastasis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by malignant melanocytes play a vital role in developing tumor-promoting microenvironments, but it is unclear whether this is mediated through CD36. To understand the role of CD36 in melanoma, we first analyzed the SKCM dataset for clinical prognosis, evaluated the percentage of CD36 in lymphatic fluid-derived EVs (LEVs), and tested whether melanoma-derived EVs increase CD36 expression and induce M2-macrophage-like characteristics. Furthermore, we performed a multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF) imaging analysis to evaluate the CD36 expression and its colocalization with various other cells in the lymph node (LN) of patients and control subjects. Our findings show that cutaneous melanoma patients have a worse clinical prognosis with high CD36 levels, and a higher percentage of CD36 in total LEVs were found at baseline in melanoma patients compared to control. We also found that monocytic and endothelial cells treated with melanoma EVs expressed more CD36 than untreated cells. Furthermore, melanoma-derived EVs can regulate immunosuppressive macrophage-like characteristics by upregulating CD36. The spatial imaging data show that cells in tumor-involved sentinel LNs exhibit a higher probability of CD36 expression than cells from control LNs, but this was not statistically significant. Conclusively, our findings demonstrated that CD36 plays a vital role in controlling the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the LN, which can promote the formation of a protumorigenic niche.">

Unraveling the mechanisms underlying treatment response for targeted therapeutics in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients is challenging due to the limited understanding of diverse responses of circulating immune cells, particularly B cells. We investigated B lymphocyte dynamics during anti-BAFF treatment, utilizing longitudinal single-cell transcriptome data.


METHODS
We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on PBMCs in four Korean SLE patients before and after belimumab treatment at the following time points: 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.


RESULTS
Analyzing over 73 000 PBMCs, we identified 8 distinct subsets of B cells and plasmablasts and analyzed dynamic changes within these cell subsets: initial declines in naive and transitional B cells followed by an increase at three months, contrasted by an initial increase and subsequent decrease in memory B cells by the third month. Meanwhile, plasmablasts exhibited a consistent decline throughout treatment. B cell activation pathways, specifically in naive and memory B cells, were downregulated during the third and sixth months. These findings were validated at the protein level throughout the first four weeks of treatment using flow cytometry. Comparative analysis with bulk transcriptome data from 22 Japanese SLE patients showed increased NR4A1 expression six months post-belimumab treatment, indicating its role in restricting self-reactive B cells, thereby contributing to the biological responses of anti-BAFF treatment.


CONCLUSION
The observed B cell dynamics provided insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of anti-BAFF in SLE patients. Furthermore, it underscores the need for research in predicting drug responses based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="Introduction Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important tropical and neglected disease and represents a serious global health problem. The initial interaction between the phagocytes and the parasite is crucial to determine the pathogen’s capacity to initiate infection and it shapes the subsequent immune response that will develop. While type-1 T-cells induce IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-12 production by monocytes/macrophages to fight the infection, type-2 T-cells are associated with a regulatory phenotype (IL-10 and TGF-β) and successful infection establishment. Recently, our group demonstrated the role of an important Th1/Th17 T-cell population, the mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, in VL. MAIT cells can respond to L. infantum by producing TNF-α and IFN-γ upon MR1-dependent activation. Objective and methods Here, we describe the impact of the MR1-blockage on L. infantum internalization on the functional profile of circulating neutrophils and monocytes as well as the impact of the MR1-blockage on the soluble mediator signatures of in vitro whole blood cultures. Results Overall, our data showed that VL patients presents higher percentage of activated neutrophils than asymptomatic and non-infected controls. In addition, MR1 blockade led to lower TNF-α and TGF-β production by non-activated neutrophils from asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, TNF-α and IL-10 production by monocytes was higher in VL patients. In the analysis of soluble mediators produced in vitro, MR1-blockade induced a decrease of IFN-γ and an increase of IL-10, IL-27 and IL-33 in the cell cultures of AS group, a cytokine pattern associated with type 2 deleterious response. Discussion and conclusion These data corroborate the hypothesis that MR1-restricted responses are associated to a protective role during Leishmania infection.">

Substantial evidence has shown a relationship between immune phenotype lymphocytes and COVID-19 disease severity and/or implication in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, belonging to ABO blood groups has been investigated as a correlation factor to COVID-19 disease. This pilot study investigated lymphocyte typing in a cohort of blood donors to understand the underlying mechanism in SARS-CoV-2 infection linked to the blood group. The study cohort consisted of 20–64-year-old subjects, without comorbidities, from both sexes, who were COVID-19 vaccinated with previous or no infection history. Whole blood samples, collected at A.O.R.N. Sant’Anna and San Sebastiano Hospital (Campania Region), were processed by multiparametric cytofluorimetric assay, to characterize CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell CD3+ subpopulations. The CD45RA, CCR7, CD27, CD28, CD57 and PD-1 markers were investigated to delineate the peripheral T-cell maturation stages. Differences were detected in ABO blood types in CD3+, CD4+ gated on CD3+, CD8+ and CD8+ gated on CD3+ percentage. These results contribute to identifying a memory cell “identikit” profile in COVID-19 disease, thus leading to a useful tool in precision medicine.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, mount an immune response upon exposure to antigens and pathogens. Emerging evidence shows that macrophages exposed to an antigen can generate a “memory-like” response (a.k.a. trained immunity), which confers a non-specific and enhanced response upon subsequent stimulation with a second antigen/microbe. This trained immunity has been implicated in the enhanced response of macrophages against several invading pathogens. However, the association between the nature of the antigen and the corresponding immune correlate of elicited trained immunity is not fully understood. Similarly, the response of macrophages trained and restimulated with homologous stimulants to subsequent infection by pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains unexplored. Here, we report the immune and metabolic profiles of trained immunity in human THP-1-derived macrophages after homologous training and restimulation with BCG, LPS, purified protein Derivative (PPD), heat-killed Mtb strains HN878 (hk-HN), and CDC1551 (hk-CDC). Furthermore, the impact of training on the autophagic and antimicrobial responses of macrophages with or without subsequent infection by clinical Mtb isolates HN878 and CDC1551 was evaluated. Results show that repeated stimulation of macrophages with different antigens displays distinct pro-inflammatory, metabolic, antimicrobial, and autophagy induction profiles. These macrophages also induce a differential antimicrobial response upon infection with clinical Mtb HN878 and CDC1551 isolates. A significantly reduced intracellular bacterial load was noted in the stimulated macrophages, which was augmented by the addition of rapamycin, an autophagy inducer. These observations suggest that the nature of the antigen and the mode of stimulation shape the magnitude and breadth of macrophage innate memory response, which impacts subsequent response to Mtb infection. IMPORTANCE Trained immunity (a.k.a. innate memory response) is a novel concept that has been rapidly emerging as a mechanism underpinning the non-specific immunity of innate immune cells, such as macrophages. However, the association between the nature of the stimuli and the corresponding immune correlate of trained immunity is not fully understood. Similarly, the kinetics of immunological and metabolic characteristics of macrophages upon “training” by the same antigen as primary and secondary stimuli (homologous stimulation) are not fully characterized. Furthermore, the ability of antigens such as purified protein derivative (PPD) and heat-killed-Mtb to induce trained immunity remains unknown. Similarly, the response of macrophages primed and trained by homologous stimulants to subsequent infection by pathogenic Mtb is yet to be reported. In this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that the nature of the stimuli impacts the depth and breadth of trained immunity in macrophages, which differentially affects their response to Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Coinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a significant public health concern. Individuals infected with Mtb who acquire HIV are approximately 16 times more likely to develop active tuberculosis. T cells play an important role as both targets for HIV infection and mediators of the immune response against both pathogens. This review aims to synthesize the current literature and provide insights into the effects of HIV/Mtb coinfection on T cell populations and their contributions to immunity. Evidence from multiple in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that T helper responses are severely compromised during coinfection, leading to impaired cytotoxic responses. Moreover, HIV’s targeting of Mtb-specific cells, including those within granulomas, offers an explanation for the severe progression of the disease. Herein, we discuss the patterns of differentiation, exhaustion, and transcriptomic changes in T cells during coinfection, as well as the metabolic adaptations that are necessary for T cell maintenance and functionality. This review highlights the interconnectedness of the immune response and the pathogenesis of HIV/Mtb coinfection.">

        <tr id="Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the severity of COVID-19, since the respiratory, thrombotic and myocardial complications of the disease are closely linked to vascular endothelial damage. To address this issue, we evaluate here the effect of conditioned media from spike S1-activated macrophages (CM_S1) on the proliferation of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), focusing on the specific role of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Results obtained demonstrate that the incubation with CM_S1 for 72 h hinders endothelial cell proliferation and induces signs of cytotoxicity. Comparable results are obtained upon exposure to IFN-γ + TNF-α, which are thus postulated to play a pivotal role in the effects observed. These events are associated with an increase in p21 protein and a decrease in Rb phosphorylation, as well as with the activation of IRF-1 and NF-kB transcription factors. Overall, these findings further sustain the pivotal role of a hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines as a trigger for endothelial activation and injury in the immune-mediated effects of COVID-19.">

Growing evidence demonstrates the crucial role of innate immunity in tumor initiation and progression. Several studies support the idea that innate immunity, through the release of pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines and tumor growth factors, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM). Cutaneous melanoma is the most common skin cancer, with an incidence that rapidly increased in recent decades. Melanoma is a highly immunogenic tumor, due to its high mutational burden. The metastatic form retains a high mortality. The advent of immunotherapy revolutionized the therapeutic approach to this tumor and significantly ameliorated the patients’ clinical outcome. In this review, we will recapitulate the multiple roles of innate immune cells in melanoma and the related implications for immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Influenza infections result in a significant number of severe illnesses annually, many of which are complicated by secondary bacterial super-infection. Primary influenza infection has been shown to increase susceptibility to secondary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection by altering the host immune response, leading to significant immunopathology. Type III interferons (IFNs), or IFNλs, have gained traction as potential antiviral therapeutics due to their restriction of viral replication without damaging inflammation. The role of IFNλ in regulating epithelial biology in super-infection has recently been established; however, the impact of IFNλ on immune cells is less defined. In this study, we infected wild-type and IFNLR1-/- mice with influenza A/PR/8/34 followed by S. aureus USA300. We demonstrated that global IFNLR1-/- mice have enhanced bacterial clearance through increased uptake by phagocytes, which was shown to be cell-intrinsic specifically in myeloid cells in mixed bone marrow chimeras. We also showed that depletion of IFNLR1 on CX3CR1 expressing myeloid immune cells, but not neutrophils, was sufficient to significantly reduce bacterial burden compared to mice with intact IFNLR1. These findings provide insight into how IFNλ in an influenza-infected lung impedes bacterial clearance during super-infection and show a direct cell intrinsic role for IFNλ signaling on myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract Type I interferons (IFN) are immune-stimulatory cytokines involved in antiviral and antitumor immune responses. They enhance the efficacy of immunogenic anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy by activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Macrophages are one of the most abundant innate immune cells in the immune microenvironment of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) and can exert potent immune-suppressive functions. Here, we investigate the potential of tumoral type I IFNs to repolarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in two murine MBM models and assess the effects of radiotherapy-induced type I IFN on TAMs in a transcriptomic MBM patient dataset. In mice, we describe a proinflammatory M1-like TAM phenotype induced by tumoral IFNβ and identify a myeloid type I IFN-response signature associated with a high M1/M2-like TAM ratio. Following irradiation, patients with MBM displaying a myeloid type I IFN-response signature showed increased overall survival, providing evidence that tumoral IFNβ supports an effective antitumor immune response by re-educating immune-regulatory TAM. These findings uncover type I IFN–inducing therapies as a potential macrophage-targeting therapeutic approach and provide a rationale for combining radiotherapy with concomitant immunotherapy to improve treatment response in patients with MBM. Significance: Our study shows that re-education of tumor-associated macrophages by tumoral IFNβ translates into improved clinical outcome in patients with melanoma brain metastases, providing pathomechanistic insights into synergistic type I interferon–inducing therapies with immunotherapies and warranting investigation of IFNβ as a predictive biomarker for combined radioimmunotherapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune cell populations in the intestinal muscularis propria during colitis are poorly resolved. Maintaining homeostasis in this niche is critical, highlighted by the poorer prognosis of inflammatory bowel disease associated with muscularis propria inflammation.


METHODS
This study utilizes single-cell RNA sequencing to survey the immune cell populations within the muscularis propria of normal colon and dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Findings are validated by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and cell-lineage tracing in vivo, and in vitro assays with muscularis macrophages (MMφ).


RESULTS
In naïve conditions, transcriptional duality is observed in MMφs with 2 major subpopulations: conventional resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs and Lyve1+ MMφs. The Lyve1+ population is phagocytic and expresses several known MMφ markers in mouse and human, confirming their identity as a bona fide MMφ subset. Single-cell transcriptomics indicate that resident MMφs are retained during colitis and exhibit plasticity toward an inflammatory profile. Lyve1+ MMφs, which express anti-inflammatory marker CD163, are absent during colitis, as confirmed by flow cytometry. In contrast, lineage tracing finds that resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs remain during colitis and are not completely replaced by the inflammatory infiltrating monocytes. In vitro studies provide biological evidence of the plasticity of resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), mirroring transcriptional observations in vivo of their inflammatory plasticity. Potential markers for colitic MMφs, validated in animal models and in individuals with ulcerative colitis, are identified.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings contribute to the understanding of the immune system in the muscularis propria niche during colitis by resolving the heterogeneity and origins of colitic MMφs.">

        <tr id="Human alveolar type I (AT1) cells are specialized epithelial cells that line the alveoli in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. The primary function of AT1 cells is not only to facilitate efficient gas exchange between the air and the blood in the lungs, but also to contribute to the structural integrity of the alveoli to maintain lung function and homeostasis. Aging has notable effects on the structure, function, and regenerative capacity of human AT1 cells. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving these age-related changes in AT1 cells remains limited. Leveraging a recent single-cell transcriptomics dataset we generated on healthy human lungs, we identified a series of significant molecular alterations in AT1 cells from aged lungs. Notably, the aged AT1 cells exhibited increased cellular senescence and chemokine gene expression, alongside diminished epithelial features such as decreases in cell junctions, endocytosis, and pulmonary matrisome gene expression. Gene set analyses also indicated that aged AT1 cells were resistant to apoptosis, a crucial mechanism for turnover and renewal of AT1 cells, thereby ensuring alveolar integrity and function. Further research on these alterations is imperative to fully elucidate the impact on AT1 cells and is indispensable for developing effective therapies to preserve lung function and promote healthy aging.">

        <tr id="Introduction Most healthy individuals recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas a remarkable number continues to suffer from unexplained symptoms, known as Long COVID or post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). It is therefore imperative that methods for preventing and treating the onset of PASC be investigated with the utmost urgency. Methods A mathematical model of the immune response to vaccination and viral infection with SARS-CoV-2, incorporating immune memory cells, was developed. Results and discussion Similar to our previous model, persistent infection was observed by the residual virus in the host, implying the possibility of chronic inflammation and delayed recovery from tissue injury. Pre-infectious vaccination and antiviral medication administered during onset can reduce the acute viral load; however, they show no beneficial effects in preventing persistent infection. Therefore, the impact of these treatments on the PASC, which has been clinically observed, is mainly attributed to their role in preventing severe tissue damage caused by acute viral infections. For PASC patients with persistent infection, vaccination was observed to cause an immediate rapid increase in viral load, followed by a temporary decrease over approximately one year. The former was effectively suppressed by the coadministration of antiviral medications, indicating that this combination is a promising treatment for PASC.">

This review examines current knowledge on viral-host interactions and immune responses in HIV-infected infants, focusing on immune development, viral dynamics, and therapeutic implications. The immune system of infants undergoes rapid maturation during early life, influencing their susceptibility to HIV infection and responses to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Key aspects include thymic function, cytokine profiles, and the establishment of immune memory, which collectively shape immune responses against HIV. Viral dynamics in HIV-infected infants differ markedly from those in adults, characterized by high viral loads, diverse viral subtypes, and the early establishment of viral reservoirs within immune cells. These reservoirs, particularly in sanctuary sites like the central nervous system, pose challenges for achieving viral eradication and long-term remission. Effective management requires strategies to characterize and target these reservoirs, alongside early intervention to mitigate viral replication and preserve immune function. Advances in viral monitoring technologies and treatment regimens are essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing the global burden of pediatric HIV infection.

        <tr id="Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is a rare, yet potentially fatal disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) enterotoxins, known as superantigens, which trigger an intense immune response. Our previous study demonstrated the protective effect of tofacitinib against murine toxin-induced shock and a beneficial effect against S. aureus sepsis. In the current study, we examined the effects of tofacitinib on T-cell response in peripheral blood using a mouse model of enterotoxin-induced shock. Our data revealed that tofacitinib suppresses the activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. Furthermore, both gene and protein levels of Th1 cytokines were downregulated by tofacitinib treatment in mice with enterotoxin-induced shock. Importantly, we demonstrated that CD4+ cells, but not CD8+ cells, are pathogenic in mice with enterotoxin-induced shock. In conclusion, our findings suggest that tofacitinib treatment suppresses CD4+ T-cell activation and Th1 response, thereby aiding in protection against staphylococcal toxic shock in mice. This insight may guide the future development of novel therapies for STSS.">

        <tr id="Type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling has been shown to be upregulated in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Dysregulated B-cell functions, including antigen presentation, as well as antibody and cytokine production, all of which may be affected by IFN-I signaling, play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. We investigated the IFN-I signature in 71 patients with the more severe form of the disease, diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), and 33 healthy controls (HCs). Activation via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can influence the IFN-I signaling cascade; thus, we analyzed the effects of the TLR homologue CD180 ligation on the IFN-I signature in B cells. CD180 stimulation augmented the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) in dcSSc B cells (p = 0.0123). The expression of IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) in non-switched memory B cells producing natural autoantibodies was elevated in dcSSc (p = 0.0109), which was enhanced following anti-CD180 antibody treatment (p = 0.0125). Autoantibodies to IFN-Is (IFN-alpha and omega) correlated (dcSSc p = 0.0003, HC p = 0.0192) and were present at similar levels in B cells from dcSSc and HC, suggesting their regulatory role as natural autoantibodies. It can be concluded that factors other than IFN-alpha may contribute to the elevated IFN-I signature of dcSSc B cells, and one possible candidate is B-cell activation via CD180.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis and AIDS remain two of the most relevant human infectious diseases. The pathogens that cause them, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV, individually elicit an immune response that treads the line between beneficial and detrimental to the host. Co-infection further complexifies this response since the different cytokines acting on one infection might facilitate the dissemination of the other. In these responses, the role of type I interferons is often associated with antiviral mechanisms, while for bacteria such as Mtb, their importance and clinical relevance as a suitable target for manipulation are more controversial. In this article, we review the recent knowledge on how these interferons play distinct roles and sometimes have opposite consequences depending on the stage of the pathogenesis. We highlight the dichotomy between the acute and chronic infections displayed by both infections and how type I interferons contribute to an initial control of each infection individually, while their chronic induction, particularly during HIV infection, might facilitate Mtb primo-infection and progression to disease. We expect that further findings and their systematization will allow the definition of windows of opportunity for interferon manipulation according to the stage of infection, contributing to pathogen clearance and control of immunopathology.">

        <tr id="Epithelial injury calls for a regenerative response from a coordinated network of epithelial stem cells and immune cells. Defining this network is key to preserving the repair process for acute resolution, but also for preventing a remodeling process with chronic dysfunction. We recently identified an immune niche for basal-epithelial stem cells using mouse models of injury after respiratory viral infection. Niche function depended on an early sentinel population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) that provided ligand GPNMB to basal-ESC receptor CD44 for reprogramming towards chronic lung disease. These same cell and molecular control points worked directly in mouse and human basal-ESC organoids, but the findings were not yet validated in vivo in human disease. Further, persistence of GPNMB expression in moDCs and M2-macrophages in mouse models suggested utility as a long-term disease biomarker in humans. Here we show increased expression of GPNMB localized to moDC-macrophage populations in lung tissue samples from long-term Covid, asthma, and COPD. The findings thereby provide initial evidence of a persistent and correctable pathway from acute injury to chronic disease with implications for cellular reprogramming and inflammatory memory.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma IDH-wildtype is highly immune suppressive and is characterized by a strong component of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). To interfere with the immune suppressive functions of MDSCs, a comprehensive understanding on how MDSCs acquire their suppressive phenotype is essential. Previously, we and others have shown a distinct Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptor expression profile for MDSCs in glioblastoma. Siglec receptors can transmit inhibitory signals comparable to PD-1 and are suggested to act as glyco-immune checkpoints. Here, we investigated how glioma specific Siglec-sialic acid interactions influence myeloid immune suppressive functions. Co-culturing monocytes with glioblastoma cells induced CD163 expression on the monocytes. Upon desialylation of the glioblastoma cells, this induction of CD163 was hampered, and furthermore, the monocytes were now able to secrete higher amounts of IL-6 and TNFα compared to fully sialylated glioblastoma cells. Additionally, Siglec-specific triggering using anti-Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 antibodies displayed a decreased TNFα secretion by the monocytes, validating the role of the Siglec–Sialic axis in the co-culture experiments. Together, our results demonstrate that glioblastoma cells induce a myeloid immune-suppressive phenotype that could be partly rescued by lowering the glioblastoma-associated sialic acid levels. This manuscript supports further research of the Siglec–Sialic acid axis in the context of glioblastoma and its potential to improve clinical outcome.">

        <tr id="AbstractThroughout history, the influenza A virus has caused numerous devastating global pandemics. Macrophages, as pivotal innate immune cells, exhibit a wide range of immune functions characterized by distinct polarization states, reflecting their intricate heterogeneity. In this study, we employed the time-resolved single-cell sequencing technique coupled with metabolic RNA labelling to elucidate the dynamic transcriptional changes in distinct polarized states of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) upon infection with the influenza A virus. Our approach not only captures the temporal dimension of transcriptional activity, which is lacking in conventional scRNA-seq methods, but also reveals that M2-polarized Arg1_macrophages is the sole state supporting successful replication of influenza A virus. Furthermore, we identified distinct antigen presentation capabilities to CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells across diverse polarized states of macrophages. Notably, the M1 phenotype, exhibited by both bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and murine alveolar macrophages (AMs), demonstrated superior conventional and cross-presentation abilities for exogenous antigens, with a particular emphasis on cross-presentation capacity. Additionally, as CD8+ T cell differentiation progressed, M1 polarization exhibited an enhanced capacity for cross-presentation. All three phenotypes of BMDMs, including M1, demonstrated robust presentation of CD4+ regulatory T cells, while displaying limited ability to present naive CD4+ T cells. These findings offer novel insights into the immunological regulatory mechanisms governing distinct polarized states of macrophages, particularly their roles in restricting the replication of influenza A virus and modulating antigen-specific T cell responses through innate immunity.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Evidence suggests that COVID-19 predisposes to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). While monocytes/macrophages play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of atherosclerosis, less is known about their immunopathogenic mechanisms that lead to CVDs during COVID-19. Natural killer (NK) cells, which play an intermediary role during pathologies like atherosclerosis, are dysregulated during COVID-19. Here, we sought to investigate altered immune cells and their associations with CVD risk during severe COVID-19.


METHODS
We measured plasma biomarkers of CVDs and determined phenotypes of circulating immune subsets using spectral flow cytometry. We compared these between patients with severe COVID-19 (severe, n=31), those who recovered from severe COVID-19 (recovered, n=29), and SARS-CoV-2-uninfected controls (controls, n=17). In vivo observations were supported using in vitro assays to highlight possible mechanistic links between dysregulated immune subsets and biomarkers during and after COVID-19. We performed multidimensional analyses of published single-cell transcriptome data of monocytes and NK cells during severe COVID-19 to substantiate in vivo findings.


RESULTS
During severe COVID-19, we observed alterations in cardiometabolic biomarkers including oxidized-low-density lipoprotein, which showed decreased levels in severe and recovered groups. Severe patients exhibited dysregulated monocyte subsets, including increased frequencies of proinflammatory intermediate monocytes (also observed in the recovered) and decreased nonclassical monocytes. All identified NK-cell subsets in the severe COVID-19 group displayed increased expression of activation and tissue-resident markers, such as CD69. We observed significant correlations between altered immune subsets and plasma oxidized-low-density lipoprotein levels. In vitro assays revealed increased uptake of oxidized-low-density lipoprotein into monocyte-derived macrophages in the presence of NK cells activated by plasma of patients with severe COVID-19. Transcriptome analyses confirmed enriched proinflammatory responses and lipid dysregulation associated with epigenetic modifications in monocytes and NK cells during severe COVID-19.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides new insights into the involvement of monocytes and NK cells in the increased CVD risk observed during and after COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Human astroviruses (HAstV) are major global causes of gastroenteritis, but little is known about host factors required for their cellular entry. Here, we utilized complementary CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout and activation screening approaches and identified neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP4) as entry factors for HAstV infection of human intestinal epithelial cells. Disruption of FcRn or DPP4 reduced HAstV infection in permissive cells and, reciprocally, overexpression of these factors in non-permissive cells was sufficient to promote infection. We observed direct binding between FcRn and HAstV virions as well as purified spike protein. Finally, inhibitors for DPP4 and FcRn currently in clinical use prevent HAstV infection in cell lines and primary human enteroids. Thus, our results reveal mechanisms of HAstV entry as well as druggable targets.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, characterized by limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Its aggressiveness is attributed not only to the uncontrolled proliferation and invasion of tumor cells but also to the complex interplay between these cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Within the tumor microenvironment, an intricate network of immune cells, stromal cells, and various signaling molecules creates a pro-inflammatory milieu that supports tumor growth and progression. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acid for brain function, is associated with anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties. Therefore, in this work, DHA liposomes were synthesized using a microfluidic platform to target and reduce the inflammatory environment of GBM. The liposomes were rapidly taken up by macrophages in a time-dependent manner without causing cytotoxicity. Moreover, DHA liposomes successfully downregulated the expression of inflammatory-associated genes (IL-6; IL-1β; TNFα; NF-κB, and STAT-1) and the secretion of key cytokines (IL-6 and TNFα) in stimulated macrophages and GBM cells. Conversely, no significant differences were observed in the expression of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory gene expressed in alternatively activated macrophages. Additionally, DHA liposomes were found to be more efficient in regulating the inflammatory profile of these cells compared with a free formulation of DHA. The nanomedicine platform established in this work opens new opportunities for developing liposomes incorporating DHA to target GBM and its inflammatory milieu.">

        <tr id="Certain somatic mutations confer a fitness advantage in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) over normal HSPCs, resulting in the clonal expansion of mutant blood cells1, otherwise known as clonal haematopoiesis (CH). CH is frequently observed among healthy elderly people and is closely associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The most frequently mutated genes of CH include DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL12. Among them, even though ASXL1 mutations are clinically associated with the highest risk for developing CVDs, little is known whether and how the mutations contribute to CVDs. Here we show accelerated development of atherosclerosis and increased inflammatory monocytes in mice transplanted with the bone marrow cells (BMCs) from the mice expressing mutant ASXL1 (ASXL1-MT) selectively in hematopoietic cells. RNA sequencing analysis of the plaque-macrophages derived from BMCs expressing ASXL1-MT showed more inflammatory signatures than those from control BMCs. Mechanistically, wild-type ASXL1 inhibited innate immune signalling through direct interactions with IRAK1/TRAF6/TAK1 in the cytoplasm, while ASXL1-MT, which only interacted with TAK1, lost this regulatory function, leading to NF-κB activation. This mechanism is unique and distinct from those of CH with Tet2 or Dnmt3a mutations, where overactivation of the IL-1β/NLRP3 inflammasome plays critical roles3–5. Intriguingly, IRAK1/4 inhibition decreased the number of inflammatory monocytes and attenuated the development of atherosclerosis driven by ASXL1-MT. The present work connects the mutations of an epigenetic factor, ASXL1, with inflammation and CVDs and gives an indication for the prevention of CVDs in CH.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cervical cancer has the second-highest mortality rate among malignant tumors of the female reproductive system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade are promising therapeutic agents, but their efficacy when combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has not been fully tested, and how they alter the tumor microenvironment has not been comprehensively elucidated. Methods In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing using 46,950 cells from nine human cervical cancer tissues representing sequential different stages of NACT and PD-1 blockade combination therapy. We delineated the trajectory of cervical epithelial cells and identified the crucial factors involved in combination therapy. Cell–cell communication analysis was performed between tumor and immune cells. In addition, THP-1-derived and primary monocyte-derived macrophages were cocultured with cervical cancer cells and phagocytosis was detected by flow cytometry. The antitumor activity of blocking CD74 was validated in vivo using a CD74 humanized subcutaneous tumor model. Results Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that NACT activated cytokine and complement-related immune responses. Cell–cell communication analysis revealed that after NACT therapy, interaction strength between T cells and cancer cells decreased, but intensified between macrophages and cancer cells. We verified that macrophages were necessary for the PD-1 blockade to exert antitumor effects in vitro. Additionally, CD74-positive macrophages frequently interacted with the most immunoreactive epithelial subgroup 3 (Epi3) cancer subgroup during combination NACT. We found that CD74 upregulation limited phagocytosis and stimulated M2 polarization, whereas CD74 blockade enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, decreasing cervical cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions Our study reveals the dynamic cell–cell interaction network in the cervical cancer microenvironment influenced by combining NACT and PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, blocking tumor-associated macrophage-derived CD74 could augment neoadjuvant therapeutic efficacy.">

However, the molecular pathways underlying the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell transdifferentiation in CD patients remain elusive. To this aim, we created and functionally screened a transposon AIEC mutant library of 10.058 mutants to identify the virulence determinants directly implicated in triggering IL-23 production and pTh17 cell generation. pTh17 cell transdifferentiation was assessed in functional assays by co-culturing AIEC-infected human dendritic cells (DCs) with autologous conventional Th17 (cTh17) cells isolated from blood of Healthy Donors (HD) or CD patients. AIEC triggered IL-23 hypersecretion and transdifferentiation of cTh17 into pTh17 cells selectively through the interaction with CD-derived DCs. Moreover, the chronic release of IL-23 by AIEC-colonized DCs required a continuous IL-23 neutralization to significantly reduce the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell differentiation. The multi-step screenings of the AIEC mutant’s library revealed that deletion of ybaT or rfaP efficiently hinder the IL-23 hypersecretion and hampered the AIEC-dependent skewing of protective cTh17 into pathogenic IFNγ-producing pTh17 cells. Overall, our findings indicate that ybaT (inner membrane transport protein) and rfaP (LPS-core heptose kinase) represent novel and attractive candidate targets to prevent chronic intestinal inflammation in CD.">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses pose a significant burden on global human health. Influenza has a broad cellular tropism in the airway, but how infection of different epithelial cell types impacts replication kinetics and burden in the airways is not fully understood. Using primary human airway cultures, which recapitulate the diverse epithelial cell landscape of the human airways, we investigated the impact of cell type composition on virus tropism and replication kinetics. Cultures were highly diverse across multiple donors and 30 independent differentiation conditions and supported a range of influenza replication. Although many cell types were susceptible to influenza, ciliated and secretory cells were predominantly infected. Despite the strong tropism preference for secretory and ciliated cells, which consistently make up 75% or more of infected cells, only ciliated cells were associated with increased virus production. Surprisingly, infected secretory cells were associated with overall reduced virus output. The disparate response and contribution to influenza virus production could be due to different pro- and antiviral interferon-stimulated gene signatures between ciliated and secretory populations, which were interrogated with single-cell RNA sequencing. These data highlight the heterogeneous outcomes of influenza virus infections in the complex cellular environment of the human airway and the disparate impacts of infected cell identity on multiround burst size, even among preferentially infected cell types.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, is a promising treatment modality in oncology that involves augmenting the tumor-attacking capabilities of the immune system. Several preclinical and clinical studies have underscored the transformative potential of ICBs in the context of malignancies. 1 However, the efficacy of ICB therapy is often impeded by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in solid tumors, which are commonly due to a paucity of tumor neoantigens, checkpoint targets, and the inflammatory presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is profoundly immunosuppressive, which is the key reason for the limited clinical efficacy of ICB therapy. Within this milieu, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant myeloid cell subset, and their high infiltration levels have been implicated in mediating resistance to ICB therapy, thereby correlating with adverse prognosis across a spectrum of cancers. 3 Recent advances reported in Nature Cancer have shed light on specific TAM subpopulations that are instrumental in facilitating tumor immune evasion and resistance to ICB therapy. Two recent studies have delineated the roles of Sirp α + TAMs in colorectal cancer (CRC) 4 and Siglec-9 + TAMs in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. The role of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in pediatric COVID-19 patients remains unclear.


METHODS
We isolated EVs from healthy controls (n = 13) and pediatric COVID-19 patients (n = 104) with varying severity during acute and convalescent phases using serial ultracentrifugation. EV effects on healthy PBMCs, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocytes were assessed through in vitro assays, flow cytometry, and ELISA.


RESULTS
Our findings indicate that COVID-19 severity correlates with diverse immune responses. Severe acute cases exhibited increased cytokine levels, decreased IFNγ levels, and lower CD4+ T cell and monocyte counts, suggesting immunosuppression. EVs from severe acute patients stimulated healthy cells to express higher PDL1, increased Th2 and Treg cells, reduced IFNγ secretion, and altered Th1/Th17 ratios. Patient-derived EVs significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (p < .001 for mild, p = .0025 for severe cases) and decreased CD4+ T cell (p = .043) and monocyte (p = .033) populations in stimulated healthy PBMCs.


CONCLUSION
This study reveals the complex relationship between immunological responses and EV-mediated effects, emphasizing the impact of COVID-19 severity. We highlight the potential role of plasma-derived EVs in early-stage immunosuppression in severe COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="The stress kinase MAPK13 (aka p38δ-MAPK) is an attractive entry point for therapeutic intervention because it regulates the structural remodeling that can develop after epithelial barrier injury in the lung and likely other tissue sites. However, a selective, safe, and effective MAPK13 inhibitor is not yet available for experimental or clinical application. Here we identify a first-in-kind MAPK13 inhibitor using structure-based drug design combined with a screening funnel for cell safety and molecular specificity. This inhibitor (designated NuP-4) down-regulates basal-epithelial stem cell reprogramming, structural remodeling, and pathophysiology equivalently to Mapk13 gene-knockout in mouse and mouse organoid models of post-viral lung disease. This therapeutic benefit persists after stopping treatment as a sign of disease modification and attenuates key aspects of inflammation and remodeling as an indication of disease reversal. Similarly, NuP-4 treatment can directly control cytokine-stimulated growth, immune activation, and mucinous differentiation in human basal-cell organoids. The data thereby provide a new tool and potential fix for long-term stem cell reprogramming after viral injury and related conditions that require MAPK13 induction-activation. New and noteworthy This study identifies a small-molecule inhibitor for MAPK13 with efficacy and safety in models of the long-term disease that features epithelial stem cell reprogramming towards inflammation and structural remodeling. The present model has direct implications for respiratory disease triggered by viral infection and other inhaled toxins, but the tissue distribution of MAPK13 implies related actions at other epithelial barrier sites. The findings also refine a hypothesis for therapeutic intervention based on proper adjustment of MAPK13 function with a selective kinase inhibitor.">

Neutrophils, despite being the most populous immune cells in human blood circulation, are not considered a viable option for cellular therapies because of their short lifespan and poor understanding of their role in the pathophysiology of various diseases.

Activation brings about significant changes to neutrophil biology such as increased lifespan, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and enhanced effector functions. Activated neutrophils also possess the potential to stimulate the downstream immune response and are described as essential effectors in the immune response to tumors. This makes activated neutrophils an interesting candidate for cell therapies. Here, we review the biology of activated neutrophils in detail. We discuss the different ways neutrophils can be activated and the effect they have on other immune cells for stimulation of downstream immune response.

        <tr id="The PD-1-PD-L1 immune checkpoint helps to maintain self-tolerance and prevent the development of autoimmune diseases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are successful immunotherapeutics for several cancers, but responding patients can develop immune-mediated adverse events. It is well established that PD-1 regulates CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, but its role in controlling the activation of pathogenic γδ T cells is less clear. Here we examined the role of PD-1 in regulating γδ T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. We found that PD-1 was highly expressed on CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells in the lymph node (LN) and CNS of mice with EAE. Treatment of mice with anti-PD-1 significantly augmented IL-17A-producing CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells in the LN and CNS and enhanced the severity of EAE. The exacerbating effect of anti-PD-1 on EAE was lost in Tcrd-/- mice. Conversely, ligation of PD-1 suppressed Il17a and Rorc gene expression and IL-17A production by purified Vγ4 γδ T cells stimulated via the TCR, but not with IL-1β and IL-23. Our study demonstrates that PD-1 regulates TCR-activated CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells, but that cytokine-activated IL-17A producing γδ T cells escape the regulatory effects of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Melioidosis is a tropical infection caused by the intracellular pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, an underreported and emerging global threat. As melioidosis-associated mortality is frequently high despite antibiotics, novel management strategies are critically needed. Therefore, we sought to determine whether functional changes in the host innate and adaptive immune responses are induced during acute melioidosis and are associated with outcome. Using a unique whole blood stimulation assay developed for use in resource-limited settings, we examined induced cellular functional and phenotypic changes in a cohort of patients with bacteremic melioidosis prospectively enrolled within 24 h of positive blood culture and followed for 28 days. Compared to healthy controls, melioidosis survivors generated an IL-17 response mediated by Th17 cells and terminally-differentiated effector memory CD8+ T cells (P < .05, both), persisting to 28 days after enrolment. Furthermore, melioidosis survivors developed polyfunctional cytokine production in CD8+ T cells (P < .01). Conversely, a reduction in CCR6+ CD4+ T cells was associated with higher mortality, even after adjustments for severity of illness (P = 0.004). Acute melioidosis was also associated with a profound acute impairment in monocyte function as stimulated cytokine responses were reduced in classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes. Impaired monocyte cytokine function improved by 28-days after enrolment. These data suggest that IL-17 mediated cellular responses may be contributors to host defense during acute melioidosis, and that innate immune function may be impaired. These insights could provide novel targets for the development of therapies and vaccine targets in this frequently lethal disease.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality globally, emphasizing the need to develop more effective and well-tolerated treatments. Pharmacological inhibitors of Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 (CDK4/6i) can inhibit breast cancer growth by inducing a senescent-like state. However, long-term treatment efficacy remains hindered by the development of drug resistance and restoration of cell proliferation. Thus, clearance of senescent-like cancer cells may extend the durability of treatment. In this study, we showed that CDK4/6i-treated breast cancer cells exhibit various senescence-associated phenotypes that remain insensitive to common senolytic compounds. By searching for novel vulnerabilities, we identified a significantly increased lysosomal mass and altered lysosomal structure across various breast cancer cell types upon exposure to CDK4/6i in preclinical systems and clinical specimens. We demonstrated that these lysosomal alterations render breast cancer cells sensitive to lysosomotropic agents, such as L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) and salinomycin. Importantly, sequential treatment with CDK4/6i/lysosomotropic agents effectively reduced the growth of both Hormone Receptor-positive (HR+) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in vivo. This sequential therapeutic strategy offers a promising approach to eliminate CDK4/6i-induced senescent(-like) cells, potentially reducing tumor recurrence and enhancing the overall efficacy of breast cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Rhinovirus C (RV-C) infects airway epithelial cells and is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in humans. To interrogate the mechanisms of RV-C-mediated disease, animal models are essential. Towards this, RV-C infection was recently reported in wild-type (WT) mice, yet, titers were not sustained. Therefore, the requirements for RV-C infection in mice remain unclear. Notably, prior work has implicated human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as essential host factors for virus uptake and replication, respectively. Here, we report that even though human (h) and murine (m) CDHR3 orthologs have similar tissue distribution, amino acid sequence homology is limited. Further, while RV-C can replicate in mouse lung epithelial type 1 (LET1) cells and produce infectious virus, we observed a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of dsRNA-positive cells following hSTING expression. Based on these findings, we sought to assess the impact of hCDHR3 and hSTING on RV-C infection in mice in vivo. Thus, we developed hCDHR3 transgenic mice, and utilized adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver hSTING to the murine airways. Subsequent challenge of these mice with RV-C15 revealed significantly higher titers 24 h post-infection in mice expressing both hCDHR3 and hSTING—compared to either WT mice, or mice with hCDHR3 or hSTING alone, indicating more efficient infection. Ultimately, this mouse model can be further engineered to establish a robust in vivo model, recapitulating viral dynamics and disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients, inhibits graft rejection by binding to cyclophilins and competitively inhibiting calcineurin. While concerns about respiratory infections in immunosuppressed patients exist, contradictory data emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prompting investigations into CsA's impact on viral infections. This study explores CsA's antiviral effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.1, Delta variants, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium (HAE). CsA exhibited a dose‐dependent antiviral effect against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta variant, reducing viral load over 10 days. However, no significant impact was observed against SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron or HPIV3, indicating a virus‐specific effect. At high concentrations, CsA was associated with an increase of IL‐8 and a decrease of IFNλ expression in infected and noninfected HAE. This study highlights the complexity of CsA's antiviral mechanisms, more likely involving intricate inflammatory pathways and interactions with specific viral proteins. The research provides novel insights into CsA's effects on respiratory viruses, emphasizing the need for understanding drug–virus interactions in optimizing therapeutic approaches for transplant recipients and advancing knowledge on immunosuppressive treatments' implications on respiratory viral infections. Limitations include the model's inability to assess T lymphocyte activation, suggesting the necessity for further comprehensive studies to decipher the intricate dynamics of immunosuppressive treatments on respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which promotes a sustained inflammatory environment in the central nervous system. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the control of inflammation and might play a neuroprotective role. Indeed, a decrease in Treg number and function has been reported in PD. In this context, pramipexole, a dopaminergic receptor agonist used to treat PD symptoms, has been shown to increase peripheral levels of Treg cells and improve their suppressive function. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of pramipexole on immunoregulatory Treg cells and its possible neuroprotective effect on human dopaminergic neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells. Methods Treg cells were sorted from white blood cells of healthy human donors. Assays were performed with CD3/CD28‐activated and non‐activated Treg cells treated with pramipexole at concentrations of 2 or 200 ng/mL. These regulatory cells were co‐cultured with in vitro‐differentiated human dopaminergic neurons in a cytotoxicity assay with 6‐hydroxydopamine (6‐OHDA). The role of interleukin‐10 (IL‐10) was investigated by co‐culturing activated IL‐10‐producing Treg cells with neurons. To further investigate the effect of treatment on Tregs, gene expression in pramipexole‐treated, CD3/CD28‐activated Treg cells was determined by Fluidigm analysis. Results Pramipexole‐treated CD3/CD28‐activated Treg cells showed significant protective effects on dopaminergic neurons when challenged with 6‐OHDA. Pramipexole‐treated activated Treg cells showed neuroprotective capacity through mechanisms involving IL‐10 release and the activation of genes associated with regulation and neuroprotection. Conclusion Anti‐CD3/CD28‐activated Treg cells protect dopaminergic neurons against 6‐OHDA‐induced damage. In addition, activated, IL‐10‐producing, pramipexole‐treated Tregs also induced a neuroprotective effect, and the supernatants of these co‐cultures promoted axonal growth. Pramipexole‐treated, activated Tregs altered their gene expression in a concentration‐dependent manner, and enhanced TGFβ‐related dopamine receptor regulation and immune‐related pathways. These findings open new perspectives for the development of immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of PD.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes are mediators of homeostasis but contribute to neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mounting evidence suggests involvement of peripheral immune cells in PD pathogenesis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the potential role of peripheral immune secreted cytokines in modulating midbrain astrocyte reactivity. Human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes were exposed to 5% and 10% CD4+ T cell conditioned media (CD4CM) for 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days to assess chronic exposure. Additionally, astrocytes were exposed to the Th17 cell cytokine, IL-17A (10 ng/mL), alone and in combination with TNF-α (0.3 ng/mL) to assess potential synergistic effects of both cytokines at 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days. CD4CM induced acute and chronic alterations in midbrain astrocytes. Increased NFκB translocation to the nucleus, increased expression of the pro-inflammatory genes, IL-1β, CXCL10 at 24 h, C3, LCN2, IL-6 at 24 and 48 h, as well as an increase in their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CXCL10 at both these time points were observed. A synergistic response to the combination of IL-17A and TNF-α on increasing inflammatory gene expression and cytokine release occurred. IL-17A and TNF-α increased intensity of S100β at 24 h, decreased nuclear area and increased circularity of astrocytes at 72 h. A synergistic effect on γH2AX intensity at 72 h and an increase in LDH release at 7 days was observed. Our results demonstrate that IL-17A and TNF-α act synergistically, enhancing midbrain astrocyte reactivity to a similar degree as CD4CM. This highlights the importance of the peripheral immune secreted cytokines in increasing the reactivity status of midbrain astrocytes, implicating their role in PD.">

        <tr id="Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare disease characterized by malignant cells derived from the epithelial cells of the biliary duct system. Despite extensive treatments, the prognosis for CCA remains poor, emphasizing the critical need for the development of novel treatments. Considerable attention has been directed towards innate immune effector cells, which can recognize tumor cells independently of the major histocompatibility complex, laying the foundation for the development of off-the-shelf drugs. In this study, we cultured innate immune cells obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy adults and conducted a comparative analysis of the effector functions against CCA cell lines by Vδ2 γδ T cells and NK cells. This analysis was performed using standard short- and long-term cytotoxicity assays, as well as ELISA for IFN-γ. Vδ2 γδ T cells demonstrated cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production in response to CCA cells in a TCR-dependent manner, particularly in the presence of tetrakis-pivaloyloxymethyl 2-(thiazole-2-ylamino)ethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate, a bisphosphonate prodrug. In contrast, direct killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity were relatively slow and weak. Conversely, NK cells displayed potent, direct cytotoxicity against CCA cells. In summary, both Vδ2 γδ T cells and NK cells show promise as innate immune effector cells for adoptive transfer therapy in the context of CCA.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a complex condition of inflammatory and immune dysregulation, triggered by severe infection. In survivors, chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation linger, facilitating the emergence of infections. CD8 dysfunction contributes to immunosuppression in sepsis survivors. We devised an animal model that enabled us to identify and analyze CD8-intrinsic defects induced by sepsis. We adoptively transferred CD45.1 CD8 OT-I T cells into CD45.2 congenic mice and subjected them to cecal ligature and puncture, to induce abdominal sepsis. One month later, we isolated the transferred CD8 cells. Surface marker expression confirmed they had not been activated through the TCR. CD8 OT-I T cells isolated from septic (or sham-operated) mice were transferred to second recipients, which were challenged with OVA-expressing Listeria monocytogenes. We compared effector capacities between OT-I cells exposed to sepsis and control cells. Naive mice that received OT-I cells exposed to sepsis had higher bacterial burden and a shorter survival when challenged with OVA-expressing L. monocytogenes. OT-I cells isolated from septic mice produced less IFN-γ but had conserved activation, expansion potential, and cytotoxic function. We observed lower transcript levels of IFN-γ and of the long noncoding RNA Ifng-as1, a local regulator of the epigenetic landscape, in cells exposed to sepsis. Accordingly, local abundance of a histone modification characteristic of active promoter regions was reduced in sepsis-exposed CD8 T cells. Our results identify a mechanism through which inflammation in the context of sepsis affects CD8 T cell function intrinsically.">

        <tr id="Brucella abortus (Ba) is a pathogen that survives inside macrophages. Despite being its preferential niche, Ba infects other cells, as shown by the multiple signs and symptoms humans present. This pathogen can evade our immune system. Ba displays a mechanism of down-modulating MHC-I on monocytes/macrophages in the presence of IFN-γ (when Th1 response is triggered) without altering the total expression of MHC-I. The retained MHC-I proteins are located within the Golgi Apparatus (GA). The RNA of Ba is one of the PAMPs that trigger this phenomenon. However, we acknowledged whether this event could be triggered in other cells relevant during Ba infection. Here, we demonstrate that Ba RNA reduced the surface expression of MHC-I induced by IFN-γ in the human bronchial epithelium (Calu-6), the human alveolar epithelium (A-549) and the endothelial microvasculature (HMEC) cell lines. In Calu-6 and HMEC cells, Ba RNA induces the retention of MHC-I in the GA. This phenomenon was not observed in A-549 cells. We then evaluated the effect of Ba RNA on the secretion of IL-8, IL-6 and MCP-1, key cytokines in Ba infection. Contrary to our expectations, HMEC, Calu-6 and A-549 cells treated with Ba RNA had higher IL-8 and IL-6 levels compared to untreated cells. In addition, we showed that Ba RNA down-modulates the MHC-I surface expression induced by IFN-γ on human monocytes/macrophages via the pathway of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). So, cells were stimulated with an EGFR ligand-blocking antibody (Cetuximab) and Ba RNA. Neutralization of the EGFR to some extent reversed the down-modulation of MHC-I mediated by Ba RNA in HMEC and A-549 cells. In conclusion, this is the first study exploring a central immune evasion strategy, such as the downregulation of MHC-I surface expression, beyond monocytes and could shed light on how it persists effectively within the host, enduring unseen and escaping CD8+ T cell surveillance.">

        <tr id="Background: Hantavirus causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Strong inflammatory responses and vascular leakage are important hallmarks of these often fatal diseases. The mechanism behind pathogenesis is unknown and no specific treatment is available. IL-6 was recently highlighted as a biomarker for HPS/HFRS severity. IL-6 signaling is complex and context dependent: while classical signaling generally provide protective responses, trans-signaling can cause severe pathogenic responses. This study aims to investigate a potential role for IL-6 trans-signaling in hantavirus pathogenesis. Methods: Effects of IL-6 trans-signaling during in vitro hantavirus infection were assessed using primary human endothelial cells treated with recombinant soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Plasma from Puumala orthohantavirus-infected HFRS patients (n=28) were analyzed for IL-6 trans-signaling potential and its associations to severity. Findings: In vitro, sIL-6R treatment of infected cells enhanced IL-6 and CCL2 secretion, upregulated ICAM-1, and affected VE-cadherin leading to a disrupted cell barrier integrity. HFRS patients showed altered plasma levels of sIL-6R and soluble gp130 (sgp130) resulting in an increased sIL-6R/sgp130 ratio suggesting enhanced IL-6 trans-signaling potential. Plasma sgp130 levels negatively correlated with number of interventions and positively with albumin levels. Patients receiving oxygen treatment displayed a higher sIL-6R/sgp130 ratio compared to patients that did not. Interpretation: IL-6 trans-signaling is linked to hantavirus pathogenesis. Targeting IL-6 trans-signaling might provide a therapeutic strategy for treatment of HPS and severe HFRS.">

        <tr id="T cells play important roles in antitumor immunity. However, given that the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor microenvironment confers resistance to T cell-based immunotherapies, novel strategies to boost T cell-mediated antitumor efficacy are urgently needed for the treatment of HCC. Here, we show that high proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type9 (PCSK9) expression was negatively associated with HCC patient's overall survival and markers of CD8+ T cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9 enhanced tumor-specific killing and downregulated PD-1 expression of AFP-specific TCR-T. Inhibition of PCSK9 significantly enhances the anti-HCC efficacy of TCR-T cells and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in vivo. Moreover, PCSK9 inhibitor suppressed HCC growth dependent on CD8+ T cells. Mechanically, pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9 promoted low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-mediated activation of mTORC1 signaling in CD8+ T cells. LDLR deficiency was shown to impair cellular mTORC1 signaling and the anti-HCC function of CD8 T cells. On the basis of our findings in this study, we propose a potential metabolic intervention strategy that could be used to enhance the antitumor effects of immunotherapy for HCC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the infectious diseases with high incidence and high mortality. About a quarter of the population has been latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. At present, the available TB treatment strategies have the disadvantages of too long treatment duration and serious adverse reactions. The sustained inflammatory response leads to permanent tissue damage. Unfortunately, the current selection of treatment regimens does not consider the immunomodulatory effects of various drugs. In this study, we preliminarily evaluated the effects of commonly used anti-tuberculosis drugs on innate immunity at the cellular level. The results showed that clofazimine (CFZ) has a significant innate immunosuppressive effect. CFZ significantly inhibited cytokines and type I interferons (IFNα and IFNβ) expression under both lipopolysaccharide stimulation and CFZ-resistant strain infection. In further mechanistic studies, CFZ strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and had no significant effect on the phosphorylation of p38. In conclusion, our study found that CFZ suppresses innate immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis by NF-κB, which should be considered in future regimen development. IMPORTANCE The complete elimination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiologic agent of TB, from TB patients is a complicated process that takes a long time. The excessive immune inflammatory response of the host for a long time causes irreversible organic damage to the lungs and liver. Current antibiotic-based treatment options involve multiple complex drug combinations, often targeting different physiological processes of Mtb. Given the high incidence of post-tuberculosis lung disease, we should also consider the immunomodulatory properties of other drugs when selecting drug combinations.">

        <tr id="Combination therapy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved the prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but many patients still have unsatisfactory outcomes. CD8 T cells are known to exert a pivotal function in the immune response against tumors. Nevertheless, most CD8 T cells in HCC tissues are in a state of exhaustion, losing the cytotoxic activity against malignant cells. Cytokines, mainly secreted by immune cells, play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here, we demonstrated the changes in exhausted CD8T cells during combination therapy by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on tumor samples before and after treatment. Combination therapy exerted a substantial impact on the exhausted CD8T cells, particularly in terms of cytokine expression. CCL5 was the most abundantly expressed cytokine in CD8T cells and exhausted CD8T cells, and its expression increased further after treatment. Subsequently, we discovered the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on CCL5-stimulated Huh7 cells and verified through a series of experiments that this pathway can mediate the resistance of liver cancer cells to lenvatinib. Tissue experiments showed that after combination therapy, the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway was activated, which can benefit the residual tumor cells to survive treatment. Tumor-bearing mouse experiments demonstrated that bergamottin (BGM), a competitive inhibitor of CYP1A1, can enhance the efficacy of both lenvatinib and combination therapy. Our research revealed one mechanism by which hepatoma cells can survive the combination therapy, providing a theoretical basis for the refined treatment of HCC.">

We previously showed that the loss of either Fabp5 or calnexin causes resistance to the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we show that brain endothelial cells lacking either Fabp5 or calnexin have an increased abundance of cell surface CD200 and soluble CD200 (sCD200) as well as decreased T-cell adhesion. In a tissue culture model of the blood–brain barrier, antagonizing the interaction of CD200 and sCD200 with T-cell CD200 receptor (CD200R1) via anti-CD200 blocking antibodies or the RNAi-mediated inhibition of CD200 production by endothelial cells increased T-cell adhesion and transmigration across monolayers of endothelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that sCD200 produced by brain endothelial cells regulates immune cell trafficking through the blood–brain barrier and is primarily responsible for preventing activated T-cells from entering the brain.">

        <tr id="Purpose This study evaluated the ability of ELISpot to identify immuno-modulatory drug therapies for their potential efficacy in patients with sepsis. Methods ELISpot was performed using diluted whole blood from 61 septic patients and 48 healthy matched controls. Innate and adaptive immunity were evaluated by ex vivo stimulated production of TNF-α and IFN-γ respectively. Potential drug efficacy was determined by the drugs’ effects to increase or decrease the number of cytokine-producing cells and amount of cytokine produced per cell as determined by spot size and intensity. The corticosteroid dexamethasone was evaluated for its ability to down modulate TNF-α and IFN-γ production. The TLR7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) and T-cell stimulants IL-7 and anti-PD-1 mAb were tested for their ability to enhance immune responses in sepsis. Results Spontaneous production of TNF-α and IFN-γ varied among healthy subjects and septic patients. LPS or resiquimod stimulation increased total TNF-α production in septic patients by 1,648% and 1,929% respectively. Conversely, dexamethasone diminished the responses to LPS or resiquimod by 71% and 61% respectively. IL-7, but not anti-PD-1 mAb markedly increased IFN-γ production in both healthy subjects (127%) and septic patients (79%). Dexamethasone also reduced anti-CD3/CD28 mAb stimulated IFN-γ production by 54%; while IL-7 ameliorated dexamethasone-induced suppression. IL-7 significantly enhanced lymphocyte function in over 90% of septic patients. Conclusion ELISpot can reveal host immune response patterns and the effects of drugs to selectively down– or up-regulate patient immunity. Furthermore, the ability of ELISpot to detect the effect of specific immuno-modulatory drugs to independently regulate the innate and adaptive host response could enable precision-based immune drug therapies in sepsis.">

        <tr id="Foxp3+ Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a subset of CD4+ T cells that play critical functions in maintaining tolerance to self antigens and suppressing autoimmunity, regulating immune responses to pathogens and have a role in the pathophysiology of anti-tumoural immunity. Treg ontogeny is complex since they are generated following recognition of self antigens in the thymus during normal T cell development (thymic Treg), but are also induced from mature conventional T cells when activated by foreign antigen with appropriate additional cues (inducible Treg). How these distinct ontogenic pathways contribute to the maintenance and function of the mature Treg compartment in health and disease remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of fate mapping approaches in mice to map the ontogeny of Treg subsets throughout life and estimate rates of production, loss and self-renewal. We find that naive and effector/memory (EM) Treg subsets exhibit distinct dynamics but are both continuously replenished by de novo generation throughout life. Using an inducible Foxp3-dependent Cre fate reporter system, we show that naive Treg and not conventional T cells, are the predominant precursors of EM Treg in adults. Tonic development of new EM Treg is not influenced by foreign antigens from commensals, rather suggesting a role for self recognition. To investigate the ontogeny of Treg development in malignant disease, we used the same fate reporter systems to characterise the Treg infiltrate of three different model tumours. In all three cases, we found that Treg derived from pre-existing, EM Treg. Together, these results reveal a predominantly linear pathway of Treg development from thymic origin to EM Treg associated with pathophysiology of malignant disease, that is driven by self antigen recognition throughout.">

        <tr id="Inflammation is a key factor in both influenza and radiation-induced lung pathophysiology. This implies a commonality of response to pulmonary damage from these insults and suggests exacerbated pathology may occur after combined exposure. We therefore tested the hypothesis that past inflammation from viral infection alters the lung microenvironment and lowers tolerance for radiation injury. Mice were inoculated with influenza A virus (IAV) and three weeks later, after virus clearance, mice received total-body irradiation (TBI). Survival as well as systemic and local lung inflammation were assessed, and strategies to mitigate pulmonary injury were investigated. After IAV infection alone, body condition recovered within 3 weeks, however inflammatory pathways remained active for 15 weeks. IAV infection exacerbated subsequent TBI responses, evident by increased lethality, enhanced histologically evident lung injury and an altered lung macrophage phenotype. To mitigate this enhanced sensitivity, captopril [an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)] was administered to limit tissue inflammation, or inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophage recruitment was blocked with a C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) inhibitor. Both treatments abrogated the changes in circulating immune cells observed 4 weeks after TBI, and attenuated pro-inflammatory phenotypes in lung alveolar macrophages, appearing to shift immune cell dynamics towards recovery. Histologically apparent lung injury was not improved by either treatment. We show that latent lung injury from viral infection exacerbates radiation morbidity and mortality. Although strategies that attenuate proinflammatory immune cell phenotypes can normalize macrophage dynamics, this does not fully mitigate lung injury. Recognizing that past viral infections can enhance lung radiosensitivity is of critical importance for patients receiving TBI, as it could increase the incidence of adverse outcomes.">

        <tr id="The re-emergence of the Mpox (formerly monkeypox) in 2022 in non-endemic countries has raised many concerns for global health due to its high transmissibility and mortality rate. A major challenge in fighting Mpox is its ability to evade the host's innate immune system, which is the first line of defense against viral infections. Mpox encodes various proteins that interfere with key antiviral pathways and mechanisms, such as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, cytokine production, complement and inflammasome activation, and chemokine binding. These proteins modulate the expression and function of innate immune mediators, such as interferons, interleukins, and toll-like receptors, and impair the recruitment and activation of innate immune cells, such as natural killer cells. By suppressing or altering these innate immune responses, Mpox enhances its replication and infection in the host tissues and organs, leading to systemic inflammation, tissue damage, and organ failure. This study reveals new insights into the molecular and cellular interactions between Mpox and the host's innate immunity and identifies potential targets and strategies for antiviral interventions.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects warm-blooded vertebrates across the world. In humans, seropositivity rates of T. gondii range from 10% to 90% across communities. Despite its prevalence, few studies address how T. gondii infection changes the metabolism of host cells. In this study, we investigate how T. gondii manipulates the host cell metabolic environment by monitoring the metabolic response over time using noninvasive autofluorescence lifetime imaging of single cells, metabolite analysis, extracellular flux analysis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Autofluorescence lifetime imaging indicates that infected host cells become more oxidized and have an increased proportion of bound NAD(P)H compared to uninfected controls. Over time, infected cells also show decreases in levels of intracellular glucose and lactate, increases in oxygen consumption, and variability in ROS production. We further examined changes associated with the pre-invasion “kiss and spit” process using autofluorescence lifetime imaging, which also showed a more oxidized host cell with an increased proportion of bound NAD(P)H over 48 hours compared to uninfected controls, suggesting that metabolic changes in host cells are induced by T. gondii kiss and spit even without invasion. IMPORTANCE This study sheds light on previously unexplored changes in host cell metabolism induced by T. gondii infection using noninvasive, label-free autofluorescence imaging. In this study, we use optical metabolic imaging (OMI) to measure the optical redox ratio (ORR) in conjunction with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to noninvasively monitor single host cell response to T. gondii infection over 48 hours. Collectively, our results affirm the value of using autofluorescence lifetime imaging to noninvasively monitor metabolic changes in host cells over the time course of a microbial infection. Understanding this metabolic relationship between the host cell and the parasite could uncover new treatment and prevention options for T. gondii infections worldwide.

        <tr id="Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains an important global public health problem. About 40 million people are infected with HIV, and this infection caused about 630,000 deaths in 2022. The hallmark of HIV infection is the depletion of CD4+ T helper lymphocytes (Th cells). There are at least seven different Th subtypes, and not all are the main targets of HIV. Moreover, the effect of the virus in a specific subtype can be completely different from that of the others. Although the most compromised Th subtype in HIV infection is Th17, HIV can induce important dysregulations in other subtypes, such as follicular Th (Tfh) cells and regulatory Th cells (Treg cells or Tregs). Several studies have shown that HIV can induce an increase in the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs without causing a significant reduction in their numbers, at least in the early phase of infection. The increased activity of this Th subtype seems to play an important role in determining the immunodeficiency status of HIV-infected patients, and Tregs may represent a new target for innovative anti-HIV therapies, including the so-called “Kick and Kill” therapeutic method whose goal is the complete elimination of the virus and the healing of HIV infection. In this review, we report the most important findings on the effects of HIV on different CD4+ T cell subtypes, the molecular mechanisms by which the virus impairs the functions of these cells, and the implications for new anti-HIV therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="A major challenge in tuberculosis (TB) therapeutics is that antibiotic exposure leads to changes in the physiologic state of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) which may enable the pathogen to withstand treatment. While antibiotic-treated Mtb have been evaluated in short-term in vitro experiments, it is unclear if and how long-term in vivo treatment with diverse antibiotics with varying treatment-shortening activity (sterilizing activity) affect Mtb physiologic states differently. Here, we used SEARCH-TB, a pathogen-targeted RNA-sequencing platform, to characterize the Mtb transcriptome in the BALB/c high-dose aerosol infection mouse model following 4-week treatment with three sterilizing and three non-sterilizing antibiotics. Certain transcriptional changes were concordant among most antibiotics, including decreased expression of genes associated with protein synthesis and metabolism, and the induction of certain genes associated with stress responses. However, the magnitude of this concordant response differed between antibiotics. Sterilizing antibiotics rifampin, pyrazinamide, and bedaquiline generated a more quiescent Mtb state than did non-sterilizing antibiotics isoniazid, ethambutol, and streptomycin, as indicated by decreased expression of genes associated with translation, transcription, secretion of immunogenic proteins, metabolism, and cell wall synthesis. Additionally, we identified distinguishing transcriptional effects specific to each antibiotic, indicating that different mechanisms of action induce distinct patterns of cellular injury. In addition to elucidating Mtb physiologic changes associated with antibiotic stress, this study demonstrates the value of SEARCH-TB as a highly granular pharmacodynamic assay that reveals antibiotic effects that are not apparent based on culture alone.">

        <tr id="A wide variety of inflammatory mediators, mainly cytokines and chemokines, are induced during SARS CoV-2 infection. Among these proinflammatory mediators, chemokines tend to play a pivotal role in virus-mediated immunopathology. The C-C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine and strong chemoattractant of monocytes, macrophages and CD4+ T cells bearing C-C chemokine receptor type-2 (CCR2). Besides controlling immune cell trafficking, CCL2 is also involved in multiple pathophysiological processes including systemic hyperinflammation associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS), organ fibrosis and blood coagulation. These pathological features are commonly manifested in severe and fatal cases of COVID-19. Given the crucial role of CCL2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis, the CCL2:CCR2 axis may constitute a potential therapeutic target to control virus-induced hyperinflammation and multi-organ dysfunction. Herein we describe recent advances on elucidating the role of CCL2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis, prognosis, and a potential target of anti-inflammatory interventions.">

        <tr id="A better understanding of sepsis-induced immunosuppression pathophysiology is desirable for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent and reduce the rates of secondary infections and their associated mortality. Here we demonstrate that PD-L1+CD44+B220LowCD138+IgM+ regulatory plasma cells (PCs) are induced in a murine model of sepsis-induced immune alterations and in critically ill patients with bacterial sepsis and COVID-19. This was revealed both by detailed analysis of their phenotypical features and gene expression profile and by functional explorations comparing capacity of purified B cells and PCs to suppress T cell proliferation and IFN{gamma} secretion ex vivo. Sepsis-induced regulatory PCs exerted their suppressive function on T cells through IL-10 production and increased PD-L1 expression independently of regulatory T cells. Our findings thus reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism of sepsis-induced immunosuppression that involves regulatory PCs. As such, these PCs constitute valid therapeutic targets to improve immune cell functions impaired by sepsis.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease with unclear pathogenesis and no effective treatments. We aimed to investigate a novel mechanistic theory and treat HAM patients with rituximab, which can deplete CD20+ B lymphocytes in circulation.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data was analyzed to identify HTLV-1-associated B cells and their effect on T cells. An observational analysis of our HAM cohort was conducted to elucidate changes in the immunological microenvironment of these patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HAM patients were isolated to explore the efficacy of B cell depletion in vitro. To assess the effect of B-cell depletion on HAM patients, eligible participants in our cohort received rituximab therapy (NCT04004819).


RESULTS
ScRNA-seq results suggest a significant effect of HTLV-1-associated B cells on T cells. Additionally, HTLV-1 was found to infect B cells and depletion of B cells inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Number of B cells in HAM patients had positive correlation with the proviral load and infected cell counts. Depletion of B cells led to a reduction in HTLV-1 proviral load in vitro. Furthermore, in clinical trial, 14 HAM patients were enrolled. Three patients (21.4%) who received rituximab failed to achieve remission, compared to 24 (85.7%) patients received any other therapy that failed to achieve remission. With a low level of circulating B cells, the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in CD4+ T cells fell.


INTERPRETATION
This study provided evidence that depleting B-lymphocytes is an innovative strategy for treating patients with HAM and broadens the understanding of the role of B cells in infectious immunity.">

        <tr id="Growing evidence suggests that systemic immune and inflammatory responses may play a critical role in the formation and development of aneurysms. Exploring the differences between single intracranial aneurysm (SIA) and multiple IAs (MIAs) could provide insights for targeted therapies. However, there is a lack of comprehensive and detailed characterization of changes in circulating immune cells in MIAs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from patients with SIA (n = 16) or MIAs (n = 6) were analyzed using high-dimensional mass cytometry to evaluate the frequency and phenotype of immune cell subtypes. A total of 25 cell clusters were identified, revealing that the immune signature of MIAs included cluster changes. Compared to patients with SIA, patients with MIAs exhibited immune dysfunction and regulatory imbalance in T-cell clusters. They also had reduced numbers of CD8+ T cells and their subgroups CD8+ Te and CD8+ Tem cells, as well as reduced numbers of the CD4+ T-cell subgroup CD27-CD4+ Tem cells. Furthermore, compared to SIA, MIAs were associated with enhanced T-cell immune activation, with elevated expression levels of CD3, CD25, CD27, CCR7, GP130, and interleukin 10. This study provides insights into the circulating immune cell profiles in patients with MIAs, highlighting the similarities and differences between patients with SIA and those with MIAs. Furthermore, the study suggests that circulating immune dysfunction may contribute to development of MIAs.">

        <tr id="Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer. CRC has no apparent symptoms in the early stages of disease, and most patients receive a confirmed diagnosis in the middle or late disease stages. The incidence of CRC continues to increase, and the affected population tends to be younger. Therefore, determining how to achieve an early CRC diagnosis and treatment has become a top priority for prolonging patient survival. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a group of bone marrow-derived immuno-negative regulatory cells that are divided into two subpopulations, polymorphonuclear-MDSCs and monocytic-MDSCs, based on their phenotypic similarities to neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. These cells can inhibit the immune response and promote cancer cell metastasis in the tumour microenvironment (TME). A large aggregation of MDSCs in the TME is often a marker of cancer and a poor prognosis in inflammatory diseases of the intestine (such as colonic adenoma and ulcerative colitis). In the present review, the phenotypic classification of MDSCs in the CRC microenvironment are first discussed. Then, the amplification, role and metastatic mechanism of MDSCs in the CRC TME are described, focusing on genes, gene modifications, proteins and the intestinal micro-environment. Finally, the progress in CRC-targeted therapies that aim to modulate the quantity, function and structure of MDSCs are summarized in the hope of identifying potential screening markers for CRC and improving CRC prognosis and therapeutic options.">

Noteworthy, type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) have been recently acknowledged as an important class of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the context of host–microorganism interactions shaping the adaptive immune response in the intestinal mucosa. Although a broad range of mouse models has led to significant progress in untangling the role of ILC3s as APCs, the outcome of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent ILC-T cell crosstalk in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains underexplored in human. Moreover, expression of MHCII is confined to ILC3 subset, endowed with lymphoid tissue-inducing properties, that adopts tissue-specific fates and functions. Intestinal microbiota could dictate the plasticity of antigen-presenting ILC3s and we here summarize our current understanding of the functions of these cells in both mouse and human CRC discussing the role of microbiota as a key modulator of their tumor-suppressive activity.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is a major global health concern, particularly affecting those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly. CD4+ T cell response is crucial for immunity against M.tb, but chronic infections and aging can lead to T cell exhaustion and senescence, worsening TB disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction, prevalent in aging and chronic diseases, disrupts cellular metabolism, increases oxidative stress, and impairs T-cell functions. This study investigates the effect of mitochondrial transplantation (mito-transfer) on CD4+ T cell differentiation and function in aged mouse models and human CD4+ T cells from elderly individuals. Mito-transfer in naïve CD4+ T cells is found to promote protective effector and memory T cell generation during M.tb infection in mice. Additionally, it improves elderly human T cell function by increasing mitochondrial mass and altering cytokine production, thereby reducing markers of exhaustion and senescence. These findings suggest mito-transfer as a novel approach to enhance aged CD4+ T cell functionality, potentially benefiting immune responses in the elderly and chronic TB patients. This has broader implications for diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to T-cell exhaustion and senescence.">

        <tr id="Severe COVID-19 cases often progress to life-threatening conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Gelsolin (GSN), an actin-binding protein with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, is a promising therapeutic target for severe COVID-19. Plasma GSN levels are significantly decreased in critical illnesses, including COVID-19, correlating with dysregulated immune responses and poor outcomes. GSN supplementation may mitigate acute lung injury, ARDS, and sepsis, which share pathophysiological features with severe COVID-19, by scavenging actin, modulating cytokine production, enhancing macrophage phagocytosis, and stabilizing the alveolar-capillary barrier. Preliminary data indicate that recombinant human plasma GSN improves oxygenation and lung function in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Although further research is needed to optimize GSN therapy, current evidence supports its potential to mitigate severe consequences of COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the biological characteristics, mechanisms, and therapeutic value of GSN in severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Systemic candidiasis remains a significant public health concern worldwide, with high mortality rates despite available antifungal drugs. Drug-resistant strains add to the urgency for alternative therapies. In this context, vaccination has reemerged as a prominent immune-based strategy. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanosized lipid bilayer particles, carry a diverse array of native fungal antigens, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and glycans. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that Candida albicans EVs triggered the innate immune response, activating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and potentially acting as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. Vaccination with C. albicans EVs induced the production of specific antibodies, modulated cytokine production, and provided protection in immunosuppressed mice infected with lethal C. albicans inoculum. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying EV-induced immune activation, our study investigated pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in EVs-phagocyte engagement. EVs from wild-type and mutant C. albicans strains with truncated mannoproteins were compared for their ability to stimulate BMDCs. Our findings revealed that EV decoration with O- and N-linked mannans and the presence of β-1,3-glucans and chitin oligomers may modulate the activation of specific PRRs, in particular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and dectin-1. The protective effect of vaccination with wild-type EVs was found to be dependent on TLR4. These results suggest that fungal EVs can be harnessed in vaccine formulations to selectively activate PRRs in phagocytes, offering potential avenues for combating or preventing candidiasis. IMPORTANCE Systemic candidiasis is a serious global health concern with high mortality rates and growing drug resistance. Vaccination offers a promising solution. A unique approach involves using tiny lipid-coated particles called extracellular vesicles (EVs), which carry various fungal components. Previous studies found that Candida albicans EVs activate the immune response and may bridge the gap between innate and adaptive immunity. To understand this better, we investigated how these EVs activate immune cells. We demonstrated that specific components on EV surfaces, such as mannans and glucans, interact with receptors on immune cells, including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and dectin-1. Moreover, vaccinating with these EVs led to strong immune responses and full protection in mice infected with Candida. This work shows how harnessing fungal EVs might lead to effective vaccines against candidiasis.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoints are mechanisms that allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and avoid destruction by the body’s immune system. Tumor cells exploit immune checkpoint proteins to inhibit T cell activation, thus enhancing their resistance to immune attacks. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, like nivolumab, work by reactivating these suppressed T cells to target cancer cells. However, this reactivation can disrupt immune balance and cause immune-related adverse events. This report presents a rare case of prurigo nodularis that developed six months after administering nivolumab for lung adenocarcinoma. While immune-related adverse events are commonly linked to T helper-1- or T helper-17-type inflammations, T helper-2-type inflammatory reactions, as observed in our case, are unusual. The PD-1–PD-L1 pathway is typically associated with T helper-1 and 17 responses, whereas the PD-1–PD-L2 pathway is linked to T helper-2 responses. Inhibition of PD-1 can enhance PD-L1 functions, potentially shifting the immune response towards T helper-1 and 17 types, but it may also influence T helper-2-type inflammation. This study reviews T helper-2-type inflammatory diseases emerging from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, highlighting the novelty of our findings.">

        <tr id="Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer with a ~50% response rate to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. To identify predictive biomarkers, we integrated bulk and single-cell RNA-seq with spatial transcriptomics from a cohort of 186 samples from 116 patients, including bulk RNA-seq from 14 matched pairs pre- and post-ICB. In non-responders, tumors show evidence of increased tumor proliferation, neuronal stem cell markers, and IL-1. Responders have increased type I/II interferons and pre-existing tissue resident (Trm) CD8 or Vd1 gd T cells that functionally converge with overlapping antigen-specific transcriptional programs and clonal expansion of public TCRs. Spatial transcriptomics demonstrated co-localization of T cells with B and dendritic cells, which supply chemokines and co-stimulation. Lastly, ICB significantly increased clonal expansion or recruitment of Trm and Vd1 cells in tumors specifically in responders, underscoring their therapeutic importance. These data identify potential clinically actionable biomarkers and therapeutic targets for MCC.">

        <tr id="The control of bacterial growth is key to the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Granulomas represent independent foci of the host immune response that present heterogeneous capacity for control of bacterial growth. At the whole tissue level, B cells and CD4 or CD8 T cells have an established role in immune protection against TB. Immune cells interact within each granuloma response, but the impact of granuloma immune composition on bacterial replication remains unknown. Here we investigate the associations between immune cell composition, including B cell, CD4, and CD8 T cells, and the state of replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) within the granuloma. A measure of ribosomal RNA synthesis, the RS ratio®, represents a proxy measure of Mtb replication at the whole tissue level. We adapted the RS ratio through use of in situ hybridization, to identify replicating and non-replicating Mtb within each designated granuloma. We applied a regression model to characterize the associations between immune cell populations and the state of Mtb replication within each respective granuloma. In the evaluation of nearly 200 granulomas, we identified heterogeneity in both immune cell composition and proportion of replicating bacteria. We found clear evidence of directional associations between immune cell composition and replicating Mtb. Controlling for vaccination status and endpoint post-infection, granulomas with lower CD4 or higher CD8 cell counts are associated with a higher percent of replicating Mtb. Conversely, changes in B cell proportions were associated with little change in Mtb replication. This study establishes heterogeneity across granulomas, demonstrating that certain immune cell types are differentially associated with control of Mtb replication. These data suggest that evaluation at the granuloma level may be imperative to identifying correlates of immune protection.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Therapy resistance is a major clinical hurdle in bone cancer treatment and seems to be largely driven by poorly understood microenvironmental factors. Recent evidence suggests a critical role for a unique subpopulation of mesenchymal stem cells with inflammatory features (iMSCs), though their origin and function remained unexplored. We demonstrate that cancer-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) trigger the development of iMSCs, which hinder therapy response in vivo, and set out to identify strategies to counteract their function.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The role of iMSCs in therapy resistance was evaluated in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of osteosarcoma. EV-induced alterations of the MSC transcriptome were analyzed and compared with scRNA-seq data of osteosarcoma and multiple myeloma patient biopsies. Functional assays identified EV components driving iMSC development. We assessed the efficacy of clinical drugs in blocking iMSC-induced resistance in vivo.


RESULTS
We found that iMSCs are induced by interaction with cancer EVs and completely abrogate the antimetastatic effect of TGFb signaling inhibition. Importantly, EV-induced iMSCs faithfully recapitulate the inflammatory single-cell RNA signature of stromal cells enriched in multiple myeloma and osteosarcoma patient biopsies. Mechanistically, cancer EVs act through two distinct mechanisms. EV-associated TGFb induces IL6 production, while the EV-RNA cargo enhances TLR3-mediated chemokine production. We reveal that simultaneous blockade of downstream EV-activated pathways with ladarixin and tocilizumab disrupts metastasis formation and overcomes iMSC-induced resistance.


CONCLUSIONS
Our observations establish iMSCs as major contributors to drug resistance, reveal EVs as physiological triggers of iMSC development and highlight a promising combination strategy to improve therapy response in bone cancer patients.">

        <tr id="The mononuclear phagocyte system includes monocytes, macrophages, some dendritic cells, and multinuclear giant cells. These cell populations display marked heterogeneity depending on their differentiation from embryonic and bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors, tissue location, and activation. They contribute to tissue homeostasis by interacting with local and systemic immune and non-immune cells through trophic, clearance, and cytocidal functions. During evolution, they contributed to the innate host defense before effector mechanisms of specific adaptive immunity emerged. Mouse macrophages appear at mid-gestation and are distributed throughout the embryo to facilitate organogenesis and clear cells undergoing programmed cell death. Yolk sac, AGM, and fetal liver-derived tissue-resident macrophages persist throughout postnatal and adult life, supplemented by bone marrow-derived blood monocytes, as required after injury and infection. Nobel awards to Elie Metchnikoff and Paul Ehrlich in 1908 drew attention to cellular phagocytic and humoral immunity, respectively. In 2011, prizes were awarded to Jules Hoffmann and Bruce Beutler for contributions to innate immunity and to Ralph Steinman for the discovery of dendritic cells and their role in antigen presentation to T lymphocytes. We trace milestones in the history of mononuclear phagocyte research from the perspective of Nobel awards bearing directly and indirectly on their role in cellular immunity.">

While DCs are believed to play a pivotal role in generating anti-tumor T-cell responses, the importance of DCs in the protection from the progression of tumors remains elusive. Here, we show how the constitutive deficiency of CD11chi DCs influences the progression of tumors with the use of binary transgenic mice with constitutive loss of CD11chi DCs. Constitutive loss of CD11chi DCs not only enhances the progression of tumors but also reduces the responses of Ag-specific T cells. Furthermore, the congenital deficiency of CD11chi DCs generates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that correlates with the marked accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and the prominent productions of immunosuppressive mediators. Thus, our findings suggest that CD11chi DCs are crucial for generating anti-tumor T-cell responses and immunogenic TME to suppress the development of tumors.">

 Seasonal flu, primarily caused by influenza H1N1 and H3N2 subtype viruses or influenza B viruses, is the most prevalent respiratory tract infection globally and leads to substantial morbidity and mortality annually. Despite the influenza virus being initially recognized as a respiratory pathogen with well-characterized transmission through respiratory droplets, its impact on ocular epithelium and associated gene expression remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional profiles of immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-S) and A549 human lung epithelial cells infected with H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus. In comparison with A549 cells, a reduced number of differentially expressed genes was observed in HCE-S upon influenza virus infection. Specifically, there was a significant upregulation of the genes IFI44L and OAS1, along with lower release of CCL5/RANTES protein. Notably, our findings revealed uniquely upregulated LGALS9 (encoding galectin-9) in HCE-S following infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Furthermore, targeted knockdown of LGALS9 in these cells resulted in a measurable decrease in viral infection, highlighting its role in the cellular responses to influenza virus and suggesting a novel avenue for antiviral therapy. Overall, our findings provide insight into the distinct mechanisms of influenza virus interactions with different epithelial cells and underscore the importance of studying the ocular surface in understanding influenza pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare type of T-lymphocyte malignancy strongly calling for novel therapies. Virotherapy by means of oncolytic viruses that are able to kill cancer cells, while sparing healthy cells, is a promising innovative form of anticancer immunotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of an oncolytic parvovirus, H-1PV, to induce selective killing (oncolysis) of CTCL cells and suppress the growth of CTCL spheroids. We demonstrated that H-1PV treatment led to oncolysis in tumor, but not in control normal cells. Oncolysis ensued despite pro-survival protein overexpression and was associated with the release of danger-signaling molecules. In heterotypic CTCL spheroids, H-1PV induced spheroid growth suppression and, upon co-culturing with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, spheroid infiltration with immune cells. In summary, we gathered the first preclinical data showing that H-1PV holds significant potential to become a novel viroimmunotherapeutic agent against CTCL. Abstract The rat protoparvovirus H-1 (H-1PV) is an oncolytic virus known for its anticancer properties in laboratory models of various human tumors, including non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) of B-cell origin. However, H-1PV therapeutic potential against hematological malignancies of T-cell origin remains underexplored. The aim of the present study was to conduct a pilot preclinical investigation of H-1PV-mediated oncolytic effects in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a type of NHL that is urgently calling for innovative therapies. We demonstrated H-1PV productive infection and induction of oncolysis in both classically grown CTCL suspension cultures and in a novel, in vivo-relevant, heterotypic spheroid model, but not in healthy donor controls, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). H-1PV-mediated oncolysis of CTCL cells was not prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression and was accompanied by increased extracellular ATP release. In CTCL spheroid co-cultures with PBMCs, increased spheroid infiltration with immune cells was detected upon co-culture treatment with the virus. In conclusion, our preclinical data show that H-1PV may hold significant potential as an ingenious viroimmunotherapeutic drug candidate against CTCL.">

        <tr id="Platelets are immune responsive in many diseases as noted by changes in platelet mRNA in conditions such as sepsis1, atherosclerosis2, COVID-193,4, and many other inflammatory and infectious etiologies5. The malaria causing Plasmodium parasite is a persistent public health threat and significant evidence shows that platelets participate in host responses to infection. Using a mouse model of non-lethal/uncomplicated malaria, P. yoelii XNL (PyNL), infected, but not control mouse platelets expressed Ido1, a rate limiting enzyme in tryptophan metabolism that increases kynurenine at the expense of serotonin. Interferon-gamma (IFN) is a potent inducer of Ido1 and mice treated with recombinant IFN had increased platelet Ido1 and IDO1 activity. PyNL infected mice treated with anti-IFN antibody had similar platelet Ido1 and metabolic profiles to that of uninfected controls. PyNL infected mice become thrombocytopenic by day 7 post-infection and transfusion of platelets from IFN treated wild type mice, but not Ido1-/- mice, increased the plasma kynurenine to tryptophan ratio, indicating platelets are a source of post-infection IDO1 activity. We generated platelet specific Ido1 knockout mice to assess the contribution of platelet Ido1 during PyNL infection. Platelet specific Ido1-/- mice had increased death and evidence of lung thrombi which were not present in infected WT mice. Platelet Ido1 may be a significant contributor to plasma KYN in IFN driven immune processes and the loss of platelets may limit total Ido1, leading to immune and vascular dysfunction.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
TIGIT blockade in our ex vivo models of bone marrow (BM) reduced the number of malignant plasma cells (PCs) in only half of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Here we wanted to investigate whether increased expression of TIGIT ligands may inhibit T cell immune response promoting resistance to TIGIT blockade.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We first characterized the number and phenotype of BM macrophages in the different stages of disease by multi-parameter flow cytometry. We assessed the effect of TIGIT ligands on PC survival performing experiments with ex vivo BM model and analyzed changes in gene expression by using Nanostring technology and real-time PCR.


RESULTS
Frequency of BM macrophages was significantly decreased in MM which was accompanied by changes in their immunophenotype. Moreover, we found a higher number of malignant PCs in ex vivo BM cells cultured onto PVR and nectin-2 compared to control, suggesting that both ligands may support PC survival. In addition, presence of PVR, but not nectin-2, overcame the therapeutic effect of TIGIT blockade or exogenous IL-2. Furthermore, presence of exogenous IL-2 increased TIGIT expression on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and, indirectly, PVR on BM macrophages. Consistently, PVR reduced the number of cytotoxic T cells and promoted a gene signature with reduced effector molecules.


CONCLUSIONS
IL-2 induced TIGIT on T cells in the BM where increased PVR expression resulted in cytotoxic T cell inhibition promoting PC survival and resistance to TIGIT blockade.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a prominent role in utero tolerating non-inherited maternal antigens and in regulating immune responses against pathogens at birth. This study investigates Treg immunity in newborns in West Africa, where sepsis remains a major public health problem. Treg phenotypes on neonates subgroups with early-onset sepsis (EOS), presumed sepsis, and healthy newborn with and without prenatal risk factors were evaluated. Treg phenotypes varied according to prenatal conditions, with increase in Treg frequency and Foxp3 expression in healthy newborns with prenatal risk factors compared to those with none risk. Compared to healthy newborns with prenatal risk factors, EOS neonates had a significantly reduced frequency of Treg and Foxp3 expression. In the Treg pool, higher frequency of activated Treg was observed in EOS neonates, suggesting an in-utero activation upstream of the sepsis onset. Their migration to the infection site may explain the reduced frequency of circulating Integrin α4β1+ Treg suggestive of homing to the endothelial tissue. EOS neonates show increases expression of CTLA-4, PD-1 and CD39 on Treg, which negatively regulate the activation of effector T cells (Teff) corroborating by the lower frequency of Teff in EOS neonates. The higher frequency of CD39+ Treg and the lower frequency of integrinα4β1+ Treg in EOS non-survivor suggests that Treg exhaustement and endothelial homing are associated with outcome severity. Neonates developing EOS are born with an altered Treg phenotypic profile. Treg expression of CTLA-4, PD-1, CD39, and integrinα4β1 cell markers can be considered as early warning or diagnostic markers of EOS.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Macrophages are the primary innate immune cells encountered by the invading coronaviruses, and their abilities to initiate inflammatory reactions, to maintain the immunity homeostasis by differential polarization, to train the innate immune system by epigenic modification have been reported in laboratory animal research.


METHODS
In the current in vitro research, murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell were infected by mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus existed in mouse. At 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 48-h post infection (hpi.), the attached cells were washed with PBS and harvested in Trizol reagent. Then The harvest is subjected to transcriptome sequencing.


RESULTS
The transcriptome analysis showed the immediate (3 hpi.) up regulation of DEGs related to inflammation, like Il1b and Il6. DEGs related to M2 differential polarization, like Irf4 showed up regulation at 24 hpi., the late term after viral infection. In addition, DEGs related to metabolism and histone modification, like Ezh2 were detected, which might correlate with the trained immunity of macrophages.


CONCLUSIONS
The current in vitro viral infection study showed the key innated immunity character of macrophages, which suggested the replacement value of viral infection cells model, to reduce the animal usage in preclinical research.">

By generating large numbers of effector/memory and terminal differentiated effector memory CD8+ T cells with diminished naïve subsets, memory inflation is believed to play critical roles in connecting the viral infection and the onset of multiple diseases. Here, we reviewed the current understanding of memory inflated CD8+ T cells in their distinct phenotypic features that different from exhausted subsets; the intrinsic and extrinsic roles in regulating the formation of memory inflation; and the key proteins in maintaining the expansion and proliferation of inflationary populations. More importantly, based on the evidences from both clinic and animal models, we summarized the potential mechanisms of memory inflation to trigger autoimmune neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and multiple sclerosis; the correlations of memory inflation between tumorigenesis and resistance of tumour immunotherapies; as well as the effects of memory inflation to facilitate vascular disease progression. To sum up, better understanding of memory inflation could provide us an opportunity to beyond the acute phase of viral infection, and shed a light on the long-term influences of CD8+ T cell heterogeneity in dampen host immune homeostasis.">

        <tr id="The occurrence of chronic inflammation resulting from infection with human papillomaviruses is an important factor in the development of cervical cancer (CC); thus, deciphering the crosstalk between the tumor microenvironment and innate immune cells during the establishment of immune tolerance is vital for identifying potential treatment strategies.Single-cell RNA sequencing data and primary tumor samples from patients with CC were used to evaluate the functional role of Siglec-10 on dendritic cells (DCs). Patient-derived tumor fragment platforms were used to examine the ability of Siglec-10 blockade to reinvigorate DC-mediate T-cell activation and tumor clearance.Here, we demonstrated that Siglec-10 is a prominent inhibitory checkpoint for DCs infiltrated in CC. CC epithelial cells use their aberrant surface sialylated structures to induce the transformation of conventional DCs into phenotypes characterized by low immunogenicity and high immunotolerance. Additionally, Siglec-10+DCs suppress the function of adaptive T cells via galectin-9 signaling to strengthen the immunosuppressive CC microenvironment. Disturbance of Siglec-10 signaling restored the DC-mediated tumoricidal response and increased adaptive T cells sensitivity to programmed cell death protein 1 inhibition.Our study confirms the checkpoint role of Siglec-10 on DCs and proposes that targeting Siglec-10 may be a promising avenue for immunotherapy against CC.">

 The increased incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, occurring in patients infected with severe influenza or SARS-CoV-2, suggests that antiviral immune responses create an environment permissive to fungal infection. Our recent evidence suggests that absence of the type I IFN receptor 2 subunit (IFNAR2) of the heterodimeric IFNAR1/2 receptor is allowing for this permissive immune environment of the lung through regulation of damage responses. Because damage is associated with poor outcome to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, this suggested that IFNAR2 may be involved in A. fumigatus susceptibility. In this study, we determined that absence of IFNAR2 resulted in increased inflammation, morbidity, and damage in the lungs in response to A. fumigatus challenge, whereas absence of IFNAR1 did not. Although the Ifnar2−/− mice had increased morbidity, we found that the Ifnar2−/− mice cleared more conidia compared with both wild-type and Ifnar1−/− mice. However, this early clearance did not prevent invasive disease from developing in the Ifnar2−/− mice as infection progressed. Importantly, by altering the inflamed environment of the Ifnar2−/− mice early during A. fumigatus infection, by neutralizing TNF-α, we were able to reduce the morbidity and fungal clearance in these mice back to wild-type levels. Together, our results establish a distinct role for IFNAR2 in regulating host damage responses to A. fumigatus and contributing to an A. fumigatus–permissive environment through regulation of inflammation. Specifically, our data reveal a role for IFNAR2 in regulating TNF-α–mediated damage and morbidity during A. fumigatus infection.">

The signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) promotes protective immunity and autoimmunity downstream of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and IL-23. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), Stat4-/- mice are resistant to the development of inflammation and paralysis. To define whether STAT4 is required for intrinsic signaling in mature DC function, we used conditional mutant mice in the EAE model. Deficiency of STAT4 in CD11c-expressing cells resulted in decreased T cell priming and inflammation in the central nervous system. EAE susceptibility was recovered following adoptive transfer of wild-type bone marrow-derived DCs to mice with STAT4-deficient DCs, but not adoptive transfer of STAT4- or IL-23R-deficient DCs. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) identified STAT4-dependent genes in DC subsets that paralleled a signature in MS patient DCs. Together, these data define an IL-23-STAT4 pathway in DCs that is key to DC function during inflammatory disease.">

Conversely, the elimination of senescent cells enhances the body's regenerative and reparative capacity, thereby retarding the aging process. Here, we present a brief overview of 12 Hallmarks of aging and subsequently emphasize the potential of immune checkpoint blockade, innate immune cell therapy (including T cells, iNKT cells, macrophages, and NK cells), as well as CAR-T cell therapy for inducing and augmenting immune responses aimed at eliminating senescent cells.

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), is a major global health issue, with around 10 million new cases annually. Advances in TB immunology have improved our understanding of host signaling pathways, leading to innovative therapeutic strategies. Inflammasomes, protein complexes organized by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), play a crucial role in the immune response to M. tb by activating caspase 1, which matures proinflammatory cytokines IL1β and IL18. While inflammation is necessary to fight infection, excessive or dysregulated inflammation can cause tissue damage, highlighting the need for precise inflammasome regulation. Drug-resistant TB strains have spurred research into adjunctive host-directed therapies (HDTs) that target inflammasome pathways to control inflammation. Canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pathways can trigger excessive inflammation, leading to immune system exhaustion and M. tb spread. Novel HDT interventions can leverage precision medicine by tailoring treatments to individual inflammasome responses. Studies show that medicinal plant derivatives like silybin, andrographolide, and micheliolide and small molecules such as OLT1177, INF39, CY-09, JJ002, Ac-YVAD-cmk, TAK-242, and MCC950 can modulate inflammasome activation. Molecular tools like gene silencing and knockouts may also be used for severe TB cases. This review explores these strategies as potential adjunctive HDTs in fighting TB.">

 We demonstrate the role of signaling via the glucocorticoid receptor, NR3C1, in differentiation of CD8+ T cell memory. Pharmacological inhibition as well as the short hairpin RNA–mediated knockdown of the receptor hindered memory transition and limited the homeostatic turnover of the activated CD8+ T cells. Dexamethasone exposure of CD8+ T cells expanded during a resolving infection with influenza A virus or a γ-herpesvirus promoted conversion of effector cells into memory cells by modulating cellular metabolism and lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Reduced reactive oxygen species levels in the responding effector cells upregulated Bcl2 and enhanced survival. The generated virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells were efficiently recalled following challenge of animals with a secondary infection to control it better. The memory-enhancing effect was predominantly evident at low doses of dexamethasone.

        <tr id="The success of immunotherapy for cancer treatment is limited by the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME); Therefore, identifying novel targets to that can reverse this immunosuppressive TME and enhance immunotherapy efficacy is essential. In this study, enrichment analysis based on publicly available single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data from gastric cancer patients are conducted, and found that tumor-intrinsic interferon (IFN) plays a central role in TME regulation. The results shows that KDM3A over-expression suppresses the tumor-intrinsic IFN response and inhibits KDM3A, either genomically or pharmacologically, which effectively promotes IFN responses by activating endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). KDM3A ablation reconfigures the dsRNA-MAVS-IFN axis by modulating H3K4me2, enhancing the infiltration and function of CD8 T cells, and simultaneously reducing the presence of regulatory T cells, resulting in a reshaped TME in vivo. In addition, combining anti-PD1 therapy with KDM3A inhibition effectively inhibited tumor growth. In conclusions, this study highlights KDM3A as a potential target for TME remodeling and the enhancement of antitumor immunity in gastric cancer through the regulation of the ERV-MAVS-IFN axis.">

 Studying viral infections necessitates well-designed cell culture models to deepen our understanding of diseases and develop effective treatments. In this study, we present a readily available
 ex vivo
 3D co-culture model replicating the human intestinal mucosa. The model combines fully differentiated human intestinal epithelium (HIE) with human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) and faithfully mirrors the
 in vivo
 structural and organizational properties of intestinal mucosal tissues. Specifically, it mimics the lamina propria, basement membrane, and the air-exposed epithelial layer, enabling the pioneering observation of macrophage migration through the tissue to the site of viral infection. In this study, we applied the HIE-hMDMs model for the first time in viral infection studies, infecting the model with two globally significant viruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human norovirus GII.4. The results demonstrate the model’s capability to support the replication of both viruses and show the antiviral role of macrophages, determined by their migration to the infection site and subsequent direct contact with infected epithelial cells. In addition, we evaluated the production of cytokines and chemokines in the intestinal niche, observing an increased interleukin-8 production during infection. A parallel comparison using a classical
 in vitro
 cell line model comprising Caco-2 and THP-1 cells for SARS-CoV-2 experiments confirmed the utility of the HIE-hMDMs model in viral infection studies. Our data show that the
 ex vivo
 tissue models hold important implications for advances in virology research.




 The fabrication of intricate
 ex vivo
 tissue models holds important implications for advances in virology research. The co-culture model presented here provides distinct spatial and functional attributes not found in simplified models, enabling the evaluation of macrophage dynamics under severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and human norovirus (HuNoV) infections in the intestine. Moreover, these models, comprised solely of primary cells, facilitate the study of difficult-to-replicate viruses such as HuNoV, which cannot be studied in cell line models, and offer the opportunity for personalized treatment evaluations using patient cells. Similar co-cultures have been established for the study of bacterial infections and different characteristics of the intestinal tissue. However, to the best of our knowledge, a similar intestinal model for the study of viral infections has not been published before.

        <tr id="Metabolic reprogramming is a k`ey hallmark of tumors, developed in response to hypoxia and nutrient deficiency during tumor progression. In both cancer and immune cells, there is a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, which then leads to lactate acidification, increased lipid synthesis, and glutaminolysis. This reprogramming facilitates tumor immune evasion and, within the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer and immune cells collaborate to create a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The growing interest in the metabolic reprogramming of the TME, particularly its significance in colorectal cancer (CRC)—one of the most prevalent cancers—has prompted us to explore this topic. CRC exhibits abnormal glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and increased lipid synthesis. Acidosis in CRC cells hampers the activity of anti-tumor immune cells and inhibits the phagocytosis of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), while nutrient deficiency promotes the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages. In CRC cells, activation of G-protein coupled receptor 81 (GPR81) signaling leads to overexpression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and reduces the antigen presentation capability of dendritic cells. Moreover, the genetic and epigenetic cell phenotype, along with the microbiota, significantly influence CRC metabolic reprogramming. Activating RAS mutations and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) occur in approximately 50% and 80% of patients, respectively, stimulating glycolysis and increasing levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) and MYC proteins. Certain bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which activate CD8+ cells and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, while other mechanisms support pro-tumor activities. The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in selected CRC patients has shown promise, and the combination of these with drugs that inhibit aerobic glycolysis is currently being intensively researched to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
The metabolic characteristics of liver cancer drive considerable hurdles to immune cells function and cancer immunotherapy. However, how metabolic reprograming in the tumour microenvironment impairs the antitumour immune response remains unclear.


DESIGN
Human samples and multiple murine models were employed to evaluate the correlation between GPR109A and liver cancer progression. GPR109A knockout mice, immune cells depletion and primary cell coculture models were used to determine the regulation of GPR109A on tumour microenvironment and identify the underlying mechanism responsible for the formation of intratumour GPR109A+myeloid cells.


RESULTS
We demonstrate that glutamine shortage in liver cancer tumour microenvironment drives an immunosuppressive GPR109A+myeloid cells infiltration, leading to the evasion of immune surveillance. Blockade of GPR109A decreases G-MDSCs and M2-like TAMs abundance to trigger the antitumour responses of CD8+ T cells and further improves the immunotherapy efficacy against liver cancer. Mechanistically, tumour cells and tumour-infiltrated myeloid cells compete for glutamine uptake via the transporter SLC1A5 to control antitumour immunity, which disrupts the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homoeostasis and induces unfolded protein response of myeloid cells to promote GPR109A expression through IRE1α/XBP1 pathway. The restriction of glutamine uptake in liver cancer cells, as well as the blockade of IRE1α/XBP1 signalling or glutamine supplementation, can eliminate the immunosuppressive effects of GPR109A+ myeloid cells and slow down tumour progression.


CONCLUSION
Our findings identify the immunometabolic crosstalk between liver cancer cells and myeloid cells facilitates tumour progression via a glutamine metabolism/ER stress/GPR109A axis, suggesting that GPR109A can be exploited as an immunometabolic checkpoint and putative target for cancer treatment.">

Perplexingly, innate cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-12, are also associated with rejection of organ transplants. However, the pathways of innate immune activation in allogeneic transplantation are unclear. While the role of microbial and cell death products has been previously described, we identified alloreactive memory CD4 T cells as the primary triggers of innate inflammation. Memory CD4 T cells engaged MHC II-mismatched dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the production of innate inflammatory cytokines. This innate inflammation was independent of several pattern recognition receptors and was primarily driven by TNF superfamily ligands expressed by alloreactive memory CD4 T cells. Blocking of CD40L and TNFα resulted in dampened inflammation, and mice genetically deficient in these molecules exhibited prolonged survival of cardiac allografts. Furthermore, myeloid cell and CD8 T cell infiltration into cardiac transplants was compromised in both CD40L- and TNFα-deficient recipients. Strikingly, we found that priming of naive alloreactive CD8 T cells was dependent on licensing of DCs by memory CD4 T cells. This study unravels the key mechanisms by which alloreactive memory CD4 T cells contribute to destructive pathology and transplant rejection.">

IL-15 stimulation of CD8α– NK cells induced CD8α expression via the RUNX3 transcription factor, driving formation of a unique induced CD8α (iCD8α+) population. iCD8α+ NK cells displayed higher proliferation, metabolic activity, and antitumor cytotoxic function compared with preexisting CD8α+ and CD8α– subsets.

While apoptosis has been extensively studied in CD4+ T cell depletion, recent research has highlighted the significant role of necroptosis, a regulated form of necrosis, in this process. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) has emerged as a central player in necroptosis, regulating both cell death and inflammatory responses. This review delves into the intricate mechanisms by which RIPK1 orchestrates necroptosis in CD4+ T cells during HIV infection. We explore the structural intricacies of RIPK1, its interactions with other signaling molecules, and the downstream events that culminate in necroptotic cell death. Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting RIPK1 to mitigate CD4+ T cell loss and control HIV disease progression. Understanding the multifaceted role of RIPK1 in HIV-induced necroptosis may pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions to combat this devastating disease.">

Spleen pathology begins at the marginal zone (MZ), apparent by 2 d postinfection (dpi), and progresses throughout the red pulp by 4 dpi. To better understand how M.R2k/b mice respond to infection and how Cmv5s contributes to tissue damage in the spleen, we assessed the regulation of myeloid cells and inflammation during acute MCMV infection in MA/My and M.R2k/b mice. We found that Cmv5s drove increased neutrophil accumulation and cell death at the MZ, which corresponded with evidence of localized oxidative stress and increased overall spleen IL-6 and TGF-β1 early during infection. Further assessment of MCMV infection dynamics at the early MZ revealed infected SIGNR1+ MZ macrophages as the first apparent cell type lost during infection in these mice and the likely target of early neutrophil recruitment. Spleen macrophages were also identified as the mediators of differential spleen IL-6 and TGF-β1 between MA/My and M.R2k/b mice. Interrogation of MCMV progression past 2 dpi revealed substantial M.R2k/b F480+ red pulp macrophage loss along with buildup of oxidative stress and MZ macrophage debris that was not neutrophil dependent.

The innate immune response, the host's primary defense against viral infection, plays a pivotal role and has become a breakthrough in research mechanisms. A component of the innate immune system, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are involved in inducing inflammatory responses to viral infections. Numerous DAMPs are released from virally infected cells, activating downstream signaling pathways via internal and external receptors on immune cells. This activation triggers immune responses and helps regulate viral host invasion. This review examines the immune regulatory mechanisms of various DAMPs, such as the S100 protein family, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and heat shock proteins, in various viral infections to provide a theoretical basis for designing novel antiviral drugs.">

While targeting this process can influence various hallmarks of cancer, the immunomodulatory effects of iron chelation in the tumor microenvironment are unknown. Here, we report that treatment with deferiprone, an FDA-approved iron chelator, unleashes innate immune responses that restrain ovarian cancer. Deferiprone reprogrammed ovarian cancer cells towards an immunostimulatory state characterized by production of type I interferon (IFN) and overexpression of molecules that activate natural killer (NK) cells. Mechanistically, these effects were driven by innate sensing of mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol and concomitant activation of nuclear DNA damage responses triggered upon iron chelation. Deferiprone synergized with chemotherapy and prolonged the survival of mice with ovarian cancer by bolstering type I IFN responses that drove NK cell-dependent control of metastatic disease. Hence, iron chelation may represent an alternative immunotherapeutic strategy for malignancies that are refractory to current T cell-centric modalities.">

        <tr id="Infection by bacteria leads to tissue damage and inflammation, which need to be tightly controlled by host mechanisms to avoid deleterious consequences. It is previously reported that TMEM16F, a calcium-activated lipid scramblase expressed in various immune cell types including T cells and neutrophils, is critical for the control of infection by bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) in vivo. This function correlated with the capacity of TMEM16F to repair the plasma membrane (PM) damage induced in T cells in vitro, by the Lm toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). However, whether the protective effect of TMEM16F on Lm infection in vivo is mediated by an impact in T cells, or in other cell types, is not determined. Herein, the immune cell types and mechanisms implicated in the protective effect of TMEM16F against Lm in vivo are elucidated. Cellular protective effects of TMEM16F correlated with its capacity of lipid scrambling and augment PM fluidity. Using cell type-specific TMEM16F-deficient mice, the indication is obtained that TMEM16F expressed in liver Kupffer cells (KCs), but not in T cells or B cells, is key for protection against Listeria in vivo. In the absence of TMEM16F, Listeria induced PM rupture and fragmentation of KCs in vivo. KC death associated with greater liver damage, inflammatory changes, and dysregulated liver metabolism. Overall, the results uncovered that TMEM16F expressed in Kupffer cells is crucial to protect the host against Listeria infection. This influence is associated with the capacity of Kupffer cell-expressed TMEM16F to prevent excessive inflammation and abnormal liver metabolism.">

This review synthesizes current knowledge on the mechanisms, clinical implications, and therapeutic strategies concerning gut mucosal immunity in HIV-exposed infants. The gut mucosa serves as a critical site for immune maturation and defense against pathogens, but HIV infection disrupts this delicate balance, leading to compromised immune function and increased susceptibility to infections.  Infants born to HIV-positive mothers experience unique challenges in gut mucosal immunity due to vertical transmission of the virus and exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV infection disrupts gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), resulting in early depletion of CD4+ T cells and compromised mucosal barrier function. These alterations contribute to microbial translocation, chronic inflammation, and immune dysregulation, impacting overall immune competence and increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Despite advances in ART, persistent immune activation and residual gut mucosal damage pose ongoing challenges in achieving optimal immune reconstitution and preventing long-term complications in HIV-exposed infants. Clinical implications of compromised gut mucosal immunity in HIV-exposed infants extend beyond gastrointestinal health to encompass systemic immune dysfunction and increased risks of non-AIDS comorbidities. Impaired gut barrier function exacerbates microbial translocation, leading to systemic inflammation that may contribute to neurodevelopmental abnormalities and metabolic disorders.

        <tr id="Introduction
Genetic mutations in critical nodes of pulmonary epithelial function are linked to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and other interstitial lung diseases. The slow progression of these pathologies is often intermitted and accelerated by acute exacerbations, complex non-resolving cycles of inflammation and parenchymal damage, resulting in lung function decline and death. Excess monocyte mobilization during the initial phase of an acute exacerbation, and their long-term persistence in the lung, is linked to poor disease outcome.


Methods
The present work leverages a clinical idiopathic PF dataset and a murine model of acute inflammatory exacerbations triggered by mutation in the alveolar type-2 cell-restricted Surfactant Protein-C [SP-C] gene to spatially and phenotypically define monocyte/macrophage changes in the fibrosing lung.


Results
SP-C mutation triggered heterogeneous CD68+ macrophage activation, with highly active peri-injured cells relative to those sampled from fully remodeled and healthy regions. Ingenuity pathway analysis of sorted CD11b-SigF+CD11c+ alveolar macrophages defined asynchronous activation of extracellular matrix re-organization, cellular mobilization, and Apolipoprotein E (Apoe) signaling in the fibrosing lung. Cell-cell communication analysis of single cell sequencing datasets predicted pro-fibrogenic signaling (fibronectin/Fn1, osteopontin/Spp1, and Tgfb1) emanating from Trem2/TREM2 + interstitial macrophages. These cells also produced a distinct lipid signature from alveolar macrophages and monocytes, characterized by Apoe expression. Mono- and di-allelic genetic deletion of ApoE in SP-C mutant mice had limited impact on inflammation and mortality up to 42 day after injury.


Discussion
Together, these results provide a detailed spatio-temporal picture of resident, interstitial, and monocyte-derived macrophages during SP-C induced inflammatory exacerbations and end-stage clinical PF, and propose ApoE as a biomarker to identify activated macrophages involved in tissue remodeling.">

        <tr id="Chronic viral infections cause thymic involution yet the potential for broader, longer-term impact on thymic composition remains unexplored. Here we show that chronic, but not acute, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection promotes a unique population of immature B cells in the thymus. We show that chronic viral infection promotes signals within the thymus, including the expression of B-cell activating factor (BAFF), that favor the maturation of this population as these cells acquire expression of CD19 and immunoglobulin M. Mechanistically, type I interferon (IFN-I), predominantly IFNβ, signals to thymic hematopoietic cells, strongly delaying T-cell development at the earliest precursor stage. Furthermore, IFN-I signaling to the nonhematopoietic compartment provides a second signal essential to favor B-cell differentiation and maturation within the thymus. Importantly, chronic infection yields changes in the B-cell population for at least 50 days following infection, long after thymic atrophy has subsided. Thus, the inflammatory milieu induced by chronic viral infection has a profound, and long-lasting, effect on thymic composition leading to the generation of a novel population of thymic B cells.">

        <tr id="Th1 and Th2 cytokines determine the outcome of Leishmania major infection and immune protection depends mainly on memory T cells induced during vaccination. This largely hinges on the nature and type of memory T cells produced. In this study, transgenic Leishmania major strains expressing membrane-associated ovalbumin (mOVA) and soluble ovalbumin (sOVA) were used as a model to study whether fully differentiated Th1/Th2 and Th17 cells can recall immune memory and tolerate pathogen manipulation. Naïve OT-II T cells were polarised in vitro into Th1/Th2 cells, and these cells were transferred adoptively into recipient mice. Following the transferral of the memory cells, the recipient mice were challenged with OVA transgenic Leishmania major and a wild-type parasite was used a control. The in vitro-polarised T helper cells continued to produce the same cytokine signatures after being challenged by both forms of OVA-expressing Leishmania major parasites in vivo. This suggests that antigen-experienced cells remain the same or unaltered in the face of OVA-transgenic Leishmania major. Such ability of these antigen-experienced cells to remain resilient to manipulation by the parasite signifies that vaccines might be able to produce immune memory responses and defend against parasitic immune manipulation in order to protect the host from infection.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy is developing as the mainstream strategy for treatment of cancer. However, the interaction between the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) restricts T cell proliferation, resulting in the immune escape of tumor cells. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy has achieved clinical success in tumor treatment through blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint pathway. However, the presence of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) will inhibit antitumor immune responses and facilitate tumor growth, which can weaken the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The repolarization of M2 TAMs into M1 TAMs can induce the immune response to secrete proinflammatory factors and active T cells to attack tumor cells. Herein, hollow iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared for reprogramming M2 TAMs into M1 TAMs. BMS-202, a small-molecule PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor that has a lower price, higher stability, lower immunogenicity, and higher tumor penetration ability compared with antibodies, was loaded together with pH-sensitive NaHCO3 inside hollow Fe3O4 NPs, followed by wrapping with macrophage membranes. The formed biomimetic FBN@M could produce gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) from NaHCO3 in response to the acidic TME, breaking up the macrophage membranes to release BMS-202. A series of in vitro and in vivo assessments revealed that FBN@M could reprogram M2 TAMs into M1 TAMs and block the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, which eventually induced T cell activation and the secretion of TNF-α and IFN-γ to kill the tumor cells. FBN@M has shown a significant immunotherapeutic efficacy for tumor treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction Granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) show fast recovery following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) constituting the major part of peripheral blood in the early phase. Although G-MDSCs mediate immune suppression through multiple mechanisms, they may also promote inflammation under specific conditions. Methods G-MDSCs were isolated from 82 patients following allo-HSCT within 90 days after allo-HSCT, and their interactions with autologous CD3+ T-cells were examined. T-cell proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry following CFSE staining, while differentiation and interferon-γ secretion were characterized using chemokine receptor profiling and ELISpot assays, respectively. NK cell cytotoxicity was evaluated through co-culture with K562 cells. An aGVHD xenogeneic model in humanized mice was employed to study the in vivo effects of human leukocytes. Furthermore, transcriptional alterations in G-MDSCs were analyzed via RNA sequencing to investigate functional transitions. Results G-MDSCs promoted inflammation in the early-stage, by facilitating cytokine secretion and proliferation of T cells, as well as their differentiation into pro-inflammatory T helper subsets. At day 28, patients with a higher number of G-MDSCs exhibited an increased risk of developing grades II-IV aGvHD. Besides, adoptive transfer of G-MDSCs from patients at day 28 into humanized mice exacerbated aGvHD. However, at day 90, G-MDSCs led to immunosuppression, characterized by upregulated expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase gene and interleukin-10 secretion, coupled with the inhibition of T cell proliferation. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis of G-MDSCs at day 28 and day 90 revealed that 1445 genes were differentially expressed. These genes were associated with various pathways, revealing the molecular signatures of early post-transplant differentiation in G-MDSCs. In addition, genes linked to the endoplasmic reticulum stress were upregulated in patients without aGvHD. The acquisition of immunosuppressive function by G-MDSCs may depend on the activation of CXCL2 and DERL1 genes. Conclusion Our findings revealed the alteration in the immune characteristics of G-MDSCs within the first 90 days post-allo-HSCT. Moreover, the quantity of G-MDSCs at day 28 may serve as a predictive indicator for the development of aGvHD.">

        <tr id="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an orphan neurodegenerative disease. Immune system dysregulation plays an essential role in ALS onset and progression. Our preclinical studies have shown that the administration of exogenous allogeneic B cells improves outcomes in murine models of skin and brain injury through a process termed pligodraxis, in which B cells adopt an immunoregulatory and neuroprotective phenotype in an injured environment. Here, we investigated the effects of B-cell therapy in the SOD1G93A mouse preclinical model of ALS and in a person living with ALS. Purified splenic mature naïve B cells from haploidentical donor mice were administered intravenously in SOD1G93A mice for a total of 10 weekly doses. For the clinical study in a person with advanced ALS, IgA gammopathy of unclear significance, and B lymphopenia, CD19+ B cells were positively selected from a healthy haploidentical donor and infused intravenously twice, at a 60-day interval. Repeated intravenous B-cell administration was safe and significantly delayed disease onset, extended survival, reduced cellular apoptosis, and decreased astrogliosis in SOD1G93A mice. Repeated B-cell infusion in a person with ALS was safe and did not appear to generate a clinically evident inflammatory response. An improvement of 5 points on the ALSFRS-R scale was observed after the first infusion. Levels of inflammatory markers showed persistent reduction post-infusion. This represents a first demonstration of the efficacy of haploidentical B-cell infusion in the SOD1G93A mouse and the safety and feasibility of using purified haploidentical B lymphocytes as a cell-based therapeutic strategy for a person with ALS.">

 As a major immune cell type in the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) secrete suppressive factors that can inhibit anti-tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. One approach trying to utilize macrophages for immunotherapy has been to block the CD47-SIRPα axis, which mediates inhibitory signaling, to promote phagocytosis of tumor cells. Many CD47-targeted agents, namely anti-CD47 antibodies and SIRPα fusion proteins, were associated with a diverse spectrum of toxicities which limit their use in clinical settings. Universal expression of CD47 also leads to a severe ‘antigen sink’ effect of CD47-targeted agents. Given that the CD47 receptor, SIRPα, has a more restricted expression profile and may have CD47-independent functions, targeting SIRPα is considered to have distinct advantages in improving clinical efficacy with a better safety profile.



 We have developed ES004-B5, a potentially best-in-class pan-allelic human SIRPα blocking antibody using hybridoma technology.



 ES004-B5 binds to major human SIRPα variants through a unique epitope with high affinity. By blocking CD47-induced inhibitory “don’t eat me” signaling, ES004-B5 exerts superior anti-tumor activity in combination with anti-TAA antibodies in vitro and in vivo. Unlike CD47-targeted agents, ES004-B5 exhibits an excellent safety profile in non-human primates.



 ES004-B5 has potential to be an important backbone for SIRPα-based combination therapy and/or bispecific antibodies, which will likely overcome the limitations of CD47-targeted agents encountered in clinical settings.
 Statement of significance

Beyond the canonical role in defense against pathogens, the extrusion of NETs also contributes to the initiation, metastasis, and therapeutic response of malignant diseases. Recently, NETs have been implicated in the development and therapeutic responses of various types of tumors. Although extensive work regarding inflammation in tumors has been reported, a comprehensive summary of how these web‐like extracellular structures initiate and propagate tumor progression under the specific microenvironment is lacking. In this review, we demonstrate the initiators and related signaling pathways that trigger NETs formation in cancers. Additionally, this review will outline the current molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of NETs during dormant cancer cells awakening, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) extravasation, and metastatic recurrence of cancer. This is followed by a perspective on the current and potential clinical potential of NETs as therapeutic targets in the treatment of both local and metastatic disease, including the improvement of the efficacy of existing therapies.">

        <tr id="Conventional CD4+ T lymphocytes consist of naïve, foreign antigen-specific memory, and self-antigen-driven memory-phenotype (MP) cell compartments at homeostasis. We recently showed that MP cells tonically proliferate in response to self-antigens and differentiate into the T-bet+ subset in steady state. How excess proliferation and differentiation of MP cells are inhibited remains unclear. Given immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), it is possible that they are also involved in inhibition of spontaneous MP cell activation. Here we show using Foxp3-diphtheria toxin receptor-transgenic mice that both MP and naïve CD4+ T cells spontaneously proliferate and differentiate into Th1 cells upon acute Treg depletion. At an early time point post Treg depletion, MP as compared to naïve CD4+ T cells are preferentially activated while at a later stage, the response is dominated by activated cells originated from the naïve pool. Moreover, we argue that MP cell proliferation is driven by TCR and CD28 signaling whereas Th1 differentiation mediated by IL-2. Furthermore, our data indicate that such activation of MP and naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes contribute to development of multi-organ inflammation at early and later time points, respectively, after Treg ablation. Together our findings reveal that Tregs tonically inhibit early, spontaneous proliferation and Th1 differentiation of MP CD4+ T lymphocytes as well as late activation of naïve cells, thereby contributing to maintenance of T cell homeostasis.">

 Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States. As an STI, C. trachomatis infections can cause inflammatory damage to the female reproductive tract and downstream sequelae including infertility. No vaccine currently exists to C. trachomatis, which evades sterilizing immune responses in its human host. A better understanding of this evasion will greatly benefit the production of anti-Chlamydia therapeutics and vaccination strategies. This minireview will discuss a single branch of the immune system which activates in response to genital Chlamydia infection: so-called “cell-autonomous immunity” activated by the cytokine interferon-gamma. We will also discuss the mechanisms by which human and mouse-adapted Chlamydia species evade cell-autonomous immune responses in their native hosts. This minireview will examine five pathways of host defense and their evasion: I) depletion of tryptophan and other nutrients, II) immunity-related GTPase-mediated defense, III) production of nitric oxide, IV) IFNγ-induced cell death, and V) RNF213-mediated destruction of inclusions.">

        <tr id="Chronic inflammatory milieu in the tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to the recruitment and differentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs, which are phenotypically and morphologically defined as a subset of neutrophils, cause major immune suppression in the TME, posing a significant challenge in the development of effective immunotherapies. Despite recent advances in our understanding of PMN-MDSC functions, the mechanism that gives rise to immunosuppressive neutrophils within the TME remains elusive. Both in vivo and in vitro, newly recruited neutrophils into the tumor sites remained activated and highly motile for several days and developed immunosuppressive phenotypes, as indicated by increased arginase 1 (Arg1) and dcTrail-R1 expression and suppressed anticancer CD8 T cell cytotoxicity. The strong suppressive function was successfully recapitulated by incubating naive neutrophils with cancer cell culture supernatant in vitro. Cancer metabolite secretome analyses of the culture supernatant revealed that both murine and human cancers released lipid mediators to induce the differentiation of immunosuppressive neutrophils. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) lipidomic analysis identified platelet-activation factor (PAF; 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) as a common tumor-derived lipid mediator that induces neutrophil differentiation. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPCAT2), the PAF biosynthetic enzyme, is up-regulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and shows an unfavorable correlation with patient survival across multiple cancer types. Our study identifies PAF as a lipid-driven mechanism of MDSC differentiation in the TME, providing a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic Gram-negative bacterium representing one of the leading causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The development of pneumonia results from a complex interplay between pathogens and pulmonary innate mucosal immunity. Therefore, the knowledge of the host immune responses is pivotal for the development of effective therapeutics to treat A. baumannii infections. Previous studies were conducted using cell lines and animal models, but a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between A. baumannii and primary human immune cells is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we investigated the response of primary monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells to the A. baumannii-type strain and an epidemic clinical isolate. We found that all immune cells trigger different responses when interacting with A. baumannii. In particular, macrophages and monocytes mediate bacterial clearance, whereas monocytes and dendritic cells activate a late response through the production of cytokines, chemokines, and the expression of co-stimulatory molecules. The epidemic strain induces lower expression of interleukin-10 and CD80 compared with the type strain, potentially constituting two immune evasion strategies.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has achieved important clinical advances in several types of tumors, particularly via targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. However, existing therapeutic strategies that suppress the PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway usually experience low treatment efficacy and the risk of causing autoimmune diseases. Herein, we report a cancer cell-targeted molecularly imprinted lysosomal nanodegrader (MILND) for boosting immune checkpoint blockade therapy against tumors. The MILND, imprinted with the N-terminal epitope of PD-L1 as an imprinting template, could specifically target the PD-L1 on tumor cells to promote cellular uptake. This process further induces the transport of PD-L1 into lysosomes for degradation, ultimately resulting in the downregulation of PD-L1 expression levels on tumor cells. As a result, a T cell-mediated immune response in the body was activated via the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway, which triggered a durable antitumor efficacy. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the MILND could effectively accumulate in tumor sites and exhibit strong tumor growth suppression efficacy in a xenograft tumor model without obvious side effects. Therefore, the MILND provides not only a promising strategy for boosting cancer immunotherapy but also insights for developing molecular imprinting-empowered nanomedicines.">

        <tr id="Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presents a global health challenge, characterized by significant morbidity and mortality. However, the role of natural killer T (NKT) cells in human ARDS remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study explored the numerical and functional status of NKT cells in patients with ARDS, examining their clinical relevance and interactions with macrophages and fibroblasts during various stages of the syndrome.Peripheral blood from 40 ARDS patients and 30 healthy controls was analyzed, with paired samples of peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from seven ARDS patients. We measured levels of NKT cells, cytokines, CD69, programmed death-1 (PD-1), and annexin-V using flow cytometry, and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein expression using real-time PCR.ARDS patients exhibited decreased circulating NKT cells with elevated CD69 expression and enhanced IL-17 production. The reduction in NKT cells correlated with PaO2/FiO2 ratio, albumin, and C-reactive protein levels. Proliferative responses to α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) were impaired, and co-culturing NKT cells with monocytes or T cells from ARDS patients resulted in a reduced α-GalCer response. Increased and activated NKT cells in BALF induced proinflammatory cytokine release by macrophages and ECM protein expression in fibroblasts.ARDS is associated with a numerical deficiency but functional activation of circulating NKT cells, showing impaired responses to α-GalCer and altered interactions with immune cells. The increase in NKT cells within BALF suggests their role in inducing inflammation and remodeling/fibrosis, highlighting the potential of targeting NKT cells as a therapeutic approach for ARDS.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune cell dysfunction plays a central role in sepsis-induced immunoparalysis. Targeted treatment using healthy donor immune cell transfusions, particularly granulocyte concentrates (GC) potentially induces tissue damage. Initial trials using GC in an extracorporeal immune cell perfusion system provided evidence for beneficial effects with fewer side effects, by separating patient and donor immune cell compartments. A multicenter clinical trial is exploring feasibility and effects of a 6-h treatment (NCT06143137). This ex vivo study examines technical feasibility and cellular effects of an extended treatment interval up to 24 h.


METHODS
Standard GC were purified to increase the potential storage time and subsequently implemented in the extracorporeal immune cell perfusion system. Parameters assessed included cell viability, phagocytosis activity, oxidative burst, cytokine release, and metabolic parameters of purified. GC during an extended circulation time of up to 24 h.


RESULTS
After storage of 72 h granulocytes were viable throughout the study period and exhibited preserved functionality and metabolic activity. The findings highlight a time-dependent nature of cytokine release by neutrophils in the extracorporeal circuit, as cytokine secretion patterns showed IL-8 peaking within 6 h, while MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α increased after 24 h of circulation.


CONCLUSION
Purified GC remain functional after 72 h of storage and additional 24 h in the circulating treatment model. Cytokine secretion patterns revealed a significant increase, especially between 10 and 24 h of treatment. Extending treatment time holds promise for enhancing immune response against sepsis-induced immunoparalysis. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing immune-targeted therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered a low immunogenic tumor with "cold" tumor microenvironment (TME) and is mostly unresponsive to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Here we decipher the impact of intratumoral heterogeneity of immune determinants on antitumor response.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We performed spatial proteomic and transcriptomic analyses and multiplexed immunofluorescence on multiple tumor regions, including tumor center (TC) and invasive front (IF), from 220 PDAC-patients, classified according to their transcriptomic immune signaling into high-immunogenic (HI-PDACs, n=54) and low-immunogenic tumors (LI-PDACs, n=166). Spatial compartments (tumor: Pancytokeratin+/CD45- and leukocytes: Pancytokeratin-/CD45+) were defined by fluorescent imaging.


RESULTS
HI-PDACs exhibited higher densities of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with upregulation of T-cell priming-associated immune determinants, including CD40, ITGAM, GITR, CXCL10, GZMB, IFNG and HLA-DR, which was significantly more prominent at the IF than the TC. In contrast, LI-PDACs exhibited immune evasive TMEs with downregulation of immune determinants and a negative gradient from TC to IF. Patients with HI-PDACs had significantly better outcomes; however, they showed more frequently exhausted immune phenotypes.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate strategic differences in the regulation of immune determinants, which lead to different levels of effectiveness of antitumor responses between high- and low-immunogenic tumors and dynamic spatial changes, which affect the evolution of immune evasion and patient outcomes. This supports coevolution of tumor and immune cells and may help define therapeutic vulnerabilities to improve antitumor immunity and harness the responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors in PDAC patients.">

        <tr id="An oral Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) with wild-type S. Typhi was re-established allowing us to explore the development of immunity. In this model, ~55% of volunteers who received the challenge reached typhoid diagnosis criteria (TD), while ~45% did not (NoTD). Intestinal macrophages are one of the first lines of defense against enteric pathogens. Most organs have self-renewing macrophages derived from tissue-resident progenitor cells seeded during the embryonic stage; however, the gut lacks these progenitors, and all intestinal macrophages are derived from circulating monocytes. After infecting gut-associated lymphoid tissues underlying microfold (M) cells, S. Typhi causes a primary bacteremia seeding organs of the reticuloendothelial system. Following days of incubation, a second bacteremia and clinical disease ensue. S. Typhi likely interacts with circulating monocytes or their progenitors in the bone marrow. We assessed changes in circulating monocytes after CHIM. The timepoints studied included 0 hours (pre-challenge) and days 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 14, 21 and 28 after challenge. TD participants provided extra samples at the time of typhoid diagnosis, and 48-96 hours later (referred as ToD). We report changes in Classical Monocytes -CM-, Intermediate Monocytes -IM- and Non-classical Monocytes -NCM-. Changes in monocyte activation markers were identified only in TD participants and during ToD. CM and IM upregulated molecules related to interaction with bacterial antigens (TLR4, TLR5, CD36 and CD206). Of importance, CM and IM showed enhanced binding of S. Typhi. Upregulation of inflammatory molecules like TNF-α were detected, but mechanisms involved in limiting inflammation were also activated (CD163 and CD354 downregulation). CM upregulated molecules to interact/modulate cells of the adaptive immunity, including T cells (HLA-DR, CD274 and CD86) and B cells (CD257). Both CM and IM showed potential to migrate to the gut as integrin α4β7 was upregulated. Unsupervised analysis revealed 7 dynamic cell clusters. Five of these belonged to CM showing that this is the main population activated during ToD. Overall, we provide new insights into the changes that diverse circulating monocyte subsets undergo after typhoid diagnosis, which might be important to control this disease since these cells will ultimately become intestinal macrophages once they reach the gut.">

However, several factors impair the immune function of DCs and may promote immune evasion in cancer. Understanding the mechanism of DC dysfunction and the diverse functions of heterogeneous DCs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for designing effective strategies for cancer immunotherapy. Clinical applications targeting DCs summarized in this report aim to improve immune infiltration and enhance the biological function of DCs to modulate the TME to prevent cancer cells from evading the immune system. Herein, factors in the TME that induce DC dysfunction, such as cytokines, hypoxic environment, tumor exosomes and metabolites, and co-inhibitory molecules, have been described. Furthermore, several key signaling pathways involved in DC dysfunction and signal-relevant drugs evaluated in clinical trials were identified. Finally, this review provides an overview of current clinical immunotherapies targeting DCs, especially therapies with proven clinical outcomes, and explores future developments in DC immunotherapies.">

To bridge this gap, we profiled IPF and control patient lung tissue using spatial transcriptomics, integrating the data with an IPF scRNA-seq atlas. We identified three disease-associated niches with unique cellular compositions and localizations. These include a fibrotic niche, consisting of myofibroblasts and aberrant basaloid cells, located around airways and adjacent to an airway macrophage niche in the lumen, containing SPP1+ macrophages. In addition, we identified an immune niche, characterized by distinct lymphoid cell foci in fibrotic tissue, surrounded by remodeled endothelial vessels. This spatial characterization of IPF niches will facilitate the identification of drug targets that disrupt disease-driving niches and aid in the development of disease relevant in vitro models.">

        <tr id="Curative strategies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection are hindered by incomplete characterization of the latent reservoir and limited enhancement of anti-HIV immune responses. In this study, we identified a novel dual role for peripheral and tissue-resident Vδ1 T cells within the gastrointestinal mucosa of virally suppressed people with HIV. Phenotypic analyses identified an increased frequency of highly differentiated, cytotoxic effector Vδ1 T cells that exerted potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vitro coinciding with direct increases in cytolytic function. Conversely, we detected an enrichment of HIV-1 DNA in tissue-resident CD4+Vδ1 T cells in situ. Despite low CD4 expression, we found circulating Vδ1 T cells also contained HIV-1 DNA which was replication-competent. We show that TCR-mediated activation of peripheral Vδ1 T cells induced de novo upregulation of CD4 providing a plausible mechanism for increased permissibility to infection. These findings highlight juxtaposing roles for Vδ1 T cells in HIV-1 persistence including significant contribution to tissue reservoirs.">

        <tr id="Pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major contributor to poor lung transplant outcomes. We recently demonstrated a central role of airway-centered NK cells in mediating IRI; however, there are no existing effective therapies for directly targeting NK cells in humans. We hypothesized that a depleting anti-CD94 monoclonal antibody (mAb) would provide therapeutic benefit in mouse and human models of IRI based on high levels of KLRD1 (CD94) transcripts in bronchoalveolar lavage samples from lung transplant patients. We found that CD94 is highly expressed on mouse and human NK cells, with increased expression during IRI. Anti-mouse and anti-human mAbs against CD94 showed effective NK cell depletion in mouse and human models and blunted lung damage and airway epithelial killing. In two different allogeneic orthotopic lung transplant mouse models, anti-CD94 treatment during induction reduced early lung injury and chronic inflammation relative to control therapies. Anti-CD94 did not increase donor antigen-presenting cells that could alter long-term graft acceptance. Lung transplant induction regimens incorporating anti-CD94 treatment may safely improve early clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between expression level of CTLA-4 on CD4+ T cells and sepsis-associated immunosuppression (SAI), and to elucidate the possible mechanism of mTOR pathway mediated autophagic-lysosomal disorder in regulating CTLA-4 expression. Methods We enrolled 63 sepsis patients admitted to our ICU between January 1 and June 30, 2023. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the patients within 24 hours of recruitment. Expression levels of mTOR, P62, LC3II, and CTLA-4 on circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes were quantitated using flow cytometry. The association of these markers and relationship between CTLA-4 expression and the incidence of SAI and 28-day mortality were comprehensively analyzed. Results Compared with non-immunosuppressed patients with sepsis, patients with SAI had a higher 28-day mortality rate (37.5% vs 13.0%, P=0.039) and higher CTLA-4 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on CD4+ T cells (328.7 versus 78.7, P<0.0001). CTLA-4 MFI on CD4+ cells was independently associated with the occurrence of SAI (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.14, P=0.044). In patients with sepsis and SAI, non-survivors had higher CTLA-4 expression than survivors (sepsis: 427.5 versus 130.6, P=0.002; and SAI: 506.7 versus 225.2, P<0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of CTLA-4 MFI at predicting 28-day mortality in patients with SAI was 100% and 80% respectively with the cutoff value of 328.7 and the area under the curve of 0.949. The MFI of mTOR, P62, and LC3II on CD4+ T cells were statistically higher in patients with SAI than in non-immunosuppressed patients (267.2 versus 115.9, P<0.0001; 314.8 versus 173.7, P<0.0001; and 184.7 versus 1123.5, P=0.012, respectively); P62 and LC3II were markedly higher in non-survivors than in survivors of sepsis (302.9 versus 208.9, P=0.039; and 244.3 versus 122.8, P<0.0001 respectively). The expression of CTLA-4 statistically correlated with that of LC3II in patients with sepsis, patients with SAI, and patients with SAI who did not survive (correlation coefficient: 0.69, 0.68, and 0.73, respectively, P<0.0001). Conclusions CTLA-4 overexpression on CD4+ T cells was markedly associated with the incidence of SAI and had great relevance to 28-day mortality. mTOR pathway mediated autophagic-lysosomal disorder showed significant association with CTLA-4 expression.">

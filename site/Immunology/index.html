        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="For triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subset of breast cancer, immune cell infiltrates have prognostic implications. The presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells supports tumor progression, while tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) correlate with improved survival and responsiveness to immunotherapy. Manipulating the abundance of these populations may enhance tumor immunity. Gemcitabine (GEM), a clinically employed chemotherapeutic, is reported to be systemically myeloablative, and thus it is a potentially useful adjunct therapy for promoting anti-tumor immunity. However, knowledge about the immunological effects of GEM intratumorally is limited. Thus, we directly compared the impact of systemic GEM on immune cell presence and functionality in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to its effects in the periphery. We found that GEM is not myeloablative in the TME; rather, we observed sustained, significant reductions in TILs and dendritic cells—crucial components in initiating an adaptive immune response. We also performed bulk-RNA sequencing to identify immunological alterations transcriptionally induced by GEM. While we found evidence of upregulation in the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) response pathway, we determined that GEM-mediated growth control is not dependent on IFN-γ. Overall, our findings yield new insights into the tissue- and temporal-dependent immune ablative effects of GEM, contrasting the paradigm that this therapy is specifically myeloablative.">

        <tr id="Immune cells from the adaptive and innate immune systems coexist in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) to mediate tumor cell immunosurveillance and prevent tumor relapse. Relapse-free survival after surgical resection is heterogeneous in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), the two major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. Yet, little is known about the composition and spatial organisation of the TME that could explain the different prognoses for lung cancer patients. Using spatial multi-omics analyses, we show that LUAD and LUSC have distinct TMEs and that neutrophil-enriched tumors are associated with worse survival, while the accumulation of myeloid-instructed CD14+ T cells in the tumor core was associated with prolonged patient survival. CD14+CD4+ T cells express prototypic markers of myeloid cells and were found to be clonally expanded tumor-specific activated T cells. TNFα signaling was activated in tumors with high infiltration of CD14+CD4+ T cells in the tumor core. Our results demonstrate that innate immune cells impact adaptive immune cell activity to support the deployment of discrete T cell populations with anti-tumor activity.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis, caused by M.tuberculosis (Mtb), remains an enduring global health challenge, especially given the limited efficacy of current therapeutic interventions. Much of existing research has focused on immune failure as a driver of tuberculosis. However, the crucial role of host macrophage biology in controlling the disease remains underappreciated. While we have gained deeper insights into how alveolar macrophages (AMs) interact with Mtb, the precise AM subsets that mediate protection and potentially prevent tuberculosis progression have yet to be identified. In this study, we employed multi-modal scRNA-seq analyses to evaluate the functional roles of diverse macrophage subpopulations across different infection timepoints, allowing us to delineate the dynamic landscape of controller and permissive AM populations during the course of infection. Our analyses at specific time-intervals post-Mtb challenge revealed macrophage populations transitioning between distinct anti- and pro-inflammatory states. Notably, early in Mtb infection, CD38− AMs showed a muted response. As infection progressed, we observed a phenotypic shift in AMs, with CD38+ monocyte-derived AMs (moAMs) and a subset of tissue-resident AMs (TR-AMs) emerging as significant controllers of bacterial growth. Furthermore, scATAC-seq analysis of naïve lungs demonstrated that CD38+ TR-AMs possessed a distinct chromatin signature prior to infection, indicative of epigenetic priming and predisposition to a pro-inflammatory response. BCG intranasal immunization increased the numbers of CD38+ macrophages, substantially enhancing their capability to restrict Mtb growth. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal, dynamic roles of different macrophage subsets in TB infection and reveal rational pathways for the development of improved vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections such as influenza A virus. This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.">

        <tr id="Yellow fever vaccination provides long-lasting protection and is a unique model for studying the immune response to an acute RNA virus infection in humans. To elucidate the early innate immune events preceding the rapid generation of protective immunity, we performed transcriptome analysis of human blood dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte subpopulations before and 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after vaccination. We detected temporary upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in all DC and monocyte subsets on day 3 and 7 after vaccination as well as cell type specific responses and temporal dynamics. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed rapid appearance of activated DC and monocyte clusters dominated by ISGs, inflammatory chemokines and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation. This was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in a large cohort of vaccinees. We identified SIGLEC1/CD169 upregulation as a sensitive indicator of the transient IFN-induced activation state elicited in DCs and monocytes by YF17D vaccination correlating with early protective IgM antibody responses.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.">

        <tr id="Despite promising results with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, outcomes of patients with brain metastasis (BrM) remain poor. Identifying determinant of resistance is crucial but has been hindered by limited access to patient samples and the scarcity of relevant preclinical models. Here, we developed two mouse melanoma BrM models that mirror the disparate response to ICB seen in patients. By characterizing their mutational landscape and performing single-cell phenotypic and transcriptomic analysis, we demonstrated that these models recapitulate both the cellular and molecular features of human disease. Through our comparative analysis, we identified key factors contributing to ICB response. In the responsive model, we found that tumor cells expressed inflammatory programs that polarized microglia toward reactive states, expressing high levels of MHC-I and -II and immunostimulatory molecules, eliciting robust T cell recruitment and activation, which favored anti-tumor immunity. Conversely, the resistant melanoma cells were characterized by neurological molecular signatures and expression of ligands that maintain microglia homeostatic states, resulting in poor T cell infiltration and therapy resistance. We validated our findings in BrM patients, showing that BR1 and BR3 signatures correlated with T cell infiltration and were associated with better and worse patient outcomes, respectively. Our study fills a critical gap by providing clinically relevant models and revealing mechanistic insights into BrM ICB responses, identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus. Previous studies have shown antibody Fc effector functions are critical for optimal monoclonal antibody-mediated protection against alphaviruses; however, the requirement of Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) for protection during natural infection has not been evaluated. Here, we showed mice lacking activating FcγRs (FcRγ-/-) developed prolonged clinical disease with more virus in joint-associated tissues. Viral clearance was associated with anti-MAYV cell surface binding rather than neutralizing antibodies. Lack of Fc-FcγR engagement increased the number of monocytes through chronic timepoints. Single cell RNA sequencing showed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes in joint-associated tissue with increased MAYV RNA present in FcRγ-/- monocytes and macrophages. Transfer of FcRγ-/- monocytes into wild type animals was sufficient to increase virus in joint-associated tissue. Overall, this study suggests that engagement of antibody Fc with activating FcγRs promotes protective responses during MAYV infection and prevents monocytes from being potential targets of infection.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Understanding the immune mechanisms associated with liver transplantation (LT), particularly the involvement of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs), represents a significant challenge. Methods: This study employs a multi-omics approach to analyse liver transplant samples from both human (n = 17) and mouse (n = 16), utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and immunological techniques. Results: Our findings reveal a comprehensive T cell-centric landscape in LT across human and mouse species, involving 235,116 cells. Notably, we found a substantial increase in CD8+ TRMs within rejected grafts compared to stable ones. The elevated presence of CD8+ TRMs is characterised by a distinct expression profile, featuring upregulation of tissue-residency markers (CD69, CXCR6, CD49A and CD103+/-,), immune checkpoints (PD1, CTLA4, and TIGIT), cytotoxic markers (GZMB and IFNG) and proliferative markers (PCNA and TOP2A) during rejection. Furthermore, there is a high expression of transcription factors such as EOMES and RUNX3. Functional assays and analyses of cellular communication underscore the active role of CD8+ TRMs in interacting with other tissue-resident cells, particularly Kupffer cells, especially during rejection episodes. Conclusions: These insights into the distinctive activation and interaction patterns of CD8+ TRMs suggest their potential utility as biomarkers for graft rejection, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing graft tolerance and improving overall transplant outcomes.">

        <tr id="Current rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatments do not restore immune tolerance. Investigating dendritic cell (DC) populations in human synovial tissue (ST) may reveal pathways to re-instate tolerance in RA. With single-cell and spatial-transcriptomics of synovial tissue biopsies, validated by micro co-culture systems, we identified condition and niche-specific myeloid DC clusters with distinct differentiation trajectories and functions. Healthy synovium contains a unique tolerogenic AXLpos DC2 cluster in the superficial sublining layer. In active RA, a macrophage-rich lining-layer niche becomes populated with inflammatory DC3 clusters that specifically activate memory CCL5pos TEM and CCL5posCXCL13pos TPH, promoting synovitis. In the sublining lymphoid niche, CCR7pos DC2 mReg specifically interact with naïve-T-cells, potentially driving the local expansion of new effector T-cells. Sustained remission sees the resolution of these niches but lacks the recovery of tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, indicating latent potential for disease flare. A human RA disease-flare model showed that the activation of blood predecessor of ST-DC3 clusters precedes the onset of inflammation in joints. Therapeutic strategies targeting pathogenic ST-DC3 clusters, or reinstating tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, may restore immune homeostasis in RA. In brief Deconstruction of human RA synovium, using single-cell spatial transcriptomics and micro-culture systems, reveals distinct neighbourhoods within the synovial architecture across health, and RA patients with active disease or sustained remission. Discrete niches are identified that contain distinct myeloid DC clusters that differ in frequency, differentiation trajectories, and effector functions. Highlights Human RA synovium exhibits condition and niche specific myeloid DC clusters that vary in their tissue differentiation trajectories and functions. ST-CD14pos DC3 (iDC3) support inflammatory CCL5pos TEM and CCL5pos TPH cell activation in the hyperplastic lining layer.

        <tr id="This study addresses the molecular mechanisms behind JAK inhibitors’ (JAKi) epigenetic regulation of IFN-γ-induced genes in macrophages, key players in controlling inflammation in chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and COVID-19. Utilizing transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches, we reveal that JAKi selectively regulate gene programs in IFN-γ-activated human macrophages. Our single-cell analysis identified high expression of IFN-γ signature genes in macrophages from RA and severe COVID-19 patients. JAKi suppressed some inflammatory genes, while a subset remained unresponsive to JAK-STAT inhibition. We discovered that JAKi selectively target IRF-STAT-dependent open chromatin regions, leaving AP-1-C/EBP-regulated genes with open chromatin unaffected. Some JAKi-insensitive genes could be inhibited by JNK inhibitors in IFN-γ-primed macrophages. Our analysis also identified JAKi-sensitive and - insensitive IFN-γ signature genes in RA patients resistant to MTX treatments and COVID-19 vaccinated donors, highlighting JAKi’s therapeutic potential and risks. These findings uncover new JAKi responsiveness mechanisms through epigenomic changes in IFN-γ-primed macrophages, advancing our understanding of inflammation regulation in chronic diseases.

Although the recruited MDMs became quickly and preferentially infected with Mtb, CD4+ T cells rapidly disinfected the MDMs. Clearance of Mtb from MDMs was not explained by IFN-γ, but rather by MHCII-mediated cognate interactions with CD4+ T cells. These interactions promoted MDM expression of glycolysis genes essential for Mtb control. Thus, by recruiting MDMs, CD4+ T cells initiate a cycle of bacterial phagocytosis, Mtb antigen presentation and disinfection in an attempt to clear the bacteria from the lungs.">

        <tr id="Therapies that harness the immune system to target and eliminate tumor cells have revolutionized cancer care. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which boosts the anti-tumor immune response by inhibiting negative regulators of T cell activation1–3, is remarkably successful in a subset of cancer patients, yet a significant proportion do not respond to treatment, emphasizing the need to understand factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy of ICB4–9. The gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a critical determinant of immune function and response to cancer immunotherapy, with multiple studies demonstrating association of microbiota composition with clinical response10–16. However, a mechanistic understanding of how gut commensal bacteria influence the efficacy of ICB remains elusive. Here we utilized a gut commensal microorganism, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induces an antigen-specific Th17 cell effector program17, to investigate how colonization with it affects the efficacy of ICB in restraining distal growth of tumors sharing antigen with SFB. We find that anti-PD-1 treatment effectively inhibits the growth of implanted SFB antigen-expressing melanoma only if mice are colonized with SFB. Through T cell receptor clonal lineage tracing, fate mapping, and peptide-MHC tetramer staining, we identify tumor-associated SFB-specific Th1-like cells derived from the homeostatic Th17 cells induced by SFB colonization in the small intestine lamina propria. These gut-educated ex-Th17 cells produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, and promote expansion and effector functions of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby controlling tumor growth. A better understanding of how distinct intestinal commensal microbes can promote T cell plasticity-dependent responses against antigen-sharing tumors may allow for the design of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.">

A growing number of T cell-directed therapeutics have demonstrated partial therapeutic efficacy, with anti-CD3 (α-CD3) representing the only regulatory agency-approved drug capable of slowing disease progression through a mechanism involving the induction of partial T cell exhaustion. There is an outstanding need to augment the durability and effectiveness of T cell targeting by directly restraining proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 1 cytotoxic CD8+ T cell (Tc1) subsets, while simultaneously augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Here, we present a novel strategy for reducing diabetes incidence in the NOD mouse model using a blocking monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 diabetes-risk associated T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD226. Methods Female NOD mice were treated with anti-CD226 between 7-8 weeks of age and then monitored for diabetes incidence and therapeutic mechanism of action. Results Compared to isotype-treated controls, anti-CD226 treated NOD mice showed reduced insulitis severity at 12 weeks and decreased disease incidence at 30 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis performed five weeks post-treatment demonstrated reduced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells in spleens of anti-CD226 treated mice. Phenotyping of pancreatic Tregs revealed increased CD25 expression and STAT5 phosphorylation following anti-CD226, with splenic Tregs displaying augmented suppression of CD4+ T cell responders in vitro. Anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited reduced frequencies of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein (IGRP)-reactive CD8+ T cells in the pancreas, using both ex vivo tetramer staining and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) approaches. 51Cr-release assays demonstrated reduced cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells by anti-CD226-treated autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Conclusions/interpretation CD226 blockade reduces T cell cytotoxicity and improves Treg function, representing a targeted and rational approach for restoring immune regulation in type 1 diabetes. Research in Context What is already known about this subject? The co-stimulatory receptor CD226 is upregulated upon activation and is highly expressed on NK cell subsets, myeloid cells, and effector T cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism in CD226 (rs763361; C>T) results in a Gly307Ser missense mutation linked to genetic susceptibility for type 1 diabetes. Global knockout of Cd226 and conditional Cd226 knockout in FoxP3+ Tregs reduced insulitis severity and diabetes incidence in NOD mice, indicating a crucial role for CD226 in disease pathogenesis. What is the key question? Can CD226 blockade reduce T cell cytotoxicity and improve Treg function to diminish diabetes incidence in NOD mice? What are the new findings? Anti-CD226 treatment reduced insulitis, decreased disease incidence, and inhibited splenic CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cell proliferation. Pancreatic Tregs from anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited increased CD25 expression; splenic Tregs displayed augmented STAT5 phosphorylation and suppressive capacity in vitro. Anti-CD226 treatment reduced IGRP-specific pancreatic CD8+ T cell frequencies, and reduced autoreactive CD8+ T cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells in vitro. How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? CD226 blockade could reduce autoreactive T cell cytotoxicity, enhance Treg function, and slow disease progression in high-risk or recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases.">

        <tr id="Exhaustion represents a collection of programmed T cell differentiation states and an important mode of T cell dysfunction. T cell progression from progenitor to terminal exhaustion is associated with upregulation of the transcription factor TOX and expression of TIM3. Our understanding of factors regulating TOX expression and the transition from progenitor to terminal exhaustion, however, remains incomplete. We reveal here that T cell upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor type II (TNFR2) coincides with the gain of phenotypic markers and functions reflective of terminal exhaustion. Meanwhile, knocking out TNFR2 affords a novel population of T cells that express TIM3 but possess diminished TOX levels and functional characteristics of both progenitor and terminally exhausted cells. TIM3+ TNFR2 KO T cells exhibit reduced exhaustion transcriptional programs and enhanced AP1 pathway signatures. Finally, TNFR2 KO mice demonstrate improved T cell-dependent control of tumor and chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis viral (cLCMV) infection, while pharmacologic antagonism of TNFR2 licenses responses to checkpoint blockade in multiple tumor models.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Cancer immunotherapy has been regarded as a promising strategy for cancer therapy by blocking immune checkpoints and evoking immunity to fight cancer, but its efficacy seems to be heterogeneous among patients. Manipulating the gut microbiota is a potential strategy for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Here, we report that MS-20, also known as “Symbiota®”, a postbiotic that comprises abundant microbial metabolites generated from a soybean-based medium fermented with multiple strains of probiotics and yeast, inhibited colon and lung cancer growth in combination with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) antibody in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, MS-20 remodeled the immunological tumor microenvironment by increasing effector CD8+ T cells and downregulating PD1 expression, which were mediated by the gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from mice receiving MS-20 treatment to recipient mice increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment and significantly improved antitumor activity when combined with anti-PD1 therapy. Notably, the abundance of Ruminococcus bromii, which increased following MS-20 treatment, was positively associated with a reduced tumor burden and CD8+ T-cell infiltration in vivo. Furthermore, an ex vivo study revealed that MS-20 could alter the composition of the microbiota in cancer patients, resulting in distinct metabolic pathways associated with favorable responses to immunotherapy. Overall, MS-20 could act as a promising adjuvant agent for enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint-mediated antitumor therapy.">

        <tr id="Gain-of-function mutations in the dsDNA sensing adaptor STING lead to a severe autoinflammatory syndrome known as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). Patients with SAVI develop interstitial lung disease (ILD) and produce autoantibodies that are commonly associated with systemic autoimmune diseases. Mice expressing the most common SAVI mutation, STING V154M (VM), similarly develop ILD but exhibit severe T and B cell lymphopenia and low serum Ig titers, and they lack autoantibodies. Importantly, lethally irradiated VM hosts reconstituted with WT stem cells (WT→VM) still develop ILD. In this study, we find that WT→VM chimeras had restored B cell function, produced autoantibodies, and thereby recapitulated the loss of tolerance seen in patients with SAVI. Lymphocytes derived from both WT and BCR or TCR transgenic (Tg) donors accumulated in the extravascular lung tissue of WT+Tg→VM mixed chimeras, but lymphocyte activation and germinal center formation required WT cells with a diverse repertoire. Furthermore, when T cells isolated from the WT→VM chimeras were adoptively transferred to naive Rag1-deficient secondary hosts, they trafficked to the lung and recruited neutrophils. Overall, these findings indicated that VM expression by radioresistant cells promoted the activation of autoreactive B cells and T cells that then differentiated into potentially pathogenic effector subsets.">

Dysfunctional T cell activity precipitates tissue pathology that occurs alongside disease-associated alterations of structural cell subsets, but the mechanisms by which T cells promote these changes remain unclear. We show that subsets of circulating and skin-resident CD4+ T cells promote distinct transcriptional outcomes in human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts that correspond with divergent T cell cytokine production. Using these transcriptional signatures, we identify T cell-dependent outcomes associated with inflammatory skin disease, including a set of Th17 cell-induced genes in keratinocytes that are enriched in the skin during psoriasis and normalized by anti-IL-17 therapy, and a skin-resident T cell-induced gene module enriched in scleroderma-associated fibroblasts.

We found that participants who produce bNAbs, termed neutralizers, have a superior LN-associated B cell follicle architecture compared with PLWH who do not. The latter was associated with a significantly higher in situ prevalence of Bcl-6hi follicular helper CD4 T cells (TFH), expressing a molecular program that favors their differentiation and stemness, and significantly reduced IL-10 follicular suppressor CD4 T cells.

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) are virtually insensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) employed as standalone therapeutics, at least in part reflecting microenvironmental immunosuppression. Thus, conventional chemotherapeutics and targeted anticancer agents that not only mediate cytotoxic effects but also promote the recruitment of immune effector cells to the HGSOC microenvironment stand out as promising combinatorial partners for ICIs in this oncological indication.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We harnessed a variety of transcriptomic, spatial and functional assays to characterize the differential impact of neo-adjuvant paclitaxel-carboplatin on the immunological configuration of paired primary and metastatic HGSOC biopsies as compared to NACT-naïve HGSOC samples from 5 independent patient cohorts.


RESULTS
We found neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)-driven endoplasmic reticulum stress and calreticulin exposure in metastatic HGSOC lesions culminates with the establishment of a dense immune infiltrate including follicular T cells (TFH cells), a prerequisite for mature tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation. In this context, TLS maturation was associated with an increased intratumoral density of ICI-sensitive TCF1+PD-1+ CD8+ T cells over their ICI-insensitive TIM-3+PD-1+ counterparts. Consistent with this notion, chemotherapy coupled with a PD-1-targeting ICI provided a significant survival benefit over either therapeutic approach in syngeneic models of HGSOC bearing high (but not low) tumor mutational burden.


CONCLUSION
Altogether, our findings suggest that NACT promotes TLS formation and maturation in HGSOC lesions, de facto preserving an intratumoral ICI-sensitive T-cell phenotype. These observations emphasize the role of rational design, especially relative to the administration schedule, for clinical trials testing chemotherapy plus ICIs in patients with HGSOC.">

        <tr id="The transcription factor BATF plays critical roles in the differentiation of various immune cells, including CD8+ T cells. Here, we demonstrated that BATF controls epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming of CD8+ T cells at an early phase of acute viral infection, thereby promoting the differentiation of cytolytic effector CD8+ T cells. Loss of BATF drastically perturbed gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and the bindings of key transcription factors including Jun, T-bet, and IRF4. The direct interaction with IRF4 was essential for BATF-mediated effector differentiation, as the BATF mutant lacking this interaction failed to induce proper chromatin remodeling and proliferation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Notably, IRF4 binding was exhaustively dependent on BATF, whereas BATF retained binding capacity even in IRF4-deficient CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, BATF initiated chromatin remodeling in the absence of IRF4, whereas subsequent dynamic epigenomic reorganization required IRF4. Our data proposed that BATF serves as a “pioneer transcription factor” spearheading the reorganization of chromatin architecture upon antigen encounter, followed by further rearrangement of epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes through the cooperation with IRF4.">

        <tr id="The cytokine interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a pivotal T cell-derived signal crucial for germinal center (GC) responses, but the precise mechanisms by which IL-21 influences B cell function remain elusive. Here, we investigated the B cell-intrinsic role of IL-21 signaling by employing a novel IL-21 receptor (Il21r) conditional knock-out mouse model and ex vivo culture systems and uncovered a surprising duality of IL-21 signaling in B cells. While IL-21 stimulation of naïve B cells led to Bim-dependent apoptosis, it promoted robust proliferation of pre-activated B cells, particularly class-switched IgG1+ B cells ex vivo. Consistent with this, B cell-specific deletion of Il21r led to a severe defect in IgG1 responses in vivo following immunization. Intriguingly, Il21r-deleted B cells are significantly impaired in their ability to transition from a pre-GC to a GC state following immunization. Although Il21r-deficiency did not affect the proportion of IgG1+ B cells among GC B cells, it greatly diminished the proportion of IgG1+ B cells among the plasmablast/plasma cell population. Collectively, our data suggest that IL-21 serves as a critical regulator of B cell fates, influencing B cell apoptosis and proliferation in a context-dependent manner.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm) are essential for regional immunity in non-lymphoid tissues. Although single-cell transcriptomics have revealed Trm heterogeneity in various diseases, the molecular mechanisms behind this diversity are unclear. To investigate this, we used Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection, which persists in the central nervous system (CNS) and is controlled by brain CD8+ Trm. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of brain CD8+ T cells from T. gondii-infected mice showed heterogeneous expression of the transcriptional regulator Id2, correlating with different functional states. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we found that Id2-deficiency in T cells caused parasite-specific Trm to develop an altered phenotype with diminished effector functions and reduced expression of CD49a. Furthermore, loss of Id2 in brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells led to the accumulation of exhausted PD1+Tox+CD8+ Trm cells, while Id2 overexpression repressed T cell exhaustion. Overall, our study shows that Id2 levels dictate the acquisition of effector vs. exhausted phenotypes in CD8+ Trm during chronic CNS infection.

Viral loads (VL), NK cell numbers, activation, proliferation, and functional measures were evaluated in blood and tissues. In non-depleted (control) animals, infection rapidly induced NK cell expansion, activation, and increased tissue trafficking associated with VL. Strikingly, we report that experimental NK cell depletion leads to higher VL, longer duration of viral shedding, significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, and overt lung damage. Overall, we find the first significant and conclusive evidence for NK cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and disease pathology. These data indicate that adjunct therapies for infection could largely benefit from NK cell-targeted approaches.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Dysregulated T-cell immune response-mediated inflammation plays critical roles in the pathology of diverse liver diseases, but the underlying mechanism of liver immune homeostasis control and the specific therapies for limiting T-cell overactivation remain unclear. Methods: The metabolic changes in concanavalin A (ConA) mice and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) patients and their associations with liver injury were analyzed. The expression of purine catabolism nucleases (e.g., CD39 and CD73) on liver cells and immune cells was assessed. The effects of MCregs and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and the underlying mechanism were also explored. Results: Our findings revealed significant alterations in purine metabolism in ConA mice and AIH patients, which correlated with liver injury severity and therapeutic response. CD39 and CD73 were markedly upregulated on CD11b+Gr-1+ MCs under liver injury conditions. The naturally expanded CD39+CD73+Gr-1highCD11b+ MCreg subset during early liver injury effectively suppressed CD4+ T-cell hyperactivation and liver injury both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MCregs released CD73high EVs, which converted extracellular AMP to immunosuppressive metabolites (e.g., adenosine and inosine), activating the cAMP pathway and inhibiting glycolysis and cytokine secretion in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the mechanism controlling immune homeostasis during the early liver injury phase and highlights that MCreg or MCreg-EV therapy may be a specific strategy for preventing diverse liver diseases induced by T-cell overactivation.">

        <tr id="Stem-like progenitors are a critical subset of cytotoxic T cells that self-renew and give rise to expanded populations of effector cells critical for successful checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Emerging evidence suggests that the tumor-draining lymph nodes can support the continuous generation of these stem-like cells that replenish the tumor sites and act as a critical source of expanded effector populations, underlining the importance of understanding what factors promote and maintain activated T cells in the stem-like state. Using advanced 3D multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, here we identified antigen-presentation niches in tumor-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance, and affinity evolution of a unique population of TCF-1+PD-1+SLAMF6hi stem-like CD8+ T cells. Our results show that contrary to the prevailing view that persistent TCR signaling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement well beyond the initial priming phase sustained the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway plays a central role in this process by mediating the fine-tuning of TCR and co-stimulatory signal input that enables selective expansion of high affinity TCR stem-like clones, enabling them to act as a renewable source of high affinity effector cells. PD-1 checkpoint blockade disrupts this fine tuning of input signaling, leading to terminal differentiation to the effector state or death of the most avid anti-tumor stem-like cells. Our results thus reveal an unexpected relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative feedback regulatory loop, and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumor effect that comes at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high affinity stem-like precursors.">

        <tr id="Protection from pathogens relies on both humoral (antibody-mediated) and cellular (T cell-mediated) responses. While infections robustly elicit both types of immunity, currently approved vaccine adjuvants largely fail to induce T cell responses on par with that instigated by infections. Our goal was to investigate the transcriptional programming that supports the formation of CD8+ T cells elicited by subunit vaccines compared to those elicited by infections. Our data show that vaccine-elicited T cells represent a transcriptionally unique subset of activated T cells with high proliferative capacity and a memory cell fate. This relies on IL-27 signaling, which stabilizes c-Myc and thereby supports the biomass acquisition necessary for clonal expansion. Collectively, our findings reveal that subunit vaccine-elicited T cells uniquely combine aspects of both memory and effector T cell subsets, and selectively utilize IL-27 signaling to sustain the clonal expansion of cells dedicated to a memory fate. One Sentence Summary In contrast to infection, subunit vaccines induce a distinct population of CD8+ T cells with memory fate characteristics which maintain their proliferative capacity during the expansion phase through IL-27 receptor signaling.">

        <tr id="IL-23 signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases, yet the cellular targets and signaling pathways affected by this cytokine remain poorly understood. We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract A comprehensive immune landscape for Brucella infection is crucial for developing new treatments for brucellosis. Here, we utilized single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) of 290,369 cells from 35 individuals, including 29 brucellosis patients from acute (n = 10), sub‐acute (n = 9), and chronic (n = 10) phases as well as six healthy donors. Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays were applied for validation within this cohort. Brucella infection caused a significant change in the composition of peripheral immune cells and inflammation was a key feature of brucellosis. Acute patients are characterized by potential cytokine storms resulting from systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, primarily due to classical monocytes. Cytokine storm may be mediated by activating S100A8/A9‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway. Moreover, monocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells were the probable contributors to immune paralysis in acute patients. Chronic patients are characterized by a dysregulated Th1 response, marked by reduced expression of IFN‐γ and Th1 signatures as well as a high exhausted state. Additionally, Brucella infection can suppress apoptosis in myeloid cells (e.g., mDCs, classical monocytes), inhibit antigen presentation in professional antigen‐presenting cells (APCs; e.g., mDC) and nonprofessional APCs (e.g., monocytes), and induce exhaustion in CD8+ T/NK cells, potentially resulting in the establishment of chronic infection. Overall, our study systemically deciphered the coordinated immune responses of Brucella at different phases of the infection, which facilitated a full understanding of the immunopathogenesis of brucellosis and may aid the development of new effective therapeutic strategies, especially for those with chronic infection.">

        <tr id="Soil-transmitted helminths are one of the most common infections across the world, yet how to promote an effective humoral response to helminths is not well understood. To ensure the most effective response, molecular programs underpin the specialization of antibody effector subtype to microenvironmental signals. Here, we identify the methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) as a key target to promote IgA-driven responses. Mll1 was increased in germinal center (GC) B cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues, and the absence of MLL1 in mature B cells led to significant reductions in GCs, IgG1 and IgE in response to the helminth Trichuris muris. Yet, worm expulsion occurred more rapidly in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice compared to control mice in the first two weeks of infection. Accelerated worm clearance correlated with significantly elevated IgA+ plasma cells (PC), serum IgA and fecal IgA in in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice. Stimulation of B cells in vitro confirmed that Mll1-deficiency accelerated the formation of IgA+ PC and that this effect was B cell-intrinsic. CCR9 was identified as a key MLL1-regulated molecule by RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry. Correspondingly, Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice infected with either T. muris or the bacterium C. rodentium significant increased IgA+CCR9+ PC localized in the large intestine. This tailoring of the B cell response to promote IgA-secreting PC correlated to a healthier microbiome in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice, compared to control mice. Thus, this study reveals MLL1 as a key target to tailor B cell responses to helminth infections, which may aid the development of effective mucosal vaccines or new targeted treatments. Significance statement Diseases caused by infections, such as soil-transmitted helminth infections or bacterial infections, continue to pose a major human health problem worldwide. One key reason why soil-transmitted helminths continue to cause long-term health and economic burdens is the lack of an effective vaccine for human use. Antibody responses underpin most successful vaccine designs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how B cell responses are regulated to produce tailored antibody to different pathogens is critical for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines. This study uncovered MLL1 as a novel therapeutic target to promote IgA-producing plasma cells, opening new avenues of investigation into how effective and tailored antibody responses may be produced in response to bacterial or helminth infection.">

In a study of a perforin-deficient mouse model of HLH with a viral trigger, we aimed to determine if CD8+ T cell behaviour could be modulated by targeted interleukin (IL)-2 treatment. We observed a paradoxical benefit that contrasted with IL-2’s typical role in boosting T cell activity: targeted IL-2 delivery to CD8+ T cells led to reduced hyperinflammation and disease severity. Our results demonstrated that IL-2 induced exhaustion in overactive CD8+ T cells, thus mitigating hyperinflammation.

        <tr id="The successful development of germinal centers (GC) relies heavily on innate mechanisms to amplify the initial inflammatory cascade. In addition to their role in antigen presentation, innate cells are essential for the redirection of circulating lymphocytes toward the draining lymph node (dLN) to maximize antigen surveillance. Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) and its receptors (S1PR1-5) affect various aspects of immunity; however, the role of S1PR4 in regulating an immune response is not well understood. Here we use a footpad model of localized TH1 inflammation to carefully monitor changes in leukocyte populations within the blood, the immunized tissue, and the dLN. Within hours of immunization, neutrophils failed to adequately mobilize and infiltrate into the footpad tissue of S1PR4-/- mice, thereby diminishing the local vascular changes thought to be necessary for redirecting circulating cells toward the inflamed region. Neutrophil depletion with anti-Ly6G antibodies significantly reduced early tissue edema as well as the redirection and initial accumulation of naïve lymphocytes in dLN of WT mice, while the effects were less prominent or absent in S1PR4-/- dLN. Adoptive transfer experiments further demonstrated that the lymphocyte homing deficiencies in vivo were not intrinsic to the donor S1PR4-/- lymphocytes, but were instead attributed to differences within the S1PR4-deficient host. Reduced cell recruitment in S1PR4-/- mice would seed the dLN with fewer antigen-respondent lymphocytes and indeed, dLN hypertrophy at the peak of the immune response was severely diminished, with attenuated GC and activation pathways in these mice. Histological examination of the S1PR4-/- dLN also revealed an underdeveloped vascular network with reduced expression of the leukocyte tethering ligand, PNAd, within high endothelial venule regions, suggesting inadequate growth of the dLN meant to support a robust GC response. Thus, our study reveals that S1PR4 may link early immune modulation by neutrophils to the initial recruitment of circulating lymphocytes and downstream expansion and maturation of the dLN, thereby contributing to optimal GC development during an adaptive response.">

        <tr id="SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the generation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ effector and memory T cells. However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

Although effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+ B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+ T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+ CD4+ T cells and a high proportion of Ag+ CD8+ T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The interleukin (IL)-1-family receptor antagonist IL-38 has emerged as a negative regulator of auto-inflammation. Given the intricate interplay between antitumor immunity and auto-inflammation, we hypothesized that blocking IL-38 may enhance tumor immune control. Methods Our hypothesis was tested in the transgenic polyoma virus middle T oncoprotein mammary carcinoma model that is suitable for identifying strong immunomodulators. To investigate the effect of acute IL-38 blockade, we used a neutralizing antibody, alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Immune cell composition and location in tumors were determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The role of γδ T cells was studied using an antibody blocking γδ T-cell receptor signaling. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing and RNA expression analysis were employed to determine mechanisms downstream of IL-38 neutralization. Additionally, in vitro assays with γδ T cells, CD8+ T cells and cDC1, followed by in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion, were performed to study the underlying mechanistic pathways. Results Both, genetic ablation of IL-38 and neutralization with the antibody, reduced tumorigenesis, and IL-38 blockade improved chemotherapy efficacy. This was accompanied by an augmented lymphocyte infiltrate dominated by γδ T cells and CD8+ T cells, and signaling through the γδ-T-cell receptor was required for CD8+ T cell infiltration. Rather than directly interacting with CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells recruited conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) into tumors via the chemokine Xcl1. cDC1 in turn activated CD8+ T cells via the Notch pathway. Moreover, IL-38 negatively correlated with cDC1, XCL1-producing γδ T cells, T-cell infiltrates and survival in patients with mammary carcinoma. Conclusions These data suggest that interfering with IL-38 improves antitumor immunity even in immunologically cold tumors.">

Iron is an essential micronutrient for multiple immunologic processes and nutritional deficiency is a common problem worldwide. Despite its prevalence, the impact of nutritional iron deficiency on the establishment of memory T cell responses is not fully understood. In this study we investigate the impact of nutritional iron deficiency on the generation, phenotype, and function of memory T cell responses using a murine model of dietary iron modulation in the context of influenza infection. Iron deficient mice have decreased systemic iron levels and develop significant anemia. Increased T cell expression of the transferrin receptor (CD71) is seen in iron deficient mice at baseline. During primary influenza infection, iron deficient mice experience increased weight loss and phenotypic evidence of impairments in T cell activation. Following recovery from infection, iron deficient mice generate increased influenza specific memory T cells which exhibit impaired ability to produce IFNγ, most notably within the lung. Importantly, the ability to produce IFNγ and TNFα is not recovered by co-culture with iron replete dendritic cells, suggesting a T cell intrinsic alteration in functional memory formation. Altogether, these results isolate a critical effect of nutritional iron deficiency on T cell memory development and function.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing immune-mediated disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. The underlying causes of IBD are not fully understood, but genetic factors have implicated in genome-wide association studies, including CTLA-4, an essential negative regulator of T cell activation. However, establishing a direct link between CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 knockout mice. In this study, we identified zebrafish Ctla-4 homolog and investigated its role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by generating a Ctla-4-deficient (ctla-4-/-) zebrafish line. These mutant zebrafish exhibit reduced weight, along with impaired epithelial barrier integrity and lymphocytic infiltration in their intestines. Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation-related genes, disturbing immune system homeostasis. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated increased Th2 cells and interleukin 13 expression, along with decreased innate lymphoid cells and upregulated proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited reduced diversity and an altered composition of the intestinal microbiota. All these phenotypes closely resemble those found in mammalian IBD. Lastly, supplementation with Ctla-4-Ig successfully alleviated intestinal inflammation in these mutants. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the pivotal role of Ctla-4 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Additionally, they offer substantial evidence linking CTLA-4 to IBD and establish a novel zebrafish model for investigating both the pathogenesis and potential treatments.">

        <tr id="The liver routinely encounters antigens from the gut, triggering pro- inflammatory responses. Unresolved inflammation can lead to liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is influenced by various immune cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which exhibit both innate and adaptive immunity traits. Here, we examined iNKT cell dynamics in a diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in iNKT cell numbers in HCC livers due to apoptosis and impaired cytokine production. CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, displayed delayed tumor initiation and lower tumor and foci number. However, these tumors were larger in size and characterized by enhanced proliferation and immunosuppression. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of healthy iNKT cells post-tumor establishment reduced tumor burden, highlighting their potential therapeutic role. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells contribute to early HCC development, while in later stages they help to control tumor growth, thus underscoring their complex role in liver carcinogenesis. Further understanding of iNKT cell functions may inform novel immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC management.">

        <tr id="Radiotherapy (RT) serves as the primary treatment for solid tumors. Its potential to incite an immune response against tumors both locally and distally profoundly impacts clinical outcomes. However, RT may also promote the accumulation of immunosuppressive cytokines and immunosuppressive cells, greatly impeding the activation of antitumor immune responses and substantially limiting the effectiveness of RT. Therefore, regulating post-RT immunosuppression to steer the immune milieu toward heightened activation potentially enhances RT’s therapeutic potential. Cytokines, potent orchestrators of diverse cellular responses, play a pivotal role in regulating this immunosuppressive response. Identifying and promptly neutralizing early released immunosuppressive cytokines are a crucial development in augmenting RT’s immunomodulatory effects. To this end, we conducted a screen of immunosuppressive cytokines following RT and identified macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) as an early up-regulated and persistent immune suppressor. Single-cell sequencing revealed that the main source of up-regulated MCSF derived from tumor cells. Mechanistic exploration revealed that irradiation-dependent phosphorylation of the p65 protein facilitated its binding to the MCSF gene promoter, enhancing transcription. Knockdown and chemical inhibitor experiments conclusively demonstrated that suppressing tumor cell-derived MCSF amplifies RT’s immune-activating effects, with optimal results achieved by early MCSF blockade after irradiation. Additionally, we validated that MCSF acted on macrophages, inducing the secretion of a large number of inhibitory cytokines. In summary, we propose a novel approach to enhance the immune activation effects of RT by blocking the MCSF-CSF1R signaling pathway early after irradiation.">

Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

While early granulomas were composed of resKCs, late granulomas were found outside of the sinusoids and contained resKC-derived macrophages, and monocyte-derived macrophages (momacs). ResKCs and moKCs within the sinusoids were identified as homeostatic/regulatory cells, while resKC-derived macrophages and momacs within late granulomas were pro-inflammatory. Despite the infection being largely confined to the resKC-derived macrophages, in the absence of monocyte recruitment, parasite control was strongly compromised. Macrophage heterogeneity, involving migration and reprogramming of resKCs, along with recruitment of monocyte-derived cells, is a hallmark of granuloma maturation and hepatic immunity in VL.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial in initiating and shaping both innate and adaptive immune responses. Clinical studies and experimental models have highlighted their significant involvement in various autoimmune diseases, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets. Nicotinamide (NAM), a form of vitamin B3, with its anti-inflammatory properties, has been suggested, while the involvement of NAM in DCs regulation remains elusive. Here, through analyzing publicly available databases, we observe substantial alterations in NAM levels and NAM metabolic pathways during DCs activation. Furthermore, we discover that NAM, but not Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN), significantly inhibits DCs over-activation in vitro and in vivo. The suppression of DCs hyperactivation effectively alleviates symptoms of psoriasis. Mechanistically, NAM impairs DCs activation through a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs)-NF-κB dependent manner. Notably, phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) and PARPs are significantly upregulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated DCs and psoriasis patients; elevated NAMPT and PARPs expression in psoriasis patients correlates with higher psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) scores. In summary, our findings underscore the pivotal role of NAM in modulating DCs functions and autoimmune disorders. Targeting the NAMPT-PARP axis emerges as a promising therapeutic approach for DC-related diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract Previous studies have found that the peripheral immune environment is closely related to the occurrence and development of intracranial aneurysms. However, it remains unclear how the metabolism of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the composition of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) changes in the process of intracranial aneurysm rupture. This study utilized cytometry by time of flight technology to conduct single‐cell profiling analysis of PBMCs and PMNs from 72 patients with IAs. By comparing the expression differences of key metabolic enzymes in PBMCs between patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms (RIAs) and unruptured intracranial aneurysms, we found that most PBMCs subsets from RIA group showed upregulation of rate‐limiting enzymes related to the glycolytic pathway. By comparing the composition of PMNs, it was found that the proinflammatory CD101+HLA DR+ subsets were increased in the RIA group, accompanied by a decrease in the anti‐inflammatory polymorphonuclear myeloid‐derived suppressor cells. In conclusion, this study showed the changes in the peripheral immune profile of RIAs, which is helpful for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying peripheral changes and provides a direction for future related research.">

        <tr id="Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages have important roles in the initiation and progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). These cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to generate immunophenotypes that promote leukocyte infiltration, axonal degeneration and demyelination, worsening MS pathology. The mechanisms that dictate metabolic programs in monocytes and macrophages in MS remain unclear. We previously reported that extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN, CD147), a glycoprotein that acts as a chaperone of monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), assisted with glycolysis-driven pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Using newly-generated CCR2CreERT2:EMMPRINfl/fl (CCR2:EMMP) mice, we report that presymptomatic deletion of EMMPRIN in CCR2+ monocytes prevented or reduced clinical disability of EAE. This was correspondent with decreased infiltration of leukocytes into the CNS. Single cell RNA-seq of blood monocytes from EAE and proteomics analysis of macrophages from CCR2:EMMP−/− mice revealed significant alterations in metabolic programs, particularly reduced glycolysis and elevated mitochondrial electron transport and fatty acid oxidation, which were linked to their reduced pro-inflammatory traits. Our findings implicate EMMPRIN as a key regulator of metabolic pathways that exacerbate pro-inflammatory functions of monocytes in MS.">

Prior studies showed that Dnase2-/- Ifnar-/- double knockout (DKO) mice develop Type I IFN-independent liver inflammation, but immune mechanisms were unclear. We now show that DKO mice recapitulate many features of human autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), including periportal and interstitial inflammation and fibrosis and elevated ALT. Infiltrating cells include CD8+ tissue resident memory T cells, type I innate lymphoid cells, and inflammatory monocyte/macrophage cells that replace the Kupffer cell pool. Importantly, TLR9 expression by bone marrow-derived cells is required for the the development of AIH. TLR9 is highly expressed by inflammatory myeloid cells but not long-lived Kupffer cells. Furthermore, the initial recruitment of TLR9 expressing monocytes and subsequent activation of lymphocytes requires IFNγ signaling.

        <tr id="Abundant infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor stroma plays a pivotal role in inducing immune escape in pancreatic cancer (PC). Lactate serves as a direct regulator of macrophage polarization and functions, although the precise regulation mechanism remain inadequately understood. Our study revealed that PC cells promote macrophage polarization towards the M2d phenotype through high lactate secretion. M2d is characterized by elevated secretion of IL-10 and VEGF-A, which diminish CD8+ T cells cytotoxicity and promote tumor neoangiogenesis simultaneously. Additionally, we identify 2,5'-oligoadenylate synthase 3 (OAS3) as an essential regulator of M2d polarization, upregulated by PC cells via lactate/METTL3/OAS3 axis. METTL3 mediated m6A modification on OAS3 mRNA correlates with increased OAS3 expression in TAMs, which is associated with poorer prognosis in PC patients. OAS3 deficiency in macrophages substantially impairs IL-10highVEGF-AhighM2d polarization and their pro-tumor functions while enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine (Gem) and anti-PD-L1 mAb in humanized mouse models. In conclusion, OAS3 presents as a promising immune therapeutic target for reversing IL-10highVEGF-AhighM2d infiltration and restoring CD8+ T cell mediated anti-tumor immunity in pancreatic cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract CD19‐targeted chimeric antigen receptor T‐cell (CAR‐T) immunotherapy has transformed the management of relapsed/refractory large B‐cell lymphoma (LBCL), yet durable remissions are observed in less than half of treated patients. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key and understudied factor impacting CD19 CAR‐T therapy outcomes. Using NanoString nCounter transcriptome profiling (n = 24) and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC, n = 15), we studied the TME in pretreatment biopsies from patients with LBCL undergoing CD19 CAR‐T therapy. Patients who achieved complete response (CR) after CAR‐T therapy demonstrated higher expression of genes associated with T‐cell trafficking and function, whereas those who did not achieve CR had higher expression of genes associated with macrophages and T‐cell dysfunction. Distinct patterns of immune infiltration and fibrosis in the TME were associated with CAR‐T therapy outcomes, and these findings were corroborated using artificial intelligence‐assisted image analyses. Patients who achieved CR had a lower proportion of the biopsy occupied by an interspersed immune infiltrate and a higher proportion of hypocellular/fibrotic regions. Furthermore, mIHC revealed lower density of CD4+ T cells and higher densities of both macrophages and tumor cells expressing PD‐L1 in non‐CR patients. Spatial analysis revealed that PD‐1+ T cells were in close proximity to PD‐L1+ macrophages or PD‐L1+ tumor cells in patients who did not compared to those who did achieve CR after CAR‐T therapy. These findings suggest that morphologic patterns in the TME and engagement of the PD‐1/PD‐L1 axis in pretreatment biopsies may impact CD19 CAR‐T immunotherapy response in patients with LBCL.">

        <tr id="Stem-like CD8+ T cells (TSL) are a subset of immune cells with superior persistence and antitumor immunity. They are TCF1+ PD-1+ and important for the expansion of tumor specific CD8+ T cells in response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. In acute infections, naïve CD8+ T cells differentiate into effector and memory CD8+ T cells; in cancer and chronic infections, persistent antigen stimulation can lead to T cell exhaustion. Recent studies have highlighted the dichotomy between late dysfunctional (or exhausted) T cells (TLD) that are TCF1– PD-1+ and self-renewing TCF1+ PD-1+ TSL from which they derive. TCF1+ TSL cells are considered to have stem cell-like properties akin to memory T cell populations and can give rise to cytotoxic effector and transitory T cell phenotypes (TTE) which mediate tumor control. In this review, we will discuss recent advances made in research on the formation and expansion of TSL, as well as distinct niches required for their differentiation and maintenance in the setting of cancer. We will also discuss potential strategies to generate these cells, with clinical implications for stemness enhancement in vaccine design, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and adoptive T cell therapies.">

        <tr id="Due to the historical dogma, that host defense against intracellular pathogens is mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence suggests a more complex and multifaceted role for B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. They accumulate at the side of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity continue to be unraveled. Apart from antibodies, B cells produce a wide range of cytokines, which can influence the local immune response. Here we addressed the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10) secreting B cells in long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Our research highlights the previously unknown role of B cell-derived IL-10 as a negative regulator of protective immunity in TB. For the first time, we demonstrate that mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 show increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, as evidenced by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was accompanied by male-specific immune alterations, indicating a previously unknown sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Background CD24 plays a crucial role not only in promoting tumor progression and metastasis but also in modulating macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity. However, the impact of tumor CD24 on the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains poorly explored. Here, we investigated the role of CD24a, murine CD24 gene, in the progression and immune dynamics of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods: We employed Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology to perform a gene knockout of Cd24a in 4T1 cells. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the distribution and number of immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and macrophages, within tumors, spleens, and bone marrow. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to detect these immune cells in tumor sections. Additionally, ANDOR Dragonfly High-Speed Confocal was used to perform three-dimensional (3D) mapping of mouse tumors. Results Our study showed that knocking out CD24a significantly impeded tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. Flow cytometry and IF analysis revealed that the loss of CD24a transformed tumor microenvironment from cold to hot by promoting the infiltration of M1 macrophages, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and CD49b+ natural killer (NK) cells while reducing the recruitment and expansion of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) in the TME. Additionally, the 3D mapping of TME further validated the “hot state” of CD24a knockout tumors. Conclusions Our study provides the first evidence that targeting CD24a could effectively reprogram the TME, enhancing its immunogenicity, and transforming immune cold tumors into hot tumors. This strategy may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing the immune response against poorly immunogenic tumors.">

        <tr id="Most patients treated with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells eventually experience disease progression. Furthermore, CAR T cells have not been curative against solid cancers and several hematological malignancies such as T cell lymphomas, which have very poor prognoses. One of the main barriers to the clinical success of adoptive T cell immunotherapies is CAR T cell dysfunction and lack of expansion and/or persistence after infusion. In this study, we found that CD5 inhibits CAR T cell activation and that knockout (KO) of CD5 using CRISPR-Cas9 enhances the antitumor effect of CAR T cells in multiple hematological and solid cancer models. Mechanistically, CD5 KO drives increased T cell effector function with enhanced cytotoxicity, in vivo expansion, and persistence, without apparent toxicity in preclinical models. These findings indicate that CD5 is a critical inhibitor of T cell function and a potential clinical target for enhancing T cell therapies. Deleting CD5 with CRISPR-Cas9 enhances T cell activation and proliferation, boosting their antitumor effects in multiple tumor models. Editor’s summary The currently available chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have had limited efficacy for a wide range of solid cancers and hematological malignancies, due in part to CAR T cell dysfunction. The scavenger receptor CD5 associates with the T cell receptor (TCR) and inhibits T cell function. Patel et al. show that genetic deletion of CD5 in CAR and TCR T cells enhances expansion, persistence, and cytotoxicity and is effective in preclinical solid tumor and hematological malignancy models. These results suggest that CD5 may be a critical negative regulator of CAR T cells that can be therapeutically targeted. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="Enrichment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMΦs) in the tumor microenvironment correlates with worse clinical outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, prompting the development of therapies to inhibit TAMΦ infiltration. However, the lackluster efficacy of CCL2-based chemotaxis blockade in clinical trials suggests that a new understanding of monocyte/macrophage infiltration may be necessary. Here we demonstrate that random migration, and not only chemotaxis, drives macrophage tumor infiltration. We identified tumor- associated monocytes (TAMos) that display a dramatically enhanced migration capability, induced rapidly by the tumor microenvironment, that drives effective tumor infiltration, in contrast to low-motility differentiated macrophages. TAMo, not TAMΦ, promotes cancer cell proliferation through activation of the MAPK pathway. IL-6 secreted both by cancer cells and TAMo themselves enhances TAMo migration by increasing dendritic protrusion dynamics and myosin- based contractility via the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Independent from CCL2 mediated chemotaxis, IL-6 driven enhanced migration and pro-proliferative effect of TAMo were validated in a syngeneic TNBC mouse model. Depletion of IL-6 in cancer cells significantly attenuated monocyte infiltration and reversed TAMo-induced cancer cell proliferation. This work reveals the critical role random migration plays in monocyte driven TAMΦ enrichment in a tumor and pinpoints IL-6 as a potential therapeutic target in combination with CCL2 to ameliorate current strategies against TAMΦ infiltration.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer of stem cells originating in the bone marrow. Increasing evidence suggests that AML survival and relapse are controlled by genetic alterations, as well as a functional interaction between the tumor and the immune system. In this review, we will discuss the biology of immune evasion in AML and explore the current landscape of immune-based therapies. We argue that a better understanding of the immune microenvironment in AML could help predict responses to immunotherapy and guide decisions for future treatment. Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex hematopoietic clonal disorder with limited curative options beyond stem cell transplantation. The success of transplant is intimately linked with the graft versus leukemia effect from the alloreactive donor immune cells including, T and NK cells. The immune system plays a dynamic role in leukemia survival and resistance. Despite our growing understanding of the immune microenvironment, responses to immune-based therapies differ greatly between patients. Herein, we review the biology of immune evasion mechanisms in AML, discuss the current landscape of immunotherapeutic strategies, and discuss the implications of therapeutic targets. This review focuses on T and NK cell-based therapy, including modified and non-modified NK cells, CAR-T and CAR-NK cells, antibodies, and checkpoint blockades. Understanding the complex interchange between immune tolerance and the emergence of tumor resistance will improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="In chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), tissue-resident self-reactive T cells perpetuate disease. The specific tissue factors governing the persistence and continuous differentiation of these cells remain undefined but could represent attractive therapeutic targets. In a model of chronic CNS autoimmunity, we find that oligodendrocyte-derived interleukin-33 (IL-33), an alarmin, is key for locally regulating the pathogenicity of self-reactive CD8+ T cells. The selective ablation of IL-33 from neo-self-antigen-expressing oligodendrocytes mitigates CNS disease. In this context, fewer self-reactive CD8+ T cells persist in the inflamed CNS, and the remaining cells are largely locked into a stem-like precursor program, failing to form TCF-1low effector progeny. Importantly, interventional IL-33 blockade by locally administered somatic gene therapy reduces T cell infiltrates and improves the disease course. Our study identifies oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 as a druggable tissue factor regulating the differentiation and survival of self-reactive CD8+ T cell in the inflamed CNS. This finding introduces tissue factors as a novel category of immune targets for treating chronic CNS autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Macrolide antibiotic azithromycin is widely used in clinical practice to treat respiratory tract infections and inflammatory diseases. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Given the involvement of the CD27 pathway in the pathophysiology of various T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory, autoimmune, and lymphoproliferative diseases, we examined the impact of AZM on CD27 regulation and potential consequences on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotypes. Using cellular immunology approaches on healthy donors’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we demonstrate AZM-mediated downregulation of surface CD27 expression as well as its extracellular release as soluble CD27. Notably, AZM-exposed CD27high (hi) cells were defective in their ability to expand compared to CD27intermediate (Int) and CD27low (lo) subsets. The defective CD27hi subset expansion was found to be associated with impaired cell proliferation and cell division. At the molecular level, the CD27hi subset exhibited lower mTOR activity than other subsets. Functionally, AZM treatment resulted in marked depletion of helper CD4+ (Th1) and cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte (Tc1)-associated CXCR3+CD27hi effector cells and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ production. These findings provide mechanistic insights on immunomodulatory features of AZM on T-lymphocyte by altering the CD27 pathway. From a clinical perspective, this study also sheds light on potential clinical benefits observed in patients on prophylactic AZM regimens against various respiratory diseases and opens avenues for future adjunct therapy against Th1- and Tc1-dominated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.">

Here, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from non-diabetes and T2D patients by scRNA-seq.

In T2D patients, cytotoxic CD4 T cells, effector memory CD8 T cells, and γδ T cells have increased cytotoxicity and clonal expansion. B cells were characterized by increased differentiation into intermediate B cells, plasma cells, and isotype class switching with increased expression of soluble antibody genes.

        <tr id="Differential antiviral T cell immunity in early life impacts the clinical outcome of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we found delayed enrichment of early-life murine CMV-specific CD8 T cells due to a general deficiency of αβ T cells. Adoptive transfer of naïve adult T cells into neonates did not protect due to a blockade of CD8 but not of CD4 effector T cell differentiation. Early-life deficiency of critical signal 3 cytokines during T cell priming resulted in the appearance of non-cytotoxic CD8 effector T cells whereas the effector phase of adult-primed T cells was not disrupted in neonates. Accordingly, we found an overall low number of antiviral human CD8 T cells in newborns with congenital CMV. Together, this study suggests defective CD8 T cell immunity as an important factor explaining the higher risk for CMV disease in the early-life phase.">

CDC42 upregulation in CD4+T cells underliesTh1 inflammation but the CD4+T cell subtype(s) with CDC42 upregulation and their contribution to steroid resistance are not known. Compared to healthy-weight asthma, obesity-alone and healthy-weight controls, single-cell transcriptomics of obese asthma CD4+T cells revealed CDC42 upregulation in 3 clusters comprised of naïve and central memory T cells, which differed from the cluster enriched for Th1 responses that was comprised of effector T cells. NR3C1, coding for glucocorticoid receptor, was downregulated, while genes coding for NLRP3 inflammasome were upregulated, in clusters with CDC42 upregulation and Th1 responses. Conserved genes in these clusters correlated with pulmonary function deficits in obese asthma. These findings suggest that several distinct CD4+T cell subtypes are programmed in obese asthma for CDC42 upregulation, Th1 inflammation, and steroid resistance, and together contribute to obese asthma phenotype. Summary CD4+T cells from obese children with asthma are distinctly programmed for non-allergic immune responses, steroid resistance and inflammasome activation, that underlie the obese asthma phenotype.">

Gastrointestinal inflammation has been suggested as a trigger of axSpA. We recently identified a bacterial peptide (YeiH) that can be presented by HLA-B*27 to expanded public T cell receptors in the joint in axSpA and the eye in B27AAU. While YeiH is present in enteric microbiota and pathogens, additional evidence that pathogenic T cells in HLA-B*27–associated autoimmunity may have had a prior antigenic encounter within the gastrointestinal tract remains lacking. Here, we analyzed ocular, synovial, and blood T cells in B27AAU and axSpA, showing that YeiH-specific CD8+ T cells express a mucosal gene set and surface proteins consistent with intestinal differentiation, including CD161, integrin α4β7, and CCR6. In addition, we found an expansion of YeiH-specific CD8+ T cells in axSpA and B27AAU blood compared with that from individuals acting as healthy controls, whereas influenza-specific CD8+ T cells were equivalent across groups. Finally, we demonstrated the dispensability of TRBV9 for antigen recognition. Collectively, our data suggest that, in HLA-B27–associated autoimmunity, early antigen exposure and differentiation of pathogenic CD8+ T cells may occur in enteric organs.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cancer can create a shield of suppressive innate immune cells that stop our body’s natural defenses from tumors. VTX-0811 is a new drug that targets these cells and turns them from allies of cancer to fighters against it. Preclinical tests show that it works in the lab on human cells and tumors and is safe and efficacious in animals. The results are promising and pave the way for human trials to see if VTX-0811 can become a new powerful weapon against cancer. Abstract Omnipresent suppressive myeloid populations in the tumor microenvironment limit the efficacy of T-cell-directed immunotherapies, become more inhibitory after administration of T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, and are overall associated with worse survival of cancer patients. In early clinical trials, positive outcomes have been demonstrated for therapies aimed at repolarizing suppressive myeloid populations in the tumor microenvironment. We have previously described the key role of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in maintaining an inhibitory state of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), most of which express high levels of PSGL-1. Here we describe a novel, first-in-class humanized high-affinity monoclonal antibody VTX-0811 that repolarizes human macrophages from an M2-suppressive phenotype towards an M1 inflammatory phenotype, similar to siRNA-mediated knockdown of PSGL-1. VTX-0811 binds to PSGL-1 of human and cynomolgus macaque origins without inhibiting PSGL-1 interaction with P- and L-Selectins or VISTA. In multi-cellular assays and in patient-derived human tumor cultures, VTX-0811 leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators. RNAseq data from VTX-0811 treated ex vivo tumor cultures and M2c macrophages show similar pathways being modulated, indicating that the mechanism of action translates from isolated macrophages to tumors. A chimeric version of VTX-0811, consisting of the parental murine antibody in a human IgG4 backbone, inhibits tumor growth in a humanized mouse model of cancer. VTX-0811 is exceptionally well tolerated in NHP toxicology assessment and is heading into clinical evaluation after successful IND clearance.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Human and mouse natural killer (NK) cells have been shown to develop memory-like function after short-term exposure to the cocktail of IL-12/15/18 or to overnight co-culture with some tumor cell lines. The resulting cells retain enhanced lytic ability for up to 7 days as well as after cryopreservation, and memory-like NK cells (mlNK) have been shown to induce complete remissions in patients with hematological malignancies. No single phenotype has been described for mlNK and the physiological changes induced by the short-term cytokine or tumor-priming which are responsible for these enhanced functions have not been fully characterized. Here, we have generated mlNK by cytokine and tumor-priming to find commonalities to better define the nature of NK cell “memory” in vitro and, for the first time, in vivo. Methods We initiated mlNK in vitro from healthy donors with cytokines (initiated cytokine-induced memory-like (iCIML)-NK) and by tumor priming (TpNK) overnight and compared them by high-dimensional flow cytometry, proteomic and metabolomic profiling. As a potential mechanism of enhanced cytolytic function, we analyzed the avidity of binding of the mlNK to NK-resistant tumors (z-Movi). We generated TpNK from healthy donors and from cancer patients to determine whether mlNK generated by interaction with a single tumor type could enhance lytic activity. Finally, we used a replication-incompetent tumor cell line (INKmune) to treat patients with myeloid leukaemias to potentiate NK cell function in vivo. Results Tumor-primed mlNK from healthy donors and patients with cancer showed increased cytotoxicity against multiple tumor cell lines in vitro, analogous to iCIML-NK cells. Multidimensional cytometry identified distinct memory-like profiles of subsets of cells with memory-like characteristics; upregulation of CD57, CD69, CD25 and ICAM1. Proteomic profiling identified 41 proteins restricted to mlNK cells and we identified candidate molecules for the basis of NK memory which can explain how mlNK overcome inhibition by resistant tumors. Finally, of five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or refractory acute myeloid leukemia treated with INKmune, three responded to treatment with measurable increases in NK lytic function and systemic cytokines. Conclusions NK cell “memory” is a physiological state associated with resistance to MHC-mediated inhibition, increased metabolic function, mitochondrial fitness and avidity to NK-resistant target cells.">

        <tr id="How group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) regulate mucosal protection in the presence of T cells remains poorly understood. Here, we examined ILC3 function in intestinal immunity using ILC3-deficient mice that maintain endogenous T cells, T helper 17 (TH17) cells, and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were dispensable for generation of TH17 and TH22 cell responses to commensal and pathogenic bacteria, and absence of ILC3s did not affect IL-22 production by CD4 T cells before or during infection. However, despite the presence of IL-22–producing T cells, ILC3s and ILC3-derived IL-22 were required for maintaining homeostatic functions of the intestinal epithelium. T cell–sufficient, ILC3-deficient mice were capable of pathogen clearance and survived infection with a low dose of Citrobacter rodentium. However, ILC3s promoted pathogen tolerance at early time points of infection by activating tissue-protective immune pathways. Consequently, ILC3s were indispensable for survival after high-dose infection. Our results demonstrate a context-dependent role for ILC3s in immune-sufficient animals and provide a blueprint for uncoupling of ILC3 and TH17 cell functions. In T cell–sufficient mice, ILC3s are required for mucosal protection from high-dose but not low-dose bacterial infection. Editor’s summary Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) contribute to intestinal homeostasis and immunity against gut pathogens. Distinguishing the functions of ILC3s from those of T helper 17 (TH17) cells has remained challenging because of similar transcription factor dependencies and cytokine production profiles. To better define ILC3-specific roles, Araujo et al. developed genetically engineered mice that lack ILC3s while retaining endogenous T cells and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were the primary producers of IL-22, which was required for the maintenance of intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. Whereas TH17 cells were sufficient to protect against low-dose Citrobacter rodentium infection, ILC3s provided early protection and were required for survival after high-dose infection. Together, these findings identify nonredundant functions of ILC3s in mucosal homeostasis and immunity. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Aberrant activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway causes autoimmunity in humans and mice; however, the exact mechanism by which the cGAS-STING pathway initiates adaptive immunity and tissue pathology is still not fully understood. Here, we used a cGAS knockin (KI) mouse model that develops systemic autoimmunity. In the lungs of cGAS-KI mice, blood vessels were enclosed by organized lymphoid tissues that resemble tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). Cell-intrinsic cGAS induction promoted up-regulation of CCR5 in CD8+ T cells and led to CCL5 production in vascular endothelial cells. Peripheral CD8+ T cells were recruited to the lungs and produced CXCL13 and interferon-γ. The latter triggered endothelial cell death, potentiated CCL5 production, and was essential for TLS establishment. Blocking CCL5 or CCR5, or depleting CD8+ T cells, impaired TLS formation. cGAS-mediated TLS formation also enhanced humoral and antitumor responses. These data demonstrate that cGAS signaling drives a specialized lymphoid structure that underlies autoimmune tissue pathology. cGAS initiates pulmonary TLS formation, which is dependent on the CCL5-CCR5 axis between endothelial cells and T cells. Editor’s summary Overactivation of the innate immune sensing cGAS-STING pathway can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. To investigate how cGAS hyperactivation drives lung inflammation, Zhao et al. generated a cGAS conditional knockin mouse model. Hyperactivation of cGAS resulted in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the lung, which enhanced antibody responses and antitumor immunity. CCL5-producing endothelial cells in the lung promoted CD8+ T cell recruitment to TLSs via CCR5 signaling, which was induced by T cell–intrinsic cGAS expression. Blocking CCR5/CCL5 impaired TLS formation, suggesting that CCR5/CCL5 could be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity or to enhance antitumor immunity. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="The aim of our study was to determine whether granzyme B-expressing regulatory B cells (GZMB+ B cells) are enriched in the blood of transplant patients with renal graft tolerance. To achieve this goal, we analysed two single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets: (1) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including GZMB+ B cells from renal transplant patients, i.e., patients with stable graft function on conventional immunosuppressive treatment (STA, n = 3), drug-free tolerant patients (TOL, n = 3), and patients with antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR, n = 3), and (2) ex-vivo-induced GZMB+ B cells from these groups. In the patient PBMCs, we first showed that natural GZMB+ B cells were enriched in genes specific to Natural Killer (NK) cells (such as NKG7 and KLRD1) and regulatory B cells (such as GZMB, IL10, and CCL4). We performed a pseudotemporal trajectory analysis of natural GZMB+ B cells and showed that they were highly differentiated B cells with a trajectory that is very different from that of conventional memory B cells and linked to the transcription factor KLF13. By specifically analysing GZMB+ natural B cells in TOLs, we found that these cells had a very specific transcriptomic profile associated with a reduction in the expression of HLA molecules, apoptosis, and the inflammatory response (in general) in the blood and that this signature was conserved after ex vivo induction, with the induction of genes associated with migration processes, such as CCR7, CCL3, or CCL4. An analysis of receptor/ligand interactions between these GZMB+/− natural B cells and all of the immune cells present in PBMCs also demonstrated that GZMB+ B cells were the B cells that carried the most ligands and had the most interactions with other immune cells, particularly in tolerant patients. Finally, we showed that these GZMB+ B cells were able to infiltrate the graft under inflammatory conditions, thus suggesting that they can act in locations where immune events occur.">

Further phenotypical analysis confirmed the granulocytic-like features of this monocyte subpopulation that is associated with an increase in granulocyte–monocyte precursors (GMPs) in the PB of these patients (pts). Mechanistically, this granulocyte-like monocyte population suppressed NK cell activity by inducing TIGIT and engaging NKp30. Accordingly, an increased frequency of TIGIT+ NK cells with impaired functions was found in both the PB and tumoral tissue of CRC pts.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite the considerable progress in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment, relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is still frequent and associated with a poor prognosis. Relapse has been shown to be correlated with an incomplete eradication of CD34+ leukemic stem cells prior to HSCT. Previously, we have shown that a novel CD34-directed, bispecific T-cell engager (BTE) can efficiently redirect the T-cell effector function toward cancer cells, thus eliminating leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. However, its impact on γδ T-cells is still unclear. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the CD34-specific BTE using in vitro expanded γδ T-cells as effectors. We showed that the BTEs bind to γδ T-cells and CD34+ leukemic cell lines and induce target cell killing in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, γδ T-cell mediated killing was found to be superior to αβ T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we observed that only in the presence of BTE the γδ T-cells induced primary AML blast killing in vitro. Importantly, our results show that γδ T-cells did not target the healthy CD34intermediate endothelial blood–brain barrier cell line (hCMEC/D3) nor lysed CD34+ HSCs from healthy bone marrow samples.">

        <tr id="During activation the T cell transmembrane receptor CD6 becomes incorporated into the T cell immunological synapse where it can exert both co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory functions. Given the ability of CD6 to carry out opposing functions, this study sought to determine how CD6 regulates early T cell activation in response to viral infection. Infection of CD6 deficient mice with a neurotropic murine coronavirus resulted in greater activation and expansion of CD4 T cells in the draining lymph nodes. Further analysis demonstrated that there was also preferential differentiation of CD4 T cells into T follicular helper cells, resulting in accelerated germinal center responses and emergence of high affinity virus specific antibodies. Given that CD6 conversely supports CD4 T cell activation in many autoimmune models, we probed potential mechanisms of CD6 mediated suppression of CD4 T cell activation during viral infection. Analysis of CD6 binding proteins revealed that infection induced upregulation of Ubash3a, a negative regulator of T cell receptor signaling, was hindered in CD6 deficient lymph nodes. Consistent with greater T cell activation and reduced UBASH3a activity, the T cell receptor signal strength was intensified in CD6 deficient CD4 T cells. These results reveal a novel immunoregulatory role for CD6 in limiting CD4 T cell activation and deterring CD4 T follicular helper cell differentiation, thereby attenuating antiviral humoral immunity. Importance CD6 monoclonal blocking antibodies are being therapeutically administered to inhibit T cell activation in autoimmune disorders. However, the multifaceted nature of CD6 allows for multiple and even opposing functions under different circumstances of T cell activation. We therefore sought to characterize how CD6 regulates T cell activation in the context viral infections using an in vivo murine coronavirus model. In contrast to its role in autoimmunity, but consistent with its function in the presence of superantigens, we found that CD6 deficiency enhances CD4 T cell activation and CD4 T cell help to germinal center dependent antiviral humoral responses. Finally, we provide evidence that CD6 regulates transcription of its intracellular binding partner UBASH3a, which suppresses T cell receptor signaling and consequently T cell activation. These findings highlight the context dependent flexibility of CD6 in regulating in vivo adaptive immune responses, which may be targeted to enhance anti-viral immunity.">

        <tr id="While most of the cancer immunotherapy strategies engage adaptive immunity, especially tumor-associated T cells, the small fraction of responding patients and types of cancers amenable, and the possibility of severe adverse effects limit its usage. More effective and general interventions are urgently needed. Recently, a de facto innate immune memory, termed ‘trained immunity’, has become a new research focal point, and promises to be a powerful tool for achieving long-term therapeutic benefits against cancers. Trained immunity-inducing agents such as BCG and fungal glucan have been shown to be able to avert the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), enhance T cell responses, and eventually lead to tumor regression. Here, we review the current understating of trained immunity induction and highlight the critical roles of emergency granulopoiesis, interferon γ and tissue-specific induction. Preclinical and clinical studies that have exploited trained immunity inducers for cancer immunotherapy are summarized, and repurposed trained immunity inducers from other fields are proposed. We also outline the challenges and opportunities for trained immunity in future cancer immunotherapies. We envisage that more effective cancer vaccines will combine the induction of trained immunity with T cell therapies.">

        <tr id="Concurrent KRAS LKB1 (STK11, KL) mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC) is particularly difficult to treat and does not respond well to current immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This is due to numerous mechanisms including low antigen presentation limiting T cell mediated killing. To activate anti-tumor immunity, we targeted tumor cell – natural killer (NK) cell interactions. We tested whether a novel antibody based therapeutic strategy that predominantly activates natural killer (NK) cells demonstrates efficacy in pre-clinical mouse models of KL NSCLC. NK cells rely on binding of ligands, such as Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I-related chain A or B (MICA/B), to the activating receptor NKG2D. Importantly MICA and MICB are widely expressed in elevated levels across NSCLC subtypes including KL lung cancers. Proteases with the tumor microenvironment (TME) can cleave these proteins rendering tumor cells less visible to NK cells. We therefore developed a MICA monoclonal antibody, AHA-1031, which utilizes two NK cell activating receptors. AHA1031 prevents ligand shedding without interfering with binding to NKG2D while targeting cancer cells to antibody mediated cell dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our therapeutic novel antibody has significant monotherapy activity in KL cancer models including xenografts of human cell lines and patient derived xenografts. Activating NK cells through MICA/B stabilization and inducing ADCC offers an alternative and potent therapy option in KL tumors. MICA/B are shed across different tumors making this therapeutic strategy universally applicable.">

        <tr id="Venous thromboembolism is common in individuals with chronic inflammatory diseases, but the pathogenic basis for this increased thrombotic risk remains poorly understood. Myeloid cell ‘trained immunity’ describes persistent innate immune cell memory arising from prior exposure to an inflammatory stimulus, leading to an enhanced immune response to subsequent unrelated stimuli. We identify enhanced myeloid cell prothrombotic activity as a novel maladaptive consequence of trained immunity. LPS stimulation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages trained previously with either β-glucan or free haem exhibited significantly enhanced procoagulant and antifibrinolytic gene expression and activity compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone. The β-glucan training-mediated increase in activated myeloid cell procoagulant activity was mediated by enhanced acid sphingomyelinase-mediated tissue factor (TF) functional decryption. Furthermore, pre-treatment with methyltransferase and acetyltransferase inhibitors to erase epigenetic marks associated with innate immune memory diminished trained macrophage TF gene expression in β-glucan-trained macrophages. Functional analysis of splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan-trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Remarkably, monocyte procoagulant activity increased proportionately with time since β-glucan administration, before plateauing at 4 weeks. Furthermore, haematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid isolated from β-glucan-trained mice possessed enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice. Trained immunity and associated metabolic perturbations may therefore represent novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in immunothrombotic disease development, opening new avenues for targeted intervention.">

Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that directly kill cancer cells and modulate the activation of other immune cells during anti-tumour immune response. NK cells in the lymph nodes are involved in the regulation of T-cell and B-cell populations and the clearance of viral infections. In solid tumours, lymph nodes are a frequent site of metastasis and immune cell priming, whilst in haematological malignancies, tumour cells can proliferate in the lymph nodes. Thus, lymph nodes are an important site in anti-tumour immunity and therapy resistance. It is therefore crucial to identify strategies to increase recruitment and overcome suppression of NK cells in the lymph node microenvironment to improve tumour clearance. In this review, we summarise the literature interrogating NK cell phenotype and function in the lymph nodes in the context of infection and cancer and evaluate both current and potential strategies to mobilise and activate NK cells within the lymph nodes of cancer patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) show signs of low-grade inflammation, which is related to the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the underlying triggers remain unknown. The gut microbiota is a plausible source as it comprises pro-inflammatory bacteria, bacterial metabolites and viruses, including (bacterio)phages. These prokaryotic viruses have been shown to mediate inflammatory responses in gastrointestinal disease. Given the differences in phage populations in healthy individuals versus those with cardiometabolic diseases such as T2D, we here questioned whether phages from T2D individuals would have increased immunogenic potential. To address this, we isolated intestinal phages from a fresh stool sample of healthy controls and individuals with newly diagnosed, treatment-naive T2D. Phages were purified using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation and incubated with healthy donor dendritic cells (DCs) and autologous T cells. Donors with T2D had slightly higher free viral particle numbers compared to healthy controls (p = .1972), which has been previously associated with disease states. Further, phages from T2D induced a higher inflammatory response in DCs and T cells than phages from HC. For example, the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on DCs (p < .001) and interferon-y secretion from T cells (p < .01) were increased when comparing the two groups. These results suggest that phages might play a role in low-grade inflammation in T2D individuals.">

        <tr id="NKT cells are innate-like T cells, recruited to the skin during viral infection, yet their contributions to long-term immune memory to viruses are unclear. We identified granzyme K, a product made by cytotoxic cells including NKT cells, is linked to induction of Th1-associated antibodies during primary dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. We examined the role of NKT cells in vivo using DENV-infected mice lacking CD1d-dependent (CD1ddep) NKT cells. In CD1d-KO mice, Th1-polarized immunity and infection resolution were impaired, which was dependent on intrinsic NKT cell production of IFN-γ, since it was restored by adoptive transfer of WT but not IFN-γ-KO NKT cells. Furthermore, NKT cell deficiency triggered immune bias, resulting in higher levels of Th2-associated IgG1 than Th1-associated IgG2a, which failed to protect against a homologous DENV re-challenge and promoted antibody-dependent enhanced disease during secondary heterologous infections. Similarly, Th2-immunity, typified by a higher IgG4:IgG3 ratio, was associated with worsened human disease severity during secondary infections. Thus, CD1ddep NKT cells establish Th1 polarity during the early innate response to DENV, which promotes infection resolution, memory formation and long-term protection from secondary homologous and heterologous infections. These observations illustrate how early innate immune responses during primary infections can influence secondary infection outcomes.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key effectors in co-ordinating inflammatory and immune responses to threats to the host. How macrophages decipher diverse danger signals to tailor inflammatory responses remains an unanswered question. Cell volume control is critical for normal cellular function. Disturbances in extracellular and intracellular homeostasis induce changes in cell volume, but the impact of disruptions in cell volume in controlling macrophage inflammatory responses is poorly understood. Here, we discover that macrophages use cell volume control as a bona fide danger sensing mechanism to promote and augment inflammatory responses. Using macrophages deficient in the volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), which lack cell volume control under hypo-osmotic conditions, we show that disruptions in cell volume are sensed by macrophages to drive a large transcriptomic response and induction of inflammation. Cell volume disruption, particularly loss of cell volume control, induces type I interferon signalling through a DNA– and STING-dependent mechanism, but independent of cGAS and 2’3’cGAMP transport. Further, we found that cell volume changes synergise with diverse pathogen-mediated signalling to augment type I interferon responses and exacerbate the cytokine storm in a mouse model of hyperinflammation. Our findings highlight cell volume as an important regulator in shaping inflammatory responses, adding to our understanding of how macrophages sense complex danger signals and threats.">

Because of its immunosuppressive nature, the TME can pose a challenge for cancer immunotherapies targeting solid tumors. Chemokines have emerged as a crucial element in enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, playing a direct role in immune cell signaling within the TME and facilitating immune cell migration towards cancer cells. However, chemokine ligands and their receptors exhibit context-dependent diversity, necessitating evaluation of their tumor-promoting or inhibitory effects based on tumor type and immune cell characteristics. This review explores the role of chemokines in tumor immunity and metastasis in the context of the TME. We also discuss current chemokine-related advances in cancer immunotherapy research, with a particular focus on lung cancer, a common cancer with a low survival rate and limited immunotherapy options.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) control adaptive immunity and restrain type 2 inflammation in allergic disease. Interleukin-33 promotes the expansion of tissue-resident Tregs and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s); however, how Tregs locally coordinate their function within the inflammatory niche is not understood. Here, we show that ILC2s are critical orchestrators of Treg function. Using spatial, cellular, and molecular profiling of the type 2 inflamed niche, we found that ILC2s and Tregs engage in a direct (OX40L-OX40) and chemotaxis-dependent (CCL1-CCR8) cellular dialogue that enforces the local accumulation of Gata3high Tregs, which are transcriptionally and functionally adapted to the type 2 environment. Genetic interruption of ILC2-Treg communication resulted in uncontrolled type 2 lung inflammation after allergen exposure. Mechanistically, we found that Gata3high Tregs can modulate the local bioavailability of the costimulatory molecule OX40L, which subsequently controlled effector memory T helper 2 cell numbers. Hence, ILC2-Treg interactions represent a critical feedback mechanism to control adaptive type 2 immunity. Treg-mediated constraint of adaptive type 2 inflammation is contingent on local dialogue with ILC2. Editor’s summary Regulatory T cells (Tregs) maintain the balance between protective and harmful inflammation, yet the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated restraint of type 2 immunity remain to be determined. Stockis et al. investigate how cross-talk between ILC2) and Tregs constrains adaptive type 2 immunity in mice. ILC2 were required for the expansion of tissue-resident Gata3high Tregs after IL-33 exposure. These Gata3high Tregs directly controlled the availability of the costimulatory molecule OX40L on ILC2, which facilitated the expansion of effector memory TH2 cells and promoted type 2 airway inflammation. These findings identify that ILC2 locally regulate both effector and regulatory T cells during type 2 inflammation. —Hannah Isles">

We investigated the impact of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) on blood-derived MAIT cells and report virus-mediated impairment of activation, cytokine production, and altered transcription factor expression by VZV infected (antigen+) and VZV exposed (antigen-) MAIT cells in response to TCR-dependent and -independent stimulation. Furthermore, we reveal that suppression of VZV exposed (antigen-) MAIT cells is not mediated by a soluble factor from neighbouring VZV infected (antigen+) MAIT cells. Finally, we demonstrate that VZV impairs the cytolytic potential of MAIT cells in response to riboflavin synthesising bacteria. In summary, we report a virus-mediated immune-evasion strategy that disarms MAIT cell responses.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β cells and involves an interplay between β cells and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), an enzyme implicated in inflammatory pathways in β cells and macrophages, using a mouse model in which the endogenous mouse Alox15 gene is replaced by the human ALOX12 gene. Our findings demonstrate that VLX-1005, a potent 12-LOX inhibitor, effectively delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes in human gene replacement non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. By spatial proteomics analysis, VLX-1005 treatment resulted in marked reductions in infiltrating T and B cells and macrophages with accompanying increases in immune checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and PD-1, suggesting a shift towards an immune-suppressive microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of isolated islets from inhibitor-treated mice revealed significant alteration of cytokine-responsive pathways. RNA sequencing of polarized proinflammatory macrophages showed that VLX-1005 significantly reduced the interferon response. Our studies demonstrate that the ALOX12 human replacement gene mouse provides a platform for the preclinical evaluation of LOX inhibitors and supports VLX-1005 as an inhibitor of human 12-LOX that engages the enzymatic target and alters the inflammatory phenotypes of islets and macrophages to promote the delay of autoimmune diabetes.">

        <tr id="The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to foreign antigens in food and commensal microbes with potential to induce adaptive immune responses. Peripherally induced T regulatory (pTreg) cells are essential for mitigating inflammatory responses to these agents1–4. While RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells (RORγt-APCs) were shown to program gut microbiota-specific pTregs5–7, understanding of their characteristics remains incomplete, and the APC subset responsible for food tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that RORγt-APCs are similarly required for differentiation of food antigen-specific pTregs and establishment of oral tolerance. The ability of these cells to direct both food and microbiota-specific pTreg cell differentiation is contingent on expression of RORγt and on a unique cis-regulatory element within the Rorc gene locus (Rorc(t) +7kb). Absent this +7kb element, there was a notable increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 (Th2) cells in lieu of pTregs, leading to compromised tolerance in a mouse asthma model. By employing single-cell analyses across these models, as well as freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, we identified a rare subset of evolutionarily conserved APCs that are dependent on RORγt, uniquely express the Prdm16 transcription factor, and are endowed with essential mediators for inducing pTreg cell differentiation. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of how RORγt-APCs develop and how they regulate T cell responses to food and microbial antigens could offer new insights into developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as organ transplant tolerance.">

Gamma delta (γδ) T cells in the context of HIV/Mtb coinfection have been understudied in children, despite in vitro evidence suggesting γδ T cells assist with Mtb control. We investigated whether boosting a specific subset of γδ T cells, phosphoantigen-reactive Vγ9+Vδ2+ cells, could improve TB outcome using a nonhuman primate model of pediatric HIV/Mtb coinfection. Juvenile Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), equivalent to 4–8-year-old children, were infected intravenously (i.v.) with SIV. After 6 months, MCM were coinfected with a low dose of Mtb and then randomized to receive zoledronate (ZOL), a drug that increases phosphoantigen levels, (n=5; i.v.) at 3- and 17-days after Mtb accompanied by recombinant human IL-2 (s.c.) for 5 days following each ZOL injection. A similarly coinfected MCM group (n=5) was injected with saline as a control. Vγ9+Vδ2+ γδ T cell frequencies spiked in the blood, but not airways, of ZOL+IL-2-treated MCM following the first dose, however, were refractory to the second dose. At necropsy eight weeks after Mtb, ZOL+IL-2 treatment did not reduce pathology or bacterial burden. γδ T cell subset frequencies in granulomas did not differ between treatment groups. These data show that transiently boosting peripheral γδ T cells with ZOL+IL-2 soon after Mtb coinfection of SIV-infected MCM did not improve Mtb host defense.">

        <tr id="Purpose: Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) inhibitors (BETi) have demonstrated epigenetic modulation capabilities, specifically in transcriptional repression of oncogenic pathways. Preclinical assays suggest that BETi potentially attenuates the PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis, supporting its combination with immunomodulatory agents. Patients and Methods: A Phase 1b clinical trial was conducted to elucidate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the BET inhibitor RO6870810, as monotherapy and in combination with the PD-L1 antagonist atezolizumab, in patients with advanced ovarian carcinomas and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Endpoints included maximum tolerated dosages, adverse event profiling, pharmacokinetic evaluations, and antitumor activity. Pharmacodynamic and immunomodulatory effects were assessed in tumor tissue (by immunohistochemistry and RNA-seq) and in peripheral blood (by flow cytometry and cytokine analysis). Results: The study was terminated prematurely due to a pronounced incidence of immune-related adverse effects in patients receiving combination of RO6870810 and atezolizumab. Anti-tumor activity was limited to 2 patients (5.6%) showing partial response. Although target engagement was confirmed by established BETi pharmacodynamic markers in both blood and tumor samples, BETi failed to markedly decrease tumor PD-L1 expression and had a suppressive effect on anti-tumor immunity. Immune effector activation in tumor tissue was solely observed with the atezolizumab combination, aligning with this checkpoint inhibitor's recognized biological effects. Conclusions: The combination of BET inhibitor RO6870810 with the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab presents an unfavorable risk-benefit profile for ovarian cancer and TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) patients due to the increased risk of augmented or exaggerated immune reactions, without evidence for synergistic anti-tumor effects.">

        <tr id="Abstract Liver metastases (LM) remain a major cause of cancer-related death and are a major clinical challenge. LM and the female sex are predictors of a poorer response to immunotherapy but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We previously reported on a sexual dimorphism in the control of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of colorectal carcinoma liver metastases (CRCLM) and identified estrogen as a regulator of an immunosuppressive TME in the liver. Here we aimed to assess the effect of estrogen deprivation on the cytokine/chemokine profile associated with CRCLM, using a multiplex cytokine array and the RNAscope technology, and its effects on the innate and adaptive immune responses in the liver. We also evaluated the benefit of combining the selective estrogen-receptor degrader Fulvestrant with immune checkpoint blockade for the treatment of CRCLM. We show that estrogen depletion altered the cytokine/chemokine repertoire of the liver, decreased macrophage polarization, as reflected in reduced accumulation of tumor infiltrating M2 macrophages and increased the accumulation of CCL5+/CCR5+ CD8+ T and NKT cells in the liver TME. Similar results were obtained in a murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma model. Importantly, treatment with Fulvestrant also increased the accumulation of CD8+CCL5+, CD8+CCR5+ T and NK cells in the liver TME and enhanced the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD1 immunotherapy, resulting in a significant reduction in the outgrowth of LM. Taken together, our results show that estrogen regulates immune cell recruitment to the liver and suggest that inhibition of estrogen action could potentiate the tumor-inhibitory effect of immunotherapy in hormone-independent and immunotherapy-resistant metastatic cancer. Significance: The immune microenvironment of the liver plays a major role in controlling the expansion of hepatic metastases and is regulated by estrogen.

        <tr id="After the primary response, circulating memory CD4+T effector and T regulatory cells (Treg) regulate recall responses, which are impaired in allergy. Using mass spectrometry, we discovered distinct metabolomes of these cells in humans and their unique enrichment in amino acids. By assessing energy metabolism in in vitro and ex vivo single-cell analyses, we determined that increased intracellular L-phenylalanine boosts glycolysis while limiting OXPHOS in CD4+T, memory CD4+T and Th2, but not in Treg cells. L-phenylalanine also restrains memory CD4+T proliferation in an IL4I1-dependent manner and inhibits Th2 cell proliferation and differentiation. RNA-sequencing, metabolomics, flow cytometry and proteomics, validated in vitro and across patients’ cohorts, revealed an impairment in LAT1-dependent transport of L-phenylalanine into Th2 cells in allergy with an increase in its intracellular processing, accompanied by an expansion of pathogenic Th2 cells. Thus, our study identifies L-phenylalanine as a checkpoint in the development, energy metabolism and function of Th2 cells.">

Individuals infected with Mtb who acquire HIV are approximately 16 times more likely to develop active tuberculosis. T cells play an important role as both targets for HIV infection and mediators of the immune response against both pathogens. This review aims to synthesize the current literature and provide insights into the effects of HIV/Mtb coinfection on T cell populations and their contributions to immunity. Evidence from multiple in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that T helper responses are severely compromised during coinfection, leading to impaired cytotoxic responses. Moreover, HIV’s targeting of Mtb-specific cells, including those within granulomas, offers an explanation for the severe progression of the disease. Herein, we discuss the patterns of differentiation, exhaustion, and transcriptomic changes in T cells during coinfection, as well as the metabolic adaptations that are necessary for T cell maintenance and functionality. This review highlights the interconnectedness of the immune response and the pathogenesis of HIV/Mtb coinfection.">

        <tr id="Objective: The immune response initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is poorly elucidated. We aimed to access and compare the antiviral cellular responses and lymphocytes activation between healthy pregnancies and pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We detected the immunological changes of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of healthy non-pregnant women, non-pregnant women with COVID-19, healthy pregnant women, pregnant women with COVID-19 and convalescent group by flow cytometry. In vitro blockade was used to identify NKT-like cell activation through ICOS-ICOSL pathway. Results: We found that CD3+CD56+ NKT-like cells decreased significantly in COVID-19 positive pregnant women compared to healthy pregnant women. NKT-like cells of pregnant women expressed higher level of activating receptors CD69 and NKp46 after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly, they also increased the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule ICOS. NKT-like cells of pregnant women with COVID-19 up-regulated the expression of IFN-γ, CD107a and Ki67. Meanwhile, we found that ICOSL expression was significantly increased on pDCs in pregnant women with COVID-19. Blocking ICOS in vitro significantly decreased the antiviral activity of NKT-like cells in COVID-19 positive pregnant women, suggesting that ICOS-ICOSL may play an important role in the virus clearance by NKT-like cells. Conclusions: During SARS-CoV-2 infection, NKT-like cells of pregnant women activated through ICOS-ICOSL pathway and played an important role in the antiviral response.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a challenging hematological malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) contribute to therapeutic failure, relapse, and adverse outcome. This study investigates the role of quiescence and related molecular mechanisms in AML pathogenesis and LSC functions to identify potential therapeutic targets. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the LSC-enriched quiescent cell population has a distinct gene signature with prognostic relevance in patients with AML. Mechanistically, quiescent blasts exhibit increased autophagic activity, which contributes to their sustained viability. Proteomic profiling uncovered differential requirements for iron metabolism between quiescent and cycling cells, revealing a unique dependence of quiescent cells on ferritinophagy, a selective form of autophagy mediated by nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), which regulates iron bioavailability. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of inhibiting NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy using genetic knockdown and chemical inhibition approaches. In vitro assays showed that suppression of NCOA4 was toxic to leukemic blasts, particularly the CD34+CD38− LSC-enriched population, without affecting normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. In vivo studies using murine patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of AML confirmed that NCOA4 inhibition reduced tumor burden and impaired LSC viability and self-renewal, indicating a specific vulnerability of these cells to ferritinophagy disruption. Our findings underscore the role of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in maintaining LSC quiescence and function and suggest that targeting this pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy for AML. This study highlights the potential of NCOA4 inhibition to improve AML outcomes and paves the way for future research and clinical development. Targeting quiescent leukemic stem cells through NCOA4-dependent ferritinophagy inhibition may improve therapeutic outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia. Editor’s summary Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are thought to be a main contributor to relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, Larrue et al. identified a reliance on ferritinophagy, a form of autophagy that relies on nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), in LSCs and demonstrated that inhibition reduced tumor growth in primary patient samples and mouse models. This represents a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with AML that will require further study. —Dorothy Hallberg">

NKT1 cells are susceptible to ARTC2-mediated P2X7 receptor (P2RX7) activation, but the effects on other unconventional T-cell types are unknown. Here, we show that MAIT, γδT, and NKT cells express P2RX7 and are sensitive to P2RX7-mediated cell death. Mouse peripheral T-bet+ MAIT1, γδT1, and NKT1 cells, especially in liver, co-express ARTC2 and P2RX7, which can be further upregulated by retinoic acid. Blocking ARTC2 or inhibiting P2RX7 protected MAIT1, γδT1, and NKT1 cells from cell death, enhanced their survival in vivo, and increased the number of IFN-γ-secreting cells without affecting IL-17 production. Importantly, this revealed the existence of IFN-γ and IL-4 co-producing unconventional T-cell populations normally lost upon isolation due to ARTC2/P2RX7-induced death. Administering extracellular NAD in vivo activated this pathway, depleting P2RX7-sensitive unconventional T cells. Our study reveals ARTC2/P2RX7 as a common regulatory axis modulating the unconventional T-cell compartment, affecting the viability of IFN-γ- and IL-4-producing T cells, offering important insights to facilitate future studies into how these cells can be regulated in health and disease.">

Expression of IRF8 mutants in murine B cell lymphomas suppressed CD4, but not CD8, activation elicited by antigen presentation and downmodulated CD74 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DM, intracellular regulators of antigen peptide processing/loading in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II. Concordantly, mutant IRF8 bound less efficiently to the promoters of these genes. Mice harboring IRF8 mutant lymphomas displayed higher tumor burden and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, typified by depletion of CD4, CD8, and natural killer cells, increase in regulatory T cells and T follicular helper cells.

        <tr id="Introduction Exosomes produced by the protozoan parasite Leishmania (LeishEXO) are well-established drivers of virulence, though mechanisms underlying their exacerbation of experimental leishmaniasis remain elusive. Expression of Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a protein implicated in exosome-mediated pathologies and viral internalization, has been shown to correlate with cutaneous leishmaniasis severity. Given ANXA1’s regulation of myeloid cells – the canonical hosts for Leishmania – we studied the potential role of ANXA1 and its receptors FPR1/2 in exerting LeishEXO’s effects. Methods Murine and in vitro ANXA1-/- models were used to study the generation of protective TH1 responses during experimental L. major infection with and without LeishEXO. Recruitment of inflammatory cells was assessed using a peritoneal cell recruitment assay and immunophenotyping, and production of inflammatory mediators was measured using a cytokine and chemokine array. Treatment of experimental models with FPR2 antagonist WRW4 and FPR1/2 agonist WKYMVm was used to delineate the role of the FPR/ANXA1 axis in LeishEXO-mediated hyperpathogenesis. Results We established that ANXA1 deficiency prohibits LeishEXO-mediated pathogenesis and myeloid cell infection, with minimal alterations to adaptive and innate immune phenotypes. FPR2 blockade with WRW4 similarly inhibited leishmanial hyperpathogenesis, while direct activation of FPRs with WKYMVm enhanced infection and recapitulated the LeishEXO-mediated phenotype. This research describes LeishEXO’s utilization of the ANXA1/FPR axis to facilitate parasitic internalization and pathogenesis, which may be leveraged in the development of therapeutics for leishmaniasis.">

        <tr id="The ability of an organism to overcome infectious diseases has traditionally been linked to killing invading pathogens. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that, apart from restricting pathogen loads, organismal survival is coupled to an additional yet poorly understood mechanism called disease tolerance.

We found that the FDA-approved BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a potent and rapid inducer of p16High immune subsets both in mice and humans. In turn, p16High immune cells were indispensable for counteracting different lethal conditions, including LPS-induced sepsis, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and ionizing irradiation. Mechanistically, we propose that activation of TLR7 or a low physiological activity of STING is sufficient to induce p16High immune subset that, in turn, establishes a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance. Furthermore, containing these signals within a beneficial range by deleting MDA5 that appeared sufficient to maintain a low activity of STING, induces p16High immune cells and delays organ deterioration upon aging with improved healthspan.

        <tr id="Background Increases in GPNMB are detectable in FTD-GRN cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-mortem brain, and brains of aged Grn-deficient mice. Although no upregulation of GPNMB is observed in the brains of young Grn-deficient mice, peripheral immune cells of these mice do exhibit this increase in GPNMB. Importantly, the functional significance of GPNMB upregulation in progranulin-deficient states is currently unknown. Given that GPNMB has been discussed as a potential therapeutic target in GRN-mediated neurodegeneration, it is vital for the field to determine what the normal function of GPNMB is in the immune system, and whether targeting GPNMB will elicit beneficial or deleterious effects. Methods The effects of GPNMB knock-down via antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) were assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 25 neurologically healthy controls (NHCs) and age- and sex-matched FTD-GRN patients, as well as peritoneal macrophages (pMacs) from progranulin-deficient (Grn-/-) and B6 mice. Lysosomal function, antigen presentation and MHC-II processing and recycling were assessed, as well as cytokine release and transcription. Results We demonstrate here that ASO-mediated knockdown of GPNMB increases lysosomal burden and cytokine secretion in FTD-GRN carrier and neurologically healthy controls (NHCs) monocytes. ASO-mediated knockdown of GPNMB in Grn-deficient macrophages decreased lysosomal pan-cathepsin activity and protein degradation. In addition, ASO-mediated knockdown of GPNMB increased MHC-II surface expression, which was driven by decreased MHC-II uptake and recycling, in macrophages from Grn-deficient females. Finally, ASO-mediated knockdown of GPNMB dysregulated IFNγ-stimulated cytokine transcription and secretion by mouse macrophages due to the absence of regulatory actions of the GPNMB extracellular fragment (ECF). Conclusions Our data herein reveals that GPNMB has a regulatory effect on multiple immune effector functions, including capping inflammation and immune responses in myeloid cells via secretion of its ECF. Therefore, in progranulin-deficient states, the drastic upregulation in GPNMB transcript and protein may represent a compensatory mechanism to preserve lysosomal function in myeloid cells. These novel findings indicate that targeted depletion in FTD-GRN would not be a rational therapeutic strategy because it is likely to dysregulate important immune cell effector functions.">

T cells are major IL-32 producers in these diseases and key mediators of pathogen and tumor elimination but also autoimmune destruction. However, their contribution to IL-32 biology during immune responses is hardly understood due to several isoforms with divergent inflammatory properties. Here, we identified IL-32β as the predominant isoform in various T cell subsets of healthy individuals and breast cancer patients with the highest levels detected in intratumoral regulatory T cells. We show that IL-32β is induced by IL-2 but IL-32β release requires T Cell Receptor rather than IL2R stimulation. Using inhibitors of protein secretion pathways and serial (ultra)centrifugation of T cell supernatants, we demonstrate that T cells actively secrete IL-32β unconventionally, as a free protein and, to a minor degree, through exosomes. Thus, our data identify activated T cells as major IL-32β secretors in health and cancer.">

CD4+CD8+ T cells are increased in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They are not only associated with joint erosions in established disease, but are also present in the pre-clinical stages of RA. This study aims to further investigate their expansion in the context of T cell clonality in patients with RA, as well as their responsiveness to T cell targeted treatment.


METHODS
Single-cell-(sc)RNA- and scTCR-sequencing data were used to determine co-receptor expression and T cell receptor sequences to assess clonality of CD4+CD8+ T cells in RA (n=3) patients and healthy controls (n=2). Peripheral CD4+CD8+ T cells and their subpopulations were measured in patients with RA (n=53), PsA (n=52) and healthy donors (n=50) using flow cytometry. In addition, changes in CD4+CD8+ T cell frequency were prospectively followed in RA patients receiving therapy with abatacept for 12 weeks.


RESULTS
We observed an increase of CD4+ T cells expressing CD8α in RA patients, both in comparison to PsA patients and to healthy controls. Clonality analysis revealed, that these CD4+CD8αlow T cells are part of large T cell clones, which cluster separately from CD4+CD8- T cell clones in the scRNA-seq gene expression analysis. Treatment with abatacept significantly reduced the frequency of peripheral CD4+CD8αlow T cells, and this was linked to reduction in disease activity.


CONCLUSION
In RA, clonal expansion of CD4+ T cell clones culminates in the emergence of peripheral CD4+CD8αlow T cells, which are associated with disease activity and diminished upon abatacept treatment, and which could contribute to disease pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus and the leading cause of infectious disease related birth defects worldwide. How the immune response modulates the risk of intrauterine transmission of HCMV after maternal infection remains poorly understood. Maternal T cells likely play a critical role in preventing infection at the maternal-fetal interface and limiting spread across the placenta, but concerns exist that immune responses to infection may also cause placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a guinea pig model of primary cytomegalovirus infection. Monoclonal antibodies specific to guinea pig CD4 and CD8 were used to deplete T cells in non- pregnant and in pregnant guinea pigs after mid-gestation. CD4+ T cell depletion increased the severity of illness, caused significantly elevated viral loads, and increased the rate of congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection relative to animals treated with control antibody. CD8+ T cell depletion was comparably well tolerated and did not significantly affect the weight of infected guinea pigs or viral loads in their blood or tissue. However, significantly more viral genomes and transcripts were detected in the placenta and decidua of CD8+ T cell depleted dams post-infection. This study corroborates earlier findings made in nonhuman primates that maternal CD4+ T cells play a critical role in limiting the severity of primary CMV infection during pregnancy while also revealing that other innate and adaptive immune responses can compensate for an absent CD8+ T cell response in α-CD8-treated guinea pigs. Author Summary Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is a leading cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes and preventable disability in children. Using guinea pigs, a well-established small animal model of congenital infection and intrauterine development, this study tested how depleting T cells affects the course of primary cytomegalovirus infections. Severe illness and high rates of congenital infection were observed when helper CD4+ T cells were depleted. The depletion of killer CD8+ T cells did not affect the severity of disease or the rate of congenital infection but did increase the amount of virus that was detected in the placenta. A greater understanding how an immune response can prevent the infection of the placenta and developing offspring is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic development. This study not only describes a new reagent that can be used to study the guinea pig immune system but also sheds new light in how adaptive immunity regulates congenital viral infection.">

        <tr id="Trm cells are sequestered at barrier tissues as a swift first line defense against peripheral reinfections in both antigen dependent and antigen independent bystander modes. Trm cells are also capable of mediating autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, wherein autoreactive Trm cells are aberrantly activated. To quickly combat infections, activated Trm cells can stimulate the influx and activation of memory T cells and innate immune cells. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the inflammatory responses that Trm cell populations can induce, specifically in the activation of the innate profile. Most studies to date have utilized a reductionist approach to examine single Trm populations, specific pathogens, and defined tissues. Herein, we adopted a more holistic approach utilizing barrier-free ‘dirty’ mice to profile activated innate cells attracted to the skin in the presence of quiescent cutaneous Trm cells. Notably, dirty mice are a more human predictive model due to having a diverse microbial experience that leads to the development of a complete complement of Trm cells in the skin. We demonstrate that in the dirty mouse model mice have a significant reduction in cutaneous neutrophils and monocytes compared to SPF mice following local treatment with two separate innate stimuli. These findings reveal that cutaneous Trm cells have the capacity to temper the innate immune response and further substantiate the implication that Trm cells are heterogenous in their functions depending in large part on their tissue residency. However, in an autoimmune microenvironment Trm cells are capable of recruiting innate cells to the site of an exposure to a damage-associated molecular pattern. Likely due to the imbalance of IL-17 and IFN-γ.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, is a promising treatment modality in oncology that involves augmenting the tumor-attacking capabilities of the immune system. Several preclinical and clinical studies have underscored the transformative potential of ICBs in the context of malignancies. 1 However, the efficacy of ICB therapy is often impeded by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in solid tumors, which are commonly due to a paucity of tumor neoantigens, checkpoint targets, and the inflammatory presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is profoundly immunosuppressive, which is the key reason for the limited clinical efficacy of ICB therapy. Within this milieu, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant myeloid cell subset, and their high infiltration levels have been implicated in mediating resistance to ICB therapy, thereby correlating with adverse prognosis across a spectrum of cancers. 3 Recent advances reported in Nature Cancer have shed light on specific TAM subpopulations that are instrumental in facilitating tumor immune evasion and resistance to ICB therapy. Two recent studies have delineated the roles of Sirp α + TAMs in colorectal cancer (CRC) 4 and Siglec-9 + TAMs in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM">

EOMES+type-1 regulatory (EOMES+Tr1-like) T-cells had a dysregulated homeostasis in multiple sclerosis (MS), which was related to their activation in the central nervous system (CNS). EOMES+Tr1-like cells were strongly enriched in patient’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and were the main IL-10-producing T-cells in the CSF. IL-10+EOMES+Tr1-like were present in MS brain lesions, and some were found close to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-infected B-cells. EOMES+Tr1-like cells and FOXP3+Tregs produced IL-10 with EBV-derived antigens, but not with major myelin antigens. EOMES+Tr1-like cells responded selectively to the latency-associated antigen EBNA1, whereas FOXP3+Tregs responded also to lytic antigens. EBNA1-specific EOMES+Tr1-like cells were associated with anti-EBNA1 IgG, disappeared upon therapeutic B-cell depletion and were relatively abundant in patients with the HLA-DRB1*15 risk haplotype. The aberrant anti-viral specificities of Tregs in MS could undermine their protective functions and anti-EBV immune surveillance.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) mediate host defense against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and tumors. However, the magnitude of CTL response and their function needed to confer heterosubtypic immunity against influenza virus infection are unknown. We addressed the role of CD8+ T cells in the absence of any cross-reactive antibody responses to influenza viral proteins using an adenoviral vector expressing a 9mer amino acid sequence recognized by CD8+ T cells. Our results indicate that both CD8+ T cell frequency and function are crucial for heterosubtypic immunity. Low morbidity, lower viral lung titers, low to minimal lung pathology, and better survival upon heterosubtypic virus challenge correlated with the increased frequency of NP-specific CTLs. NP-CD8+ T cells induced by differential infection doses displayed distinct RNA transcriptome profiles and functional properties. CD8+ T cells induced by a high dose of influenza virus secreted significantly higher levels of IFN-γ and exhibited higher levels of cytotoxic function. The mice that received NP-CD8+ T cells from the high-dose virus recipients through adoptive transfer had lower viral titers following viral challenge than those induced by the low dose of virus, suggesting differential cellular programming by antigen dose. Enhanced NP-CD8+ T-cell functions induced by a higher dose of influenza virus strongly correlated with the increased expression of cellular and metabolic genes, indicating a shift to a more glycolytic metabolic phenotype. These findings have implications for developing effective T cell vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.


IMPORTANCE
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are an important component of the adaptive immune system that clears virus-infected cells or tumor cells. Hence, developing next-generation vaccines that induce or recall CTL responses against cancer and infectious diseases is crucial. However, it is not clear if the frequency, function, or both are essential in conferring protection, as in the case of influenza. In this study, we demonstrate that both CTL frequency and function are crucial for providing heterosubtypic immunity to influenza by utilizing an Ad-viral vector expressing a CD8 epitope only to rule out the role of antibodies, single-cell RNA-seq analysis, as well as adoptive transfer experiments. Our findings have implications for developing T cell vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.">

        <tr id="Objective: To investigate the expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in circulating exosomes, and to define the role of exosomal PD-L1 in promoting immune escape mechanism during chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) and related liver diseases. Methods: The levels of PD-L1 expressed in exosomes were detected by ELISA. CD8+T cells were sorted and cytotoxicity test was assessed by flow cytometry. PD-L1 protein expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: Circulating exosomal PD-L1 levels were significantly higher in patients with CHB and HCC than in healthy controls (F =7.46, P=0.001). Levels of CD107a on CD8+T cells in patients with CHB receiving PD-L1 blocking antibody were significantly lower than in patients receiving isotype blocking antibody (t = 4.96, P < 0.01). Levels of TNF-α in cell culture supernatants of the PD-L1 blocking antibody group were significantly higher than in the isotype blocking antibody group (t =5.92, P < 0.01). Compared with patients receiving isotype blocking antibody, levels of CD107a on CD8+T cells significantly increased in patients with HCC receiving anti-PD-L1 antibody (t = 3.51, P<0.05). Compared with adjacent tissues, the levels of PD-L1 protein expression in HCC tissues were slightly higher; however, no significant difference between the two groups was observed. Conclusions: PD-L1 blockade in exosomes might promote the cytotoxic function of CD8+T cells and inhibit immune evasion during progression of HCC. Blocking PD-L1 in exosomes reduced the cytotoxic function of CD8+T cells in patients with CHB while enhancing the production of proinflammatory cytokines.">

        <tr id="Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) represents endogenous mechanisms of negative immunoregulation. While the modulation of effector functions has been the major focus of PD-1 research, quick PD-1 upregulation in naïve T cells starting 1 h after priming raised a possibility that PD-1 also affects the development of effector T cells. The role of PD-1 in functional differentiation into Th1 and Th2 has been unclear. In murine naïve CD4+ T cell activation, we found that PD-1 stimulation during the early stage of T cell activation strongly impaired Th2 cell development, while Th1 cell induction was relatively resistant to this immunosuppressive signaling. The steep decline in Th2 cell induction suggested the significance of PD-1 in allergic inflammation. Treatment with anti-human PD-1 agonist antibody inhibited allergic inflammation in human PD-1-knock-in mice as shown by the reduction of Th2 cells, IgE levels and eosinophilic infiltration. This study shows that PD-1 regulates not only the intensity but also the quality of immune response by deviating Th differentiation. PD-1 stimulators are projected to be valuable in suppressing various forms of inflammatory activities, but the efficacy against Th2-dominant immune response may be particularly high.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoints are mechanisms that allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and avoid destruction by the body’s immune system. Tumor cells exploit immune checkpoint proteins to inhibit T cell activation, thus enhancing their resistance to immune attacks. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, like nivolumab, work by reactivating these suppressed T cells to target cancer cells. However, this reactivation can disrupt immune balance and cause immune-related adverse events. This report presents a rare case of prurigo nodularis that developed six months after administering nivolumab for lung adenocarcinoma. While immune-related adverse events are commonly linked to T helper-1- or T helper-17-type inflammations, T helper-2-type inflammatory reactions, as observed in our case, are unusual. The PD-1–PD-L1 pathway is typically associated with T helper-1 and 17 responses, whereas the PD-1–PD-L2 pathway is linked to T helper-2 responses. Inhibition of PD-1 can enhance PD-L1 functions, potentially shifting the immune response towards T helper-1 and 17 types, but it may also influence T helper-2-type inflammation. This study reviews T helper-2-type inflammatory diseases emerging from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, highlighting the novelty of our findings.">

        <tr id="Combination therapy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved the prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but many patients still have unsatisfactory outcomes. CD8 T cells are known to exert a pivotal function in the immune response against tumors. Nevertheless, most CD8 T cells in HCC tissues are in a state of exhaustion, losing the cytotoxic activity against malignant cells. Cytokines, mainly secreted by immune cells, play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here, we demonstrated the changes in exhausted CD8T cells during combination therapy by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on tumor samples before and after treatment. Combination therapy exerted a substantial impact on the exhausted CD8T cells, particularly in terms of cytokine expression. CCL5 was the most abundantly expressed cytokine in CD8T cells and exhausted CD8T cells, and its expression increased further after treatment. Subsequently, we discovered the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on CCL5-stimulated Huh7 cells and verified through a series of experiments that this pathway can mediate the resistance of liver cancer cells to lenvatinib. Tissue experiments showed that after combination therapy, the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway was activated, which can benefit the residual tumor cells to survive treatment. Tumor-bearing mouse experiments demonstrated that bergamottin (BGM), a competitive inhibitor of CYP1A1, can enhance the efficacy of both lenvatinib and combination therapy. Our research revealed one mechanism by which hepatoma cells can survive the combination therapy, providing a theoretical basis for the refined treatment of HCC.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant aggravating factor in individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for TB, and HIV-1 target macrophages. Understanding how Mtb subverts these cells may facilitate the identification of new druggable targets. Here, we explored how TB can induce macrophages to form tunneling nanotubes (TNT), promoting HIV-1 spread. We found that TB triggers metabolic rewiring of macrophages, increasing their glycolytic ATP production. Using pharmacological inhibitors and glucose deprivation, we discovered that disrupting aerobic glycolysis significantly reduces HIV-1 exacerbation in these macrophages. Glycolysis is essential for tunneling nanotubes (TNT) formation, which facilitates viral transfer and cell-to-cell fusion and induces the expression of the sialoadhesin Siglec-1, enhancing both HIV-1 binding and TNT stabilization. Glycolysis did not exacerbate HIV-1 infection when TNT formation was pharmacologically prevented, indicating that higher metabolic activity is not sufficient per se to make macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1. Overall, these data might facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting glycolytic activity in TB-induced immunomodulatory macrophages to ultimately halt HIV-1 dissemination in co-infected patients.">

        <tr id="The communication mechanism of the gut–lung axis has received increasing attention in recent years, particularly in acute respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza. The peripheral immune system serves as a crucial bridge between the gut and the lungs, two organs that are not in close proximity to each other. However, the specific communication mechanism involving gut microbiota, immune cells, and their anti-influenza effects in the lung remains to be further elucidated. In this study, the effects of 731 species of peripheral immune cells and 211 different gut microbiota on influenza outcomes were analyzed using a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. After identifying specific species of gut microbiota and peripheral immune cells associated with influenza outcomes, mediation analyses were conducted to determine the mediating effects of specific immune cells in the protective or injurious effects of influenza mediated by gut microbiota. 19 species of gut microbiota and 75 types of peripheral immune cells were identified as being associated with influenza susceptibility. After rigorous screening, 12 combinations were analyzed for mediated effects. Notably, the down-regulation of CD64 on CD14- CD16- cells mediated 21.10% and 18.55% of the protective effect of Alcaligenaceae and Dorea against influenza, respectively. In conclusion, focusing on influenza, this study genetically inferred different types of gut microbiota and peripheral immune cells to determine their protective or risk factors. Furthermore, mediation analysis was used to determine the proportion of mediating effects of peripheral immune cells in gut microbiota-mediated susceptibility to influenza. This helps elucidate the gut–lung axis mechanism by which gut microbiota affects influenza susceptibility from the perspective of regulation of peripheral immune cells.">

 A major challenge in osteosarcoma (OS) immunotherapy is overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), to restore immune recognition and destruction of tumor cells. One of the key immune cell subsets known to contribute to the immunosuppressive TME are M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Our work aims to identify novel oncolytic virus (OV) combination immunotherapies to induce direct lysis of OS tumor cells, activate immune-mediated destruction of OS, and remodel the immunosuppressive TME. The direct lytic activity of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV; HSV1716) treatment was assessed using LIVE/DEAD flow cytometry and viral replication was measured using standard plaque assay. NK cell degranulation and killing assays were performed by co-culture of OS cell lines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) treated ± oHSV; NK cell degranulation and target cell death was assessed by flow cytometry. TAMs were generated in vitro by co-culture of PBMC with OS cell lines or primary bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for 7 days. Phagocytosis assays were performed by co-culture of TAMs with OS cells using fluorescent cell tracker stains and flow cytometry. Multicellular spheroids were generated by co-culture of firefly luciferase-expressing OS cell lines with CD14+ monocytes and bone marrow derived MSCs for 7 days in low adhesion plates, viability of tumor cells after treatment was assessed by addition of d-luciferin and quantification of luminescence. Treatment of four OS cell lines with oHSV for 72 hours resulted in <20% cell death by direct lysis. However, after treatment with oHSV-GFP, >95% of OS cells were GFP+ and viral titer increased up to 105-fold when compared to viral input. This highlighted high levels of infection and replication of oHSV within OS cell lines, despite limited oncolysis. Moreover, oHSV treatment of PBMC significantly enhanced the immune-mediated killing of OS cell lines, and this was NK cell dependent. Monolayer co-culture of PBMC with OS cell lines or MSC generated TAMs with significantly increased pro-tumor M2-like phenotype (CD14+CD206+CD163+), when compared with PBMC cultured alone, and TAMs suppressed NK cell degranulation against OS cell lines. Treatment of TAMS with oHSV encoding GM-CSF reduced the proportion of M2 TAMs. Moreover, treatment of OS target cells with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) and co-culture with in vitro generated TAMs significantly increased their phagocytic activity. Multicellular spheroids incorporating MSCs and CD14+ monocytes displayed a high degree of resistance against immune-mediated killing, when compared with OS cell line alone as monolayer or spheroid cultures. However, combination of OV with anti-EGFR mAb significantly increased immune-mediated killing against multicellular spheroids. oHSV combination strategies with mAb may be a promising treatment strategy against OS, to exert direct oncolysis, stimulate immune-mediated destruction, and remodel the immunosuppressive TME.

        <tr id="Hepatitis B, caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), often progresses to chronic infection, leading to severe complications, such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic HBV infection is characterized by a complex interplay between the virus and the host immune system, resulting in immune cell exhaustion, a phenomenon commonly observed in chronic viral infections and cancer. This state of exhaustion involves elevated levels of inhibitory molecules, cells, and cell surface receptors, as opposed to stimulatory counterparts. This review aims to elucidate the expression patterns of various co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptors on immune cells isolated from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. By analyzing existing data, the review conducts comparisons between CHB patients and healthy adults, explores the differences between HBV-specific and total T cells in CHB patients, and examines variations between intrahepatic and peripheral immune cells in CHB patients. Understanding the mechanisms underlying immune exhaustion in CHB is crucial for developing novel immunotherapeutic approaches. This detailed analysis sheds light on the immune exhaustion observed in CHB and lays the groundwork for future combined immunotherapy strategies aimed at leveraging checkpoint receptors to restore immune function and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Liver fibrosis associated with increased mortality is caused by activation of hepatic stellate cells and excessive production and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to fibrotic insults. It has been shown that in addition to liver inflammation, systemic inflammation also contributes to liver fibrogenesis. A deeper understanding of mechanisms that control liver fibrotic response to intra- and extra-hepatic inflammation is essential to develop novel clinical strategies against this disease. Extracellular vesicles (EV) have been recognized as immune mediators that facilitate activation of hepatic stellate cells. In inflammatory diseases, activated neutrophils release neutrophil elastase (NE) bound to EV, which has been identified as a significant contributor to inflammation by promoting immune cell activation. Here, we aimed to explore the role of inflammation derived plasma EV-associated NE in liver fibrogenesis and its potential mechanisms. We show EV-associated NE induces activation, proliferation and migration of hepatic stellate cells by promoting activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This effect did not occur through EV without surface NE, and Sivelestat, a NE inhibitor, inhibited activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway mediated by EV-associated NE. Moreover, we found plasma EV-associated NE increases deposition of collagen1 and α-smooth muscle actin in the liver of a mouse model of liver fibrosis (Mdr2-/-). Notably, this effect does not occur in control mice without preexisting liver disease. These data suggest that EV-associated NE is a pro-fibrogenic factor for hepatic stellate cell activation via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in pre-existing liver injuries. Inhibition of the plasma EV-associated NE in inflammatory conditions may be a therapeutic target for liver fibrosis in patients with inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract Type I interferons (IFN) are immune-stimulatory cytokines involved in antiviral and antitumor immune responses. They enhance the efficacy of immunogenic anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy by activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Macrophages are one of the most abundant innate immune cells in the immune microenvironment of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) and can exert potent immune-suppressive functions. Here, we investigate the potential of tumoral type I IFNs to repolarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in two murine MBM models and assess the effects of radiotherapy-induced type I IFN on TAMs in a transcriptomic MBM patient dataset. In mice, we describe a proinflammatory M1-like TAM phenotype induced by tumoral IFNβ and identify a myeloid type I IFN-response signature associated with a high M1/M2-like TAM ratio. Following irradiation, patients with MBM displaying a myeloid type I IFN-response signature showed increased overall survival, providing evidence that tumoral IFNβ supports an effective antitumor immune response by re-educating immune-regulatory TAM. These findings uncover type I IFN–inducing therapies as a potential macrophage-targeting therapeutic approach and provide a rationale for combining radiotherapy with concomitant immunotherapy to improve treatment response in patients with MBM. Significance: Our study shows that re-education of tumor-associated macrophages by tumoral IFNβ translates into improved clinical outcome in patients with melanoma brain metastases, providing pathomechanistic insights into synergistic type I interferon–inducing therapies with immunotherapies and warranting investigation of IFNβ as a predictive biomarker for combined radioimmunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis and AIDS remain two of the most relevant human infectious diseases. The pathogens that cause them, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV, individually elicit an immune response that treads the line between beneficial and detrimental to the host. Co-infection further complexifies this response since the different cytokines acting on one infection might facilitate the dissemination of the other. In these responses, the role of type I interferons is often associated with antiviral mechanisms, while for bacteria such as Mtb, their importance and clinical relevance as a suitable target for manipulation are more controversial. In this article, we review the recent knowledge on how these interferons play distinct roles and sometimes have opposite consequences depending on the stage of the pathogenesis. We highlight the dichotomy between the acute and chronic infections displayed by both infections and how type I interferons contribute to an initial control of each infection individually, while their chronic induction, particularly during HIV infection, might facilitate Mtb primo-infection and progression to disease. We expect that further findings and their systematization will allow the definition of windows of opportunity for interferon manipulation according to the stage of infection, contributing to pathogen clearance and control of immunopathology.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background and Aim Chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection remains a major public health problem. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2018 Hepatitis B Guidelines provide that CHB individuals not requiring antiviral therapy yet are monitored to determine the need for antiviral therapy in the future; however, these tests do not include measurement of cytokines and immune cell characterization. This case‐control study compared the cytokine and immune checkpoint protein expression profiles between CHB individuals not yet on antiviral treatment and hepatitis B virus (HBV)‐negative individuals. Methods CD4 and CD8 T cells from CHB and HBV‐negative individuals were characterized for immune checkpoint proteins programmed cell death‐1 (PD1), T cell Immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain‐containing protein 3 (TIM‐3), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte‐associated antigen 4 (CTLA‐4) (CD152), and a memory marker CXCR3 (CD183) using flow cytometry. Malaria‐induced cytokine expression levels were determined by stimulating their blood cells with Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain antigens (CSP, AMA‐1, and TRAP) in whole blood assays, and cytokine levels were measured using a 13‐plex Luminex kit. Results HBV‐negative and CHB individuals had comparable levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, a proportion of the CD4+ and CD8+ populations from both groups, which were CXCR3+, expressed PD‐1 and CD152. The ability to produce cytokines in response to malaria antigen stimulation was not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion These findings support excluding CHB individuals from antiviral therapy at this stage of infection. However, CHB individuals require regular monitoring to determine the need for later antiviral treatment.">

        <tr id="PRF1 (perforin 1) is a key cytotoxic molecule that plays a crucial role in the killing function of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Recent studies have focused on PRF1’s role in cancer development, progression, and prognosis. Studies have shown that aberrant PRF1 expression has a significant role to play in cancer development and progression. In some cancers, high expression of the PRF1 gene is associated with a better prognosis for patients, possibly because it helps enhance the body’s immune response to tumors. However, some studies have also shown that the absence of PRF1 may make it easier for tumors to evade the body’s immune surveillance, thus affecting patient survival. Furthermore, recent studies have explored therapeutic strategies based on PRF1, such as enhancing the ability of immune cells to kill cancer cells by boosting PRF1 activity. In addition, they have improved the efficacy of immunotherapy by modulating its expression to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment. Based on these findings, PRF1 may be a valuable biomarker both for the treatment of cancer and for its prognosis in the future. To conclude, PRF1 has an important biological function and has clinical potential for the treatment of cancer, which indicates that it deserves more research and development in the future.">

        <tr id="Introduction Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important tropical and neglected disease and represents a serious global health problem. The initial interaction between the phagocytes and the parasite is crucial to determine the pathogen’s capacity to initiate infection and it shapes the subsequent immune response that will develop. While type-1 T-cells induce IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-12 production by monocytes/macrophages to fight the infection, type-2 T-cells are associated with a regulatory phenotype (IL-10 and TGF-β) and successful infection establishment. Recently, our group demonstrated the role of an important Th1/Th17 T-cell population, the mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, in VL. MAIT cells can respond to L. infantum by producing TNF-α and IFN-γ upon MR1-dependent activation. Objective and methods Here, we describe the impact of the MR1-blockage on L. infantum internalization on the functional profile of circulating neutrophils and monocytes as well as the impact of the MR1-blockage on the soluble mediator signatures of in vitro whole blood cultures. Results Overall, our data showed that VL patients presents higher percentage of activated neutrophils than asymptomatic and non-infected controls. In addition, MR1 blockade led to lower TNF-α and TGF-β production by non-activated neutrophils from asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, TNF-α and IL-10 production by monocytes was higher in VL patients. In the analysis of soluble mediators produced in vitro, MR1-blockade induced a decrease of IFN-γ and an increase of IL-10, IL-27 and IL-33 in the cell cultures of AS group, a cytokine pattern associated with type 2 deleterious response. Discussion and conclusion These data corroborate the hypothesis that MR1-restricted responses are associated to a protective role during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="T cells play important roles in antitumor immunity. However, given that the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor microenvironment confers resistance to T cell-based immunotherapies, novel strategies to boost T cell-mediated antitumor efficacy are urgently needed for the treatment of HCC. Here, we show that high proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type9 (PCSK9) expression was negatively associated with HCC patient's overall survival and markers of CD8+ T cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9 enhanced tumor-specific killing and downregulated PD-1 expression of AFP-specific TCR-T. Inhibition of PCSK9 significantly enhances the anti-HCC efficacy of TCR-T cells and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in vivo. Moreover, PCSK9 inhibitor suppressed HCC growth dependent on CD8+ T cells. Mechanically, pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9 promoted low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-mediated activation of mTORC1 signaling in CD8+ T cells. LDLR deficiency was shown to impair cellular mTORC1 signaling and the anti-HCC function of CD8 T cells. On the basis of our findings in this study, we propose a potential metabolic intervention strategy that could be used to enhance the antitumor effects of immunotherapy for HCC.">

        <tr id="To efficiently absorb nutrients and facilitate microbial commensalism, the host establishes tolerogenic immune programs against dietary and commensal antigens, promoted by peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs)1,2. Previous research into which antigen-presenting cells (APCs) initiate dietary pTreg responses focused on type 1 DCs (cDC1)3. However, we now report that food-specific pTreg cells are exclusively induced by the recently identified RORγt+ APCs4–8, and not by cDC1. Instead, pTregs interact with cDC1 to regulate the response of food-specific CD8αβ T cells that accumulate in the lamina propria (LP) and epithelial layer of the small intestine (SI) and express memory markers. Upon infection with pathogens that mimic dietary antigens, food-specific CD8αβ cells activate an effector program to potentially guard against ‘Trojan horse’ attacks. Uniquely, after the infection resolves, these cells do not respond to their corresponding dietary antigens, allowing for safe food consumption. Based on our findings, we propose that in response to dietary antigens, dedicated antigen-presenting cells direct a unique CD8αβ response that is coupled to the pTreg program to facilitate protective acute effector responses within the overall strategy of tolerance.">

        <tr id="Foxp3+ Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a subset of CD4+ T cells that play critical functions in maintaining tolerance to self antigens and suppressing autoimmunity, regulating immune responses to pathogens and have a role in the pathophysiology of anti-tumoural immunity. Treg ontogeny is complex since they are generated following recognition of self antigens in the thymus during normal T cell development (thymic Treg), but are also induced from mature conventional T cells when activated by foreign antigen with appropriate additional cues (inducible Treg). How these distinct ontogenic pathways contribute to the maintenance and function of the mature Treg compartment in health and disease remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of fate mapping approaches in mice to map the ontogeny of Treg subsets throughout life and estimate rates of production, loss and self-renewal. We find that naive and effector/memory (EM) Treg subsets exhibit distinct dynamics but are both continuously replenished by de novo generation throughout life. Using an inducible Foxp3-dependent Cre fate reporter system, we show that naive Treg and not conventional T cells, are the predominant precursors of EM Treg in adults. Tonic development of new EM Treg is not influenced by foreign antigens from commensals, rather suggesting a role for self recognition. To investigate the ontogeny of Treg development in malignant disease, we used the same fate reporter systems to characterise the Treg infiltrate of three different model tumours. In all three cases, we found that Treg derived from pre-existing, EM Treg. Together, these results reveal a predominantly linear pathway of Treg development from thymic origin to EM Treg associated with pathophysiology of malignant disease, that is driven by self antigen recognition throughout.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cervical cancer has the second-highest mortality rate among malignant tumors of the female reproductive system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade are promising therapeutic agents, but their efficacy when combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has not been fully tested, and how they alter the tumor microenvironment has not been comprehensively elucidated. Methods In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing using 46,950 cells from nine human cervical cancer tissues representing sequential different stages of NACT and PD-1 blockade combination therapy. We delineated the trajectory of cervical epithelial cells and identified the crucial factors involved in combination therapy. Cell–cell communication analysis was performed between tumor and immune cells. In addition, THP-1-derived and primary monocyte-derived macrophages were cocultured with cervical cancer cells and phagocytosis was detected by flow cytometry. The antitumor activity of blocking CD74 was validated in vivo using a CD74 humanized subcutaneous tumor model. Results Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that NACT activated cytokine and complement-related immune responses. Cell–cell communication analysis revealed that after NACT therapy, interaction strength between T cells and cancer cells decreased, but intensified between macrophages and cancer cells. We verified that macrophages were necessary for the PD-1 blockade to exert antitumor effects in vitro. Additionally, CD74-positive macrophages frequently interacted with the most immunoreactive epithelial subgroup 3 (Epi3) cancer subgroup during combination NACT. We found that CD74 upregulation limited phagocytosis and stimulated M2 polarization, whereas CD74 blockade enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, decreasing cervical cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions Our study reveals the dynamic cell–cell interaction network in the cervical cancer microenvironment influenced by combining NACT and PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, blocking tumor-associated macrophage-derived CD74 could augment neoadjuvant therapeutic efficacy.">

        <tr id="T cell accumulation within the aorta promotes endothelial dysfunction and the genesis of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. Viral infection during pregnancy is also known to mediate marked acute endothelial dysfunction, but it is not clear whether T cells are recruited to the aorta and whether the dysfunction persists post-partum. Here, we demonstrate that influenza A virus (IAV) infection during pregnancy in a murine model resulted in endothelial dysfunction of the aorta, which persisted for up to 60 days post-infection and was associated with higher levels of IFN-g mRNA expression within the tissue. In the absence of infection, low numbers of naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, central memory T cells and effector memory T cells were observed in the aorta. However, with IAV infection these T cell subsets were significantly increased with a notable accumulation of IAV-specific CD8+ effector memory T cells. Critically, this increase was maintained out to at least 60 days. In contrast, IAV infection in non-pregnant female mice resulted in modest endothelial dysfunction with no accumulation of T cells within the aorta. These data therefore demonstrate that the aorta is a site of T cell recruitment and retention after IAV infection during pregnancy. Whilst IAV-specific memory T cells could theoretically confer protection against future influenza infection, non-specific memory T cell activation and IFN-g production in the aorta could also contribute to future endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.">

These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Cystatin F (CstF) is a protease inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, including those involved in activating the perforin/granzyme cytotoxic pathways. It is targeted at the endolysosomal pathway but can also be secreted to the extracellular milieu or endocytosed by bystander cells. CstF was shown to be significantly increased in tuberculous pleurisy, and during HIV coinfection, pleural fluids display high viral loads. In human macrophages, our previous results revealed a strong upregulation of CstF in phagocytes activated by interferon γ or after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). CstF manipulation using RNA silencing led to increased proteolytic activity of lysosomal cathepsins, improving Mtb intracellular killing. In the present work, we investigate the impact of CstF depletion in macrophages during the coinfection of Mtb-infected phagocytes with lymphocytes infected with HIV. The results indicate that decreasing the CstF released by phagocytes increases the major pro-granzyme convertase cathepsin C of cytotoxic immune cells from peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes. Consequently, an observed augmentation of the granzyme B cytolytic activity leads to a significant reduction in viral replication in HIV-infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Ultimately, this knowledge can be crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches to control both pathogens based on manipulating CstF.">

        <tr id="Alloreactive memory T cells have been implicated as central drivers of transplant rejection. Perplexingly, innate cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-12, are also associated with rejection of organ transplants. However, the pathways of innate immune activation in allogeneic transplantation are unclear. While the role of microbial and cell death products has been previously described, we identified alloreactive memory CD4 T cells as the primary triggers of innate inflammation. Memory CD4 T cells engaged MHC II-mismatched dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the production of innate inflammatory cytokines. This innate inflammation was independent of several pattern recognition receptors and was primarily driven by TNF superfamily ligands expressed by alloreactive memory CD4 T cells. Blocking of CD40L and TNFα resulted in dampened inflammation, and mice genetically deficient in these molecules exhibited prolonged survival of cardiac allografts. Furthermore, myeloid cell and CD8 T cell infiltration into cardiac transplants was compromised in both CD40L- and TNFα-deficient recipients. Strikingly, we found that priming of naive alloreactive CD8 T cells was dependent on licensing of DCs by memory CD4 T cells. This study unravels the key mechanisms by which alloreactive memory CD4 T cells contribute to destructive pathology and transplant rejection.">

        <tr id="Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer. CRC has no apparent symptoms in the early stages of disease, and most patients receive a confirmed diagnosis in the middle or late disease stages. The incidence of CRC continues to increase, and the affected population tends to be younger. Therefore, determining how to achieve an early CRC diagnosis and treatment has become a top priority for prolonging patient survival. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a group of bone marrow-derived immuno-negative regulatory cells that are divided into two subpopulations, polymorphonuclear-MDSCs and monocytic-MDSCs, based on their phenotypic similarities to neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. These cells can inhibit the immune response and promote cancer cell metastasis in the tumour microenvironment (TME). A large aggregation of MDSCs in the TME is often a marker of cancer and a poor prognosis in inflammatory diseases of the intestine (such as colonic adenoma and ulcerative colitis). In the present review, the phenotypic classification of MDSCs in the CRC microenvironment are first discussed. Then, the amplification, role and metastatic mechanism of MDSCs in the CRC TME are described, focusing on genes, gene modifications, proteins and the intestinal micro-environment. Finally, the progress in CRC-targeted therapies that aim to modulate the quantity, function and structure of MDSCs are summarized in the hope of identifying potential screening markers for CRC and improving CRC prognosis and therapeutic options.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly lethal and resistant to immunotherapy. Although immune recognition can be enhanced with immunomodulatory agents including checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines, few patients experience clinical efficacy because the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) is dominated by immunosuppressive myeloid cells that impose T cell inhibition. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) was reported to downregulate metabolic regulators arginase and iNOS in immunosuppressive myeloid cells and enhance immunity against immune-sensitive tumors including head and neck cancers. We show for the first time that combining a PDE5 inhibitor, tadalafil, with a mesothelin-specific vaccine, anti-PD1, and anti-CTLA4 yields antitumor efficacy even against immune-resistant PDAC. To determine immunologic advantages conferred by tadalafil, we profiled the TiME using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA analysis with Domino to infer intercellular signaling. Our analyses demonstrated that tadalafil reprograms myeloid cells to be less immunosuppressive. Moreover, tadalafil synergized with the vaccine, enhancing T cell activation including mesothelin-specific T cells. Tadalafil treatment was also associated with myeloid-T cell signaling axes important for antitumor responses (e.g., Cxcr3, Il12). Our study shows that PDE5 inhibition combined with vaccine-based immunotherapy promotes pro-inflammatory states of myeloid cells, activation of T cells, and enhanced myeloid-T cell crosstalk to yield antitumor efficacy against immune-resistant PDAC.">

        <tr id="Despite significant progress in the treatment of some types of cancer, high-grade gliomas (HGGs) remain a significant clinical problem. In the case of glioblastoma (GBM), the most common solid tumor of the central nervous system in adults, the average survival time from diagnosis is only 15–18 months, despite the use of intensive multimodal therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells, which have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies, are a new, promising therapeutic option. However, the efficacy of CAR-T cells in solid tumors is lower due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype therefore seems particularly important because it may allow for increasing the effectiveness of CAR-T cells in the therapy of solid tumors. The following literature review aims to present the results of preclinical studies showing the possibilities of improving the efficacy of CAR-T in the TME of GBM by reprogramming the TME toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. It may be achievable thanks to the use of CAR-T in a synergistic therapy in combination with oncolytic viruses, radiotherapy, or epigenetic inhibitors, as well as by supporting CAR-T cells crossing of the blood–brain barrier, normalizing impaired angiogenesis in the TME, improving CAR-T effector functions by cytokine signaling or by blocking/knocking out T-cell inhibitors, and modulating the microRNA expression. The use of CAR-T cells modified in this way in synergistic therapy could lead to the longer survival of patients with HGG by inducing an endogenous anti-tumor response.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a complex condition of inflammatory and immune dysregulation, triggered by severe infection. In survivors, chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation linger, facilitating the emergence of infections. CD8 dysfunction contributes to immunosuppression in sepsis survivors. We devised an animal model that enabled us to identify and analyze CD8-intrinsic defects induced by sepsis. We adoptively transferred CD45.1 CD8 OT-I T cells into CD45.2 congenic mice and subjected them to cecal ligature and puncture, to induce abdominal sepsis. One month later, we isolated the transferred CD8 cells. Surface marker expression confirmed they had not been activated through the TCR. CD8 OT-I T cells isolated from septic (or sham-operated) mice were transferred to second recipients, which were challenged with OVA-expressing Listeria monocytogenes. We compared effector capacities between OT-I cells exposed to sepsis and control cells. Naive mice that received OT-I cells exposed to sepsis had higher bacterial burden and a shorter survival when challenged with OVA-expressing L. monocytogenes. OT-I cells isolated from septic mice produced less IFN-γ but had conserved activation, expansion potential, and cytotoxic function. We observed lower transcript levels of IFN-γ and of the long noncoding RNA Ifng-as1, a local regulator of the epigenetic landscape, in cells exposed to sepsis. Accordingly, local abundance of a histone modification characteristic of active promoter regions was reduced in sepsis-exposed CD8 T cells. Our results identify a mechanism through which inflammation in the context of sepsis affects CD8 T cell function intrinsically.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis particularly in the metastatic setting. Treatments with anti-programmed cell death protein-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in combination with chemotherapies have demonstrated promising clinical benefit in metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) but there is still an unmet need, particularly for patients with PD-L1 negative tumors. Mechanisms of resistance to ICIs in mTNBC include the presence of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Eganelisib is a potent and selective, small molecule PI3K-γ inhibitor that was shown in preclinical studies to reshape the TME by reducing myeloid cell recruitment to tumors and reprogramming TAMs from an immune-suppressive to an immune-activating phenotype and enhancing activity of ICIs. These studies provided rationale for the clinical evaluation of eganelisib in combination with the anti-PD-L1 atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel in firstline mTNBC in the phase 2 clinical trial MAcrophage Reprogramming in Immuno-Oncology-3 (MARIO-3, NCT03961698). We present here for the first time, in-depth translational analyses from the MARIO-3 study and supplemental data from eganelisib monotherapy Ph1/b study in solid tumors (MARIO-1, NCT02637531). Methods Paired pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies were analyzed for immunophenotyping by multiplex immunofluorescence (n=11), spatial transcriptomics using GeoMx digital spatial profiling (n=12), and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry, (n=18). Peripheral blood samples were analyzed using flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine analysis. Results Results from paired tumor biopsies from MARIO-3 revealed gene signatures of TAM reprogramming, immune activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) reorganization. Analysis of PD-L1 negative tumors revealed elevated ECM gene signatures at baseline that decreased after treatment. Gene signatures of immune activation were observed regardless of baseline PD-L1 status and occurred in patients having longer progression-free survival. Peripheral blood analyses revealed systemic immune activation. Conclusions This is the first report of translational analyses including paired tumor biopsies from a phase 2 clinical study of the first-in-class PI3K-γ inhibitor eganelisib in combination with atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel in frontline mTNBC. These results support the mechanism of action of eganelisib as a TAM-reprogramming immunotherapy and support the rationale for combining eganelisib with ICI and chemotherapy in indications with TAM-driven resistance to ICI.">

        <tr id="Our understanding of T-cell-dependent humoral responses has been largely shaped by studies involving model antigens such as recombinant proteins and viruses 1,2. In these contexts, B cells internalize the entire antigen or pathogen, and present a range of antigens to helper CD4+ T cells to initiate the humoral response. However, this model does not account for large pathogens (such as parasites) that are too large to be taken up by individual B cells, and the mechanisms by which B cells acquire and present antigens from large complex pathogens to T cells remain poorly understood. Here we used Plasmodium, the causative parasite of malaria, as a model to investigate the requirements for T cell help for B cells targeting the Plasmodium surface circumsporozoite protein (CSP). Upon Plasmodium sporozoite (SPZ) immunization, CSP-specific B cells can form a synapse-like structure with SPZs and take up CSP and non-CSP surface antigens. As a result, CSP-specific B cells can receive help from CD4+ T cells specific to antigens that are located on the surface but not cytosol of the Plasmodium SPZ. Therefore, B cells can obtain help, not only from T cells with the same protein specificity, but also from T cells specific for spatially linked antigens. This flexibility in T cell help may enhance the initiation and maintenance of humoral immune responses to complex pathogens.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Mucosal enrichment of the Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC) pathotype and the expansion of pathogenic IFNγ-producing Th17 (pTh17) cells have been linked to Crohn’s Disease (CD) pathogenesis. However, the molecular pathways underlying the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell transdifferentiation in CD patients remain elusive. To this aim, we created and functionally screened a transposon AIEC mutant library of 10.058 mutants to identify the virulence determinants directly implicated in triggering IL-23 production and pTh17 cell generation. pTh17 cell transdifferentiation was assessed in functional assays by co-culturing AIEC-infected human dendritic cells (DCs) with autologous conventional Th17 (cTh17) cells isolated from blood of Healthy Donors (HD) or CD patients. AIEC triggered IL-23 hypersecretion and transdifferentiation of cTh17 into pTh17 cells selectively through the interaction with CD-derived DCs. Moreover, the chronic release of IL-23 by AIEC-colonized DCs required a continuous IL-23 neutralization to significantly reduce the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell differentiation. The multi-step screenings of the AIEC mutant’s library revealed that deletion of ybaT or rfaP efficiently hinder the IL-23 hypersecretion and hampered the AIEC-dependent skewing of protective cTh17 into pathogenic IFNγ-producing pTh17 cells. Overall, our findings indicate that ybaT (inner membrane transport protein) and rfaP (LPS-core heptose kinase) represent novel and attractive candidate targets to prevent chronic intestinal inflammation in CD.">

Unraveling the mechanisms underlying treatment response for targeted therapeutics in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients is challenging due to the limited understanding of diverse responses of circulating immune cells, particularly B cells. We investigated B lymphocyte dynamics during anti-BAFF treatment, utilizing longitudinal single-cell transcriptome data.


METHODS
We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on PBMCs in four Korean SLE patients before and after belimumab treatment at the following time points: 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.


RESULTS
Analyzing over 73 000 PBMCs, we identified 8 distinct subsets of B cells and plasmablasts and analyzed dynamic changes within these cell subsets: initial declines in naive and transitional B cells followed by an increase at three months, contrasted by an initial increase and subsequent decrease in memory B cells by the third month. Meanwhile, plasmablasts exhibited a consistent decline throughout treatment. B cell activation pathways, specifically in naive and memory B cells, were downregulated during the third and sixth months. These findings were validated at the protein level throughout the first four weeks of treatment using flow cytometry. Comparative analysis with bulk transcriptome data from 22 Japanese SLE patients showed increased NR4A1 expression six months post-belimumab treatment, indicating its role in restricting self-reactive B cells, thereby contributing to the biological responses of anti-BAFF treatment.


CONCLUSION
The observed B cell dynamics provided insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of anti-BAFF in SLE patients. Furthermore, it underscores the need for research in predicting drug responses based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma IDH-wildtype is highly immune suppressive and is characterized by a strong component of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). To interfere with the immune suppressive functions of MDSCs, a comprehensive understanding on how MDSCs acquire their suppressive phenotype is essential. Previously, we and others have shown a distinct Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptor expression profile for MDSCs in glioblastoma. Siglec receptors can transmit inhibitory signals comparable to PD-1 and are suggested to act as glyco-immune checkpoints. Here, we investigated how glioma specific Siglec-sialic acid interactions influence myeloid immune suppressive functions. Co-culturing monocytes with glioblastoma cells induced CD163 expression on the monocytes. Upon desialylation of the glioblastoma cells, this induction of CD163 was hampered, and furthermore, the monocytes were now able to secrete higher amounts of IL-6 and TNFα compared to fully sialylated glioblastoma cells. Additionally, Siglec-specific triggering using anti-Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 antibodies displayed a decreased TNFα secretion by the monocytes, validating the role of the Siglec–Sialic axis in the co-culture experiments. Together, our results demonstrate that glioblastoma cells induce a myeloid immune-suppressive phenotype that could be partly rescued by lowering the glioblastoma-associated sialic acid levels. This manuscript supports further research of the Siglec–Sialic acid axis in the context of glioblastoma and its potential to improve clinical outcome.">

Conversely, classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHLs) primarily feature Reed-Sternberg cells (RSCs) amid a background of reactive immune cells. Immunomodulatory pathways, notably the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, play pivotal roles in tumor immune evasion across both NHLs and cHLs. Elevated expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 is observed in a spectrum of lymphomas, influencing prognosis and treatment response.

Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, among others, have demonstrated efficacy in various B-cell lymphomas, with promising outcomes in cHL. Combination strategies incorporating ICIs with conventional chemotherapy or targeted agents show enhanced efficacy and are being explored extensively. In this review we discuss the most important features of the tumor microenvironment of NHLs and cHLs, address the therapeutic approaches with ICIs and try to outline future perspectives.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy considered incurable despite the recent therapeutic advances. Effective targeted therapies are therefore needed. Our previous studies proved that inhibiting CDK7 impairs the cell cycle and metabolic programs by disrupting E2F1 and MYC transcriptional activities, making it an appealing therapeutic target for MM. Given that CDK7 and BRD4 operate in two distinct regulatory axes in MM, we hypothesized that targeting these two complementary pathways simultaneously would lead to a deeper and more durable response. Indeed, combination therapy had superior activity against MM cell growth and viability, and induced apoptosis to a greater extent than single-agent therapy in both cell lines and patient cells. This synergistic activity was also observed in Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM) cells and with other inhibitors of E2F1 activity. Dual inhibition effectively impaired the MYC and E2F transcriptional programs and MM tumor growth and progression in xenograft animal models, providing evidence for combination therapy's potential as a therapeutic strategy in MM and WM.">

        <tr id="Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare disease characterized by malignant cells derived from the epithelial cells of the biliary duct system. Despite extensive treatments, the prognosis for CCA remains poor, emphasizing the critical need for the development of novel treatments. Considerable attention has been directed towards innate immune effector cells, which can recognize tumor cells independently of the major histocompatibility complex, laying the foundation for the development of off-the-shelf drugs. In this study, we cultured innate immune cells obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy adults and conducted a comparative analysis of the effector functions against CCA cell lines by Vδ2 γδ T cells and NK cells. This analysis was performed using standard short- and long-term cytotoxicity assays, as well as ELISA for IFN-γ. Vδ2 γδ T cells demonstrated cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production in response to CCA cells in a TCR-dependent manner, particularly in the presence of tetrakis-pivaloyloxymethyl 2-(thiazole-2-ylamino)ethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate, a bisphosphonate prodrug. In contrast, direct killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity were relatively slow and weak. Conversely, NK cells displayed potent, direct cytotoxicity against CCA cells. In summary, both Vδ2 γδ T cells and NK cells show promise as innate immune effector cells for adoptive transfer therapy in the context of CCA.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath, leading to irreversible and progressive functional deficits in patients. Pre-clinical studies involving the use of neural stem cells (NSCs) have already demonstrated their potential in neuronal regeneration and remyelination. However, the exclusive application of cell therapy has not proved sufficient to achieve satisfactory therapeutic levels. Recognizing these limitations, there is a need to combine cell therapy with other adjuvant protocols. In this context, extracellular vesicles (EVs) can contribute to intercellular communication, stimulating the production of proteins and lipids associated with remyelination and providing trophic support to axons. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of NSCs and EVs derived from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. OPCs were differentiated from NSCs and had their identity confirmed by gene expression analysis and immunocytochemistry. Exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and characterized by Western, transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Experimental therapy of C57BL/6 mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were grouped in control, treated with NSCs, treated with OPC-derived EVs and treated with a combination of both. The treatments were evaluated clinically using scores and body weight, microscopically using immunohistochemistry and immunological profile by flow cytometry. The animals showed significant clinical improvement and weight gain with the treatments. However, only the treatments involving EVs led to immune modulation, changing the profile from Th1 to Th2 lymphocytes. Fifteen days after treatment revealed a reduction in reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in the groups treated with EVs. However, there was no reduction in demyelination. The results indicate the potential therapeutic use of OPC-derived EVs to attenuate inflammation and promote recovery in EAE, especially when combined with cell therapy.">

        <tr id="CD150, also termed signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family member 1, is a cell surface receptor expressed on T cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and some tumors. Stimulation of CD150 on immune cells induces cell proliferation and cytokine production. However, the function of CD150 in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells is still not fully understood. In the present study, CD150 expression on B cells increased rapidly following EBV infection, and various CD150 antibodies, measles viral proteins and recombinant CD150 proteins induced the secretion of multiple cytokines in both CD150+ EBV-transformed B cells and EBV+ lymphoma cells. Notably, the IL-1α protein level showed the greatest increase among all cytokines measured. The culture supernatant containing these cytokines induced the rapid differentiation of monocytes to DCs after only 2 days in vitro, which was faster than the established DC maturation time. Furthermore, knockdown of CD150 expression led to a reduction in the secretion of multiple cytokines, and monocyte differentiation was partially inhibited by anti-IL-1α and anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralizing antibodies. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that CD150 activation triggers cytokine production in EBV-transformed B cells, and that measles virus coinfection might affect immune responses through the production of various cytokines in EBV+ lymphoma cells.">

        <tr id="The cGAS/STING pathway is a crucial immune activator in cancer biology, triggering innate immunosurveillance against tumors by sensing and reacting to endogenous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In this issue of Cancer Research, research by Saha and colleagues highlights the significant impact of serine deprivation on this pathway, thereby unveiling its potential for anticancer therapy. Serine is essential for cellular metabolism and influences tumor growth and immune responses. Depriving cells of serine caused mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of mtDNA into the cytosol, activating the cGAS/STING pathway and inducing type I IFN responses. In mouse models, serine deprivation enhanced antitumor immunity, with increased tumoral immune infiltration, including CD4+/CD8+ T cells and type I IFN responses. Clinically, a genetic signature indicative of lower serine enrichment in colorectal cancer patients correlated with immune activation and improved survival. Furthermore, combining serine deprivation with PD1 blockade significantly reduced tumor volume and led to long-term immunity in mice, suggesting that serine depletion enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. These findings propose serine deprivation as a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity and improve cancer patient outcomes. See related article by Saha et al., p. 2645.">

        <tr id="Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) greatly contribute to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance of cancer. However, its underlying mechanisms and whether TAMs can be promising targets to overcome ICI resistance remain to be unveiled. Through integrative analysis of immune multiomics data and single‐cell RNA‐seq data (iMOS) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lymphotoxin β receptor (LTBR) is identified as a potential immune checkpoint of TAMs, whose high expression, duplication, and low methylation are correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Immunofluorescence staining shows that the infiltration of LTBR+ TAMs is associated with LUAD stages, immunotherapy failure, and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, LTΒR maintains immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype of TAMs by noncanonical nuclear factor kappa B and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathways. Macrophage‐specific knockout of LTBR hinders tumor growth and prolongs survival time via blocking TAM immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype. Moreover, TAM‐targeted delivery of LTΒR small interfering RNA improves the therapeutic effect of ICI via reversing TAM‐mediated immunosuppression, such as boosting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and inhibiting granulocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells infiltration. Taken together, we bring forth an immune checkpoint discovery pipeline iMOS, identify LTBR as a novel immune checkpoint of TAMs, and propose a new immunotherapy strategy by targeting LTBR+ TAMs.">

        <tr id="The success of immunotherapy for cancer treatment is limited by the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME); Therefore, identifying novel targets to that can reverse this immunosuppressive TME and enhance immunotherapy efficacy is essential. In this study, enrichment analysis based on publicly available single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data from gastric cancer patients are conducted, and found that tumor-intrinsic interferon (IFN) plays a central role in TME regulation. The results shows that KDM3A over-expression suppresses the tumor-intrinsic IFN response and inhibits KDM3A, either genomically or pharmacologically, which effectively promotes IFN responses by activating endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). KDM3A ablation reconfigures the dsRNA-MAVS-IFN axis by modulating H3K4me2, enhancing the infiltration and function of CD8 T cells, and simultaneously reducing the presence of regulatory T cells, resulting in a reshaped TME in vivo. In addition, combining anti-PD1 therapy with KDM3A inhibition effectively inhibited tumor growth. In conclusions, this study highlights KDM3A as a potential target for TME remodeling and the enhancement of antitumor immunity in gastric cancer through the regulation of the ERV-MAVS-IFN axis.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in infants presents distinctive challenges due to their developing immune systems and unique viral-host interactions compared to adults. This review examines current knowledge on viral-host interactions and immune responses in HIV-infected infants, focusing on immune development, viral dynamics, and therapeutic implications. The immune system of infants undergoes rapid maturation during early life, influencing their susceptibility to HIV infection and responses to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Key aspects include thymic function, cytokine profiles, and the establishment of immune memory, which collectively shape immune responses against HIV. Viral dynamics in HIV-infected infants differ markedly from those in adults, characterized by high viral loads, diverse viral subtypes, and the early establishment of viral reservoirs within immune cells. These reservoirs, particularly in sanctuary sites like the central nervous system, pose challenges for achieving viral eradication and long-term remission. Effective management requires strategies to characterize and target these reservoirs, alongside early intervention to mitigate viral replication and preserve immune function. Advances in viral monitoring technologies and treatment regimens are essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing the global burden of pediatric HIV infection.

        <tr id="Introduction NK cells can mediate tumor cell killing by natural cytotoxicity and by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), an anti-tumor mechanism mediated through the IgG Fc receptor CD16A (FcγRIIIA). CD16A polymorphisms conferring increased affinity for IgG positively correlate with clinical outcomes during monoclonal antibody therapy for lymphoma, linking increased binding affinity with increased therapeutic potential via ADCC. We have previously reported on the FcγR fusion CD64/16A consisting of the extracellular region of CD64 (FcγRI), a high-affinity Fc receptor normally expressed by myeloid cells, and the transmembrane/cytoplasmic regions of CD16A, to create a highly potent and novel activating fusion receptor. Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of engineered induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NK (iNK) cells expressing CD64/16A as an “off-the-shelf”, antibody-armed cellular therapy product with multi-antigen targeting potential. Methods iNK cells were generated from iPSCs engineered to express CD64/16A and an interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15Rα fusion (IL-15RF) protein for cytokine independence. iNK cells and peripheral blood NK cells were expanded using irradiated K562-mbIL21–41BBL feeder cells to examine in in vitro and in vivo assays using the Raji lymphoma cell line. ADCC was evaluated in real-time by IncuCyte assays and using a xenograft mouse model with high circulating levels of human IgG. Results Our data show that CD64/16A expressing iNK cells can mediate potent anti-tumor activity against human B cell lymphoma. In particular, (i) under suboptimal conditions, including low antibody concentrations and low effector-to-target ratios, iNK-CD64/16A cells mediate ADCC, (ii) iNK-CD64/16A cells can be pre-loaded with tumor-targeting antibodies (arming) to elicit ADCC, (iii) armed iNK-CD64/16A cells can be repurposed with additional antibodies to target new tumor antigens, and (iv) cryopreserved, armed iNK-CD64/16A are capable of sustained ADCC in a tumor xenograft model under saturating levels of human IgG. Discussion iNK-CD64/16A cells allow for a flexible use of antibodies (antibody arming and antibody targeting), and an “off-the-shelf” platform for multi-antigen recognition to overcome limitations of adoptive cell therapies expressing fixed antigen receptors leading to cancer relapse due to antigen escape variants.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a life-threatening complication frequently occurring following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Since gut microbiota and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are believed to play roles in GvHD prevention, we investigated whether DP8a Tregs, which we have previously described to harbor a TCR-specificity for the gut commensal Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, could protect against GvHD, thereby linking microbiota and its effect on GvHD. We observed a decrease in CD73+ DP8α Treg frequency in allo-HSCT patients at 1-month post-transplantation, which was associated with aGvHD development at 1-month post-transplantation, as compared to aGvHD-free patients, without being correlated to hematological disease's relapse. Importantly, CD73 activity was shown to be critical for DP8αTreg suppressive function. Moreover, the frequency of host-reactive DP8α Tregs was also lower in aGvHD patients, as compared to aGvHD-free patients, which could embody a protective mechanism responsible for the maintenance of these cell subset in GvHD-free patients. We also showed that human DP8α Tregs protected mice against xeno-GvHD through limiting deleterious inflammation and preserving gut integrity. Altogether, these results demonstrated that human DP8α Tregs mediate aGvHD prevention in a CD73-dependent manner, likely through host-reactivity, advocating for the use of these cells for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to preclude aGvHD-related inflammation.">

Mounting evidence suggests involvement of peripheral immune cells in PD pathogenesis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the potential role of peripheral immune secreted cytokines in modulating midbrain astrocyte reactivity. Human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes were exposed to 5% and 10% CD4+ T cell conditioned media (CD4CM) for 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days to assess chronic exposure. Additionally, astrocytes were exposed to the Th17 cell cytokine, IL-17A (10 ng/mL), alone and in combination with TNF-α (0.3 ng/mL) to assess potential synergistic effects of both cytokines at 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days. CD4CM induced acute and chronic alterations in midbrain astrocytes. Increased NFκB translocation to the nucleus, increased expression of the pro-inflammatory genes, IL-1β, CXCL10 at 24 h, C3, LCN2, IL-6 at 24 and 48 h, as well as an increase in their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CXCL10 at both these time points were observed. A synergistic response to the combination of IL-17A and TNF-α on increasing inflammatory gene expression and cytokine release occurred. IL-17A and TNF-α increased intensity of S100β at 24 h, decreased nuclear area and increased circularity of astrocytes at 72 h. A synergistic effect on γH2AX intensity at 72 h and an increase in LDH release at 7 days was observed. Our results demonstrate that IL-17A and TNF-α act synergistically, enhancing midbrain astrocyte reactivity to a similar degree as CD4CM.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. The role of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in pediatric COVID-19 patients remains unclear.


METHODS
We isolated EVs from healthy controls (n = 13) and pediatric COVID-19 patients (n = 104) with varying severity during acute and convalescent phases using serial ultracentrifugation. EV effects on healthy PBMCs, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocytes were assessed through in vitro assays, flow cytometry, and ELISA.


RESULTS
Our findings indicate that COVID-19 severity correlates with diverse immune responses. Severe acute cases exhibited increased cytokine levels, decreased IFNγ levels, and lower CD4+ T cell and monocyte counts, suggesting immunosuppression. EVs from severe acute patients stimulated healthy cells to express higher PDL1, increased Th2 and Treg cells, reduced IFNγ secretion, and altered Th1/Th17 ratios. Patient-derived EVs significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (p < .001 for mild, p = .0025 for severe cases) and decreased CD4+ T cell (p = .043) and monocyte (p = .033) populations in stimulated healthy PBMCs.


CONCLUSION
This study reveals the complex relationship between immunological responses and EV-mediated effects, emphasizing the impact of COVID-19 severity. We highlight the potential role of plasma-derived EVs in early-stage immunosuppression in severe COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Background Cell energy metabolism controls the activation and function of dendritic cells (DCs). Inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells (IDECs) in skin lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD) express high-affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI) and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which mediate the generation and maintenance of inflammation. However, cellular energy metabolism and effector function of IDECs mediated by FcϵRI and TLR2 have not been fully elucidated. Methods IDECs in vitro were treated with TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 and anti-IgE alone or in combination for 24 h. Further, we analyzed the expression of cell surface activation markers, production of inflammatory factors, and cellular energy metabolism profiles of IDECs by using flow cytometry, multiplex assay, RNA sequencing, targeted energy metabolism, and seahorse assays. Results Compared to the unstimulated or anti-IgE groups, Pam3CSK4 alone or combined with anti-IgE groups significantly increased the expression of CD80, CD83, and CD86 on IDECs, but did not affect the expression of the above markers in the anti-IgE group. The release of inflammatory cytokines increased in the Pam3CSK4 alone or combined with anti-IgE groups, while there was a weak increasing trend in the anti-IgE group. The glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway of carbon metabolism was affected in all treatment groups. Furthermore, compared to the control group, we found a decrease in pyruvic acid, upregulation of PFKM, downregulation of FBP1, and increase in extracellular lactate, glycolysis rate, and glycolysis capacity after all treatments, while there was no difference between each treatment group. However, there was no difference in glycolytic reserve and mitochondrial basic and maximum respiration among all groups. Conclusion Our results indicate that glycolysis of IDECs may be activated through FcϵRI and TLR2 to upregulate inflammatory factors, suggesting that danger signals from bacteria or allergens might evoke an inflammatory response from AD through the glycolysis pathway.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the main residents in the bone marrow (BM) and have an essential role in the regulation of haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation and proliferation. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a group of myeloid disorders impacting haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSCPs) that are characterised by BM failure, ineffective haematopoiesis, cytopenia, and a high risk of transformation through the expansion of MDS clones together with additional genetic defects. It has been indicated that MSCs play anti-tumorigenic roles such as in cell cycle arrest and pro-tumorigenic roles including the induction of metastasis in MDS and leukaemia. Growing evidence has shown that MSCs have impaired functions in MDS, such as decreased proliferation capacity, differentiation ability, haematopoiesis support, and immunomodulation function and increased inflammatory alterations within the BM through some intracellular pathways such as Notch and Wnt and extracellular modulators abnormally secreted by MSCs, including increased expression of inflammatory factors and decreased expression of haematopoietic factors, contributing to the development and progression of MDSs. Therefore, MSCs can be targeted for the treatment of MDSs and leukaemia. However, it remains unclear what drives MSCs to behave abnormally. In this review, dysregulations in MSCs and their contributions to myeloid haematological malignancies will be discussed.">

        <tr id="Introduction Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare and deadly demyelinating disease caused by JC virus (JCV) replication in the central nervous system. PML occurs exclusively in patients with severe underlying immune deficiencies, including AIDS and hematological malignancies. PML has also emerged as a significant threat to patients on potent new immunosuppressive biologics, including natalizumab in multiple sclerosis. Methods Here, we developed an IFN-γ release assay (IGRA) that mainly detects JCV-specific effector memory T cells and effectors T cells in the blood. Results This assay was frequently positive in patients with active PML (with a positive JCV PCR in CSF) of various underlying immunosuppression causes (84% sensitivity). Only 3% of healthy donors had a positive response (97% specificity). The frequency of positivity also increased in multiple sclerosis patients according to the time on natalizumab (up to 36% in patients treated for more than 48 months, who are considered at a higher risk of PML). Discussion The results show this assay’s frequent or increased positivity in patients with PML or an increased risk of PML, respectively. The assay may help to stratify the risk of PML.">

Pharmacological inhibition as well as the short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor hindered memory transition and limited the homeostatic turnover of the activated CD8+ T cells. Dexamethasone exposure of CD8+ T cells expanded during a resolving infection with influenza A virus or a γ-herpesvirus promoted conversion of effector cells into memory cells by modulating cellular metabolism and lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Reduced reactive oxygen species levels in the responding effector cells upregulated Bcl2 and enhanced survival. The generated virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells were efficiently recalled following challenge of animals with a secondary infection to control it better. The memory-enhancing effect was predominantly evident at low doses of dexamethasone. Therefore, controlled glucocorticoid signaling within the effector CD8+ T cells is crucial for optimal memory differentiation.">

        <tr id="Drugs that target immune checkpoint have become the most popular weapon in cancer immunotherapy, yet only have practical benefits for a small percentage of patients. Tumor cells constantly interact with their microenvironment, which is made up of a variety of immune cells as well as endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Immune checkpoint expression and blocked signaling of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are key to tumor progression. In this study, we perform deliberation convolution on the TCGA database for human lung, breast, and colorectal cancer to infer crosstalk between immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) and ligands (ICLs) in TME of pan-carcinogenic solid tumor types, validated by flow cytometry. Analysis of immune checkpoints showed that there was little variation between different tumor types. It showed that CD160, LAG3, TIGIT were found to be highly expressed in CD8+ T cells instead of CD4+ T cells, PD-L1, PD-L2, CD86, LGALS9, TNFRSF14, LILRB4 and other ligands were highly expressed on macrophages, FVR, NECTIN2, FGL1 were highly expressed on Epithelial cells, CD200 was highly expressed in Endothelial cells, and CD80 was highly expressed in CD8 High expression on T cells. Overall, our study provides a new resource for the expression of immune checkpoints in TME on various types of cells. Significance: This study provides immune checkpoint expression of immune cells of multiple cancer types to infer immune mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and provide ideas for the development of new immune checkpoint-blocking drugs.">

TNBC outcomes among Black women are dismal secondary to multiple factors, such as poor healthcare accessibility resulting in delays in diagnosis, and aggressive disease biology in addition to a pro-tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Black women with breast cancer exhibit elevated levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, and a pro-tumorigenic TME with higher immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs), M2 macrophages and exhausted CD8+ T cells. We have shown that the combined use of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) ligands with interferon-α (chemokine modulation: CKM) is able to enrich the tumor with CD8+ T cells, while not increasing immunosuppressive cells. Recent clinical trials have revealed the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in rejuvenizing exhausted CD8+ T cells. We hypothesize that strategies to modulate the TME by enriching chemokines that attract CD8+T cells followed by reversal of CD8+ T cell exhaustion (ICI), when added to standard treatment, could potentially improve clinical outcomes, and mitigate the racial disparities in TNBC outcomes between Black and White Women.">

While DCs are believed to play a pivotal role in generating anti-tumor T-cell responses, the importance of DCs in the protection from the progression of tumors remains elusive. Here, we show how the constitutive deficiency of CD11chi DCs influences the progression of tumors with the use of binary transgenic mice with constitutive loss of CD11chi DCs. Constitutive loss of CD11chi DCs not only enhances the progression of tumors but also reduces the responses of Ag-specific T cells. Furthermore, the congenital deficiency of CD11chi DCs generates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that correlates with the marked accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and the prominent productions of immunosuppressive mediators. Thus, our findings suggest that CD11chi DCs are crucial for generating anti-tumor T-cell responses and immunogenic TME to suppress the development of tumors.">

Memory CD8+ T cells are essential for long-term immune protection in viral infections, including COVID-19.


METHODS
This study examined the responses of CD8+ TEM, TEMRA, and TCM subsets from unvaccinated individuals who had recovered from mild and severe COVID-19 by flow cytometry.


RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The peptides triggered a higher frequency of CD8+ TCM cells in the recovered mild group. CD8+ TCM and TEM cells showed heterogeneity in CD137 expression between evaluated groups. In addition, a predominance of CD137 expression in naïve CD8+ T cells, TCM, and TEM was observed in the mild recovered group when stimulated with peptides. Furthermore, CD8+ TCM and TEM cell subsets from mild recovered volunteers had higher TNF-α expression. In contrast, the expression partner of IFN-γ, IL-10, and IL-17 indicated an antiviral signature by CD8+ TEMRA cells. These findings underscore the distinct functional capabilities of each memory T cell subset in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 upon re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the deadliest human cancers with very limited treatment options available. The malignant behavior of GBM is manifested in a tumor which is highly invasive, resistant to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, and strongly immunosuppressive. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been introduced in the clinic and have yielded promising results in certain cancers. GBM, however, is largely refractory to these treatments. The immune checkpoint CD47 has recently gained attention as a potential target for intervention as it conveys a “don’t eat me” signal to tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) via the inhibitory SIRP alpha protein. In preclinical models, the administration of anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies has shown impressive results with GBM and other tumor models. Several well-characterized oncogenic pathways have recently been shown to regulate CD47 expression in GBM cells and glioma stem cells (GSCs) including Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) beta catenin. Other macrophage pathways involved in regulating phagocytosis including TREM2 and glycan binding proteins are discussed as well. Finally, chimeric antigen receptor macrophages (CAR-Ms) could be leveraged for greatly enhancing the phagocytosis of GBM and repolarization of the microenvironment in general. Here, we comprehensively review the mechanisms that regulate the macrophage phagocytosis of GBM cells.">

Overcoming these limitations can fully exploit the antineoplastic potential of NK cells. We also investigated the tumor-killing efficacy of NK cell-based immunotherapies, immunotherapeutic strategies, and new results from clinical trials. Notably, cetuximab, the most essential component of NK cell-based immunotherapy, inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway and activates the immune system in conjunction with NK cells, inducing innate effector functions and improving patient prognosis.

        <tr id="Abstract Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which consist of chromatin DNA studded with granule proteins, are released by neutrophils in response to both infectious and sterile inflammation. Beyond the canonical role in defense against pathogens, the extrusion of NETs also contributes to the initiation, metastasis, and therapeutic response of malignant diseases. Recently, NETs have been implicated in the development and therapeutic responses of various types of tumors. Although extensive work regarding inflammation in tumors has been reported, a comprehensive summary of how these web‐like extracellular structures initiate and propagate tumor progression under the specific microenvironment is lacking. In this review, we demonstrate the initiators and related signaling pathways that trigger NETs formation in cancers. Additionally, this review will outline the current molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of NETs during dormant cancer cells awakening, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) extravasation, and metastatic recurrence of cancer. This is followed by a perspective on the current and potential clinical potential of NETs as therapeutic targets in the treatment of both local and metastatic disease, including the improvement of the efficacy of existing therapies.">

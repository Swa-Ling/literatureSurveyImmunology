        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Preserving barrier integrity is of great importance in mucosal tissues while simultaneously defending against inflammatory threats and exposures to pathogens. NK cells at barrier sites are essential for viral control during infections such as herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) but must also balance pathogen response with tissue protection. We have characterized human tissue NK cells in the vaginal tissue (VT) as having distinct effector and tissue protective functions. Using scRNA-seq and high- parameter flow cytometry, we uncovered a unique signature for VT NK cells, indicating a reduced effector phenotype with increased factors related to tissue residency and immunoregulation at steady state. Despite their functionally quiescent nature, these cells were able to respond robustly to inflammatory signals, suggesting they are poised for pathogen response. We found that the gene signatures between mouse and human NK cells were remarkably similar, demonstrating the feasibility of using a mouse model to probe distinct NK cell functions during mucosal infection. In mice, VT NK cells responded robustly to acute HSV-2 infection and retained an enhanced recall potential after viral clearance. They also secreted tissue repair factors and played a role in restricting tissue damage following viral infection. Our data, using both human tissues and a mouse model, reveal an unexpected role of mucosal tissue NK cells in the VT in balancing host protection with tissue repair in the context of localized mucosal tissue infection.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms driving immune evasion in early-stage I high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Our findings revealed a highly immunosuppressive HGSOC microenvironment, characterized by abundant infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Trajectory analysis uncovered differentiation pathways of naïve Tregs, which underwent either activation and proliferation or transcriptional instability. The predicted Treg-cell interaction network, including crosstalk within tumor cells, facilitates Treg mobility and maturation while reinforcing their immunosuppressive function and persistence in the tumor. Moreover, their interactions with immune cells likely inhibit CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting cells, supporting tumor immune escape. Additionally, more immunogenic tumor conditions, marked by IFNγ production, may contribute to Treg destabilization. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of Tregs in early immune evasion of HGSOC and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting their activity and differentiation fate.">

        <tr id="The glioblastoma tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is an immunosuppressive barrier to therapy that encumbers glioblastoma responses to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Immunosuppressive cytokines, pro-tumor myeloid cells, and exhausted T-cells are hallmarks of the glioblastoma TIME. Here we integrate spatial and single-cell analyses of patient-matched human glioblastoma samples before and after ICI with genetic, immunologic, single-cell, and pharmacologic studies in preclinical models to reveal that interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibition reprograms the glioblastoma TIME to sensitize mouse glioblastoma to ICI and radiotherapy. Rare human glioblastoma patients who achieve clinical responses to ICI have lower pre-treatment IL-6 levels compared to glioblastomas who do not respond to ICI. Immune stimulatory gene therapy suppresses IL-6 tumor levels in preclinical murine models of glioblastoma. Furthermore, survival was longer in Il-6 knockout mice with orthotopic SB28 glioblastoma relative to wild-type mice. IL-6 blockade with a neutralizing antibody transiently sensitizes mouse glioblastoma to anti-PD-1 by increasing MHCII+ monocytes, CD103+ migratory dendritic cells (DCs), CD11b+ conventional DCs, and effector CD8+ T cells, and decreasing immunosuppressive Tregs. To translate these findings to a combination treatment strategy for recurrent glioblastoma patients, we show that IL-6 blockade plus ICI durably sensitizes mouse glioblastoma to high-dose radiotherapy.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8+ T cells are pivotal for long-term anti-tumor immunity due to their longevity and rapid response upon encountering tumor cells. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a member of the Ste20 family of kinases, restricts proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and plays critical roles in T cell priming and activation. However, the impact of HPK1 on CD8+ T cell differentiation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells derived from patients lacking HPK1 exhibit a stronger memory phenotype. HPK1 deletion promotes the formation of precursor and central memory CD8+ T cells, resulting in superior and long-lasting antitumor activity in murine cancer models compared to WT mice. Additionally, HPK1 knockout induces metabolic reprogramming by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial respiration complex activity. Mechanistically, HPK1 deletion downregulates mTOR signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of mTOR and S6. Increased mitophagy activity is observed in HPK1-depleted cells, with upregulation of key mitophagy regulators, including Pink1 and Bnip3l, maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Our study reveals that HPK1 regulates CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming, guiding cell differentiation and antitumor responses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Arginine methyltransferase protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are crucial modulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses, and their differentiation into tumor-associated macrophages is critical in shaping the TME. Despite ongoing clinical trials of small molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 for cancer therapy, their effects on macrophages, a key component of the immune system, remain poorly understood. Methods A pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis was initially conducted to investigate the expression of PRMT5 in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 in mice, as well as the use of a PRMT5-specific inhibitor, was performed to evaluate the impact of PRMT5 on macrophage polarization and tumor progression. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics were employed to explore the mechanistic roles of PRMT5 in regulating lipid metabolism and macrophage polarization. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy was assessed to study its effects on antitumor immunity in vivo. Results The pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis revealed that PRMT5 is highly expressed in the PPARG-macrophage subset, which correlates with poor patient survival. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 reprogrammed macrophages towards an antitumor phenotype, effectively inhibiting tumor progression. Mechanistically, PRMT5 was found to regulate lipid metabolism and drive macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory state via the STAT6-PPARγ pathway, fostering an immunosuppressive TME conducive to tumor growth. Notably, Prmt5 deletion induced PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells. Combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-PD-L1 therapy significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy, demonstrating a synergistic therapeutic effect. Conclusions These findings uncover a crucial role for PRMT5 in macrophage biology and suggest that targeting PRMT5 in myeloid cells offers a promising new approach for cancer immunotherapy. The combination of PRMT5 inhibition with anti-PD-L1 therapy may provide a potent strategy to reprogram the TME and enhance antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Drug-tolerant persister cancer cells were first reported fifteen years ago as a quiescent, reversible cell state which tolerates unattenuated cytotoxic drug stress. It remains unknown whether a similar phenomenon contributes to immune evasion. Here we report a persister state which survives weeks of direct cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) attack. In contrast to previously known immune evasion mechanisms that avoid immune attack, antigenic persister cells robustly activate CTLs which deliver Granzyme B, secrete IFNγ, and induce tryptophan starvation resulting in apoptosis initiation. Instead of dying, persister cells paradoxically leverage apoptotic caspase activity to avoid inflammatory death. Furthermore, persister cells acquire mutations and epigenetic changes which enable outgrowth of CTL-resistant cells. Persister cell features are enriched in inflamed tumors which regressed during immunotherapy in vivo and in surgically resected human melanoma tissue under immune stress ex vivo. These findings reveal a persister cell state which is a barrier to immune-mediated tumor clearance. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The immune system plays a crucial role in either fighting or supporting tumor growth. In this study, we analyzed immune cells in control skins and skin tumors using single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 15 different immune cell types and observed significant changes in their composition during skin tumor progression. Macrophages became the dominant immune cells in tumors and acted as key regulators of immune interactions, while other immune cells, including Langerhans cells and DETC, decreased. We also found that tumors activated specific signaling pathways, including Jak2/Stat3, and increased immune-suppressing cells like Tregs and M2 macrophages. These changes help tumors evade the immune system. Our findings provide new insights into how the immune system responds to skin tumor progression and may help guide future treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction The tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, with tumor-associated macrophages significantly influencing immune suppression and tumor growth. Colorectal cancers (CRC) classified as Consensus Molecular Subtype 4 (CMS4) and triple-negative breast cancers subsets are particularly characterized by a mesenchymal phenotype, immune exclusion, and extensive macrophage infiltration. This study aimed to investigate how targeting cancer cell stemness with specific inhibitors could modulate macrophage polarization in CRC in vitro and breast cancer in vivo, potentially shifting the immune balance from pro-tumor M2-like to anti-tumor M1-like macrophages. Methods We used four stemness inhibitors—salinomycin, SB-431542, JIB-04, and napabucasin—each targeting different pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β, histone demethylation, and STAT3, respectively), to evaluate their effects on CMS4 CRC cell lines (HCT116 and SW620) and human peripheral blood-derived macrophages in an indirect co-culture model. Results Our results showed that CMS4 CRC cell lines induced distinct macrophage polarization patterns, with HCT116 promoting M2-like macrophages and SW620 leaning toward M1-like profile. Notably, the combination of stemness inhibitors reduced stemness markers (CD133, CD44) in colorectal cancer cells and shifted macrophage polarization toward an M1-like phenotype, particularly in co-culture with HCT116. In vivo studies using the syngeneic immunocompetent EO771 breast cancer mouse model demonstrated that combination of stemness inhibitors increased the M1/M2 macrophage ratio. Conclusions Our study highlights the dual potential of stemness inhibitors to target both cancer cells and the immune microenvironment. These findings offer promising strategies for enhancing favorable immunomodulation in mesenchymal-like colorectal tumors.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and activated T cells rely on aerobic glycolysis for energy metabolism. The TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) inhibits glycolysis and protects AML cells from apoptosis. Preliminary studies suggest that combining TIGAR inhibition with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) may offer a therapeutic strategy for AML. However, it remains unclear whether silencing TIGAR can enhance T cell function and thereby improve AML prognosis. This study aims to investigate whether TIGAR silencing in host can eliminate AML cells and rejuvenate dysfunctional T cells with mouse models. TIGAR knockout mice on the C57BL/6J background were generated and AML mouse models were established through intravenous injection of C1498 cells. We found that TIGAR depletion enhanced CD8+ T cell counts and raised CD4/CD8 ratio, downregulating CD44 and immune checkpoints CTLA-4, LAG-3, PD-1 on cell surface of CD8+ T cells. TIGAR depletion boosted cytokine secretion (IFN-γ, perforin, granzyme B, TNF-α) by CD8+ T cells and IL-2, TNF-α by CD4+ T cells, improving cytotoxicity against AML cells, proliferation, and reducing apoptosis. TIGAR suppression in host with 2-DG prolonged AML mouse survival, decreased tumor burden, and leukemic infiltration. TIGAR suppression restored thymic T cell development and peripheral immune balance. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis also revealed that high TIGAR expression influences the glycolysis pathway, and correlates with markers of T cell exhaustion. This study indicates that blocking TIGAR prevents CD8+ T cell dysfunction and induces anti-AML immunity.

        <tr id="Attempts to activate an anti-tumor immune response in glioblastoma (GBM) have been met with many challenges due to its inherently immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The degree and mechanisms by which molecularly and phenotypically diverse tumor-propagating glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to this state are poorly defined. In this study, our multifaceted approach combining bioinformatics analyses of clinical and experimental datasets, single-cell sequencing, and the molecular and pharmacologic manipulation of patient-derived cells identified GSCs expressing immunosuppressive effectors mimicking regulatory T cells (Tregs). We showed that this immunosuppressive Treg-like (ITL) GSC state is specific to the mesenchymal GSC subset and is associated with and driven specifically by TGFβ type II receptor (TGFBR2) in contrast to TGFBR1. Transgenic TGFBR2 expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres promoted a mesenchymal transition and induced a six-gene ITL signature consisting of CD274 (PD-L1), NT5E (CD73), ENTPD1 (CD39), LGALS1 (galectin-1), PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2), and TGFB1. This TGFBR2-driven ITL signature was identified in clinical GBM specimens, patient-derived GSCs, and systemic mesenchymal malignancies.

        <tr id="Background Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the main immunosuppressive cells in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, systemic Treg depletion is not favored due to the crucial role of Tregs in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and prevention of autoimmunity. Recently, CCR8 has been identified as a key chemokine receptor expressed on tumor-infiltrating Tregs and targeted blockade of CCR8 exerts anticancer effect in several cancer types, but whether this pathway is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods We determined the involvement of CCR8+ Tregs in HCC using human HCC tissues and TCGA database, and examined the anticancer effect and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the CCR8 antagonist, IPG0521m, which was developed in house, in murine liver cancer model with flow cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and Real-Time PCR. Results Remarkable increase in CCR8+ Tregs was observed in human HCC tissues. Treatment of syngeneic liver cancer model with IPG0521m resulted in dramatic inhibition of tumor growth, associated with increased CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues. Bulk RNA sequencing analysis indicated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in remarkable increase in antitumor immunity. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in a switch of Tregs from high immunosuppression to low immunosuppression phenotype, associated with elevated CD8+ T and NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, and decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor tissues. Conclusions IPG0521m inhibited liver cancer growth via reducing the immunosuppressive function of Tregs, thereby boosting anti-cancer immunity. Our study paves the way for the clinical study of CCR8 antagonist in HCC and other cancers.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with dismal clinical prognosis and resistance to current therapies. GBM progression is facilitated by the tumor microenvironment (TME), with an immune infiltrate dominated by tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The TME is also characterized by hypoxia and the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), with HIF-2α emerging as a potential regulator of tumor progression. However, its role in GBM immunosuppression remains unknown. Here, we investigate HIF-2α and the use of the HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 to modulate the TME in the immunocompetent GL261 mouse GBM model. PT2385 administration in vivo decreased tumor volume and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice, without affecting GL261 viability in vitro. Notably, HIF-2α inhibition alleviated the immunosuppressive TME and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) using αPD-1 and αTIM-3 antibodies to promote long-term survival. Comprehensive analysis of the immune infiltrate through single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry revealed that combining PT2385 with ICB reduced numbers of pro-tumoral macrophages and Tregs while increasing numbers of microglia, with a corresponding transcriptional modulation towards an anti-tumoral profile of these TAMs. In vitro, deletion of HIF-2α in microglia impeded their polarization towards a pro-tumoral M2-like profile, and its inhibition impaired Treg migration. Our results show that targeting HIF-2α can switch an immunosuppressive TME towards one that favors a robust and sustained response to ICB based immunotherapy. These findings establish that clinically relevant HIF-2α inhibitors should be explored not only in malignancies with defects in the HIF-2α axis, but also in those exhibiting an immunosuppressive TME that limits immunotherapy responsiveness.

        <tr id="Background The immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME) reduces immune response effectiveness in stromal-rich tumours, including CMS4 colorectal cancer (CRC). Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), precursors to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), promote cancer progression by suppressing anti-tumour immune responses. Hypersialylation of glycans on tumours engages Siglec receptors on immune cells, driving immune dysfunction, but its role in stromal-mediated immunosuppression remains unclear. Methods Sialic acids and Siglec ligands were measured on CRC tissue, primary human CAFs, and tumour-conditioned-mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCTCS) and CAF using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The effect of stromal cell sialylation on macrophages and NK cells was assessed in ex vivo primary stromal and immune cell co-cultures and expression of Siglec-10 and immune cell phenotype markers and function were measured by flow cytometry. Using an immunocompetent Balb/c CT26 mouse model, we induced tumours with/without conditioned stromal cells, with/without pre-treatment of stromal cells with sialyltransferase inhibitor (3FAX) or sialidase (E610). We assessed the effect of stromal cell sialylation on macrophages and NK cells in the tumour and secondary lymphoid tissues by flow cytometry. Results Stromal cells, including CAFs, in CRC tumours are highly sialylated compared to epithelial cancer cells and are associated with high expression of ST6GalNAC6. Genetic knockdown of ST6GalNAC6 reduced the expression of stromal cell Siglec-10 ligands in MSCs. CAFs and MSCTCS induced Siglec-10 on macrophages and NK cells and impaired NK cell cytotoxicity. Sialidase treatment reduced Siglec-10 expression, restoring NK cell function. In vivo, desialylation of stromal cells increased macrophage activation (CD11b+CD80+) and reduced immunosuppressive marker expression (CD206, PD-L1, Siglec-G) in lymphoid tissues, indicating sustained systemic anti-tumour immunity. Intratumoural NK cells exhibited high Siglec-G expression and impaired cytotoxicity, and granzyme B expression significantly increased with sialidase treatment of stromal cells. In an inflammatory tumour model, inflammatory tumour-conditioned (iTCS) MSCs promoted metastasis and Siglec-G induction on NK cells and macrophages, both reversed by sialyltransferase inhibition, underscoring the effects of stromal modulation of innate immune cell function in inflammatory tumours. Conclusion Stromal cell sialylation modulates innate immune suppression in CRC via the sialic acid/Siglec axis. Targeting stromal sialylation restores NK cytotoxicity and macrophage activation, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for immunosuppressive stromal-rich tumours. What is already known on this topic The tumour microenvironment of consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4) colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with high stromal burden, poor immune infiltration, poor response to anti-cancer therapies and thus poor patient prognosis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have limited impact on stromal-rich CRC tumours, therefore highlighting the need to discover and target novel mechanisms of tumour immune evasion. Emerging studies have highlighted that stromal cells in CRC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are highly sialylated, expressing even higher levels of sialic acid on their cell surface than epithelial cancer cells. Targeting stromal cell sialylation has unveiled promising data in restoring the anti-tumour activity of T cells and macrophages. There is a need to explore the effects of targeting stromal cell sialylation on other immune cells of the TME and to evaluate the Siglec/sialic acid axis of stromal and immune cells in resistant CRC tumours. What this study adds: We reveal ST6GalNAC6 as a sialyltransferase enzyme that regulates the production of Siglec-10 ligands in CRC stromal cells. Overexpression of ST6GalNAC6 and Siglec-10 correlated with poor survival in CRC and mesenchymal CRC tumours. We show for the first time an induction of Siglec-10 expression on macrophages and NK cells in stromal-immune co-culture experimental models with hypersialylated MSCs and CAFs in vitro and ex vivo. Targeting stromal cell sialylation increased NK cell cytotoxicity of CRC cells, indicating a direct functional role for stromal cell sialylation in immunosuppression. An immunogenic mouse model of CRC was used to evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy of targeting stromal cell sialylation in overcoming stromal cell-mediated immunosuppression in CRC. Sialic acid-targeting of stroma slowed tumour growth and reduced inflammation-driven metastasis. This was associated with greater infiltration and activation of macrophages and NK cells with stromal cell sialic acid depletion, highlighting stromal cell sialylation as a mechanism of innate immune cell suppression in stromal-rich CRC. How this study might affect Research, Practice or Policy Our research provides insight into a novel mechanism of stromal cell-mediated immunosuppression of innate immune cells in CRC and may open up new avenues of research for targeting stromal cells in stromal-rich TMEs such as pancreatic, breast and ovarian cancers. Our research identifies a stromal cell effect of enhancing Siglec expression on tumour infiltrating innate immune cells as a novel immune checkpoint, which may be useful in identifying potential novel immunotherapeutic combinations in future.

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality but heterogeneity in patient responsiveness remains. Thus, greater understanding of the immunologic factors that dictate response to immunotherapy is critical to improve patient outcomes. Here, we show that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is elevated in the setting of melanoma in humans and mice and plays a functional role in inhibiting the CD8+ T cell response. Surprisingly, the tumor itself is not the major cellular source of Fgl2. Instead, we found that macrophage-secreted Fgl2 dampens the CD8+ T cell response through binding and apoptosis of FcγRIIB+CD8+ T cells. This regulation was CD8+ T cell autonomous and not via an antigen-presenting cell intermediary, as absence of Fcgr2b from the CD8+ T cells rendered T cells insensitive to Fgl2 regulation. Fgl2 is robustly expressed by macrophages in 10 cancer types in humans and in 6 syngeneic tumor models in mice, underscoring the clinical relevance of Fgl2 as a therapeutic target to promote T cell activity and improve patient immunotherapeutic response.">

        <tr id="A significant proportion of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) remain refractory to standard immunosuppressive therapy, and biomarkers to help guide treatment decisions are lacking. Here, we examined the circulating immune profile of patients with acetylcholine receptor antibody positive MG of differing treatment requirements compared to controls. Refractory patients displayed the highest frequency of memory B cells, and increased production of IL-6 and TNF-α upon toll-like receptor/ CD40 activation in vitro, suggesting an enhanced inflammatory phenotype. This was mirrored by a dramatic loss of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and dendritic cells in refractory disease. Refractory MG was also characterised by higher circulating complement proteins C3, C5 and clusterin as well as increased expression of complement receptors on B and T cells. Following anti-CD20 therapy, residual plasmablasts were found in circulation, likely to be drivers of ongoing disease. Baseline low B cell frequency (<3%), and high complement receptor expression were associated with poor response to rituximab, suggesting that alternative treatment strategies such as complement inhibition might be more favourable in these patients. Overall, our findings highlight an altered lymphocyte signature in patients with refractory MG and support the use of plasma cell depletion and therapies that promote Treg expansion as promising therapeutic avenues. One Sentence Summary Refractory myasthenia gravis is associated with a loss of Tregs, an expansion of pro-inflammatory B cells and elevated lymphocyte complement receptor expression.">

        <tr id="Coeliac Disease (CeD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting 0.5-1% of the general population with a wide geographical distribution. Despite recent efforts to deeply phenotype gluten-specific immune activation at the single cell level, recent clinical studies targeting gluten degradation and other immune tolerance mechanisms have been unsuccessful. To this end, a deeper understanding of immune and non-immune cellular dynamics and interactions are required to characterize tissue-specific mechanisms responsible for CeD pathogenesis, repair, and resolution. Here, we assembled the most comprehensive scRNAseq dataset in Coeliac Disease to date, including 203,555 cells across 21 active CeD and 11 control duodenal samples. Compared to control duodenum, CeD was characterized by single cell differential changes in abundance, gene expression and cell-cell interactions across cellular compartments. In the immune compartments, CeD samples showed expected increases in plasma cell abundance and shifts toward type 1 effector biology (e.g., increase in cycling CD8pos, γδ T cells and IFNG transcriptional shifts) and Tfh-related biology (e.g., increases in IL21 signaling to effector T cells). In addition, activated myeloid subsets, including DC2 and monocytes, were increased in disease and were characterized by increased pro-inflammatory pathway expression, including IL-1β. Non-immune compartments showed increased stem/crypt and secretory enterocytes in CeD samples with a decrease in absorptive enterocytes, reflecting the villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia hallmarks of CeD epithelial dysfunction. Accompanying the epithelial changes, distinct changes in stromal populations were identified, particularly with increases in abundance and transcriptional activity of NRG1 and SMOC2 fibroblasts. Cell-cell interaction analysis across multiple cellular compartments proposed a distinct increased role of fibroblasts to support the epithelial reprogramming of the increased stem/crypt epithelial fraction in CeD, mediated by myeloid derived IL-1β signal and lymphoid-derived IFN-γ. This dataset reveals a previously unknown role for T-myeloid-stromal-epithelial cell communication in CeD, highlighting key mechanisms of the tissue-level cellular dynamics in response to gluten ingestion.">

        <tr id="Overcoming immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for developing novel cancer immunotherapies. Here, we report that IL-16 administration enhances the polarization of T helper 1 (Th1) cells by inhibiting glutamine catabolism through the downregulation of glutaminase in CD4+ T cells and increases the production of Th1 effector cytokine IFN-γ, thus improving anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, we find that establishing an IL-16-dependent, Th1-dominant TME relies on mast cell-produced histamine and results in the increased expression of the CXCR3 ligands in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), thereby improving the therapeutic effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Cancer patients exhibit impaired production of IL-16, which correlates with poorer prognosis. Additionally, low IL-16 production is associated with unresponsiveness to immunotherapy in cancer patients. Collectively, our findings provided new insights into the biological function of IL-16, emphasizing its potential clinical significance as a therapeutic approach to augment anti-tumor immunity and sensitize ICB-based cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88) is a key adaptor protein mediate immune responses, primarily through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling. The TLR/MYD88 pathway plays a critical role in dendritic cells (DC) maturation and function, contributing to the body’s innate immunity. Recent studies have further highlighted MYD88’s pivotal role in intrinsic immunity and its regulatory influence on the tumor microenvironment (TME) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of MYD88 in DCs and its regulatory role in the TME have gained increasing attention. Methods RNA-sequencing data retrieved from the TCGA and GEO databases were utilized for both the training and validation of our signature. Single-cell RNA transcriptome data from GEO were analyzed to investigate the correlation among subclusters of T cells, myeloid cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) within the HCC tumor microenvironment (TME). A combination of bioinformatics and machine learning approaches was employed to perform statistical analyses.Additionally, flow cytometry was conducted to quantify T cell subtypes and assess biomarker expression in DCs. A BALB/c-derived xenograft mouse model was established to evaluate the functional role of MyD88 in tumor progression and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to reassess the biological effects of MyD88 in HCC patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Results Our pan-cancer data analysis further highlights the significant impact of MYD88 on clinical outcomes in HCC. Analysis of TCGA and GEO databases confirms that MYD88 serves as a key signaling molecule in DCs, reinforcing its critical role in immune regulation. Our in vitro experiments demonstrates that MyD88 modulates T cell function through DCs. In vivo, H22 tumor cells exhibited accelerated growth in MyD88 knockout mice and a reduced response to anti-PD-1 treatment, whereas wild-type mice showed the opposite trend. Discussion These findings underscore the critical role of MYD88 in DC function, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for immunoregulation in HCC. By shaping the TME, MYD88 not only regulates the immune response in HCC but also influences patient clinical outcomes. Both ex vivo and in vivo experiments further validate that MYD88 impacts DC functionality, contributing to variations in HCC progression">

        <tr id="Excessive neutrophil infiltration can exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage, contributing to conditions like autoimmune disorders and liver diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects. Our study offers a perspective for advancing MSC-based therapies in tissue repair.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Curative responses to immunotherapy require the generation of robust systemic immunity with limited toxicity. Recruitment of T cell populations such as precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex) from lymphoid tissues to tumors is a hallmark of effective treatment. However, the ability to efficiently induce this recruitment is lacking in current immunotherapy approaches. Furthermore, systemic administration of immunotherapies frequently results in dose-limiting toxicities, yielding an inadequate therapeutic window for eliciting durable responses. Methods In this investigation, we evaluated the safety and antitumor efficacy of locally administered interleukin 12 (IL-12) using a clinically translatable cytokine delivery platform (NCT05538624) to identify Tpex recruitment capabilities at tolerable cytokine doses. Results We show IL-12 cytokine factories can effectively treat a broad spectrum of cancer types. Single-cell RNA sequencing data suggests that the antitumor efficacy seen in our studies was due to retinal pigmented epithelial cells-mIL12 treatment inducing differentiation of Tpex cells within the tumor microenvironment. When administered in combination with checkpoint therapy, IL-12 cytokine factory treatment generated systemic abscopal immunity, preventing subcutaneous tumor outgrowth in 8/9 mice with colorectal cancer and lung metastasis in mice with melanoma. Furthermore, this platform was well tolerated in a non-human primate without signs of toxicity. Conclusions Our new immunotherapy approach provides a robust strategy for inducing Tpex recruitment and systemic immunity against a range of solid peritoneal malignancies, many incurable with current immunotherapy strategies. Notably, these features were achieved using IL-12, and by leveraging our technology, we avoided the toxicities that have prevented the translation of IL-12 to the clinic. Our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of IL-12 cytokine factories.">

        <tr id="CD4+FOXP3+ Treg cells maintain self tolerance, suppress the immune response to cancer, and protect against tissue injury during acute inflammation. Treg cells require mitochondrial metabolism to function, but how Treg cells adapt their metabolic programs to optimize their function during an immune response occurring in a metabolically stressed microenvironment remains unclear. Here, we tested whether Treg cells require the energy homeostasis–maintaining enzyme AMPK to adapt to metabolically aberrant microenvironments caused by malignancy or lung injury, finding that AMPK is dispensable for Treg cell immune-homeostatic function but is necessary for full Treg cell function in B16 melanoma tumors and during influenza virus pneumonia. AMPK-deficient Treg cells had lower mitochondrial mass and exhibited an impaired ability to maximize aerobic respiration. Mechanistically, we found that AMPK regulates DNA methyltransferase 1 to promote transcriptional programs associated with mitochondrial function in the tumor microenvironment. During viral pneumonia, we found that AMPK sustains metabolic homeostasis and mitochondrial activity. Induction of DNA hypomethylation was sufficient to rescue mitochondrial mass in AMPK-deficient Treg cells, linking AMPK function to mitochondrial metabolism via DNA methylation. These results define AMPK as a determinant of Treg cell adaptation to metabolic stress and offer potential therapeutic targets in cancer and tissue injury.">

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) are versatile professional antigen-presenting cells and play an instrumental role in the generation of antigen-specific T-cell responses. Modulation of DC function holds promise as an effective strategy to improve anti-tumor immunotherapy efficacy and enhance self-antigen tolerance in autoimmune diseases. Methods Wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (KO) mice at 2 weeks of age were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to induce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Four weeks later, WT and KO mice were randomly divided into control and treatment groups and treated once every two days for 30 weeks with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and a mix of 4 TLR2-activating lactic acid-producing probiotics (LAP), respectively. Mice were euthanized after 30 weeks of LAP treatment and their liver tissues were collected for gene expression, histological, flow cytometric and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Results We demonstrate here that oral administration of a mix of TLR2-activating LAP triggers a marked accumulation of regulatory DCs (rDCs) in the liver of mice. LAP-treated mice are protected from DEN-induced liver injury, fibrosis and HCC in a TLR2-dependent manner. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that LAP treatment determines an immunosuppressive hepatic T-cell program that is characterized by a significantly reduced cytotoxic activity. The observed functional changes of T cells correlated well with the presence of a hepatic DC subset displaying a regulatory or tolerogenic transcriptional signature. Conclusion Overall, these data suggest that stimulation of regulatory dendritic cells (rDCs) in the liver by LAP suppresses cytotoxic T-cell function and alleviates DEN-induced liver damage, fibrosis and tumorigenesis.">

        <tr id="In solid tumors, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex mix of tumor, immune, stromal cells, fibroblasts, and the extracellular matrix. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute a fraction of immune cells that may infiltrate into the TME. The primary function of these T-cells is to detect and eliminate tumor cells. However, due to the immunosuppressive factors present in the TME primarily mediated by Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) as well as the tumor cells themselves, T-cells fail to differentiate into effector cells or become dysfunctional and are unable to eliminate the tumor. In addition, chronic antigen stimulation within the TME also leads to a phenomenon, first identified in chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, where the T-cells become exhausted and lose their effector functions. Exhausted T-cells (Tex) are characterized by the presence of remarkably conserved inhibitory receptors, transcription and signaling factors and the downregulation of key effector molecules. Tex cells have been identified in various malignancies, including melanoma, colorectal and hepatocellular cancers. Recent studies have indicated novel strategies to reverse T-cell exhaustion. These include checkpoint inhibitor blockade targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), or combinations of different immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) or combination of ICTs with cytokine co-stimulation. In this review, we discuss aspects of T-cell dysfunction within the TME with a focus on T-cell exhaustion. We believe that gaining insight into the mechanisms of T-cell exhaustion within the TME of human solid tumors will pave the way for developing therapeutic strategies to target and potentially re-invigorate exhausted T-cells in cancer.">

        <tr id="Tumor dissemination is a key event in tumor progression. During this event, a main role is played by circulating tumor cells (CTCs), immune cells, and their interaction. How the immune system supports the survival and proliferation of CTCs is not fully elucidated. In this study we established an in-vitro co-culture system consisting of immune cells and CTCs from the same patient, which increased the success rate in the establishment of CTC-derived long-term cell cultures. In this system, we characterized the immune cells of successful co-cultures and the signals they exchange with cancer cells, including cytokines and extracellular vesicle (EV) content. Using this protocol, we stabilized four CTC-derived cell lines from patients with metastatic gastroesophageal cancer, which were cultured for over a year and characterized from a genetic and molecular point of view. The four cell lines harbor shared chromosomal aberrations including the amplification at 8q24.21 containing MYC and deletion 9p21.3 containing CDKN2A/B and the IFN type I cluster. The transcriptomic profile of CTC cell lines is distinct from primary tumors, and we detected the activation of E2F, G2M and MYC pathways and the downregulation of interferon response pathway. Each cell line shows a degree of invasiveness in zebrafish in-vivo, and the most invasive ones share the same mutation in RAB14 gene. In addition, the four cell lines secrete cell-line specific EVs containing microRNAs that target YAP, BRG1-AKT1, TCF8-HDAC pathways. Overall, we highlight how the immune system plays a key role in the proliferation of CTCs through EV signaling, and how CTC cell line genomic and transcriptomic alterations make these cells less visible from the immune system and likely responsible for the survival advantage in sites distant from the microenvironment of origin.">

Here, we integrated multiple single-cell assays (>150,000 cells) with a broad spectrum of blood-derived and renal allograft-derived cells. We observed 6 cell trajectories ranging from circulating CD14+ monocytes to differentiated macrophages in the kidney, with one trajectory culminating in a pro-inflammatory macrophage expressing CXCL9 and CXCL10 enriched in the allograft during rejection. LILRB2, a gene encoding an HLA-binding receptor, was closely associated with this trajectory, and was found upregulated in a recirculating classical monocyte contingent in patients with rejection but also in biopsies upon rejection. In vitro, allogeneic activation resulted in upregulation of LILRB2 in monocytes. Moreover, LILRB2 is able to bind non-self class I HLA in primary human macrophages resulted in overexpression of proinflammatory genes, suggesting the involvement of this receptor in monocyte/macrophage-associated rejection phenomena.">

However, the mechanisms that shape the tumor-immune microenvironment are incompletely understood. Here, we identify Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins as novel modulators of the tumor-immune microenvironment across diverse cancers. We demonstrate that loss of tumor MBNL expression results in an attenuated response to interferon gamma and reduced tumor antigen presentation in melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer cells. Parallel experiments in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model revealed that MBNL loss reduces tumor cell killing by CD8 + T cells in vitro and facilitates tumor escape from cytotoxic CD8 + T cell infiltration in vivo. Finally, we extended these studies to 29 human cancer types to find that MBNL expression levels are strongly associated with gene expression signatures of T cell tumor infiltration. These insights suggest that MBNL proteins play important roles in shaping the immune landscape across diverse malignancies.">

        <tr id="In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (Tregs) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD+), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes Tregs by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD+ with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing Tregs back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral Tregs, sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD+ axis disrupts Tregs metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.">

Periphery blood samples from patients with NPC were prospectively collected, and phenotypic and functional analyses of γδ T cells were performed using flow cytometry. Tumor-bearing models and RAR inhibitor approaches were utilized to investigate RA/RAR-mediated regulation of T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) and the antitumor activity of γδ T cells. Here, our findings indicate that immune exhaustion markers are highly expressed on peripheral αβ and γδ T cells in NPC patients. Serum RA levels are negatively correlated with the abundance of Tim-3 on circulating Vδ2 T cells. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that RA/RAR signaling directly targets Vδ2 T cells, repressing Tim-3 expression, promoting NF-κB activation, and enhancing the production of antitumor-related cytokines. Notably, RA supplementation improved the efficacy of Vδ2 T cell-mediated immunotherapy in human NPC by suppressing Tim-3 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that RA/RAR signaling plays a crucial role in reversing immune exhaustion and represents a promising target for γδ T cell antitumor immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Objective Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating anti-tumor immune responses. However, various factors can suppress DCs function and compromise anti-tumor immunity. Itaconate, a metabolite activated during inflammation and infection, has been identified to possess immunomodulatory properties, but its role on DCs remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of itaconate in regulating the maturation and function of DCs and its underlying molecular mechanism. Methods Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were treated with 4-octyl itaconate (4OI). The expression levels of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC-II on BMDCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of cytokines was assessed using RT-qPCR. BMDCs with different treatment were adoptively transferred to B16-OVA tumor-bearing mice. The production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein level of NRF2 in BMDCs was analyzed by Western blot. Results Treatment with 4OI represses DC maturation and function. Specifically, 4OI-treated DCs exhibited impaired phenotypic and functional maturation, characterized by decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86, as well as lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β. Furthermore, these DCs demonstrated a diminished capacity to stimulate T cell responses both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 4OI inhibits DCs maturation and function through enhancing and activating KEAP1/NRF2 pathway. Conclusion This study reveals that 4OI inhibits DC function through NRF2 activation, elucidating the immunomodulatory mechanisms of itaconate and emphasizing its pivotal role in developing targeted DC-based tumor immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Esophageal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death, often preceded with chronic inflammation and injuries. The NFκB/IKKβ pathway plays a central role in inflammation, yet its role in early esophageal carcinogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated the role of epithelial IKKβ in early esophageal carcinogenesis. Mice were treated with the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) or a vehicle for one month to induce precancerous lesions. Esophagi were harvested and examined through histological, protein, flow cytometry, and RNA analyses. Histological analysis revealed that 4-NQO treatment led to increased inflammation, intraepithelial CD45+ immune cells, and elevated IKKβ phosphorylation levels. Mice with esophageal epithelial-specific Ikkβ deletion (4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO) showed delayed progression to a precancerous state, with reduced immune cell recruitment compared to 4-NQO/controls. Immunophenotyping showed decreased recruitment of T cells, including CD4+, CD8+ and regulatory (Tregs) T cells, and increased recruitment of macrophages in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice compared to 4-NQO/controls. RNA sequencing data identified 262 differentially expressed genes in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice, implicating pathways related to inflammation and wound healing. Notably, the chemokine CXCL9, a T cell chemoattractant, was significantly upregulated in 4-NQO control mice, but not in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice. Further analysis identified IFNγ as an upstream regulator of Cxcl9 expression, and neutralization of IFNγ reduced Cxcl9 expression levels in 4-NQO treated mice. Additionally, in vitro studies demonstrated that IFNγ upregulates Cxcl9 in an NF-ĸB dependent manner in esophageal keratinocytes. These findings suggest that epithelial IKKβ regulates the immune microenvironment in early esophageal carcinogenesis through the IFNγ/CXCL9 axis and influencing T cell recruitment and inflammatory responses. Summary In a mouse model of early esophageal squamous cell carcinogenesis, loss of epithelial Ikkβ reduced inflammation and T cell recruitment, increased macrophage recruitment, inhibited IFNγ/CXCL9 signaling, and delayed the transition to a precancerous state.">

        <tr id="A primary obstacle for HIV elimination is the long-term viral reservoir in lymphoid tissues (LT) that can cause rebound viremia if therapy is stopped. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are critical for control of HIV and SIV viremia; however, CD8+ T cells that migrate to LT are primarily non-cytotoxic, calling into question whether these cells could reduce the viral reservoir on ART or control viral replication when therapy is halted. To determine if CD8+ T cells can inhibit viral replication when retained in lymphoid tissues, we inhibited lymphocyte egress from LTs in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RM) during analytic treatment interruption (ATI) using the S1PR modulator FTY720 alone or in combination with anti-PD1 and the IL-15 receptor superagonist N-803 to increase cytolytic function. FTY720 retained migrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in LT, whereas cytotoxic CD8+ T cells remained in the vasculature. After ATI and viral rebound, activated SIV-specific CD8+ T cells increased in frequency in LT of FTY720-treated RM but failed to become cytotoxic or control plasma viremia compared to controls, even when combined with anti-PD1 and N-803. These findings indicate that LT-localized CD8+ T cells alone are insufficient to delay or prevent plasma viral rebound during ATI. Significance Statement HIV therapeutic and cure strategies have all operated under the assumption that CD8+ T cells can become cytotoxic in lymph nodes to eliminate infected cells from reservoir repositories. Using FTY720 to prevent lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes, we demonstrated that lymphoid tissue-restricted CD8+ T cells are insufficient to prevent SIV rebound during antiretroviral treatment interruption, even in the presence of immunomodulators such as IL-15 receptor superagonist and PD-1 blockade. These findings call into question the ability of lymph node CD8+ T cells to control or eliminate SIV/HIV infection from lymphoid tissues without substantial immunomodulation, a notion contrary to current efforts to engage CD8+ T cells for therapeutic elimination of HIV viral reservoirs during ART.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor immune evasion extends beyond T cells, affecting innate immune elements like natural killer cells (NK) and macrophages within the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME). Nevertheless, translational strategies to trigger collaboration of NK cells and macrophages to initiate sufficient anti-tumor cytoxicity remain scarce and are urgently needed. Methods In this study, TCGA datasets was used to confirm the prognosis value of the expression level of NLR family pyrin domain containing 4 (NLRP4) in NSCLC and the tumor tissues microarray was used to further check its clinical-relevance at protein-level. Subsequently, a tumor cell line with stable NLRP4 overexpression was established and subcutaneous tumor models in C57BL/6J mice were used to validate the anti-tumor characteristics of NLRP4. After analyzing the tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence, we further validated our findings through co-culture transwell assays and TCGA analysis. Utilizing bulk-RNA sequencing, proteomics, and mass spectrometry of mouse tumor tissues, we innovatively identified the downstream pathways of NLRP4 and verified them through co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and Western blot (WB) experiments. Results NLRP4 could trigger a distinct anti-tumor ecosystem organized by TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1 in lung cancer, discovered in TCGA analysis and verified in murine model. NLRP4-eco exerted tumor-suppression capacity through chemokine reprogramming including CCL5 and CXCL2. Meanwhile, the cytoxicity of NK could be facilitated by iNOS+M1. Mechanistically, NLRP4 stimulated PI3K/Akt-NF-kB axis through suppression of the activity of PP2A. Besides, knockdown of CCL5 and blockade of CXCL2-CXCR2 axis abolished chemotaxis of TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1 respectively, as well as for LB-100, a PP2A inhibitor. Conclusion Altogether, we delineated NLRP4’s unexplored facets and discovered an NLRP4-driven anti-tumor ecosystem composed of TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1. Finally, targeting PP2A by its inhibitor successfully mimicked the anti-tumor capacity of the overexpression of NLRP4.

        <tr id="Chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases are driven, in part, by the activation of (auto)reactive CD4+ T-cells, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets for these diseases. Nicotinamide (NAM) has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in various disease models and has already demonstrated safety in several large clinical trials in humans. The mechanisms behind these observations, and especially their direct effects on CD4+ T-cells, remain poorly understood. Here, we address this gap by investigating how NAM influences CD4+ T-cell activation and function. We also describe that NAM treatment significantly suppresses CD4+ T-cell activation in vitro, as evidenced by impaired proliferation and reduced expression of surface activation markers. Additionally, NAM treatment resulted in reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-2, IFNy, and IL-17, further highlighting its anti-inflammatory potential. We found that NAM modulates key metabolic processes, including glycolysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production—both essential to T-cell activation. Taken together, our findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the regulation of T-cell activation by NAM, suggesting NAM as an attractive candidate for novel therapies targeting immune-related diseases.">

        <tr id="In the tumor host, neutrophils may exhibit protumor or antitumor activity. It is hypothesized that in response to host-derived or therapy-induced factors, neutrophils adopt diverse functional states to ultimately execute these differential functions. Here, we provide an alternative scenario in which the response of an individual tumor cell population determines the overall protumor versus antitumor outcome of neutrophil‒tumor interactions. Experimentally, we show that human neutrophils, which are sequentially stimulated with bacteria and secreted factors from tumor cells, kill a certain proportion of tumor target cells. However, the majority of the tumor cells remained resistant to this neutrophil-mediated killing and underwent a functional, phenotypic and transcriptomic switch that was reminiscent of partial epithelial‒to-mesenchymal transition. This cell biological switch was associated with physical escape from NK-mediated killing and resulted in enhanced metastasis to the lymph nodes in a preclinical orthotopic mouse model. Mechanistically, we identified the antimicrobial neutrophil granule proteins neutrophil elastase (NE) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) as the molecular mediators of this functional switch. We validated these data in patients with head and neck cancer and identified bacterially colonized intratumoral niches that were enriched for mesenchymal tumor cells and neutrophils expressing NE and MMP-9. Our data reveal the parallel execution of tumor cytotoxic and prometastatic activity by activated neutrophils and identify NE and MMP-9 as mediators of lymph node metastasis. The identified mechanism explains the functional dichotomy of tumor-associated neutrophils at the level of the tumor target cell response and has implications for superinfected cancers and the dysbiotic tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Cancer cells harbor cell-intrinsic programs capable of sculpting immunogenic landscapes, yet molecular brakes that enforce immune evasion remain poorly defined. Here, we identify C9ORF50, a previously uncharacterized intrinsically disordered protein, as a liquid-liquid phase separation-driven regulator of RNA processing and actionable immunotherapy target. Genetic ablation of C9ORF50 induces selective intron retention in spliceosome component transcripts, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This dsRNA activates type I interferon pathway that in turn orchestrates a chemokine secretory program critical for T cell recruitment. The resultant enhancement of tumor immunogenicity and reprogramming of tumor immune microenvironment drives robust antitumor immunity, effectively converting immunologically “cold” tumors to “hot” phenotypes. Therapeutic targeting of C9ORF50 via RNA interference achieved robust tumor suppression in syngeneic models, suggesting its translational relevance. Notably, C9ORF50 exhibits tumor-predominant expression, with minimal baseline levels detected in healthy tissues or immune cell populations, underscoring its potential safety as a therapeutic target. Our study not only identifies C9ORF50 as a novel LLPS-dependent regulator of RNA splicing but also establishes it as a promising and potentially safe therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity serves as a de facto memory for innate immune responses, resulting in long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. It enhances resistance to pathogens and augments immunosurveillance under physiological conditions. Given that innate immune cells typically have a short lifespan and do not divide, persistent innate immune memory may be mediated by epigenetic and metabolic changes in long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. HSCs fine-tune their state and fate in various training conditions, thereby generating functionally adapted progeny cells that orchestrate innate immune plasticity. Notably, both beneficial and maladaptive trained immunity processes can comprehensively influence HSC state and fate, leading to divergent hematopoiesis and immune outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize recent advances regarding HSC state and fate in the context of trained immunity. By elucidating the stem cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory network, we aim to refine current models of innate immune memory and provide actionable insights for developing targeted therapies against infectious diseases and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for engineering precision-trained immunity through HSC-targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic regulators of T cell maturation and exhaustion. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs influence T cell function in tumor environments remain unclear. This study focuses on miR-379-5p, which counteracts T cell exhaustion and enhances antitumor responses. Methods Native CD8+ T cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors and subjected to chronic stimulation to induce exhaustion. RNA sequencing and miRNA sequencing were performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. These miRNAs underwent bioinformatics analyses, including DESeq enrichment, immune cell infiltration assessment, and patient prognostic outcomes in The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets to assess their potential involvement in T cell exhaustion and antitumor immunity. The biological functions of miRNA on T cell differentiation, cytotoxic killing, and immune checkpoint regulation were investigated using in vitro assays, OT-I B16F10-OVA models, and patient-derived tumor organoids. Results MiR-379-5p is downregulated in exhausted T cells and negatively associated with exhausted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in advanced tumors. It correlates positively with better survival outcomes in breast cancer, cervical cancer and melanoma. In CD8+ T cells, miR-379-5p reduces the expression of immune checkpoint proteins T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3) and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) by targeting their 3’ untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-379-5p in CD8+ T cell promotes differentiation into memory-like T effector cells and enhances cytotoxic killing of cancer cells. The transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) with increased expression in exhausted T cells and negatively regulates miR-379, restoring immune checkpoint expression and suppressing cancer-killing ability. In contrast, OT-I T cells expressing ectopic miR-379-5p show increased cytotoxicity against B16F10-OVA tumors in mice. Autologous T cells isolated from patients with breast cancer transduced with miR-379-5p significantly improve killing of tumor organoids derived from the same patients. Conclusions MiR-379-5p acts as an epigenetic tumor suppressor by enhancing CD8+ T cell effector functions and suppressing T cell exhaustion. MiR-379-5p could represent a novel marker and strategy for cancer immunotherapy, offering promising avenues for enhancing antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has revolutionized cancer treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. However, resistance remains a critical challenge. This study aimed to comparatively elucidate immunophenotypic changes in syngeneic mouse models sensitive (MC-38) or resistant (LLC1) to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. In the sensitive MC-38 model, anti-PD-1 therapy increased dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, while decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment. Enhanced expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I/II) and costimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86) was observed on tumor-associated DCs and macrophages. Tumor-infiltrating CD4+T, CD8+T, regulatory T, NK, and NKT cells also significantly increased. Importantly, treatment boosted lymphocyte cytotoxic potential, with perforin identified as a key marker of efficacy. Notably, perforin expression in CD4+T and NKT cells strongly negatively correlated with tumor volume. In contrast, the resistant LLC1 model exhibited minimal immunophenotypic changes upon treatment. These findings highlight critical immune modifications induced by anti-PD-1 therapy, particularly the role of perforin, and the DC/MDSC ratio in predicting therapeutic outcomes. This research offers valuable insights into potential predictive biomarkers and informs strategies to overcome resistance, emphasizing the complex interplay between anti-PD-1 treatment and the tumor microenvironment, ultimately aiming to improve immunotherapy response rates.">

        <tr id="Diabetes negatively impacts the host immune system, leading to allergies, recurring infections, and lameness. Its impact on the distribution and molecular phenotypes of the bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) needs attention and, more importantly, in co-morbid conditions like diabetes and tuberculosis (DM-TB). In this study, total bone marrow cells were harvested at 3 w.p.i., from the low aerosol dose (100-120 CFU) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv infected control and NA-STZ induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice. The bone marrow cells were differentiated into BMDMs, and CD11c, CD11b and F4/80 marker expressions were monitored using flow cytometry. BMDMs stimulated with Mtb H37Rv lysate were subjected to global transcriptome profiling to identify the perturbed metabolic and molecular landscape. The BMDMs of the DM-TB comorbid mice showed low CD11c, CD11b and higher F4/80 expression. The macrophages of the DM group showed a skewed pro-inflammatory response, characterized by perturbed complement response, NF-kB pathway and fatty acid metabolism, whereas macrophages of the DM-TB group showed deregulated ceramide and amino acid metabolism. Macrophages from the DM and DM-TB group stimulated with Mtb H37Rv lysate, showed a deregulated transcript signature that impacts humoral response. The dampened immune response observed in the DM-TB group macrophages highlights the importance of identifying novel targets for developing tailored drugs for comorbid conditions.">

        <tr id="Backgrounds: The rapid initiation of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) can control HIV-1 viremia and stabilize the long-term health of people living with HIV-1 (PLWH). Despite this, individuals who are diagnosed late and exhibit poor therapeutic efficacy still pose a great challenge to global HIV management. To address this, we conducted comprehensive multiparametric immune profiling and analyzed its association with disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. Methods: Multicolor flow cytometry was used to characterize the circulating immune cell composition and cellular phenotypes in 40 treatment-naive individuals (16 chronic, 24 newly diagnosed), 26 HAART-treated individuals, and 18 healthy controls. Comparative analyses of T cell subsets, immune activation markers, and viral load signatures were performed, followed by network construction. We carried out principal component analysis and displayed the data by dimensionality reduction. Results: Persistent immune activation, dysregulated regulatory immunity, and aberrant memory differentiation markers were identified in T cells of HIV-1-infected individuals and were associated with disease progression. Additionally, HAART-treated patients which did not fully restore CD4 T cells exhibited higher levels of activated markers, suggesting possible biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy. Conclusions: This study describes changes in immune cell profiles throughout HIV-1 disease progression and explores suitable laboratory predictors for future clinical and therapeutic settings by monitoring pathological immune cell events.">

However, the more comprehensive spectrum of such metabolites and their mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that L-selenomethionine (L-SeMet), a gut microbial metabolite, acts as a positive regulator of immunotherapy. Through screening of a repository of gut microbial metabolites, we identified that L-SeMet can effectively enhance the effector function of CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, intragastric administration of L-SeMet in mice significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous MC38 tumors. Mechanistically, L-SeMet enhances T cell receptor (TCR) signaling by promoting LCK phosphorylation. Collectively, our findings reveal that the gut microbial metabolite L-SeMet inhibits colorectal tumor growth by potentiating CD8+ T cell functions, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for colorectal cancer treatment.">

We collected and quantitatively profiled the intratumoral mycobiome data from 1044 patients with RCC across four international cohorts, of which 466 patients received immunotherapy. Patients were stratified into mycobiota ecology-depauperate and mycobiota ecology-flourishing (MEF) groups based on fungal abundance. The MEF group had worse prognosis, higher fungal diversity, down-regulated lipid catabolism, and exhausted CD8+ T cells. We developed the intratumoral mycobiota signature and intratumoral mycobiota-related genes expression signature, which robustly predicted prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes in RCC and other cancers. Aspergillus tanneri was identified as a potential key fungal species influencing RCC prognosis. Our findings suggest that the intratumoral mycobiome suppresses lipid catabolism and induces T cell exhaustion in RCC.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in engineered adaptive immune cell therapies, current options for innate immune cell therapies are sparse. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a neutrophil progenitor-based cell therapy. Murine conditionally-immortalized neutrophil progenitors (NPs) overcome the hurdles of alternative cell therapies by engrafting in the unconditioned host and substantially contributing to the host neutrophil population. Here we demonstrate the therapeutic value of NPs using a murine model of the primary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Those with CGD are highly susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus because of genetic mutations that impair neutrophil antimicrobial function. We find that the prophylactic treatment of CGD mice with transfused NPs rescue them from an otherwise lethal S. aureus pulmonary infection. In investigating the mechanisms behind the improved clearance of S. aureus and survival of CGD mice, our data suggests that the antimicrobial function of host CGD neutrophils is rescued by the presence of donor-derived wild-type neutrophils. We also observe that survival is improved to >50% in the CGD model when mice receive NPs post-infection. This work highlights the application of NPs to improving outcomes to acute bacterial infection in CGD, demonstrating the translational potential of conditionally-immortalized myeloid progenitors as a cellular therapy.">

        <tr id="Despite the success of cancer immunotherapy in treating hematologic malignancies, their efficacy in solid tumors remains limited due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which is mainly formed by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs not only exert potent immunosuppressive effects that hinder the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and adaptive cellular therapies, but they also promote tumor advancement through non-immunological pathways, including promoting angiogenesis, driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and contributing to the establishment of pre-metastatic environments. While targeting MDSCs alone or in combination with conventional therapies has shown limited success, emerging evidence suggests that MDSC checkpoint blockade in combination with other immunotherapies holds great promise in overcoming both immunological and non-immunological barriers. In this review, we discussed the dual roles of MDSCs, with a particular emphasis on their underexplored checkpoints blockade strategies. We discussed the rationale behind combination strategies, their potential advantages in overcoming MDSC-mediated immunosuppression, and the challenges associated with their development. Additionally, we highlight future research directions aimed at optimizing combination immunotherapies to enhance cancer therapeutic effectiveness, particularly in solid tumor therapies where MDSCs are highly prevalent.">

        <tr id="Introduction Due to the historical dogma that host defense against intracellular pathogens is primarily mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have long been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence highlights the multifaceted role of B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. B cells accumulate at the site of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity are still being unraveled. In addition to producing antibodies, B cells secrete a wide range of cytokines that can influence the local immune response. In this study, we focused on the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-secreting B cells in the long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Methods B cell-specific IL-10 expression was assessed in IL-10 transcriptional reporter (Vert-X) mice following Mtb infection. To investigate the role of B cell-derived IL-10 in TB immunity, both male and female mice with a targeted knockout of IL-10 in B cells (IL-10flox/CD19cre) were infected with Mtb HN878. Disease progression, control of bacterial replication, and immunological changes were monitored throughout the course of infection. Results B cells contribute to IL-10 production in the Mtb-infected lung in both sexes, with CD138+ plasma cells serving as the primary source of B cell-derived IL-10. Mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 exhibited increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, demonstrated by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was associated with male-specific immune alterations. Conclusion Our research highlights a previously unrecognized sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT People living with HIV (PLWH) exhibit accelerated aging, characterized by systemic inflammation, termed “inflammaging.” While T-cell expansion is prevalent in PLWH, its connection to inflammaging remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the TCRβ repertoire of 257 healthy controls (HC) and 228 PLWH, revealing pronounced T cell clonal expansion in PLWH. The expansion was only partially reversed following antiretroviral therapy (ART) and closely associated with ART duration, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio. TCR-based age modeling showed a continuous accelerated trajectory of aging in PLWH, especially in younger individuals, in stark contrast to the nonlinear aging acceleration pattern seen in HC. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA combined TCR sequencing and in vitro experiments, we identified GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the primary population driving clonal expansion and maintenance in PLWH. These cells are characterized by high cytotoxicity and low exhaustion and are activated by interleukin-15 (IL-15) in vitro. Notably, GNLY+CD8+ T cells predominantly express the pro-inflammatory 15 kDa form of granulysin(GNLY). The supernatant from IL-15-stimulated CD8+ T cells induces monocytes to secrete inflammatory factors and disrupts the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells, which can be partially restored by the anti-GNLY antibodies. These findings identify GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the central drivers of persistent clonal expansion, highlighting their crucial role for mitigating inflammaging in PLWH.">

        <tr id="To provide protection, anticipatory T cell–dependent immunity is reliant on the generation and maintenance of a naïve T cell repertoire, which is sufficiently diverse to ensure recognition of newly encountered antigens. Therefore, under steady-state conditions, a given individual needs to maintain a large pool of naïve T cells, ready to respond to potential threats. Here, we demonstrate that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (Ndrg3) is essential for naïve T cell stability. Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis.">

Mechanistically, HLH / MAS are driven by persistent activation of lymphoid and myeloid cells, but our understanding of the pathogenic cell populations remains incomplete. Main body In this Perspectives article, we provide an overview of the biology of HLH / MAS and the critical role of interferon-g in disease pathogenesis. We discuss the recent discovery of cycling lymphocytes in HLH / MAS marked by expression of CD38 and HLA-DR, which are primary producers of IFN-γ. The expansion of cycling lymphocytes correlates with disease activity and helps to distinguish HLH / MAS from clinical mimics. We demonstrate an approach to quantify CD38+HLA-DR+ cycling lymphocytes and evaluate their utility as a diagnostic biomarker for HLH / MAS. Lastly, we discuss the treatment of MAS, including potential therapeutic options to target these pathogenic lymphocytes. Conclusion Understanding of biology of cycling lymphocytes in HLH / MAS will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches to overcome these fatal hyperinflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Mechanisms underlying the T-cell-dependent anti-cancer effect of cyclophosphamide (CTX) are not fully understood. We found that CTX chemotherapy induces long-term survival of mice bearing metastasized breast cancer with chromosomal instability. Given that CTX induces DNA damage and type I interferon (IFN-I) in vivo and that cGAS senses cytosolic double-stranded DNA, we investigated the role of the host cGAS–STING–IFN-I pathway in CTX therapy. We found that CD8+ T cells, the cGAS of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells, the STING of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), and the IFN-I response of non-cDC1 myeloid cells are essential for CTX efficacy. Moreover, the cGAS and STING of BM-derived cells positively modulate intratumoral CD8+ T cell populations. Our study shows that the T-cell-dependent anti-tumor effect of CTX critically involves the cGAS–STING–IFN-I axis, the IFN-I response, and the STING-independent cGAS function of host myeloid cells, which supports the deployment of CTX in treating advanced solid tumors by bypassing the often-failed IFN-I production by tumor cells due to a chronic activation of the intrinsic cGAS–STING caused by chromosomal instability.">

        <tr id="Background
 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a critical treatment for hematologic disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, and specific immune deficiencies. Despite its efficacy, challenges such as engraftment failure and delayed neutrophil regeneration remain significant barriers. These complications lead to prolonged cytopenia, increased risks of infections and other complications, and elevated morbidity and mortality rates. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to play essential roles in supporting hematopoiesis, the precise mechanisms and interactions between MSCs and other cellular components in HSCT require further investigation. Methods To address these challenges, we explored the combined infusion of allotype-cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and activated T cells from the same donor along with third-party MSCs. The study assessed the effects of this triple-cell therapy on neutrophil differentiation and function ex vivo and in vivo. Using a respiratory infection model, we evaluated the accumulation of human neutrophils, cytokine secretion (IL-6 and IL-8), bacterial clearance, and overall survival compared to control groups. Results The triple-cell therapy demonstrated a significant improvement in the differentiation of human HSCs into neutrophils both in ex vivo and in vivo. In the respiratory infection model, this approach resulted in enhanced accumulation of human neutrophils, increased secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, superior bacterial clearance, and reduced mortality rates compared to the control group. These findings highlight the synergistic interplay between allo-HSCs, MSCs, and activated T cells in promoting neutrophil production and function. Conclusions Our study presents a novel therapeutic strategy combining allo-HSCs, activated T cells, and third-party MSCs to enhance neutrophil production and functionality post-transplantation. This approach not only accelerates neutrophil regeneration but also improves resistance to infections, offering a promising avenue to overcome engraftment challenges in HSCT.">

        <tr id="Neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (NATI) significantly prolonged outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Residual tumor cells that survive NATI represent high-risk cell populations with metastatic potential and usually evade immunosurveillance by NK cells. Using an 82-protein panel, we here profiled single-cell membrane proteomics of CD56+ (NCAM1+) NK cells from tumor, peri-cancerous tissue, as well as peripheral blood from 28 TNBC patients post-NATI of residual cancer burden II/III. Unsupervised clustering resulted in several distinct clusters: 2 tumor-infiltrating NK (TINK) clusters with divergent functions of immune activation (TNFRSF7+) and suppression (SELL+); 2 immuno-suppressive peri-cancerous clusters; and 1 periphery-specific cluster. Considering the contradiction of the 2 TINK clusters, we further tested cytokine functions of SELL + and TNFRSF7 + TINKs by single-cell secreting proteomics using a 32-cytokine panel. Consistently, SELL + TINK clusters were characterized by immuno-suppressive secretion patterns (IL10+). A low proportion of SELL + TINK cluster and low proportion of IL10 + secreting SELL + TINK cluster (single-cell secreting proteomics) were both associated with better progression-free survival time. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 15 patients during 16-month follow-up. Overall, we identified a distinct immuno-suppressive TINK cell group, featuring IL10 + secreting and SELL expression with a strong relation to poor survival prognosis in TNBC patients post-NATI.

        <tr id="Allogeneic stem cell transplant and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) are the current standard treatments for patients with aplastic anemia (AA). However, IST also carries significant risks and side effects, and up to 30–50% of patients experienced refractory or relapsed disease following IST. Treating AA remains challenging and novel efficient therapies are in critical need. The IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) plays a crucial role in the T cell response and functions as a regulator of T cell activity. While ITK inhibition has shown promise in various immune-related disorders, its potential role in the pathophysiology of AA has not been thoroughly investigated. We observed elevated level of phosphorylated ITK in T cells from AA patients and AA mouse models. Moreover, we found that both treatment with an ITK inhibitor or conditional depletion of Itk in donor mice alleviated bone marrow hypoplasia, improved cytopenia, and extended survival rates. Notably, ITK inhibition orchestrates T cell quantity and function by reducing T cell infiltration and suppressing the secretion of key inflammatory cytokines in AA mice. Our data suggest that ITK inhibitor could potentially offer a new therapeutic strategy for AA.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors, enhancing clinical outcomes by releasing T cells from inhibitory effects of receptors like programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Despite these advancements, achieving durable antitumor responses remains challenging, often due to additional immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute significantly to the immunosuppressive TME and play a pivotal role in shaping T cell-mediated antitumor responses. Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2), expressed on myeloid cells, including TAMs, is an inhibitory receptor, which contributes to macrophage-mediated immunosuppression. In this study, we present AZD2796, a high-affinity anti-LILRB2 antibody designed to repolarize TAMs from an immunosuppressive to a proinflammatory phenotype. Methods Anti-LILRB2 antibodies were identified using single-B-cell encapsulation Immune Replica technology. The ability of AZD2796 to enhance proinflammatory responses from macrophages treated with CD40 ligand or lipopolysaccharide was assessed using a macrophage stimulation assay. A tumor cell/macrophage/T cell co-culture assay was developed to evaluate the effect of AZD2796, as a single agent and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody, on the cytolytic activity of antigen-specific T cells. In vivo assessments were then carried out to determine the ability of AZD2796 to alter tumor growth rate in mice humanized with CD34 hematopoietic stem cells. Results In preclinical assessments, AZD2796 skewed macrophage differentiation away from an immunosuppressive phenotype and enhanced the proinflammatory function of macrophages. AZD2796 significantly increased the anti-tumor response of T cells following PD-1 checkpoint blockade, while AZD2796 monotherapy reduced tumor growth in humanized mouse models. Conclusions These findings support the potential of AZD2796 as an anti-cancer therapy, with the ability to synergize with T-cell-based therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Background Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) initiates secondary injuries that worsen neurological damage and hinder recovery. While peripheral immune responses play a key role in stroke outcomes, clinical results from immunotherapy have been suboptimal, with limited focus on T-cell dynamics. Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) offer therapeutic potential due to their immunomodulatory properties. They can regulate immune responses and reduce neuroinflammation, potentially enhancing recovery by fostering a pro-regenerative peripheral immune environment. However, the effect of UMSCs on T-cell dynamics in AIS remains underexplored. This study investigates T-cell dynamics following AIS and examines how UMSCs may mitigate immune dysregulation to develop better treatment strategies. Methods AIS patients (NIHSS scores 0–15) were recruited within 72 h of stroke onset, with peripheral blood samples collected on Day 0 (enrollment) and Day 7. T-cell compartments were identified by flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine levels were quantified using a cytometric bead array (CBA). Mitochondria in UMSCs were labeled with MitoTracker. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients were isolated, treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cocultured with UMSCs in both direct contact and Transwell systems. Flow cytometry, CBA, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect T-cell compartments, gene expression markers for helper T (Th) cell differentiation, cytokine profiles, mitochondrial transfer, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA in UMSCs was depleted. The effects of UMSCs and mitochondria-depleted UMSCs on ischemic stroke mice were compared through behavioral assessments and analysis of the peripheral immune microenvironment. Results In AIS, T-cell compartments underwent a phenotypic shift from naïve to effector or memory states, with a specific increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells, leading to alterations in T-cell-mediated immune functions. In an ex vivo co-culture system, LPS stimulation further amplified these disparities, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in T cells. Notably, UMSCs restored mitochondrial function and reversed the shift in T-cell compartments through mitochondrial transfer. Critically, UMSC treatment significantly improved both neurological deficits and peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke mice, whereas mitochondria-depleted UMSCs failed to produce this effect. Conclusions Our comprehensive insights into the key attributes of T-cell compartments in acute ischemic stroke and the immune regulatory mechanisms of UMSCs provide a crucial theoretical foundation for understanding peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke and the therapeutic potential of UMSC treatment.

In this review, we first discuss the biology of NK cells, focusing on their functions within the tumor microenvironment (TME), the lymphatic system, and circulation. We then examine the immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells to inhibit NK cell activity, including the upregulation of inhibitory receptors. Finally, we explore the clinical implications of monitoring circulating biomarkers, such as NK cells and CTCs, for therapeutic decision-making and emphasize the need to enhance NK cell-based therapies by overcoming immune escape mechanisms.">

Here, we show that planarian flatworms harness a unique cytotoxic strategy. In planarians, activin, a hormone regulating regeneration and reproduction, also acts as an inflammatory cytokine. Overactivation of activin signaling – through protein injection, genetic chimerism, or bacterial infection – triggers ‘ruptoblasts’, an undocumented immune cell type, to undergo ‘ruptosis’, a unique mode of cell bursting that eliminates nearby cells and bacteria in mere minutes, representing one of the fastest cytotoxic mechanisms observed.

        <tr id="Background The T cell compartment undergoes significant age-related changes, contributing to the decline of the adaptive immune system and increasing the risk of suboptimal antibody responses to vaccines in older adults. To better understand the association between T cell phenotypes and vaccine responsiveness, we conducted an in-depth analysis of CD4+, CD8+, and γδ + T cells on VITAL cohort participants who are low or high responders to multiple vaccines (influenza, pneumococcal, and SARS-CoV-2). Results Using spectral cytometry and FlowSOM, we identified detailed phenotypes of naïve, regulatory, and terminally differentiated T cells. We observed that the percentages of CD31 + naïve CD4+, CD31 + naïve CD8+, and CD38 + naïve CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in low vaccine responders. Notably, CD31 + naïve T cell subsets showed a stronger correlation with immune entropy, a measure of cumulative immune system perturbations, than with age itself. Conclusions These findings suggest that subsets of naïve cells could be associated with weak vaccine responsiveness and immunosenescence. Furthermore, these naive T cell signatures could help predict weak vaccine responses, potentially informing targeted vaccination strategies in older adults.

        <tr id="Clinical data have shown that Serine/Threonine Kinase 11 (STK11) mutation may be associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITEM) and poor prognosis and failure of anti-PD-1 (αPD1) treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To explore the potential of restoring STK11 protein in immunotherapy, a bionic gene delivery system was prepared by coating the STK11-encoded DNA-cationic polymer complex core with the tumor cell membrane, termed STK11@PPCM. STK11@PPCM could specifically bind with NSCLC cells and achieve precise delivery of STK11-encoded DNA. The released DNA effectively restored the STK11 protein expression, consequently reactivating autophagy and immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells. The liberated damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and autophagosome induced dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, which in turn enhanced CD8 + T cell infiltration, M1 macrophage polarization, and proinflammatory factor expression, thereby reversing the ITEM. Moreover, STK11@PPCM was also found to improve the sensitivity of cancer cells to αPD1 by increasing the expression of PD-L1, which was confirmed in STK11-mutated NSCLC cell xenografted mouse models, constructed by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout technology. This work demonstrated for the first time that restoration of functional STK11 can effectively reverse ITME and boost αPD1 efficacy in NSCLC, offering a new therapeutic approach for STK11-mutated lung adenocarcinoma in clinic.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Upon activation, B cells undergo either the germinal center (GC) or extrafollicular (EF) response. While GC are known to generate high‐affinity memory B cells and long‐lived plasma cells, the role of the EF response is less well understood. Initially, it was thought to be limited to that of a source of fast but lower‐quality antibodies until the GC can form. However, recent evidence strongly supports the EF response as an important component of the humoral response to infection. EF responses are now also recognized as a source of pathogenic B cells in autoimmune diseases. The EF response itself is dynamic and regulated by pathways that are only recently being uncovered. We have identified that the cytokine IL‐12 acts as a molecular switch, enhancing the EF response and suppressing GC through multiple mechanisms. These include direct effects on both B cells themselves and the coordinated differentiation of helper CD4 T cells. Here, we explore this pathway in relation to other recent advancements in our understanding of the EF response's role and highlight areas for future research. A better understanding of how the EF response forms and is regulated is essential for advancing treatments for many disease states.">

        <tr id="γδ T cells are a unique subset of unconventional T cells and an important component of the innate immune system. Unlike conventional αβ T cells, γδ T cells can respond rapidly during the early stages of infection, and their antigen recognition is not restricted by MHC molecules. These distinctive features underscore the important role of γδ T cells in viral clearance and infection control. Therefore, γδ T cell-based immunotherapies have been extensively explored for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including viral infections and cancers. Several therapeutic strategies based on γδ T cells have advanced to clinical trials, demonstrating promising safety and efficacy. Currently, there are no effective treatments for flavivirus infections, which are typically characterized by acute onset. Research has shown that γδ T cells can rapidly expand during the early phases of flavivirus infections and effectively suppress viral replication, making them an attractive target for the development of novel therapies for flavivirus infections. This review aims to highlight the immunological roles of γδ T cells in flavivirus infections and to explore the potential of γδ T cell-based therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of these infections.">

        <tr id="Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with chemoresistant, immunosuppressive, and invasive properties. Despite standard therapies, including surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, tumors inevitably recur in the peritumoral region. Targeting GBM-mediated immunosuppressive and invasive properties is a promising strategy to improve clinical outcomes. Methods We utilized clinical and genomic data from the Taiwan GBM cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to analyze RNA sequencing data from patient tumor samples, determining the association of interleukin-19 (Il-19) expression with survival and immunosuppressive activity. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to assess the relationship between the enrichment levels of immune subsets and Il-19 expression level, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to predict immune responses. Cytokine array and single-cell RNA sequencing were used to examine the effects of IL-19 blockade on tumor immune microenvironment, including tumor-infiltrating leukocyte profiles, differentiation and immunosuppressive genes expression in tumor associated macrophages (TAM). CRISPR Il-19−/− cell lines and Il-19−/− mice were used to examine the role of IL-19 in tumor invasion and M2-like macrophage-mediated immunosuppression. Additionally, we developed novel cholesterol-polyethylene glycol-superparamagnetic iron oxide-IL-19 antibody nanoparticles (CHOL-PEG-SPIO-IL-19), characterized them using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy, prussian blue assay, and conducted in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a human glioblastoma stem cell-derived GBM animal model. Result Genomic screening and IPA analysis identified IL-19 as a predicted immunosuppressive cytokine in the peritumoral region, associated with poor survival in patients with GBM. Blocking IL-19 significantly inhibited tumor progression of both TMZ-sensitive (TMZ-S) and TMZ-resistant (TMZ-R) GBM-bearing mice, and modulated the immune response within the GBM microenvironment. Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveal that IL-19 antibody treatment led to a marked increase in dendritic cells and monocyte/macrophage subsets associated with interferon-gamma signaling pathways. IL-19 blockade promoted T cell activation and reprogrammed tumor-associated macrophages toward weakened pro-tumoral phenotypes with reduced Arginase 1 expression. Il19−/− M2-like bone marrow-derived macrophages with lower Arginase 1 level lost their ability to suppress CD8 T cell activation. These findings indicated that IL-19 suppression limits TAM-mediated immune suppression. Molecular studies revealed that IL-19 promotes TMZ-resistant GBM cell migration and invasion through a novel IL-19/WISP1 signaling pathway. For clinical translation, we developed a novel CHOL-PEG-SPIO-IL-19 nanoparticles to target IL-19 expression in glioblastoma tissue. MRI imaging demonstrated enhanced targeting efficiency in brain tumors, with in vivo studies showing prominent hypointense areas in T2*-weighted MRI scans of tumor-bearing mice injected with CHOL-PEG-SPIO-IL-19, highlighting nanoparticle presence in IL-19-expressing regions. Prussian blue staining further confirmed the localization of these nanoparticles in tumor tissues, verifying their potential as a diagnostic tool for detecting IL-19 expression in glioblastoma. This system offers a theranostic approach, integrating diagnostic imaging and targeted therapy for IL-19-expressing GBM. Conclusion IL-19 is a promising theranostic target for reversing immunosuppression and restricting the invasive activity of chemoresistant GBM cells.

        <tr id="Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as a transformative approach for cancer treatment, demonstrating remarkable success in patients with relapsed and refractory hematological malignancies. However, challenges persist in optimizing CAR-T cell production and improving therapeutic outcomes. One of the major hurdles is the efficiency of retroviral or lentiviral transduction during CAR-T cell manufacturing. Additionally, the heterogeneity of T-cell populations isolated from patients can impact CAR-T cell effectiveness and persistence in vivo. This article explores a novel strategy to address these challenges by focusing on serum-free medium and additive optimization. We propose a unique approach that incorporates the culturing of T cells in Nutri-T medium, along with 24 h of exposure to combined low concentrations of BX795 and rosuvastatin, to enhance the transduction efficacy and functionality of CAR-T cells. The results presented here provide promising insights into the potential of this strategy to produce more effective CAR-T cells for immunotherapy, ultimately advancing the field and benefiting cancer patients worldwide.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal cancer of the central nervous system, presenting substantial treatment challenges. The current standard treatment, which includes surgical resection followed by temozolomide and radiation, offers limited success. While immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have proven effective in other cancers, they have not demonstrated significant efficacy in GBM. Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in supporting tumor growth, fostering treatment resistance, and shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Preclinical studies show promising results for therapies targeting TAMs, suggesting potential in overcoming these barriers. TAMs consist of brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, both exhibiting diverse phenotypes and functions within the tumor microenvironment. This review delves into the origin, heterogeneity, and functional roles of TAMs in GBM, underscoring their dual roles in tumor promotion and suppression. It also summarizes recent progress in TAM-targeted therapies, which may, in combination with other treatments like immunotherapy, pave the way for more effective and personalized strategies against this aggressive malignancy.">

The TME plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulating processes such as cancer cell migration, proliferation, tumor vascularization, and the modulation of anti-cancer immune responses. 2 Effects of the TME are partially mediated by secreted factors, including exosomes, metabolites, cytokines, chemokines, and a remodeled extracellular matrix produced by CAFs, which profoundly in ﬂ uence cancer progression. 2 Numerous studies revealed that the TME plays a pivotal role in modulating anti-cancer immune responses, either promoting or suppressing these processes in a manner that appears highly context-dependent. 3 Effective immune responses against cancer cells basically involve three different key mechanisms.

        <tr id="The potential of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination against cancer is not fully achieved. Little is known about the precise nature of the anti-cancer immune response triggered by different natural DC subsets and their relevance in preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence. Here, we use mouse splenic conventional DC1s (cDC1s) or cDC2s pulsed with tumor cell lysates to generate DC vaccines. cDC1-based vaccination induces a stronger effector and memory CD4+ and CD8+ anti-tumor T cell response, leading to a better control of tumors treated either therapeutically or prophylactically. Using an experimental model of tumor relapse, we show that adjuvant or neoadjuvant cDC1 vaccination improves anti-tumor immune memory, particularly by increasing the infiltrates of CD4+ tissue resident memory (Trm) and CD8+ memory T cells. This translates into complete prevention of tumor relapses. Moreover, elevated abundance of cDC1s positively correlates with CD4+ Trm presence, and both associate with enhanced survival in human breast cancer and melanoma. Our findings suggest that cDC1-based vaccination excels at immune memory induction and prevention of cancer recurrence.">

        <tr id="In a recent study published in Nature , Breart et al. 1 untangled the controversy surrounding interleukin (IL)-27 ’ s role in regulating T cell differentiation and immune responses in cancer. Their ﬁ ndings reveal that IL-27 enhances the persistence and effector functions of tumor-in ﬁ ltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes (TILs), preventing exhaustion, sustaining T cell-dependent tumor control and immunotherapy ef ﬁ cacy without signi ﬁ cant systemic side effects. Effective immune control of cancer relies on the ability of T lymphocytes to in ﬁ ltrate tumors and exert their cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, surviving neoplastic cells promptly adapt to immune-patrolled environments and evolve under immune system pressure to progressively avoid immune clearance, establishing immune-privileged conditions that sustain limitless growth. These immune evasive strategies are deployed in 3 main routes: “ camou ﬂ age ” (reduced immunogenicity and immune exclusion), “ coercion ” (impaired local immune activation through the establishment of a highly immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment [TME]), “ cytoprotection ” (avoiding neoplastic cell killing through intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms). 2 Therapeutic approaches targeting immune checkpoints and aiming to restore cancer immune surveillance signi ﬁ cantly improved the survival and life quality of cancer patients, although their ef ﬁ cacy is restricted to a fraction of patients and tumor types. Breart et al. attempted to identify novel, actionable immunological targets by charting the cytokines, which are known to be the most potent immune system regulators.

        <tr id="Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) play a crucial role in modulating tumor immune responses and influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, our current understanding of the microenvironment within these lymph nodes remains limited. Tumors not only impair the anti-tumor activity of CD8+ T cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment, but they also facilitate immune evasion and promote metastasis by altering the structure and function of TDLNs. Research has shown that tumor-specific memory CD8+ T cells (TTSM) within TDLNs are essential for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockers. Moreover, the abnormal structure of TDLNs, along with the presence of immunosuppressive cells—such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), and immunosuppressive dendritic cells (DCs)—contributes to tumor-mediated immune evasion. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the immune microenvironment within TDLNs is essential for improving the effectiveness of immunotherapies and developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review explores various TDLN-based therapeutic strategies, addressing the controversies surrounding lymph node dissection, the use of TDLNs as a source of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for therapy, targeting immunosuppressive cells within TDLNs, and methods to reverse the structural abnormalities of TDLNs. These strategies offer valuable insights and potential directions for advancing tumor immunotherapy.">

However, their widespread use is limited by the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). This review provides a comprehensive overview of GvHD in the context of allogeneic cell-based cancer immunotherapy and evaluates current strategies to mitigate its effects. Key strategies include genetic engineering approaches such as T cell receptor (TCR) knockout (KO) and T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) CAR knock-in. Alternative immune cell types like natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells offer potential solutions due to their lower alloreactivity. Additionally, stem cell technology, utilizing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), enables standardized and scalable production of engineered CAR-T cells. Clinical trials evaluating these strategies, such as UCART19 and CTX110, demonstrate promising results in preventing GvHD while maintaining anti-tumor efficacy. The review also addresses manufacturing considerations for allogeneic cell products and the challenges in translating preclinical findings into clinical success. By addressing these challenges, allogeneic cell-based immunotherapy continues to advance, paving the way for more accessible, scalable, and effective cancer treatments.">

How to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm remains an important challenge. Whether Trm contribute also to immune control of tumors or just correlate with an unrelated process linked to clinical outcome has not been unequivocally established9,10, and phenotypic markers such as co-expression of CD69 and CD103 or CD49a integrins commonly used to monitor tumor infiltrating Trm do not unambiguously define this subset. Here we tested the hypothesis that transient downregulation of KLF2, the most conserved feature of Trm ontogeny4,11,12, will promote the differentiation of vaccine activated CD8+ T cells into Trm and enhance antitumor immunity. We show that 4-1BB antibody targeted delivery of a KLF2 siRNA to tumor bearing mice led to the downregulation of KLF2 in vaccine activated CD8+ T cells and the accumulation of phenotypically defined intratumoral CD69+CD103+ and CD69+CD49a+ CD8+ T cells which correlated with enhanced control of tumor growth. This study could serve as the foundation of a broadly applicable and clinically useful way to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm and provides direct evidence that intratumoral CD8+CD69+CD103+ and CD8+CD69+CD49a+ cells are indeed Trm and that Trm contribute to tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Background The role of T cell immunity during antineoplastic therapy is poorly understood. In the BEGYN-1 study, patients with breast cancer underwent quarterly assessments prior to and during antineoplastic therapy over a period of 12 months. Methods We used flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassays to quantify 25 T cell subpopulations and seven T cell associated plasma cytokines in peripheral blood from 92 non-metastatic breast cancer patients, respectively. In addition, the association between T cell dynamics and the outcome of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy was investigated. Results In patients undergoing chemotherapy, a significant reduction in T helper (Th) cells, particularly naïve central and effector cells and thymus positive Th cells, was observed over time. Interestingly, Th1 immune response-associated cytokines (IL-12, TNF, IFN-γ) declined while Th2 cells and cytotoxic T cells increased over time. Conclusions We conclude that in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy is associated with a transition from a Th1 immune response towards Th2 and an increase in cytotoxic T cells, whereas in patients without chemotherapy, these alterations were less pronounced. Future studies should clarify whether patterns of T cell subsets or plasma cytokines can be used as biomarkers to monitor or even improve therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Background: α-Galactosylceramide (α-Galcer), a specific ligand for invariant natural killer T (NKT) cell activation, has been actively investigated in clinical trials such as antitumor therapy; however, treatment with α-Galcer is well known to induce acute hepatitis due to enriched NKT cells in the liver. The molecular mechanisms underlying NKT-mediated hepatitis still remain obscure. The object of this study was to investigate whether and how myeloid cells affect NKT-mediated hepatitis. Methods: α-Galcer–induced NKT hepatitis was used in this study. microRNA-223 (miR-223) and neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (Ncf1)–deficent mice were generated and subjected to α-Galcer–induced NKT hepatitis. Results: In this study, we demonstrated that α-Galcer–induced NKT cell activation resulted in neutrophil and monocyte-derived macrophage accumulation in the liver. Importantly, serum levels of several hepatic myeloid cell infiltration–related cytokines and chemokines were significantly elevated after α-Galcer administration. Among these myeloid cells, blockade of neutrophil or macrophage migration through using different inhibitors of (C-X-C Motif) receptor 2, (C-C motif) receptor 2, and (C-C motif) receptor 5 signaling ameliorated α-Galcer–induced liver injury, mainly due to the decrease of reactive oxygen species production and inflammation. Depletion of neutrophils reduced α-Galcer–induced liver injury and hepatitis. Interestingly, genetic deletion of neutrophil-specific miR-223 markedly enhanced while Ncf﻿1﻿ deficiency significantly ameliorated liver inflammation and oxidative damage caused by α-Galcer. Conclusions: Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration through multiple inflammatory mediators is required for NKT cell activation–induced hepatitis, which sheds light on the myeloid cell infiltration–related molecular mechanisms of NKT cell–mediated liver injury. Our study may provide a novel therapeutical strategy for the treatment of NKT cell hepatitis.">

As a byproduct of aerobic glycolysis, lactate satisfies the metabolic needs of proliferating tumor cells while reshaping the TME to facilitate immune evasion. Elevated lactate levels inhibit effector immune cells such as CD8+ T and natural killer cells, while supporting immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, thus fostering an immunosuppressive environment. Lactate promotes epigenetic reprogramming, stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and activates nuclear factor kappa B, leading to further immunological dysfunction. In this review, we examined the role of lactate in metabolic reprogramming, immune suppression, and treatment resistance. We also discuss promising therapeutic strategies targeting lactate metabolism, including lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, monocarboxylate transporter inhibitors, and TME neutralization methods, all of which can restore immune function and enhance immunotherapy outcomes. By highlighting recent advances, this review provides a theoretical foundation for integrating lactate-targeted therapies into clinical practice. We also highlight the potential synergy between these therapies and current immunotherapeutic strategies, providing new avenues for addressing TME-related challenges and improving outcomes for patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, driven by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and immune-related factors. Among the pivotal pathways implicated in CRC tumorigenesis, the Notch signaling pathway is instrumental in governing cell fate decisions, tissue renewal, homeostasis, and immune cell development. As a highly conserved mechanism, Notch signaling not only modulates tumor cell behavior but also shapes the immune landscape within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Aberrant Notch signaling in CRC fosters immune evasion and tumor progression through its effects on the balance and functionality of immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Elevated Notch pathway activation correlates with advanced clinicopathological features and poorer clinical outcomes, highlighting its relevance as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target. Therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting the Notch pathway, such as γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in combination with other therapies, have demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical and clinical settings. This review examines the impact of Notch signaling on CRC immunity, elucidating its regulatory mechanisms within immune cells and its role in promoting tumor progression. Additionally, this review discusses therapeutic strategies targeting Notch signaling, including GSIs, mAbs, and potential combination therapies designed to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. By elucidating the multifaceted role of Notch within the CRC TME, this review underscores its potential as a target for innovative therapeutic strategies.">

The oral oncogenic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.nucleatum) was recently observed to suppress the anti‐tumour immune response, although the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from F.nucleatum (F.n‐OMVs) promoted HNSCC progression by inducing immunosuppressive phenotypes of tumour‐associated macrophages (TAMs), resulting in decreased cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration in vivo. Mechanistically, TAMs internalized tryptophanase presented in F.n‐OMVs, which activated the tryptophan‐2,3‐dioxygenase 2/aryl hydrocarbon receptor (TDO2/AHR) pathway and upregulated the transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoints. TDO2 inhibitor enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti‐programmed death‐1 in a tumour‐bearing mouse model. Both TDO2 and F.nucleatum demonstrated excellent performance in predicting the immunotherapy outcomes in patients with HNSCC. These results indicate that F.n‐OMVs induce immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC, providing novel insights into the microbiota–tumour immunity crosstalk.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, characterized by rapid proliferation, extensive infiltration, and significant intratumoral heterogeneity. Despite advancements in conventional treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis for GBM patients remains poor, with a median survival of approximately 15 months. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising alternative; however, the unique biological and immunological features, including its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and low mutational burden, render it resistant to many immunotherapeutic strategies. This review explores the key challenges in GBM immunotherapy, focusing on immune evasion mechanisms, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the TME. Immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells have shown promise in preclinical models but have limited clinical success due to antigen heterogeneity, immune cell exhaustion, and impaired trafficking across the BBB. Emerging strategies, including dual-targeting CAR-T cells, engineered immune cells secreting therapeutic molecules, and advanced delivery systems to overcome the BBB, show potential for enhancing treatment efficacy. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving GBM immunotherapy outcomes.">

        <tr id="The spleen, the largest lymphatic organ, comprises a diverse array of immunocytes in approximately one quarter of the body, including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells (such as dendritic cells, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and macrophages). These immune cells undergo dynamic transitions and mobilization, enabling the spleen to execute a wide range of immunological functions. The spleen's structural organization and multicellular composition, along with its reservoir of lymphocytes, facilitate the capture and clearance of blood-borne antigens while also orchestrating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, the spleen plays critical roles in hematopoiesis and the removal of aged or damaged red blood cells. Despite being innervated by sympathetic (catecholaminergic) nerve fibers, the spleen lacks parasympathetic (vagal or cholinergic) innervation. The neuroimmune axis, particularly the interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system immune circuits, significantly influences disease onset and progression. Extensive research employing physical, genetic, and pharmacological approaches has sought to directly modulate splenic immunocytes and activate neuroimmune interactions to restore immune homeostasis and counteract disease. Two primary mechanisms underlie these immunomodulatory interventions: (1) the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, wherein norepinephrine released by splenic catecholaminergic fibers binds to β2-adrenergic receptors on CD4⁺ T cells, triggering acetylcholine secretion, which in turn suppresses inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling, and (2) direct immunomodulation of splenic immunocytes, which regulates key genes and signaling pathways, alters cytokine secretion, and modulates ion flux to influence cellular functions. Among various therapeutic strategies, physical methods, particularly electrical stimulation and splenic ultrasound stimulation, have demonstrated the greatest promise for clinical applications in splenic immunomodulation and disease management.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematologic cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). This leads to significant dysfunction and suppression of the immune system in affected patients. Myeloma cells employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate immune and non-immune cells, evading immune surveillance and enhancing their survival. One key factor in this evasion is the disruption of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune mechanisms. Extensive evidence indicates that in the presence of myeloma cells, DC numbers are notably reduced, and their phenotype and function are altered, impairing their ability to present antigens and activate robust T-cell responses effectively. Despite rapid advances in MM treatment, with promising strategies such as DC-based vaccines being already achieved, DC dysfunction remains a substantial hurdle, associated with or contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes, disease relapse, and MM’s persistence as an incurable disease. To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms through which myeloma cells transform DCs into their “accomplices,” undermining immune responses. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the role of DCs in MM. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of DCs in anti-MM immunotherapy, discussing persistent challenges and highlighting emerging perspectives that may lead to promising breakthroughs for improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT We conducted a phase Ib/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and clinical activity of combining pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) with XL888 (Hsp90 inhibitor) in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). We hypothesized that this regimen would modulate soluble and cellular immune mediators and enhance clinical outcomes. The trial employed a 3 + 3 open-label design, with an expansion cohort at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in treatment-refractory, mismatch repair-proficient CRC patients. Comprehensive analyses of plasma cytokines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and spatial immune cell patterns in liver biopsies were performed to identify unique immune signatures resulting from the combined therapy. The combination of pembrolizumab and XL888 proved to be safe and feasible, with a subset of patients achieving stable disease, although no objective responses were observed in this heavily pre-treated population. Correlative studies revealed immunomodulatory effects in tumors and circulation, including a reduction in IL6+ cells and macrophages (CD68+) within metastatic liver tissue, alterations in blood CD3+ cells, and upregulation of numerous inflammatory plasma cytokines. These findings suggest local and systemic immune activation by the combination of pembrolizumab and XL888. While clinical activity was modest in treatment-refractory CRC patients, there were notable effects on the tumor immune environment and systemic immune modulation.">

        <tr id="Colon cancer (CC) remains a primary contributor to cancer-related fatalities worldwide, driven by difficulties in early diagnosis and constrained therapeutic options. Recent studies underscore the importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME), notably tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in fostering malignancy progression and therapy resistance. Through their inherent plasticity, TAMs facilitate immunosuppression, angiogenic processes, metastatic spread, and drug tolerance. In contrast to M1 macrophages, which promote inflammatory and tumoricidal responses, M2 macrophages support tumor expansion and dissemination by exerting immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic influences. Consequently, manipulating TAMs has emerged as a potential avenue to enhance treatment effectiveness. This review outlines the origins, polarization states, and functions of TAMs in CC, highlights their role in driving tumor advancement, and surveys ongoing efforts to target these cells for better patient outcomes. Emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating TAM functions - including depletion strategies, reprogramming approaches that shift M2-polarized TAMs toward an M1 phenotype, and inhibition of key signaling pathways sustaining TAM-mediated immunosuppression-are currently under active investigation. These approaches hold promise in overcoming TAM - induced resistance and improving immunotherapeutic efficacy in CC.">

        <tr id="Despite recent advancements, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a therapeutic challenge. While monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) leveraging natural killer (NK) cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity show great potential, none have gained clinical approval for AML. Immunocytokines have emerged as a promising strategy to overcome the limited efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. IL-15 stimulates activation, proliferation cytotoxic activity of NK cells, but its clinical use is prevented by short half-life, poor accumulation in the tumor, and toxicity due to systemic off-target immune activation. Here we report on the generation and preclinical characterization of modified immunocytokines consisting of an Fc-optimized CLEC12A (CLL-1) antibody fused to an IL-15 moiety with E46K mutation. The mutation abrogates binding to IL-15Rα, thereby enabling substitution of physiological trans-presentation by target binding and thus conditional IL-15Rβ/γ stimulation to reduce systemic toxicity. An optimal CLEC12A binder was selected from a range of murine mAbs, based on analysis of AML cell lines and leukemic cells from patients. This antibody was then used to construct an immunocytokine (MIC12) that subsequently was characterized functionally. Analysis of NK cell activation, cytokine release, proliferation and anti-leukemia reactivity demonstrated that MIC12 induced superior target cell killing and NK cell expansion compared to Fc-optimized CLEC12A antibody, with efficacy being dependent on target antigen binding. Our results show that novel immunocytokines with conditional IL-15 activity are capable of inducing potent NK cell responses against AML cells and identify MIC12 as promising therapeutic candidate for leukemia treatment.">

        <tr id="Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in patients with immune deficiency/dysregulation represents a critical unmet need in hematology, demanding the appropriate revision of classification and therapeutic paradigms. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a pivotal driver of lymphomagenesis in this high-risk subset, where viral oncoproteins (e.g., LMP1/2A) exploit immune vulnerabilities to activate NF-κB, rewire tumor microenvironments (TME), and evade immune surveillance. EBV-positive cHL, prevalent in immunosuppressed populations, exhibits distinct molecular hallmarks, including reduced somatic mutations, unique HLA associations, and profound PD-L1-mediated immune suppression, that diverge from EBV-negative cases reliant on genetic aberrations. Despite advances in combined antiretroviral therapy, HIV co-infection exacerbates pathogenesis, M2 macrophage dominance, and T-cell exhaustion, while links to other viruses remain ambiguous. Current therapies fail to adequately target these viral and immune complexities, leaving patients with poorer outcomes. This review synthesizes insights into EBV’s etiological role, immune contexture disparities, and the genetic–environmental interplay shaping cHL heterogeneity. The WHO classification highlights the need to reclassify EBV-associated cHL as a distinct subset, integrating viral status and immune biomarkers into diagnostic frameworks. Urgent priorities include global epidemiological studies to clarify causal mechanisms, development of virus-targeted therapies (e.g., EBV-specific T-cell strategies, PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade), and personalized regimens for immune-dysregulated cohorts.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can address an unmet clinical need for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its effect is often modest in the setting of high tumor burden. In this study, we postulated that strategies to lower the AML apoptotic threshold will augment T cell killing of AML cells. BH3 mimetics, such as venetoclax, are a clinically approved class of compounds that predispose cells to intrinsic apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins. We explored the anti-leukemic efficacy of BH3 mimetics combined with WT1-specific CD8+ T cells on AML cell lines and primary samples from patients with a diverse array of disease characteristics to evaluate if lowering the cellular apoptotic threshold via inhibition of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins can increase leukemic cell sensitivity to T cell therapy. We found that the combination approach of BH3 mimetic and CD8+ T cells led to significantly increased killing of established AML lines as well as of adverse-risk primary AML leukemic blast cells. In contrast to the hypothesis that enhanced killing would be due to combined activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, our data suggests that CTL-mediated killing of AML cells was accomplished primarily through activation of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This highly effective combinatorial activity due to convergence on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was conserved across multiple AML cell lines and primary samples, suggesting that mitochondrial priming may represent a novel mechanism of optimizing adoptive cell therapy for AML patients.">

While vaccine-induced TRM express high levels of CD103 and persist longer in the lung parenchyma, short-lived, H1N1-induced TRM have a transcriptome associated with higher cytotoxic potential and distinct transcriptional profile as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing. In both the vaccine and H1N1 groups, NP-specific CD8+ T cells expand during heterologous influenza virus infection and protect the mice from disease. Meanwhile, lung inflammation in response to an infection with unrelated respiratory syncytial virus do not influence the fate of pre-existing TRM. Our preclinical work thus confirms that inflammatory conditions in the tissue shape the phenotypic and functional characteristics of TRM to serve relevant informations for optimizing mucosal vaccines.">

        <tr id="The tumor-immune response is mobilized to suppress tumorigenesis, while the immune microenvironment and lymph node microenvironment are formed gradually during tumor progression. In fact, tumor surface antigens are not easily recognized by antigen-presenting cells. So it is hard for the immune system to kill the newly formed tumor cells effectively. In a normal immune environment, immune function is always suppressed to maintain the stability of the body, and regulatory T cells play an important role in maintaining immune suppression. However, during tumorigenesis, the suppression of regulatory T cell immune functions is more likely to contribute to tumor cell proliferation and migration leading directly to tumor progression. Therefore, focusing on the role of regulatory T cells in tumor immunity could improve tumor immunotherapy outcomes in the clinic. Regulatory T cells are more mature in hematologic system tumors than in solid tumors. However, there are continuing efforts to apply regulatory T cells for immunotherapy in solid tumors. This review describes the role of regulatory T cells in solid tumor immunotherapy from the perspective of prognosis, immune microenvironment remodeling, and current clinical applications. This summary could help us better understand the mechanisms of regulatory T cells in solid tumor immunotherapy and further expand their clinical application.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary In solid tumors, cancer cells are surrounded by nontumor cells, such as immune and stromal cells. Together with non-cellular components, they form the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cancer cells can hijack nontumor cells in the TME to support tumor growth. Therefore, the TME has a significant influence on the success of cancer therapy. In pancreatic cancer, immune cells of the innate immune system, macrophages, have been shown to negatively impact the survival rate of cancer patients. However, the mediators (chemokines) released by pancreatic cancer cells to control macrophages are understudied. In the present study, we characterized interactions between a murine macrophage cell line and two pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro. In screening 13 different chemokines, we observed a congruent increase in seven. This was paralleled by an increased expression of surface markers associated with a protumoral macrophage phenotype. Our findings are an essential basis for functional studies and might help to improve and develop novel therapies for pancreatic cancer in the future.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated disorders are a broad range of diseases, arising as consequence of immune defects, exaggerated/misguided immune response or a mixture of both conditions. Their frequency is on a rise in the developed societies and they pose a significant challenge for diagnosis and treatment. Traditional pharmacological, monoclonal antibody-based or polyclonal antibody replacement-based therapies aiming at modulation of the immune responses give very often dissatisfactory results and/or are burdened with unacceptable adverse effects. In recent years, a new group of treatment modalities has emerged, utilizing cells as living drugs, especially with the use of the up-to-date genetic engineering. These modern cellular therapies are designed to offer a high potential for more targeted, safe, durable, and personalized treatment options. This work briefly reviews the latest advances in the treatment of immune-mediated disorders, mainly those related to exaggeration of the immune response, with such cellular therapies as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and others. We highlight the main features of these therapies as new treatment options for taming the dysregulated immune system. Undoubtfully, in near future such therapies can provide lasting remissions in a range of immune-mediated disorders with reduced treatment burden and improved quality of life for the patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis represents an emerging, iron-dependent form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. In recent years, it has garnered significant attention in the realm of cancer immunotherapy, particularly in studies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors. This form of cell death not only enhances our comprehension of the tumor microenvironment but is also considered a promising therapeutic strategy to address tumor resistance, investigate immune activation mechanisms, and facilitate the development of cancer vaccines. The combination of immunotherapy with ferroptosis provides innovative targets and fresh perspectives for advancing cancer treatment. Nevertheless, tumor cells appear to possess a wider array of ferroptosis evasion strategies compared to CD8+T cells, which have been conclusively shown to be more vulnerable to ferroptosis. Furthermore, ferroptosis in the TME can create a favorable environment for tumor survival and invasion. Under this premise, both inducing tumor cell ferroptosis and inhibiting T cell ferroptosis will impact antitumor immunity to some extent, and even make the final result run counter to our therapeutic purpose. This paper systematically elucidates the dual-edged sword role of ferroptosis in the antitumor process of T cells, briefly outlining the complexity of ferroptosis within the TME. It explores potential side effects associated with ferroptosis-inducing therapies and critically considers the combined application of ferroptosis-based therapies with ICIs. Furthermore, it highlights the current challenges faced by this combined therapeutic approach and points out future directions for development.">

        <tr id="Melanoma, being one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer, is characterized by its aggressive and metastatic nature, with the potential to develop resistance to various treatments. This resistance makes the disease challenging to treat, emphasizing the need for new treatment strategies. Within the tumor microenvironment (TME), melanoma cells exploit metabolic shifts, particularly glycolysis, to create an immunosuppressive TME that prevents dendritic cells (DCs) from functioning properly. Essential metabolic alterations such as lactate and lipid accumulation, and lack of tryptophan disrupt DC maturation, antigen presentation, and T cell activation. In recent years, melanoma immunotherapy has increasingly focused on reprogramming the metabolism of DCs. This review paper aims to provide insights into the metabolic suppression of melanoma-associated DCs, allowing the design of therapeutic strategies based on metabolic interventions to promote or restore DC function. This contribution reviews the metabolic reprogramming of DCs as a new approach for melanoma immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="TRIMELVax is an innovative immunotherapeutic vaccine for malignant melanoma, which combines heat shock-conditioned human melanoma cell lysates with a mollusk hemocyanin as an adjuvant. Preclinical studies demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in mice with melanoma and colorectal tumors. However, the precise immunological mechanisms behind its anti-tumor effects have remained unclear. We focused on understanding how TRIMELVax induces inflammation at the injection site, recruits innate immune cells, triggers DC migration to draining lymph nodes, and affects tumor microenvironment and growth. To achieve this, C57BL/6 mice were injected in the footpad with TRIMELVax, PBS, or control vaccines, and then the skin and the popliteal lymph node were harvested for qPCR or FACS analysis. Results showed that TRIMELVax rapidly induced a specific pattern of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a differential acute innate immune response in the injection site. Neutrophils, type 1 macrophages, monocytes, cDC1, Langerhans cells, and monocyte derived-DCs were recruited to the footpad, while type 2 macrophages decreased. This early inflammation facilitated a superior migration of cDC1 and a new subtype of antigen-presenting neutrophils to the draining lymph node compared to controls. Depleting neutrophils before vaccination reduced DC migration, especially cDC1, to the draining lymph node and suppressed TRIMELVax's ability to control tumor growth, demonstrating that vaccine-induced neutrophils play a fundamental role in TRIMELVax's mechanism of action. At the tumor microenvironment level, it was observed that TRIMELVax induces a more intense infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes than controls, with a low level of exhaustiveness and greater cytotoxic capacity. A phase I clinical trial in twenty nivolumab-refractory patients showed that TRIMELVax is well tolerated with no grade 3-5 side effects and induces a Delayed-Type hypersensitivity reaction against melanoma antigens after four doses of the vaccine with an impact on disease stability and patient survival. In summary, TRIMELVax triggers a rapid and potent activation of the innate immune system, which seems crucial for a more effective adaptive immune response against aggressive melanoma tumors. These results underscore the promise of TRIMELVax as a potential immunotherapeutic approach for melanoma treatment.">

        <tr id="T-large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by clonal expansions of cytotoxic T-cells. It presents with cytopenias that are not explained by the typically low leukemic burden. Notably, T-LGLL is frequently accompanied by autoimmune disorders, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As clonal T-cell expansions are also increasingly identified in autoimmune-driven conditions, better models of T-LGLL’s pathogenesis as a spectrum of (auto)antigen-driven oligoclonal hierarchies towards overt leukemic escape with associated immune dysregulations would provide details to a valuable prototype for determinants of T-cell fitness and transformation as well as T-cell instructed dysfunctions of other immune cells. Such insights would advance our concepts of cancer biology and immunology. Common molecular links between T-LGLL and autoimmune diseases include activation of JAK/STAT signaling, proinflammatory cytokine environments, and antigen-driven immune responses. Current murine models address these mechanisms rather individually: JAK/STAT based systems replicate pathway activation, cytokine-driven models simulate inflammatory conditions, and RA models often mimic antigen stimulation. However, none of these fully captures the duality of clonal T-cell expansion and the complex immune dysregulations, inherent to T-LGLL. This review examines criteria for autochthonous in-vivo T-LGLL models and evaluates existing systems, identifying their strengths, limitations, and specific representations of clinico-pathologic aspects of LGLL. Prominent transgenic models, for example, not only manipulate the T-cell compartment but also indiscriminately alter the tumor microenvironment, impeding research on the specific role of elements of the LGLL micromilieu. We propose strategies to overcome such insufficiencies of present models. Overall, our critical appraisal emphasizes the need for novel comprehensive models that more faithfully integrate the key features of T-LGLL or for models that, by featuring specific pathogenetic aspects of the disease, would supplement existing incomplete systems. We expect such new model systems to aid in better understanding the cancer-immunity interface and in assessing novel therapeutic approaches for T-LGLL.">

        <tr id="Hematological malignancies are a diverse group of cancers that originate in the blood and bone marrow and are characterized by the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Myeloid blasts, which are derived from normal myeloid progenitors, play a central role in these diseases by disrupting hematopoiesis and driving disease progression. In addition, other myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, adapt dynamically to the tumor microenvironment, where they can promote immune evasion and resistance to treatment. This review explores the unique characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of myeloid blasts, the immunosuppressive roles of myeloid cells, and their complex interactions within the TME. Furthermore, we highlight emerging therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells, focusing on strategies to reprogram their functions, inhibit their suppressive effects, or eliminate pathological populations altogether, as well as the latest preclinical and clinical trials advancing these approaches. By integrating insights from these studies, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of myeloid cells in hematological malignancies and their potential as therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Stem cells are highly resistant to viral infection compared to their differentiated progeny, and this resistance is associated with stem cell-specific restriction factors and intrinsic interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). In HIV infection, proviral DNA has been detected in certain bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells, yet widespread stem cell infection in vivo is restricted. Intriguingly, exposing bone marrow stem cells to HIV in vitro led to viral replication selectively only in the CD34- population, but not in the CD34+ cells. The mechanism dictating this CD34-based HIV restriction remained a mystery, especially since HIV has a capacity to antagonize restriction factors and ISGs. CD34 is a common marker of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Here, we report the intrinsic antiviral properties of CD34. Expression of CD34 in HIV-1 producer cells results in the loss of progeny virion infectivity. Conversely, removal of CD34 using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or stem cell differentiation cytokines promotes HIV-1 replication in stem cells. These results suggest that in addition to restriction factors and intrinsic ISGs, CD34 serves as a host innate protection preventing retrovirus replication in stem cells. Mechanistically, CD34 does not block viral entry, integration, and release. Instead, it becomes incorporated onto progeny virions, which inactivates virus infectivity. These findings offer new insights into innate immunity in stem cells, and highlight intriguing retrovirus-host interactions in evolution.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological cancer and treatment options remain limited. In a recent first-in-class Phase I trial, the monoclonal IgE antibody MOv18, specific for the tumour-associated antigen Folate Receptor-α, was well-tolerated and preliminary anti-tumoural activity observed. Pre-clinical studies identified macrophages as mediators of tumour restriction and pro-inflammatory activation by IgE. However, the mechanisms of IgE-mediated modulation of macrophages and downstream tumour immunity in human cancer remain unclear. Here we study macrophages from patients with epithelial ovarian cancers naive to IgE therapy. High-dimensional flow cytometry and RNA-seq demonstrate immunosuppressive, FcεR-expressing macrophage phenotypes. Ex vivo co-cultures and RNA-seq interaction analyses reveal immunosuppressive associations between patient-derived macrophages and regulatory T (Treg) cells. MOv18 IgE-engaged patient-derived macrophages undergo pro-inflammatory repolarisation ex vivo and display induction of a hyperinflammatory, T cell-stimulatory subset. IgE reverses macrophage-promoted Treg cell induction to increase CD8+ T cell expansion, a signature associated with improved patient prognosis. On-treatment tumours from the MOv18 IgE Phase I trial show evidence of this IgE-driven immune signature, with increased CD68+ and CD3+ cell infiltration. We demonstrate that IgE induces hyperinflammatory repolarised states of patient-derived macrophages to inhibit Treg cell immunosuppression. These processes may collectively promote immune activation in ovarian cancer patients receiving IgE therapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The molecular barriers that cause acute xenograft rejection have been identified and addressed by generating genetically modified (GM) animals, knocked out for specific xenoantigens (xenoAgs), and expressing regulatory molecules for both complement and coagulation pathways among others. The focus of xenotransplantation research now lies in delayed xenograft rejection. Dendritic cells (DC) are a specific subpopulation of professional antigen‐presenting cells (APC) that play a crucial role in the context of organ transplantation. DCs, originating from both the xenograft and the recipient, have the capacity to present xenoAgs to the recipient's immune system via their respective major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules leading to rejection. These processes are known as direct and indirect presentation, respectively. However, under certain microenvironmental conditions, DC develops into anti‐inflammatory regulatory cells that can induce immunological tolerance. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the general characteristics and functions of DC from species relevant to xenotransplantation, specifically humans, non‐human primates (NHP), and pigs. It will also cover the process of xenoAg presentation, different methods for generating DC with regulatory properties in vitro, and finally, discuss the current strategies for using regulatory DC to improve xenograft acceptance by inducing tolerance.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) mediates durable and complete regression of various cancers. However, its efficacy is limited by the long-term persistence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, given their irreversible dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we aimed to establish an artificial lung metastasis model to examine T-lymphocyte subsets, in order to identify potential effective cell subsets for ACT.


METHODS
A metastatic lung melanoma mouse model was established using OVA-expressing melanoma B16 cells. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to examine the surface markers, transcription factors, and secreted cytokines of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells within metastatic tissues. The infiltrated cells were sorted by flow cytometry for in vitro tumor cell killing assays or in vivo cell infusion therapy combined with chemotherapeutic drugs and immune checkpoint blockade antibodies.


RESULTS
Exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex) exhibited high heterogeneity in metastatic tissues. Among Tex cells, the CXCR6- precursor cell showed certain memory characteristics, including phenotype, transcription factors, and maintenance, whereas the CXCR6+ subpopulation partially lost these traits. Moreover, CXCR6+ precursor cells effectively replenished effector-like Tex cells in metastatic tissues and exerted direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Notably, transferring these tumor-specific CXCR6+ precursor-exhausted T (Texp) cells into recipients induced a substantial regression of metastasis. In addition, these cells could respond to immune checkpoint blockade, which could better control tumor metastasis.


CONCLUSIONS
In our study, a subset of antigen-specific CXCR6-expressing Texp cells was observed within the metastatic tissue. The cells served as a crucial source of effector-like Tex cells and exerted direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. Adoptive transfer of CXCR6+ Texp cells effectively mitigated lung metastasis in mice. This study helps elucidate the role of Texp cells in metastasis, thereby offering novel insights into enhancing the efficacy and durability of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most efficient antigen-presenting cells and play a central role in the immune system, orchestrating immune response against tumors. We previously demonstrated that DC-based vaccination effectively induces anti-tumor immunity, yet at the same time showing a robust safety profile, making this treatment a potential candidate for effective adjuvant immunotherapy. To explore this possibility, we designed a randomized phase II trial (EudraCT no. 2014-005123-27) to provide a complementary autologous DC vaccination to patients (pts) with resected stage III/IV melanoma. Methods Overall, a total of 18 eligible pts were included in this study, 10 of whom received 6 monthly DC vaccination cycles combined with IL-2 administration (arm A), and 8 pts were enrolled in the follow-up observational cohort (arm B). A deep immune biomarkers profiling by multiplex immunoassay, human leukocyte antigens (HLA) typing, multiparametric flow cytometry and in situ tumor microenvironment analysis was performed for the entire pts cohort. The immunological response was assessed in vivo by DTH test and ex vivo against selected melanoma-associated antigens applying the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Results Pts receiving DC vaccination showed a better relapse-free survival compared to the observational cohort (median 6.6 months, 95% CI, 2.3–not reached (nr) (arm A) vs 5.2 months, 95% CI, 2.5–nr (arm B), not significant), with a favorable trends for female pts (median 15.5 months, 95% CI, 2.6–nr (female) vs 3.3, 95% CI, 2.3–nr (male)), pts with less than 60 years (median 22.5 months, 95% CI, 2.6–nr (age < 60) vs 4.7 months, 95% CI, 2.3–nr (age ≥ 60), and pts with wild-type BRAF status (median 22.5 months, 95% CI, 8.6–nr (BRAF wt) vs 3.8 months, 95% CI, 2.3–nr (BRAF mutated). The toxicity profile was favourable, with no severe adverse events and only mild, manageable reactions. Moreover, additional immune response data suggested increased immune modulation in vaccinated patients, which may reflect a shift in immune dynamics. Conclusions Our findings support the safety and tolerability of DC vaccination as an adjuvant treatment for melanoma, demonstrating significant immune modulation at both the tumor site and peripherally in relapsed and non-relapsed patients. These results highlight the potential of autologous, personalised DC-based therapies and pave the way for the development of innovative immunotherapy combinations in future treatment strategies.

        <tr id="Glatiramer acetate (GA) is the first-line therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and is increasingly demonstrating promising therapeutic benefits in a range of other conditions. Despite its extensive use, the precise pharmacological mechanism of GA remains unclear. In addition to T and B cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play significant roles in the neuroinflammation associated with MS, positioning them as potential initial targets for GA. Here, we investigated GA’s influence on the differentiation of human monocytes from healthy donors into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and assessed their activation status. Our results indicate that GA treatment does not hinder the differentiation of monocytes into moDCs or macrophages. Notably, we observed a significant increase in the expression of molecules required for antigen recognition, presentation, and co-stimulation in GA-treated moDCs. Conversely, there was a significant downregulation of CD1a, which is crucial for activating auto-aggressive T cells that respond to the lipid components of myelin. Furthermore, GA treatment resulted in an increased expression of CD68 on both CD14+CD16+ and CD14+CD16− monocyte subsets. These in vitro findings suggest that GA treatment does not impede the generation of moDCs under inflammatory conditions; however, it may modify their functional characteristics in potentially beneficial ways. This provides a basis for future clinical studies in MS patients to elucidate its precise mode of action.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in extracellular vesicle (EV) research in organ transplantation have highlighted the crucial role of donor-derived EVs in triggering alloimmune responses, ultimately contributing to transplant rejection. Following transplantation, EVs carrying donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules activate recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs), initiating both alloreactive and regulatory T-cell responses. While immunosuppressive drugs are essential for preventing rejection, they may also influence the biogenesis and release of EVs from donor cells. This review examines the impact of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy on EV biogenesis and release post-transplantation. In addition, EV release and uptake may be influenced by specific factors such as the patient's end-stage organ disease and the transplant procedure itself. In-vitro studies using primary human parenchymal and immune cells—integrated with cutting-edge multi-omics techniques, including genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and single-EV analysis—will offer deeper insights into EV biology and the mechanisms by which immunosuppressive agents regulate EV-initiated immune processes. A detailed understanding of how organ failure, the transplantation procedure and immunosuppressive drugs affect the biology of EVs may uncover new roles for EVs in immune activation and regulation in patients, ultimately leading to improved immunosuppressive strategies and better transplant outcomes.">

        <tr id="This review discusses reprogramming the breast tumor immune microenvironment from an immunosuppressive cold state to an immunologically active hot state. A complex interplay is revealed, in which the accumulation of metabolic byproducts—such as lactate, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ammonia—is shown to impair T-cell function and promote tumor immune escape. It is demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), and IL-35. Notably, IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells and breast cancer cells. The conversion of conventional T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells, along with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. It is further demonstrated that key immune checkpoint molecules—such as PD-1, PDL1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT—are upregulated within the TME, leading to Tcell exhaustion and diminished immune responses. The blockade of these checkpoints is shown to restore T-cell functionality and is proposed as a strategy to convert cold tumors into hot ones with robust effector cell infiltration. The therapeutic potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy is also explored, and targeting specific tumor-associated antigens, such as glycoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, is highlighted. It is suggested that CART cell efficacy can be enhanced by combining these cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents, thereby overcoming the barriers imposed by the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, the role of the microbiome in regulating estrogen metabolism and systemic inflammation is reviewed. Alterations in the gut microbiota are shown to affect the TME, and microbiome-based interventions are proposed as an additional means to facilitate the cold-to-hot transition. It is concluded that by targeting the metabolic and immunological pathways that underpin immune suppression—through combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade, CART cell therapies, and microbiome modulation—the conversion of the breast TME from cold to hot can be achieved. This reprogramming is anticipated to enhance immune cell infiltration and function, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapies and leading to better clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients.

        <tr id="Background Antigen-specific immunotherapy shows potential for inducing long-term immune tolerance in type 1 diabetes (T1D), yet its clinical application is hampered by uncertainty regarding dominant epitopes. Conversely, non-antigen-specific treatments such as anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) present a more straightforward approach but struggle to maintain tolerance after treatment. Addressing these issues is critical for advancing T1D therapies. Methods The phenotypic and metabolic properties of two subsets of exhausted CD8+ T cells were analyzed in both humans and NOD mice. T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity and Bulk RNA sequencing provided insights into the transcriptomic profiles and TCR reactivity of these cells. Mechanistic studies were conducted using the HEK-293 T cell line and primary cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was applied to evaluate the characteristics of different CD8+ T cell subsets following two types of immunotherapies. In NY8.3 mice, the effect of mitochondrial fission inhibitors on immunotherapy results was evaluated. Final validation was carried out with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from T1D patients. Results Our study reveals the diversity of two distinct exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets in T1D through flow cytometry, highlighting unique clinical features, phenotypes, and functions. Notable differences in TCR reactivity and metabolic pathways between these subsets were identified through TCR sequencing and transcriptomic analyses in NOD mice. Both antigen-specific and non-antigen-specific stimuli produced unique exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets. Our research identified leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (Lrrk2) as a key regulator of mitochondrial fission, influencing the interconversion of exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets by phosphorylating dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) at serine 637 (Ser637) and serine 616 (Ser616). scRNA-seq confirmed that antigen-specific immunotherapy effectively suppresses T cell signaling, induces exhaustion, and promotes the development of terminally exhausted T (TEX) cells. Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti-CD3 mAb treatment by promoting the development of more TEX cells. Conclusions Our results point to a new immunotherapeutic approach that targets exhausted CD8+ T cells’ energy metabolism, offering valuable insights for advancing clinical strategies in T1D therapy.

        <tr id="Macrophages are immune cells belonging to the mononuclear phagocyte system. They play crucial roles in immune defense, surveillance, and homeostasis. This review systematically discusses the types of hematopoietic progenitors that give rise to macrophages, including primitive hematopoietic progenitors, erythro-myeloid progenitors, and hematopoietic stem cells. These progenitors have distinct genetic backgrounds and developmental processes. Accordingly, macrophages exhibit complex and diverse functions in the body, including phagocytosis and clearance of cellular debris, antigen presentation, and immune response, regulation of inflammation and cytokine production, tissue remodeling and repair, and multi-level regulatory signaling pathways/crosstalk involved in homeostasis and physiology. Besides, tumor-associated macrophages are a key component of the TME, exhibiting both anti-tumor and pro-tumor properties. Furthermore, the functional status of macrophages is closely linked to the development of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic conditions, and trauma. Targeting macrophages has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in these contexts. Clinical trials of macrophage-based targeted drugs, macrophage-based immunotherapies, and nanoparticle-based therapy were comprehensively summarized. Potential challenges and future directions in targeting macrophages have also been discussed. Overall, our review highlights the significance of this versatile immune cell in human health and disease, which is expected to inform future research and clinical practice.">

Cancer-associated fibroblasts are a critical cell type within the lung tumor microenvironment that promote immune suppression, drug resistance, and tumor cell survival. Prior work shows tumor cells can co-opt fibroblasts to a protumorigenic phenotype via exosome-mediated intercellular communication. Currently, the mechanisms by which OS exosomes modulate resident lung fibroblast (LF) function have not been evaluated. To investigate this, we isolated exosomes from a panel of six OS cell lines. We assessed the uptake and response of human donor–derived primary LFs (n = 4) to OS exosome treatment in vitro via flow cytometry, confocal fluorescent microscopy, proliferation assays, phosphokinase array, multiplex cytokine analysis, and RNA sequencing. We observed that LFs efficiently take up OS exosomes, which are associated with the induction of MAPK pathway activation, fibroblast proliferation, and significantly enhanced secretion of IL-6, CXCL8, and CCL2 compared with untreated LFs. RNA sequencing of exosome-treated LFs confirmed these responses and revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to cytokine secretion, proliferation, immune cell chemotaxis, migration, proinflammatory, and profibrotic mediators. Finally, in an exosome-educated LF–OS coculture model, exosome-educated LFs conferred significantly increased OS cell survival and proliferation compared with untreated fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that the OS-derived exosomes can induce a hallmark cancer-associated fibroblast–like inflammatory phenotype in LFs, providing valuable insights into mechanisms that may promote recurrent OS lung metastasis. Significance: These findings provide a critical first step in characterizing the capacity of OS-derived exosomes to reprogram primary LFs toward a tumor-promoting inflammatory phenotype in vitro, offering novel molecular targets for the modulation of fibroblasts in the lung microenvironment as potential therapeutic strategies to prevent OS metastasis.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases are characterized by irregular immune responses that disrupt self-tolerance. This research explores the effects of the immunomodulatory drug celecoxib on the expression of immune checkpoint receptors in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Key receptors, including CTLA-4, VISTA, BTLA, PDL-1, B7H7, and LAG3, play critical roles in initiating and regulating immune responses and maintaining self-tolerance. Previous studies have highlighted the significance of immune checkpoints in preventing autoimmune conditions, with animal research supporting their effectiveness in immunotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that the upregulation of immune checkpoint receptors can enhance the inhibitory functions of DCs, thereby promoting self-tolerance. As a result, tolerogenic DCs present a promising therapeutic avenue for treating autoimmune diseases. Although these results are promising, further trials are required to validate this approach before it can be applied clinically. This study underscores the potential of targeting immune checkpoint receptors as a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune disorders.">

        <tr id="The human T-cell leukemia type-1 (HTLV-1) retrovirus establishes chronic life-long infection in a fraction of infected individuals associated with severe pathological conditions. Although the mechanism driving disease development is not fully understood, current evidence indicates the essential functions of viral regulatory proteins. Among these, the p13 protein has previously been shown to localize to the inner mitochondrial membrane in T cells, altering mitochondrial biology and T-cell function. While CD4+ T cells are the primary cell target of HTLV-1 infection, genomic viral DNA has also been detected in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which orchestrate innate and adaptive immunity and play a critical role in protecting against virus-induce diseases by establishing the appropriate balance of pro and anti-inflammatory responses. Given the central role of mitochondria in monocyte differentiation, we investigated the effect of p13 in monocytes/macrophages and found that by localizing to mitochondria, p13 affects mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, we demonstrate that p13 expression affects macrophage polarization to favor the recruitment of CD4+ T cells, the primary target of the virus, potentially facilitating the spread of viral infection and the development of disease.">

        <tr id="Background Macrophages, polarized into pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 states, are essential cellular elements of innate immunity. In the tumor microenvironment, owing to a paracrine manipulative program by cancerous cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) evolve, which can shift between M1-like and M2-like phenotypes. Since it is fairly unknown how the promising anticancer agents, silver (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) affect the bidirectional communication and reprogramming in the tumor stroma, we examined the behavior, the tumor-supporting functions, and the expression of polarization and functional marker genes of TAMs to reveal how these are modulated upon interaction with nanoparticle-exposed cancer cells. Methods We established co-cultures of murine immortalized J774 or primary bone marrow-derived macrophages with 4T1 breast cancer cells treated with AuNPs or AgNPs or with none of the nanoparticles. We assessed the expression of macrophage polarization and functional markers using RT-qPCR and Proteome Profiler Array and evaluated macrophage migration and matrix metalloproteinase activity by specific assays. Results Protein and mRNA levels of most examined factors – except tumor necrosis factor-alpha – such as C-C-motif chemokine ligands 2 and 22, interleukin-23, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, the macrophage mannose receptor CD206, transforming growth factor-beta, and chitinase-like-3 protein decreased, and the expression of polarization markers revealed a shift towards M1-like phenotype in macrophages co-cultured with AgNP- or AuNP-treated 4T1 cells. Both nanoparticle treatments reduced the levels and activity of cell migration-related factors, such as C-C motif chemokine ligand 3, matrix metalloproteinases, and suppressed macrophage migration. Conclusion Both AuNPs and AgNPs showed a remarkable ability to influence macrophage-cancer cell communication, suppressed indirectly M2-like TAM polarization, and perturbed the migration behavior of TAMs that is critical for tumor invasion, indicating modulated immunological functions and debilitated cancer-promoting capabilities of TAMs in this microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Disrupted cellular polarity (DCP) is a hallmark of solid cancer, the malignant disease of epithelial tissues, which occupies ~90% of all human cancers. DCP has been identified to affect not only the cancer cell’s aggressive behavior but also the migration and infiltration of immune cells, although the precise mechanism of DCP-affected tumor-immune cell interaction remains unclear. This review discusses immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) caused by DCP-driven tumor cell proliferation with DCP-impaired immune cell functions. We will revisit the fundamental roles of cell polarity (CP) proteins in sustaining mammary luminal homeostasis, epithelial transformation, and breast cancer progression. Then, the current data on CP involvement in immune cell activation, maturation, migration, and tumor infiltration are evaluated. The CP status on the immune effector cells and their targeted tumor cells are highlighted in tumor immune regulation, including the antigen presentation and the formation of immune synapses (IS). CP-regulated antigen presentation and delivery and the formation of IS between the immune cells, especially between the immune effectors and tumor cells, will be addressed. Alterations of CP on the tumor cells, infiltrated immune effector cells, or both are discussed with these aspects. We conclude that CP-mediated tumor aggressiveness coupled with DCP-impaired immune cell disability may decide the degree of immunosuppressive status and responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Further elucidating the dynamics of CP- or DCP-mediated immune regulation in TME will provide more critical insights into tumor-immune cell dynamics, which is required to invent more effective approaches for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="IgG4–related disease (IgG4–RD) is an autoimmune condition marked by IgG4–positive plasma cell infiltration, causing inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor–like lesions, especially in the lacrimal gland (LG). Current diagnostic criteria, based primarily on serum IgG4 levels, face limitations in predicting clinical outcomes and treatment responses. To address this, we conducted a multiplex immaunohistochemical analysis of LG tissues to assess immune checkpoint interactions and immune cell distribution in relation to mass size, fibrosis, and treatment response. Our findings revealed that PD–L1 (Programmed Death–Ligand 1), an immune checkpoint molecule, plays a key role in shaping an immunosuppressive environment that varies by clinical group. In non–responsive patients, increased co–expression of PD–L1 and CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) suggested a link to treatment resistance. Spatial analysis highlighted more active immune responses in non–fibrotic areas, while fibrotic regions exhibited stabilized immune interactions driven by PD–L1 expression. These results indicate that PD–L1 contributes to immune regulation and disease progression in IgG4–RD and emphasize its potential as a therapeutic target. This study provides new insights into the immunological landscape of IgG4–RD and paves the way for the development of personalized treatment strategies.">

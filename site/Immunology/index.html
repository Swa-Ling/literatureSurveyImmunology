        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The functional plasticity of tumor-infiltrating B (TIL-B) cells spans from anti-tumor responses to non-canonical immune suppression. Yet, how tumor microenvironment (TME) influences TIL-B development is still underappreciated. Our current study integrated single cell transcriptomics and BCR (B cell receptor) sequencing to profile TIL-B phenotypes and clonalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using trajectory and gene regulatory network analysis, we were able to characterize plasma cells, memory and naïve B cells within the HCC TME and further revealed a downregulation of BCR-signaling genes in plasma cells and a subset of inflammatory TNF+ memory B cells. Within the TME, non-switch memory B cell subset acquires an age-associated B cell phenotype (TBET+, CD11c+) and expressed higher levels of PD-L1, CD25 and granzyme B. We further demonstrated that the presence of HCC tumor cells could confer suppressive functions on peripheral blood B cells which in turn, dampen T cell co-stimulation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent novel mechanisms of non-canonical immune suppression in HCC. While previous studies identified atypical memory B cells in chronic hepatitis and across several solid cancer types, we further highlighted their potential role as regulatory B cells (Bregs) within both the TME and peripheral blood of HCC patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immunotherapy is now an integral aspect of cancer therapy. Strategies employing adoptive cell therapy (ACT) have seen the establishment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells using peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) with significant clinical results. The bone marrow (BM) is an immunological niche housing T cells with specificity for previously encountered antigens, including tumor-associated antigens from certain solid cancers. This study sought to improve our understanding of tumor-specific BM T cells in the context of solid tumors by comparing them with TILs, and to assess whether there is a rationale for using the BM as a source of T cells for ACT against solid malignancies. Methods We used the murine B16 melanoma model examining both the endogenous OVA-specific T cell response using an OVA-specific tetramer or examining the OVA-specific response with OVA-specific transgenic CD8+ (OT-1) T cells. Specifically, we compared baseline intrinsic properties of TILs or BM T cells from tumor-bearing mice and their changes following adoptive transfer in the tumor and bone marrow (as well as other compartments when indicated). Results In tumor-bearing mice, endogenous tumor-specific T cells could be detected in the BM early in the course of tumor progression and possessed a more stem-cell-like and memory phenotype in an unsupervised cluster analysis compared with TILs which appeared more exhausted. The BM and tumor microenvironments significantly impact the fate of T cells. Naïve OT-1 transferred T cells acquired an exhausted phenotype in the tumor but maintained a more memory-like phenotype in the BM with tumor progression. Importantly, in a competitive transfer experiment, BM T cells infiltrated the tumor more efficiently than TILs, displayed a higher polyfunctionality with interleukin-2, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α production and showed greater persistence compared with TILs. Conclusions T cells from the BM appear superior to TILs as a source of cells for cellular therapy. They possess a memory-enriched phenotype and exhibit improved effector function, greater persistence within a tumor-bearing host, and the capacity for increased tumor infiltration. These data provide a foundation for further exploring the BM as a source of tumor-specific T cells for ACT in solid malignancies.">

        <tr id="Host immunity in sepsis has features of hyperinflammation together with progressive immunosuppression, particularly among CD4 T cells, that can predispose to secondary infections and ineffectual organ recovery. Metabolic and immunologic dysfunction are archetypal findings in critically ill patients with sepsis, but whether these factors are mechanistically linked remains incompletely defined. We characterized functional metabolic properties of human CD4 T cells from critically ill patients with and without sepsis and healthy adults. CD4 T cells in critical illness showed increased subset-specific metabolic plasticity, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) acquiring glycolytic capacity that stabilized suppressive markers FOXP3 and TIGIT and correlated with clinical illness severity. Single-cell transcriptomics identified differential kynurenine metabolism in Tregs, which was validated ex vivo as a mechanism of Treg glycolytic adaptation and suppressive rewiring. These findings underscore immunometabolic dysfunction as a driver of CD4 T cell remodeling in sepsis and suggest therapeutic avenues to restore an effective immune response.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are critical mediators of antiviral immunity, yet their role in lymphoid tissues—key reservoirs of HIV persistence—remains poorly defined. Here, we uncover a distinct cytotoxic signature of tonsil-resident NK cells essential for targeting HIV-infected CD4⁺ T cells. Using a human tonsillar model of HIV infection and extracellular matrix-based functional assays, we identify a subset of NK cells co-expressing CD69, CD49a, CD103, and the adaptive marker NKG2C as potent effectors against autologous HIV-infected tissue CD4⁺ T cells. Both CD16⁺ and CD16⁻ NK subsets exhibited cytotoxic antiviral activity. However, HIV infection induced profound functional alterations in these NK cells, including dysregulated expression of CD9, TRAF2, ITGA1, suggesting disrupted activation, signaling, and tissue residency. Functional assays corroborated a significant impairment in the cytotoxic capacity, indicating HIV-driven NK cell dysfunction. Intriguingly, a subset of immature CD16⁻CD69⁺ NK cells underwent functional reprogramming, transitioning into a migration-competent, and metabolically primed state, driven by the upregulation of NUMAI, LCP1, SLC38A1, MT-ND2, NUMA1, MYH9, and CD44. Functional assays confirmed this transition, revealing changes in the expression of immune checkpoint receptors and a gain of cytotoxic function in these reprogrammed cells. These findings advance our understanding of NK cell biology in HIV infection and highlight novel avenues for NK-cell-based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Sepsis‐induced immunosuppression is related to increased susceptibility to secondary infections and death. Lung is the most vulnerable target organ in sepsis, but the understanding of the pulmonary immunosuppression state is still limited. Here, single‐cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is performed to map the landscape of immune cells, revealing a neutrophil‐driven immunosuppressive program in the lungs of patients with immunosuppressive sepsis. Although immunosuppressive genes are upregulated in different immune cells, only neutrophils dramatically increase in the BALF of patients in immunosuppressive phase of sepsis. Five neutrophil subpopulations in BALF are identified, among which CXCR2 + and CD274 (PD‐L1 coding gene)+ IL1RN + neutrophil subpopulations increased significantly during septic immunosuppression. Interestingly, a developmental trajectory from CXCR2 + to CD274 + IL1RN + neutrophil subpopulation is disclosed. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of CXCR2 blockade is observed on the survival of septic mice, along with a decreased number of PD‐L1 + neutrophils. Taken together, the CXCR2 + neutrophil subpopulation is discovered as a contributor to immunosuppression in sepsis and identified it as a potential therapeutic target in sepsis treatment.">

        <tr id="Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), either due to inherited or somatic mutation, is prevalent in colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers. While anti-PD-1 therapy is utilized in both local and advanced disease, up to 50% of MMRd CRC fail to respond. Using animal and human models of MMRd, we determined that interactions between MHC+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and TCF+ BHLHE40+ PRF1+ T cell subsets are associated with control of MMRd tumor growth, during anti-PD-1 treatment. In contrast, resistance is associated with upregulation of TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, and PD-1 expression on T cells, and infiltration of the tumor with immunosuppressive TREM2+ macrophages and monocytes. By combining anti-PD-1 with anti-LAG3/CTLA4/TREM2, up to 100% tumor eradication was achieved in MMRd CRC and remarkably, in >70% in MMRp CRC. This study identifies key T cell and macrophage subsets mediating the efficacy of immunotherapy in overcoming immune escape in both MMRd and MMRp CRC settings. Highlights Anti-PD-1 therapy leads to the accumulation and colocalization of MHCI/II+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and DCs with TCF+ CCL5+ T cells that have high TCR diversity. Resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy involves multiple T cell checkpoints, TREM2+ macrophages, IL1B+ TREM1+ monocytes and neutrophils, and IFITM+ tumor cells. Simultaneous blockade of PD-1, LAG3, CTLA-4 and TREM2 dramatically prevents progression of both MMRd and MMRp tumors. Combination therapy completely eliminates tumors by leveraging MHC+ macrophage, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell interactions, facilitating durable anti-tumor effects.">

Here, we show that oral RV infection induces gut-resident LLPCs that produce highly mutated protective IgA. Unlike RV-specific IgG+ LLPCs, IgA+ LLPCs were generated independently of MHCII expression by dendritic cells – rather MHCII expression by B cells was both necessary and sufficient. B cell MHCII was also sufficient to induce a unique population of T-bet+ follicular helper T (TFH1) cells which were crucial for RV-specific IgA+ LLPC accumulation in the gut via IFNγ- and CXCR3-dependent mechanisms. Similar to RV infection, TFH1 cells were required for influenza-specific IgA response. However, unlike RV infection, B cell MHCII was not sufficient to induce influenza-specific IgA+ LLPCs, suggesting the operation of mucosal site-specific priming mechanisms. Collectively, our data reveal that unconventionally primed TFH1 cells support IgA responses to mucosal viral infections.">

        <tr id="Humoral immunity is orchestrated by follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, which promote cognate B cells to produce high-affinity, protective antibodies. In aged individuals, humoral immunity after vaccination is diminished despite the presence of Tfh cells, suggesting defects after initial Tfh formation. In this study, we utilized both murine and human systems to investigate how aging alters Tfh cell differentiation after influenza vaccination. We found that young Tfh cells underwent progressive differentiation after influenza vaccination, culminating in clonal expansion of effector-like cells in both draining lymph nodes and blood. In aging, early stages of Tfh development occurred normally. However, aging rewired the later stages of development in Tfh cells, resulting in a transcriptional program reflective of cellular senescence, sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and metabolic reprogramming. We investigated the extent to which this rewiring of aged Tfh cells is due to the age-associated inflammatory ("inflammaging") microenvironment and found that this setting was sufficient to both block the transition of Tfh cells to a post-effector resting state and to skew Tfh cells towards the age-rewired state. Together, these data suggest that aging dampens humoral immunity by cytokine-mediated rewiring of late effector Tfh cell differentiation into an activated, yet less functional, cellular state.">

        <tr id="Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) substantially limits long-term survival following lung transplantation. To identify potential targets for CLAD prevention, T cells from explanted CLAD lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes, as well as diseased and nondiseased controls were isolated and single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing were performed. TCR sequencing revealed a clonally expanded population of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) with high cytotoxic potential, including upregulation of KLRK1, encoding the co-receptor NKG2D. These cytotoxic CD8+ TRMs accumulated around the CLAD airways and had a 100-fold increase in clonal overlap with lung-draining lymph nodes when compared with non-CLAD lungs. Using a murine model of orthotopic lung transplantation, we confirmed that cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation was due to chronic rejection and not transplantation alone. Furthermore, blocking NKG2D in vivo attenuated the airway remodeling following transplantation and diminished airway accumulation of CD8+ T cells. Our findings support NKG2D as a potential therapeutic target for CLAD, affecting cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia remains a major contributor to clinical complications in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, including organ injury, morbidity and mortality. Given their critical role in antiviral defense, CD8+ T cells are essential for protective immunity against CMV. Methods Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated the transcriptional signatures and developmental lineages of CD8+ T cells in eight immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who received organs from CMV-seropositive donors. Results were validated in a cohort of 62 KTRs using immunophenotyping. Results Our data revealed a significant influence of CMV serostatus on transcriptional variance of CD8+ memory T cells, associating with the first principal component from a global analysis of CD8+ T cells (p =0.0406), forming a continuum with five principal differentiation trajectories driven by CMV primary infection or reactivation. Following CMV primary infection, CD8+ T cells were hallmarked by restrained effector-memory differentiation. CD8+ T cells during CMV reactivation diverged non-linearly into senescent-like cells with signatures of arrested cell cycle, diminished translational activity and downregulated ZNF683 and longitudinally expanding effector cells with robust cytotoxic potential and upregulated ZNF683, acting as a reservoir for long-lived effector cells supporting long-term protection. Notably, CD28lo KLRG1hi IL-7R (CD127)lo HLA-DRhi CD8+ T cells present prior to the detection of viremia in CMV-seropositive patients emerged as a key feature distinguishing patients who did or did not undergo CMV reactivation after prophylaxis discontinuation (p =0.0163). Frequencies of these cells were also positively correlated with CMV-stimulated secretion of IFN-γ (p =0.0494), TNF-α (p =0.0358), MIP-1α (p =0.0262), MIP-1β (p =0.0043). Discussion These results provide insights into the transcriptional regulation that influences the generation of CD8+ T cell immunity to CMV and may inform strategics for monitoring host immune response to CMV to better identify and introduce therapeutic intervention to patients at risk of developing clinically significant CMV viremia.">

        <tr id="Access to the brain for treating neurological sequalae requires a craniotomy, which can be complicated by infection. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1-/- mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1-/- animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng-/- mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1-/- animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

We elaborate on the precise mechanisms by which memory cells contribute to autoimmune diseases, highlighting insights from current research on how pathogenic memory responses are formed and sustained in autoimmunity. Finally, we explore potential therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating memory cells to prevent or treat autoimmune disorders, including B cell-depleting therapies (e.g., Rituximab), T cell-targeting agents (e.g., Abatacept), and cytokine inhibitors (e.g., IL-17 or IL-23 blockers) that are currently used in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis.">

        <tr id="Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown unprecedented success in a subset of immunogenic tumors, however a host of patients with advanced solid tumors fail to respond well or at all to immunotherapy. Refractory tumors commonly display a tumor microenvironment (TME) rich in immunosuppressive macrophages (M2-like) that suppress adaptive immunity and promote tumor progression. The ability to reprogram macrophages in the TME into an immune-active state holds great promise for enhancing responses to ICIs. Lucicebtide (previously referred to as ST101) is a peptide antagonist of the transcription factor C/EBPβ, a key activator of the transcriptional program in immunosuppressive macrophages. Here we show that lucicebtide exposure reprograms human immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype, restores cytotoxic T cell activation in immunosuppressed co-culture assays in vitro, and further increases T-cell activity in M1-like/T cell co-cultures. In immunocompetent, macrophage-rich triple-negative breast and colorectal cancer models, lucicebtide induces repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype and suppresses tumor growth. Lucicebtide synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy and overcomes resistance to checkpoint inhibition in anti-PD-1-refractory tumors, but in vivo responses are impaired by systemic macrophage depletion, indicating that macrophage reprogramming is integral to lucicebtide activity. These results identify lucicebtide as a novel immunomodulator that reprograms immunosuppressive macrophage populations to enhance anti-tumor activity and suggests its utility for combination strategies in cancers with poor response to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a highly aggressive malignancy marked by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that hinders effective immune responses. A key feature of this environment is the extensive infiltration of myeloid cells, which contributes to immune evasion. This study explored how mesothelin (MSLN), a tumor-associated antigen, modulates the expression of CD24, an emerging target for immune modulation, and its role in promoting immune evasion in HGSOC. Understanding these underlying mechanisms is crucial for enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies and improving outcomes in patients with HGSOC. Methods We analyzed the expression of MSLN in HGSOC samples and examined its correlation with clinical outcome. In vitro and in vivo models were used to explore how MSLN influences CD24 expression and the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We also investigated the role of MSLN in the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and its impact on T-cell function and antitumor immunity. The effects of Msln knockdown on CD24 expression and the response to anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) therapy were evaluated in syngeneic mouse models. Results MSLN expression was found to be significantly elevated in HGSOC, with high MSLN levels correlating with poor prognosis and resistance to ICB. MSLN upregulated CD24 and promoted the protumorigenic polarization of TAMs, contributing to T-cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, MSLN activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which in turn enhanced CD24 expression. This activation forms a positive feedback loop that further promotes MSLN transcription. In contrast, Msln knockdown reduced CD24 expression, relieved cytotoxic T-cell suppression, and significantly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in syngeneic models. Conclusions This study elucidates the critical role of MSLN in immune evasion in HGSOC and its underlying mechanisms. Targeting MSLN in combination with ICB is a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and improve patient outcomes in HGSOC.">

        <tr id="Excessive neutrophil infiltration can exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage, contributing to conditions like autoimmune disorders and liver diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects. Our study offers a perspective for advancing MSC-based therapies in tissue repair.">

        <tr id="While most people contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, some individuals develop active disease, usually within two years of infection. Why immunity fails after initially controlling infection is unknown. C57BL/6 mice control Mycobacterium tuberculosis for up to a year but ultimately succumb to disease. We hypothesize that the development of CD4 T cell dysfunction permits bacterial recrudescence. We developed a reductionist model to assess antigen-specific T cells during chronic infection and found evidence of CD4 T cell senescence and exhaustion. In C57BL/6 mice, CD4 T cells upregulate coinhibitory receptors and lose effector cytokine production. Single cell RNAseq shows that only a small number of CD4 T cells in the lungs of chronically infected mice are polyfunctional. While the origin and causal relationship between T- cell dysfunction and recrudescence remains uncertain, we propose T cell dysfunction leads to a feed-forward loop that causes increased bacillary numbers, greater T cell dysfunction, and progressive disease.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effectors with considerable heterogeneity and potent antitumor capabilities. Intraepithelial ILC1 (ieILC1)-like NK cells, a population of cytotoxic tissue-resident innate lymphoid cells, have recently been documented in the microenvironment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and other solid tumors. These cells have antitumor cytolytic potential and are potent producers of type 1 cytokines, including IFNγ. Here, we identify a subpopulation of ex vivo differentiated ieILC1-like NK cells that produce IL-13 upon stimulation. Functional characterization revealed that these cells co-expressed IFNγ and IL-13 while maintaining an ILC1 transcriptional signature. IL-13 was induced either upon co-culture with tumor cell lines, or in response to TGF-β and IL-15. IL-13-expressing ieILC1-like NK cells were identified among tumor infiltrating lymphocytes expanded from patient HNSCC tumors, in support of their in vivoexistence in primary tumors. These data demonstrate additional heterogeneity within the ieILC1-like NK cell population than previously appreciated and highlight a unique form of ILC plasticity in which cells with clear ILC1 transcriptional profiles express a type 2 cytokine. With the known roles of IL-13 in cancer cell growth dynamics and immunoregulation, the identification of this subset within tumor microenvironments presents a potential target for therapeutic manipulation.">

        <tr id="Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is a debilitating pulmonary disorder that occurs due to persistent exposure to beryllium (Be) particles in the workplace. Be-exposure causes activation of the innate immune system, resulting in the secretion of interleukins and chemokines that drive the accumulation of B and T cells in the lungs. However, the mechanisms by which innate molecules influence the recruitment of B cells and B cell-mediated protection in CBD are poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiple approaches to examine the role of innate immune signaling and CD4+ T cells in B cell recruitment and function in the lungs. We show that the absence or blocking of IL-1R1 signaling prevents the recruitment of B cells to the lungs of BeO-exposed mice. Additionally, we show that B cell recruitment to the lungs depends on the chemokine receptor, CXCR5, and CD4+ T cells. In BeO-exposed mice, lung B cells down-regulate IgM but showed an increased IgD and CD44 surface expression. Further, RNA sequencing of pulmonary tissue-specific B cells in CBD revealed distinct gene signatures compared to splenic B cells, with increased expression of pathways involved in antigen presentation, tight junction interactions, and interferon signaling. Overall, our study shows that B cell recruitment and aggregate formation during CBD depend on sequential activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.">

        <tr id="Although immune therapy has seen significant advances, the majority of breast and other solid tumors do not respond or quickly develop de novo resistance. One factor driving resistance is highly immune suppressive myeloid cells (MCs) such as macrophages. Previous work has established clinical links between cholesterol and cancer outcome, and that MC function can be regulated through disruption in cholesterol metabolism. Thus, we screened for proteins that were expressed in MCs, involved in cholesterol homeostasis and whose expression was associated with survival; we identify the cholesterol efflux protein ABCA1. Preclinical studies revealed that ABCA1 activity resulted in increased anti-cancer functions of macrophages: enhanced tumor infiltration, decreased angiogenic potential, reduced efferocytosis, and improved support of CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, different AKT isoforms are involved, through both PI3K dependent and independent mechanisms. Assessment of human blood and breast tumors revealed correlations between ABCA1 in macrophages and angiogenic potential, VEGFA, and CD8 T cell abundance and activity, highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings. The culmination of the effects of ABCA1 on MC function were demonstrated through increased tumor growth and metastasis in mice with MC specific knockout of ABCA1. Therefore, modulating ABCA1 activity within MCs may represent a novel approach to immune therapy.">

        <tr id="Antitumor immune surveillance is the key feature of tumour progression and response to treatment in various malignancies, such as lymphomas. Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are bone marrow (BM)-derived cells with potent suppressive properties, implicated in T cell inhibition and tumour dissemination. In Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), circulating MDSCs constitute the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, while the contribution of BM MDSCs in disease pathogenesis remains elusive. In the present study we aimed to evaluate both the frequencies as well as the molecular signatures of MDSCs in blood and BM from newly diagnosed DLBCL patients prior to treatment initiation and from age matched healthy donors. Circulating levels of total, monocytic (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSCs were found increased in DLBCL compared to healthy control, while in DLBCL patients the BM MDSCs were significantly increased compared to blood. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significantly different molecular fingerprints to characterize circulating and BM M-MDSCs, implying that MDSCs exhibit their function with distinct mechanisms depending on the anatomical compartment. Despite that MDSC frequencies did not demonstrate any significant correlation with disease characteristics and outcome, our findings propose that gene expression profiling should be evaluated for their potential prognostic impact. Overall, the findings presented here, provide new insights in the immunosuppressive networks that operate in DLBCL and importantly propose new molecular mechanisms expressed by BM MDSCs which may be explored therapeutically.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes (CTL) are crucial in antiviral immune responses. However, their recruitment to infection sites renders them at risk of viral infection that could modulate their effector activity. CTL express RIG-I that detects cytosolic viral RNA and subsequently induce antiviral gene expression. Here, we investigated how influenza A virus (IAV) infection influence TCR-dependent effector responses. IAV infection of CTL stimulated RIG-I, and activated downstream pathways including TBK1 and NF-⍰B, resulting in type-I interferon secretion. Transfection of CTL with a pure RIG-I ligand, tri-phosphorylated double stranded RNA(3p-dsRNA), not only stimulated these pathways but also enhanced CTL proliferation in vitro and protected them from IAV infection. Analogous with a positive effect on CD8 effector function, both IAV infection and RIG-I ligand transfection enhanced CTL degranulation and cytokine secretion. Conversely, activation of CTL via CD3/CD28-crosslinking increased their susceptibility to IAV infection. Altogether, RIG-I stimulation either by IAV infection or 3p-dsRNA transfection promoted cell intrinsic antiviral pathways and enhanced CD8 effector functions. These findings suggest that RIG-I agonists could enhance and prolong CTL effector function in immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal Stromal Cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) may retain the cancer targeting and immune privilege of MSCs. The immense potential MSC-EVs hold as tumour-targeted therapeutics warrants an understanding of potential adverse events to support clinical translation. This study aimed to determine whether MSC-EVs would elicit an immune response following administration in tumour-bearing immunocompetent animals. Secreted EVs were isolated from both human and murine bone marrow derived MSCs and characterized. hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs were administered intravenously into 4T1 breast tumour-bearing Balb/c mice or healthy controls. Tumour tissue, draining lymph nodes and spleens were harvested, dissociated into a single cell suspension and flow cytometry performed targeting T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The 4T1 model immune profile was first determined by comparing the spleen of tumour-bearing animals to healthy controls. T cells were increased in tumour-bearing animals (CD4+/CD25+ p=0.041; CD8+/CD25+ p=0.02). A significant elevation of GR-1+ MDSCs (p=0.002), CD11b+ macrophages (p=0.023) and CD11c+ dendritic cells (p=0.001) was also observed. In contrast, CD27+ NK cells were significantly decreased compared to the spleen of healthy animals (p=0.006). Collectively this data validated the immune profile and supported the determination of any changes in response to hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs administration. No significant activation of CD4+ (p=0.20) or CD8+ (p=0.57) T cells were seen in tumour tissue in both groups. The percentage of GR-1+ MDSCs (28% vs 27%, p=0.92), CD11b+, CD11c+ and CD27+ cells were similar regardless of EV origin. No significant changes in T cells, MDSCs, macrophages, dendritic or NK cells were observed in the lymph node or spleen of animals that received hMSC-EV versus mMSC-EVs. In conclusion, human MSC-EVs elicited no discernible immune response in mice, supporting the hypothesis that MSC-EVs retain the immune privilege of the secretory cell. This reinforces the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs.">

        <tr id="Staphylococcus aureus poses an enormous burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Making an efficacious vaccine has however proven extremely challenging. Due to colonizing interactions, pre-existing S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells are often found in the human population and yet a detailed characterization of their phenotypes and how they might in turn impact vaccine efficacy are thus far unknown. Using an activation induced marker assay to sort for S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells in an effector function-independent manner, single cell transcriptomic analysis was conducted. Remarkably, S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells consisted not only of a broader spectrum of conventional T cells (Tcon) than previously described but also of regulatory T cells (Treg). As compared to polyclonally-activated CD4+ T cells, S. aureus-specific Tcon were enriched for the expression of the Th17-type cytokine genes IL17A, IL22 and IL26, while higher percentages of S. aureus-specific Treg expressed the T Cell Immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), a pleiotropic immune checkpoint. Notably, the antagonistic anti-TIGIT mAb Tiragolumab increased IL-1β production in response to S. aureus in vitro. Therefore, these results uncover the presence of S. aureus-specific TIGIT+ Treg in the blood of healthy subjects that could blunt responses to vaccination and indicate TIGIT as a potential targetable biomarker to overcome pre-exposure-induced immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cytotoxic immune cell populations, including CD8+ T cells, play a critical role in anti-tumor immunity, suppressing tumor progression. For this reason, recent therapeutic algorithms include immunotherapeutic agents that target such cell populations for the treatment of patients with a variety of solid tumors. In contrast to solid tumors, such immunotherapeutic strategies failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this reason, the study of immunophenotypic and molecular changes in cytotoxic effector cell populations in patients with such disorders would provide the necessary evidence for the development of novel immunotherapies. In this review, we provide an overview of experimental studies describing the modulation of CD8+ T cell populations in patients with myeloid neoplasms, focusing on whether and how specific cell phenotypes are linked to disease progression and treatment.">

        <tr id="Neuroblastoma (NB) is an immunologically “cold” tumor with poor or no inflamed substrates as most of solid pediatric tumors (SPT). Consistent data indicate that NB tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by myeloid cells, with little (but variable) T cell infiltration. The obstacles to lymphocyte infiltration and to their anti-tumor activity are due to different tumor immune evasion strategies, including loss of HLA Class I molecules, high expression of immune checkpoint molecular ligands leading to exhaustion of T effector (and NK) cells, induction of T regulatory, myeloid and stromal cells and secretion of immunosuppressive mediators. In odds with adult solid tumors, NB displays weak immunogenicity caused by intrinsic low mutational burden and scant expression of neoepitopes in the context of MHC-class I antigens which, in turn, are particularly poorly expressed on NB cells, thus inducing low anti-tumor T cell responses. In addition, NB is generated from embryonal cells and is the result of transcriptional abnormalities and not of the accumulation of genetic mutations over time, thus further explaining the low immunogenicity. The poor expression of immunogenic molecules on tumor cells is associated with the high production of immunosuppressive factors which further downregulate lymphocyte infiltration and activity, thus explaining the limited efficacy of new drugs in NB, as immune checkpoint inhibitors. This review is focused on examining the role of T effector and regulatory cells infiltrating TME of NB, taking into account their repertoire, phenotype, function, plasticity and, importantly, predictive value for defining novel targets for therapy.">

        <tr id="T cells play diverse roles in cancer immunology, acting as tumor suppressors, cytotoxic effectors, enhancers of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and immune suppressors; providing memory and surveillance; modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME); or activating innate immune cells. However, cancer cells can disrupt T cell function, leading to T cell exhaustion and a weakened immune response against the tumor. The expression of exhausted T cell (Tex) markers plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune landscape of multiple cancers. Our aim was to systematically investigate the role of known T cell exhaustion (Tex) markers across multiple cancers while exploring their molecular interactions, mutation profiles, and potential implications for immunotherapy. The mRNA expression profile of six Tex markers, LAG-3, PDCD1, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CXCL13, and LAYN was investigated in pan-cancer. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), and other repositories, we characterized the differential expression of the Tex markers, their association with the patients’ survival outcome, and their mutation profile in multiple cancers. Additionally, we analyzed the effects on cancer-related pathways and immune infiltration within the TME, offering valuable insights into mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and progression. Finally, the correlation between their expression and sensitivity to multiple anti-cancer drugs was investigated extensively. Differential expression of all six markers was significantly associated with KIRC and poor prognosis in several cancers. They also played a potential activating role in apoptosis, EMT, and hormone ER pathways, as well as a potential inhibitory role in the DNA damage response and RTK oncogenic pathways. Infiltration of different immune cells was also found to be associated with the expression of the Tex-related genes in most cancer types. These findings underline that the reviving of exhausted T cells can be used to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Bona fide Kupffer cells (KCs) are prenatally seeded and show unique functional and immunophenotypic features among tissue macrophages. They are considered as terminally differentiated, and adaptability in disease is attributed to recruited, monocyte-derived KCs. Here, we investigated the extent of KC plasticity and the impact of origin in mycobacterial infections that target macrophages and can persist for months. Fate-mapping combined with high-resolution imaging revealed the emergence of a unique, infection specific KC subset which downregulated the signature markers CLEC4F and VSIG4 (“KClow”). KClow were derived from bona fide KCs and located exclusively to granuloma cores. In contrast, monocyte-derived macrophages were contained at the granuloma borders and contributed to this tissue reaction. ATAC and single-cell RNA sequencing identified a specific signature of KClow with high antimycobacterial activity and specialization to a hypoxic microenvironment. Despite their fundamental deviation from the classical KC phenotype, KClow showed remarkable adaptability, and were capable to return to a homeostatic-like KC state. Accordingly, mycobacterial infections unmask KCs as highly plastic cells, capable of responding to extreme environmental changes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients only achieves response rates of 25%–30%, indicating the necessity of new therapies for non-responder patients. Since myeloid-related suppressive factors are associated with poor responses to ICI in a subgroup of HCC patients, modulation of these targets may improve response rates. Our aim was to characterize the expression of the efferocytosis receptor MERTK in HCC and to analyze its potential as a new therapeutic target. In HCC patients, MERTK was expressed by myeloid cells and was associated with poorer survival. In a murine HCC model with progressive myeloid cell infiltration, MERTK was detected in dendritic cells and macrophages with an activated phenotype, which overexpressed the checkpoint ligand PD-L1. Concomitant expression of PD-1 in tumor T-cells suggested the pertinence of combined PD-1/PD-L1 and MERTK blockade. In vivo experiments in mice showed that inhibition of MERTK improved the therapeutic effect promoted by anti-PD-1 or by ICI combinations currently approved for HCC. This effect was associated with enhanced tumor infiltration and superior activity of antigen presenting cells and effector lymphocytes. Our results indicate that MERTK may behave as a relevant target for immunotherapeutic combinations in those HCC patients with tumors enriched in a myeloid component.">

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

        <tr id="Squalene-based adjuvants like MF59, and its research alternative AddaVax, induce transient muscle injury, but their working mechanisms downstream of muscle injury remain unclear. We show that an AddaVax-adjuvanted quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (QIV) intramuscular injection triggers muscle regeneration-like immune processes and increases CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages in the muscle and inguinal lymph nodes by day 4 post-injection. This leads to a Th2 skewed vaccine response with higher levels of vaccine specific IgG1 titers, and Th2-associated cytokines in the lungs 5 days after subsequent influenza viral challenge. In aged mice, the macrophage recruitment and polarization is diminished, which is consistent with age-associated muscle mass loss, reflecting the age-related decline in muscle regeneration. Unlike young mice, aged mice exhibit a reduction in magnitude and skewing of AddaVax-mediated Th2 responses to QIV. We found that adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived macrophages derived from young mice into aged mice at the moment of vaccination leads to their infiltration into the injected muscle, where they collect vaccine antigens, drain to the lymph node, and enhance the Th2 response, recapitulating the young host response but in an older host. However, rescuing the Th2-skewing effects of AddaVax alone was not sufficient to enhance protection against mismatched subsequent influenza viral infection in aged mice, suggesting additional factors at play in the diminished vaccine response in aged hosts. This underscores the importance of the macrophage-driven muscle regenerative response in the mechanism of action for squalene-based adjuvants like AddaVax and emphasizes the need to study how muscle damage and regenerative pathways in intramuscular vaccine responses contribute to vaccine effectiveness.">

        <tr id="Toll-like receptors (TLR) are phylogenetically conserved mediators of innate immunity that are essential for establishing adaptive immune responses against invading pathogens. TLR7 is an endosomal receptor expressed predominantly in myeloid and B cells. Activation of TLR7 induces Type I interferon and proinflammatory responses; therefore, targeting TLR7 is a promising strategy for antitumor therapy. Although the use of bacterial components to trigger innate immune responses in cancer patients started a century ago, the effectiveness of systemic TLR agonists has been rather underwhelming in clinical trials, partly due to nonspecific immune activation leading to safety and tolerability issues. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) constitute a proven therapeutic modality amenable to systemic administration with limited toxicity concerns via a targeted delivery platform. We generated TLR7 agonist–antibody conjugates that recognize tumor antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Generated ADCs demonstrated robust activity in in vitro tumor antigen-presenting cell (APC) coculture systems as indicated by dose-dependent upregulation of PD-L1 and CD86 on macrophages. TLR7 agonist-ADC provided superior tumor growth control compared to intravenously (IV) administrated free TLR7 agonist. Treatment with TLR7 agonist-ADC led to prolonged activation of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with minimum immune activation in the periphery. Systemic and tissue exposure studies demonstrated tumor-specific free drug release by targeted ADC treatment. In summary, the TLR7 agonist-ADC can potentially activate immune cells in the TME to generate tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses, making it an attractive approach for precision cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Angiostrongylus cantonensis (AC) is the leading cause of eosinophilic meningoencephalitis worldwide. The neuroimmune interactions between peripheral and central immune systems in angiostrongyliasis remain unclear. In this study, significant infiltration of eosinophils, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and Ly6C monocytes is observed in the brains of AC‐infected mice, with macrophages being the most abundant. RNA‐seq and SMART‐seq analysis of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and DNA sensor gene sets revealed a marked increase in Z‐DNA binding protein 1 (Zbp1) expression in infected mice. Confocal microscopy, RT‐qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry further confirmed that Zbp1 is specifically upregulated in macrophages and microglia. Using Zbp1‐knockout mice and flow cytometry, it is found that knockout of Zbp1 enhanced lymphocyte infiltration and natural killer cell cytotoxicity, modulating the immune microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS) during AC infection. Mechanistically, it is revealed that in macrophage Zbp1 directly binds to receptor‐interacting protein 3 (RIP3) to promote its phosphorylation, subsequently facilitating the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain‐like protein (Mlkl). The activated Zbp1‐pRIP3‐pMlkl axis leads to necroptosis and upregulates pro‐inflammatory cytokines including TNF‐α, IL‐1α, CXCL9, CXCL10 in macrophages, which recruits and activates immune cells. These findings offer new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of angiostrongyliasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant neoplasm globally, with an increased death rate despite recent advancements in research and therapeutic options. Different molecular subtypes of GC have distinct interactions with the immune system, impacting the tumor microenvironment (TME), prognosis, and reaction to immunotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the TME are crucial for preventing tumor growth and metastasis, as evidenced by research showing that patients with GC who have a significant density of TILs have better survival rates. But cancer cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, both sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) playing a pivotal role in the development of an immunosuppressive TME. They prevent T cell activation and proliferation resulting in a decrease in the immune system’s capacity to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. These immune checkpoint molecules function via different but complementary mechanisms, the expression of Siglec-15 being mutually exclusive with PD-L1 and, therefore, providing a different therapeutic approach. The review explores how TILs affect tumor growth and patient outcomes in GC, with particular emphasis on their interactions within the TME and potential targeting of the PD-L1 and Siglec-15 pathways for immunotherapy.">

Recent studies have shown a correlation between CD8+ TRM cells and favorable clinical outcomes in various types of cancer, indicating their potential role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, the dual nature of CD8+ TRM cells presents challenges, as their inappropriate activation may lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review highlights significant advancements in the field, focusing on the differentiation pathways and phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8+ TRM cells across different tissues and disease states. We also review their protective roles in various contexts and the implications for vaccine development against infections and treatment strategies for tumors. Overall, this comprehensive review outlines the common features of CD8+ TRM cell differentiation and biological functions, emphasizing their specific characteristics across diverse tissues and disease states, which can guide the design of therapies against infections and tumors while minimizing the risk of autoimmune diseases.">

Analysis of human CD14+CD16+ monocytes matured in vitro by single-cell RNA sequencing identified a heterogenous population of nine clusters. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in each cluster identified increased migratory and inflammatory pathways for a group of clusters, which we termed Group 1 monocytes. Group 1 monocytes, distinguished by increased ALCAM, CD52, CD63, and SDC2, exhibited gene expression signatures implicated in CNS inflammatory diseases, produced higher levels of CXCL12, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, and ROS, and preferentially transmigrated across a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model.

        <tr id="Aging significantly diminishes T cell immunity, increasing susceptibility to infections and reducing vaccine efficacy in older individuals. Metabolism plays a key role in T cell function, shaping their energy requirements, activation, and differentiation. Recent studies highlight altered metabolic signaling as a pivotal factor in T cell aging, influencing the ability of T cells to maintain quiescence, respond to activation, and differentiate into functional subsets. Aberrant metabolic pathways disrupt the quiescence of aged T cells and skew their differentiation toward short-lived, pro-inflammatory effector T cells while hindering the generation of long-lived memory and T follicular helper cells. These changes contribute to a hyper-inflammatory state, exacerbate chronic low-grade inflammation, and compromise immune homeostasis. In this review, we explore how metabolic signaling is altered during T cell aging and the resulting functional impacts. We also discuss therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring proper T cell differentiation, improving vaccine responses, and rejuvenating immune function in older populations.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors include targeting additional immunosuppressive compartments in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Inhibitory macrophages (Mφ) can be one of the most abundant immune cells in the TME associated with poor prognosis. However, to date, selective Mφ depletion strategies as a cancer immunotherapy have not been successful in clinical trials. Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure (MARCO) is one of a family of class-A scavenger receptors expressed by Mφ in the TME and is one of the most upregulated transcripts in dendritic cells (DC) following their ex vivo uptake of dead tumor cells. The clinical significance of MARCO expression in the TME is not fully understood. Methods The therapeutic potential of targeting MARCO by an anti-murine MARCO (ED31, clone ED31) monoclonal antibody, which inhibits ligand-binding to MARCO, was explored in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) in C57BL/6J mice bearing B16F10 or Pan02 tumors. The mechanism by which ED31 impacts the TME was investigated by flow cytometry in the different treatment arms. The contribution of Mφ was assessed by both in vivo depletion and in vitro functional assays. Chemokine production was measured by a bead-based multiplex assay. Results ED31 enhanced antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4, but not of anti-PD-1. Analysis of the TME revealed that adding ED31 to anti-CTLA-4 substantially increased immune cell infiltration, including mature conventional DC recruitment, that was due to a switch to M1-pattern chemokines by Mφ. Mφ depletion completely abrogated both the increase in immune cell infiltration and chemokine production, and abolished the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy. Conclusions Targeting MARCO as an additional checkpoint in the TME can offer a strategy to improve the antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 through a mechanism involving Mφ reprogramming rather than their depletion.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in linking innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition to presenting antigens to T cells, DCs must also provide co-stimulatory signals along with cytokines for T cells to induce an appropriate cellular immune response. Tolerance is also established and maintained by DCs under homeostatic circumstances. There is remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity in DCs, each with different functional flexibility and specific expression of various markers. The three primary categories of DCs comprise conventional DCs (cDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). Langerhans cells (LCs) are another type of DCs, which are found in the skin's epidermal layer. DCs may be positioned or triggered inappropriately as a result of dysregulation of DC. This phenomenon can cause an imbalance in immune responses and even immune-related pathological disorders, i.e., autoimmune diseases and malignancies. Herein, by reviewing the ontogeny, biology, characteristics, and function of DCs subsets in immune system, we discuss the contribution of these cells in the mentioned immune-related disorders.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Adaptive immune resistance in cancer describes the various mechanisms by which tumors adapt to evade anti-tumor immune responses. IFN-γ induction of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was the first defined and validated adaptive immune resistance mechanism. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is central to adaptive immune resistance as immune modulatory secreted and integral membrane proteins are dependent on ER. Sigma1 is a unique ligand-regulated integral membrane scaffolding protein enriched in the ER of cancer cells. PD-L1 is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is translated into the ER and processed through the cellular secretory pathway. At the cell surface, PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint molecule that binds PD-1 on activated T-cells and blocks anti-tumor immunity. PD-L1 can also be incorporated into cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), and EV-associated PD-L1 can inactivate T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that a selective small molecule inhibitor of Sigma1 can block IFN-γ mediated adaptive immune resistance in part by altering the incorporation of PD-L1 into cancer cell-derived EVs. Sigma1 inhibition blocked post-translational maturation of PD-L1 downstream of IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling. Subsequently, EVs released in response to IFN-γ stimulation were significantly less potent suppressors of T-cell activation. These results suggest that by reducing tumor derived immune suppressive EVs, Sigma1 inhibition may promote antitumor immunity. Sigma1 modulation presents a novel approach to regulating the tumor immune microenvironment by altering the content and production of EVs. Altogether, these data support the notion that Sigma1 may play a role in adaptive immune resistance in the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, with over 1 billion people worldwide living with obesity. It is associated with an increased risk of over 200 chronic co-morbidities, including an increased susceptibility to infection. Numerous studies have highlighted the dysfunction caused by obesity on a wide range of immune cell subsets, including dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are innate immune sentinels that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems. DCs provide critical signals that instruct and shape the immune response. Our group has previously reported that DCs from people with obesity display defective cytokine production; however, the mechanisms underpinning these defects are unclear. Methods We investigated the functional responses of DCs using a murine-specific single-stranded RNA virus, Sendai virus, in mice on a standard diet and in a model of diet-induced obesity. Results Here, we demonstrate that GM-CSF cultured bone marrow–derived DCs (GM-DCs) from mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) have reduced cytokine production following viral challenge. This was associated with a dysfunctional metabolism through reduced translation in the HFD GM-DCs. Conclusions We propose that obesity-mediated effects on DCs have downstream consequences on their ability to effectively mediate subsequent immune responses, especially during viral infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT HIV persists in people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in long-lived and proliferating latently infected CD4+ T cells that selectively express pro-survival proteins, including the zinc finger proteins, Ikaros and Aiolos. In this study, we investigated whether pomalidomide, an immunomodulatory agent that induces degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos, could increase the death of HIV-infected cells and/or reverse HIV latency. Using an in vitro model of CD4+ T cells infected with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter virus, pomalidomide increased the expression of the pro-survival protein B cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and did not increase apoptosis of GFP+ HIV productively infected CD4+ T cells. Pomalidomide also increased the expression of CD155 and UL16-binding protein (ULBP) stress proteins on GFP+ HIV productively infected CD4+ T cells, but this did not translate to enhanced clearance following co-culture with a natural killer (NK) cell line. Using CD4+ T cells from PLHIV on ART, pomalidomide ex vivo activated memory CD4+ T cells resulting in elevated HLA-DR expression and induced CD4+ T cell proliferation but only in the presence of T cell receptor stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. There was no effect on cell-associated HIV RNA or the frequency of intact HIV DNA. In conclusion, despite an increase in stress protein expression, promoting Ikaros and Aiolos degradation in CD4+ T cells using pomalidomide did not directly induce apoptosis of HIV-infected cells or induce HIV latency reversal. 
IMPORTANCE
 People living with HIV (PLHIV) require lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to the persistence of latently infected cells. The zinc finger proteins, Ikaros and Aiolos, have recently been implicated in promoting the persistence of latently infected cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of pomalidomide, an immunomodulatory imide drug that induces the degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos, on HIV latency reversal and death of infected cells. Using CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, as well as an in vitro model of productive HIV infection, we found that pomalidomide induced T cell activation and expression of stress proteins but no evidence of latency reversal or selective death of infected cells.">

        <tr id="The present immune therapy was focused on the immune checkpoint blockade or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Immunotherapy (CART) transfer, but how to activate the innate immune system to antitumor still lags out. Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocytes in human, and heterogeneous neutrophils have been increasingly recognized as important players in tumor progression. They play double “edge-sward” by either supporting or suppressing the tumor growth, including driving angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling to promote tumor growth, participating in antitumor adaptive immunity, or killing tumor cells directly to inhibit the tumor growth. The complex role of neutrophils in various tumors depends on the tumor microenvironment (TME) they are located, and emerging evidence has suggested that neutrophils may determine the success of tumor immunotherapy in the context of the immune checkpoint blockade, innate immune training, or drug-loaded extracellular microvesicles therapy, which makes them become an exciting target for tumor immunotherapy, but still with challenges. Here, we summarize the latest insights on how to activate neutrophils in antitumor immunity and discuss the advances of neutrophil-targeted immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Hypoxia in tumor cells is linked to increased drug resistance and more aggressive behavior. In pancreatic cancer, the tumor microenvironment is notably hypoxic and exhibits strong immunosuppressive properties. Given that immunotherapy is now approved for pancreatic cancer treatment, further understanding of how pancreatic tumor cell hypoxia influences T-cell cytotoxicityis essential. Objective This study examined how hypoxia affects the interaction between pancreatic tumor cells (PANC-1) and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells. Methods Pancreatic tumor cells (PANC-1) were exposed to 20 cycles of chronic hypoxic conditions, each for 72 hours, followed by a re-oxygenation period for 24 hours. On cycles 10 and 20, PANC-1 conditioned media (CM) was harvested, and the hypoxic PANC-1 cells were co-cultured with either the activated cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells or with CD8+ T-cells CM. CD8+ T-cells CM was collected after five days of cell activation using anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and interleukin-2 (IL-2). CD8+ T-cells were activated for 72 hours and then cultured with the hypoxic PANC-1 CM. Results Hypoxic PANC-1 cells showed significant resistance to the lytic effect of either CD8+ T-cells co-culture or CD8+ T-cells CM treatment compared to normoxic PANC-1 cells. A significant decrease in TNF-α and IFN-γ levels was also detected. Additionally, a significant increase in IL-6, p53 and TNF-α gene expression levels was observed in PANC-1 cells treated with CD8+ T-cells CM. Moreover, IL-6 gene expression level showed a significant difference between hypoxic and normoxic PANC-1 cells. CD8+ T-cell proliferation and cytokines production were significantly higher in cells co-cultured with PANC-1 CM. However, no significant differences were observed after treatment with either hypoxic or normoxic PANC-1 CM. Conclusion Hypoxia decreases PANC-1 cells’ sensitivity to cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells. Reduced tumor cell susceptibility to CD8+ T-cells was associated with increased IL-6 expression and reduced TNF-α and IFN-γ levels. Thus, cytokine dysregulation might contribute to the hypoxia-mediated resistance of pancreatic tumor cells to CD8+ T-cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The increased expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on a subset of immune cells in the peripheral blood has been frequently observed in patients with cancer, suggesting a relationship with PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying PD-L1 expression on various types of immune cells in the peripheral blood of patients with cancer. Methods PD-L1 expression on various immune cell populations was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 112 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using flow cytometry. A mouse model of X-ray-induced acute thrombocytopenia was used to investigate the relationship between thrombopoiesis and PD-L1-expressing platelet generation. The clinical significance of PD-L1-expressing platelets was analyzed in a cohort of patients with stage IV NSCLC who received a combination of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy and chemotherapy. Results All immune cell populations, including monocytes, T cells, B cells, and NK cells, showed higher PD-L1 expression in patients with cancer than in healthy controls. However, this increased frequency of PD-L1-expressing cells was not attributed to the expression of the cells themselves. Instead, it was entirely dependent on the direct interaction of the cells with PD-L1-expressing platelets. Notably, the platelet-dependent acquisition of PD-L1 on circulating immune cells of patients with lung cancer was observed in various other cancer types and was mechanistically associated with a surge in thrombopoiesis, resulting in the increased production of PD-L1-expressing reticulated platelets. Clinically, patients with enhanced thrombopoiesis and concurrently high PD-L1-expressing platelets exhibited a better response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Conclusions These findings highlight the role of tumor-associated thrombopoiesis in generating PD-L1-expressing platelets that may serve as a resource for PD-L1-positive cells in the circulation and act as a predictive biomarker for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Bone marrow serves as the residence of hematopoietic stem cells and is recognized as one of the most radiosensitive tissues. Exposure to acute radiation leads to severe damage to bone marrow hematopoiesis which can be fatal, while few clinically applicable medication or specific therapeutic targets have been discovered. In this study, we found that the administration of cannabidiol significantly enhanced individual survival and restored the reconstitution capacity of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells within 14 days after irradiation. Single‐cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of genes associated with stemness along with Wnt and BMP signaling pathways were restored by the cannabidiol treatment through the upregulation of Atf2, a transcription factor possessing multifunctional properties. Atf2 upregulation induced by cannabidiol treatment potentially upregulated the expression of Lrp6 to improve the stemness of hematopoietic stem cells. Further functional experiments validated the crucial role of Atf2 in regulating multilineage differentiation potential of bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Overall, our findings provide evidence for a promising radioprotective function of cannabidiol and Atf2 as a candidate therapeutic target for acute radiation‐induced hematopoietic injury, thereby paving the way for future research in the field.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are a specialized subset of memory T cells that permanently reside in non-lymphoid tissues, providing localized and long-lasting immune protection. In the urinary tract, TRM cells play critical roles in defending against infections, mediating tumor immunity, and influencing the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic potential is immense, with promising avenues for vaccine development, enhanced cancer immunotherapy, and targeted treatments for chronic inflammation. However, challenges remain in harnessing their protective roles while minimizing their pathological effects, particularly in immunosuppressive or inflammatory microenvironments. This review explores the diverse roles of TRM cells in urinary tract diseases, including infections, cancer, and chronic inflammation, and discusses therapeutic strategies and future directions for leveraging TRM cells to improve clinical outcomes. By advancing our understanding of TRM cell biology, we can develop innovative interventions that balance their immune-protective and regulatory functions.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Non‐lymphoid tissue Tregs (NLT‐Tregs) are critical for tissue homeostasis, inflammation control, and induction of tissue repair. Recent single‐cell RNA sequencing data identified the expression of CD83 as part of an NLT‐Treg signature, which is an essential molecule for the stability and differentiation of lymphoid Tregs. However, the biological significance of CD83 expression for NLT Tregs has not yet been elucidated. The present study explores for the first time the role of CD83 expression by lung‐resident Tregs in the steady state and during asthma to understand its importance in barrier tissues. We evaluated the effect of Treg‐specific CD83 deletion (CD83cKO) on the lung‐resident T‐cell compartment and cytokine profile. CD83‐deficient lung Tregs are less differentiated but more activated, resulting in unrestrained T‐cell activation. Further, CD83cKO mice were challenged in an asthma model and showed an accelerated disease progression, driven by Th2‐biased T‐cell responses. CD83cKO Tregs exhibited enhanced responsiveness to IL‐4, leading to insufficient control of Th2‐differentiation from naïve T cells. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CD83 in the NLT‐Treg‐mediated modulation of Th2 responses. Overall, our results highlight CD83 as a key player in tissue homeostasis and inflammatory responses, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for inflammatory disorders such as asthma.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health concern due to its poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options, particularly in advanced stages. Tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), plays a key role in tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. TAMs exhibit plasticity, shifting between pro-inflammatory M1 and immunosuppressive M2 phenotypes, with the latter predominating in GC and contributing to poor outcomes. Recent therapeutic advancements focus on targeting TAMs, including inhibiting M2 polarization, reprogramming TAMs to M1 phenotypes, and combining TAM-targeted approaches with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Innovations in nanotechnology, metabolic reprogramming, and targeting key pathways such as interleukin-6 and C-C motif ligand 2/C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 further enhance these strategies. However, challenges remain, including the spatial and functional heterogeneity of TAMs within the TME and the need for selective targeting to avoid disrupting immune homeostasis. Ongoing research on TAM origins, functions, and interactions within the TME is crucial for developing precise and effective therapies. These advances hold promise not only for improving outcomes in GC but also for addressing other cancers with similarly complex microenvironments.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have revolutionized cancer research by offering three-dimensional models that retain the genetic and architectural features of primary tumors. The integration of invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells into PDO platforms presents an innovative approach for studying immune–tumor dynamics and advancing cancer immunotherapy. iNKT cells, known for their ability to modulate immune responses and target tumors, face challenges in suppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs), which limit their therapeutic potential. PDOs provide a physiologically relevant platform to explore strategies to counteract TME-induced immunosuppression, such as modulating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), or tumor metabolism. Additionally, PDOs enable the testing of combination therapies, including iNKT cell-based treatments and immune checkpoint inhibitors, to amplify anti-tumor efficacy. While the integration of iNKT cells with PDOs remains underexplored, ongoing advancements in multi-omics, imaging, and automation technologies promise to enhance this approach, paving the way for personalized cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="In the realm of oncology, the tumor microenvironment (TME)—comprising extracellular matrix components, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells—plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, progression, and response to therapeutic interventions. Initially, the TME exhibits tumor-suppressive properties that can inhibit malignant transformation. However, as the tumor progresses, various factors induce immune tolerance, resulting in TME behaving in a state that promotes tumor growth and metastasis in later stages. This state of immunosuppression is crucial as it enables TME to change from a role of killing tumor cells to a role of promoting tumor progression. Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract with an alarmingly high mortality rate. While chemotherapy has historically been the cornerstone of treatment, its efficacy in prolonging survival remains limited. The emergence of immunotherapy has opened new therapeutic pathways, yet the challenge of immune tolerance driven by the gastric cancer microenvironment complicates these efforts. This review aims to elucidate the intricate role of the TME in mediating immune tolerance in gastric cancer and to spotlight innovative strategies and clinical trials designed to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches. By providing a comprehensive theoretical framework, this review seeks to advance the understanding and application of immunotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were first recognized over twenty years ago as a key immunomodulatory cell population. Since their initial identification, a growing body of literature points to the importance of MDSC as a heterogeneous, immunosuppressive cell population and as a therapeutic target in adults with cancer. MDSC are potent suppressors of T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells and can be helpful or harmful to the host depending on the pathophysiology. For example, MDSC are beneficial in pregnancy and prevent spontaneous abortion by promoting maternal-fetal tolerance. Increased MDSC are also associated with improved outcomes in patients with graft vs. host disease by decreasing T cell-driven inflammation. However, MDSC can also be harmful and are known to be pathologic in adults with cancer and chronic infections by promoting tumor escape and impairing pathogen clearance, respectively. Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of MDSC and their immune suppression effects in adults, much less is known regarding the role of MDSC in children. Research investigating MDSC in children lags significantly behind adult studies. In fact, while over 5,000 publications on PubMed discuss MDSC in immune regulation, fewer than 50 of these publications focus specifically on their role in children. This review aims to summarize the existing literature on the role of MDSC in children and identify important directions for future research, including targeting these cells in the pediatric population to improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Originally identified for its involvement in bone remodeling, accumulating data emerged in the past years indicating that receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) actually acts as a multifunctional soluble molecule that influences various physiological and pathological processes. Regarding its role in carcinogenesis, while direct effects on tumor cell behavior have been precisely characterized, the impact of the RANKL/RANK system (and its inhibition) on the intratumoral immune landscape remains unclear. Methods After various in silico/in situ/in vitro analyses, the immunotherapeutic efficacy of RANKL blockade (alone and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)) or doxorubicin/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy) was investigated using different syngeneic mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (4T1, 67NR and E0771). Isolated from retrieved tumors, 14 immune cell (sub)populations, along with the activation status of antigen-presenting cells, were thoroughly analyzed in each condition. Finally, the impact of RANKL on the functionality of both dendritic cells (DC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) was determined. Results A drastic tumor growth inhibition was reproductively observed following RANKL inhibition. Strikingly, this antitumor activity was not detected in immunocompromised mice, demonstrating its dependence on the adaptive immune responses and justifying the diverse enriched signatures linked to immune cell regulation/differentiation detected in RANKLhigh-expressing human neoplasms. Interestingly, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (but not PD-1 checkpoint inhibition) potentiated the anticancer effects of RANKL blockade by priming effector T cells and increasing their infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we highlighted that RANKL indirectly promotes regulatory T cell differentiation and suppressive function by inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway on antigen-presenting cells. Conclusions Taken together, this study provides insight into the role of RANKL/RANK axis in immune tolerance, demonstrates the significant impact of RANKL-dependent impairment of T cell–DC/pDC crosstalk on tumor development and, ultimately, supports that this ligand could be an interesting actionable target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that poses a severe threat to human health. A variety of highly immunogenic tuberculosis proteins have been used as targets in vaccine development to mitigate the spread of TB. Although Th1-type immunity has long been considered a crucial part of resistance to Mtb, γδ T cells, the predominant source of IL-17, are not negligible in controlling the early stages of TB infection. In addition to classical phosphoantigens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat-resistant antigens (HAg), a complex containing 564 proteins obtained from live tuberculosis bacteria after heat treatment at 121 °C for 20 min, have been confirmed to be highly effective γδ T cell stimulators as well. Several studies have demonstrated that HAg-activated γδ T cells can participate in TB immunity by secreting multiple cytokines against Mtb or by interacting with other innate immune cells. In this review, we present a possible mechanism of HAg stimulation of γδ T cells and the role of HAg-activated γδ T cells in anti-TB immunity. We also highlight the limitations of studies on HAg activation of γδ T cells and suggest further research directions on the relationship between HAg and γδ T cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The occurrence of inflammation subsequent to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with an elevated risk of transplant‐related mortality (TRM). However, the duration of inflammation and the potential efficacy of anti‐inflammatory agents in reducing TRM remain uncertain. We performed a comprehensive investigation to examine the post‐transplantation alterations of inflammatory mediators and to ascertain the correlation between inflammation level and TRM through the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, ELISAs and cytometric bead array. The findings revealed that the 30‐day interval following transplantation is characterised by the most pronounced inflammatory response in both human and murine subjects, thereby elevating the risk of TRM. The inflammation is primarily caused by myeloid bias during haematopoietic reconstitution, which is a commonly overlooked aspect in clinical transplantation, additionally, a lesser extent of irradiation‐induced injury. The administration of the anti‐inflammatory agent resveratrol has the potential to reduce systemic inflammation and TRM by suppressing the NOD‐like receptor signalling pathway and slowing down granulocyte implantation in HSCT mice. This approach did not impair the differentiation potential of haematopoietic stem cells. These findings demonstrate that the 30‐day post‐transplant period represents an opportunity to facilitate HSCT colonisation, mitigate transplant‐related adverse effects, and potentially reap the benefits of anti‐inflammatory treatments.">

        <tr id="Anti-tumor immunity, including innate and adaptive immunity is critical in inhibiting tumorigenesis and development of tumor. The adaptive immunity needs specific lymph organs such as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which are highly correlated with improved survival outcomes in many cancers. In recent years, with increasing attention on the TLS in tumor microenvironment, TLSs have emerged as a novel target for anti-tumor therapy. Excitingly, studies have shown the contribution of TLSs to the adaptive immune responses. However, it is unclear how TLSs to form and how to more effectively defense against tumor through TLS formation. Recent studies have shown that the inflammation plays a critical role in TLS formation. Interestingly, studies have also found that gut microbiota can regulate the occurrence and development of inflammation. Therefore, we here summarize the potential effects of gut microbiota- mediated inflammation or immunosuppression on the TLS formation in tumor environments. Meanwhile, this review also explores how to manipulate mature TLS formation through regulating gut microbiota/metabolites or gut microbiota associated signal pathways for anti-tumor immunity, which potentially lead to a next-generation cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, necessitating innovative treatments. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are primary immunosuppressive effectors that foster tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. They are broadly categorized into proinflammatory M1 and tumor-promoting M2 phenotypes, with elevated M2 infiltration correlating with poor prognosis. Strategies aimed at inhibiting TAM recruitment, depleting TAMs, or reprogramming M2 to M1 are therefore highly promising. Key signaling pathways, such as CSF-1/CSF-1R, IL-4/IL-13–STAT6, TLRs, and CD47-SIRPα, regulate TAM polarization. Additionally, macrophage-based drug delivery systems permit targeted agent transport to hypoxic regions, enhancing therapy. Preclinical studies combining TAM-targeted therapies with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors have yielded improved responses and prolonged survival. Several clinical trials have also reported benefits in previously unresponsive patients. Future work should clarify the roles of macrophage-derived exosomes, cytokines, and additional mediators in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These insights will inform the design of next-generation drug carriers and optimize combination immunotherapies within precision medicine frameworks. Elucidating TAM phenotypes and their regulatory molecules remains central to developing novel strategies that curb tumor progression and ultimately improve outcomes in lung cancer. Importantly, macrophage-based immunomodulation may offer expanded treatment avenues.">

        <tr id="Reprogramming the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) plays an important role in promoting the reversal of immune "cold" tumors into "hot" inflammatory tumors. Improving drug targeting, blocking immune checkpoints, and promoting the activation of immune cells are crucial for reprogramming the TIM. Here, an intercellular adhesion molecule 1-targeted antibody‒drug conjugate in combination with a B7-H3-CD3 bispecific antibody is selected for TIM reprogramming, which improved the efficacy of triple-negative breast cancer immunotherapy. This combination therapy improves drug targeting, blocks immune checkpoint pathways, and activates effector T cells to release cytokines, leading to immunogenic cell death and the release of tumor-associated antigens. This effect promotes the maturation of dendritic cells, infiltration and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, repolarization of M1-type macrophages, and reduction of M2-type macrophages, immune suppressor Tregs, and MDS cells, thereby reprogramming the TIM. In addition, this innovative strategy promotes the accumulation of immune cells at metastasis sites and significantly impedes the progression of lung metastatic lesions. Overall, this study provides novel insights for reprogramming the TIM using novel immunotherapeutic strategies that leverage the synergistic effects of antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has brought hope for patients with cancer and showed promising results and a high cure rate in various types of hematological malignancies. However, cellular therapy can lead to profound immunodeficiency of the innate and adaptive immune systems, whether at the systemic or at the local cellular immune response, which is a major predisposing risk factor for invasive opportunistic infection, including fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogens. The role of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and their antigen specificity in humans remains largely unknown, but Tregs have been implicated in a wide range of modulating viral and fungal infections. Though there have been many advancements regarding the use of CAR T-cells in treating hematological malignancies, the intricate and homeostatic role of Tregs in influencing therapeutic outcomes and infection risk remains underexplored. Most published literature on this topic focuses on the role of Treg in the immunosuppression necessary for successful CAR T-cell therapy rather than the dual function of Treg in immunosuppression and immune recovery. We intend to bridge this gap with a specific focus on the contribution of Tregs in the modulation of CAR T-cell efficacy and their role in opportunistic infections after therapy. In this review, we described the potential role and dynamics of Tregs following CAR T-cell therapy, offering an expanded understanding of their impact on patient outcomes and highlighting areas for future research.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Statins, a class of HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors, exhibit prophylactic benefits against immune rejection induced by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo‐HSCT). Despite the protective function is confirmed, the precise mechanism to induce immune tolerance of statin in the initial stages of transplantation remains incompletely understood. Given that Treg cells play a critical role in preventing graft versus host response and Foxp3 as a transcription factor of Treg can be induced by statins, we hypothesize that the immunosuppressive effects of statins are partially mediated through regulation of Treg cells expansion. Methods T cells were stimulated in vitro under anti‐CD3/anti‐CD28/IL‐2/TGF‐β condition or allo‐reactive system with or without the addition of statins. The induction of Tregs were detected using flow cytometry. Allo‐HSCT models were established by transferring donor cells alone or combined with recipient treated by fluvastatin. The proportions of Treg and phenotypes of effector T cells were identified. Cytokine secretion and antigen‐presenting cell (APC) function were tested in irradiated mice. Results Statins induced higher Treg production in classical and allogeneic cell co‐culture conditions in vitro. In the early stage of models treated with fluvastatin only in donors or combined treatment of donors and recipients, a similar phenomenon was observed with elevated levels of Foxp3+ Treg along with increased expression of CCR7, CD62L, and S1P1 on allo‐reactive T cells. Fluvastatin treatment suppressed the secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines IFN‐γ and TNF‐α by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in irradiated mice. Furthermore, fluvastatin also contributed to restraining the numbers and activation of APCs, including dentritic cells (DCs) and macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Our finding demonstrated that statin exposure modulates immune responses during the initial phase of allo‐HSCT by promoting Treg expansion and suppressing inflammatory reactions, which supply a promising strategy for aGVHD prevention.">

        <tr id="Background Trafficking of immune cells to the central nervous system is hypothesized to facilitate HIV entry and immune-induced neuronal injury and is mediated by surface proteins such as chemokine receptors and α4 integrin. We longitudinally assessed immune cell activation and surface marker expression in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood and their relationship with CSF HIV RNA beginning during primary HIV infection (PHI) before and after antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods Longitudinal paired blood and CSF were obtained in ART-naïve PHI (<12 month since infection) participants; some independently initiated ART during follow up. Multiparameter flow cytometry of fresh samples determined activation (% CD38+HLADR+) and chemokine receptor expression (% CCR5+ and CXCR3+) on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and subtype and α4 integrin expression (% and mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) of CD49d+) on monocytes. HIV RNA was quantified by PCR. Analyses employed Spearman correlation, within-subject correlation, and linear mixed models. Results 51 participants enrolled at a median 3.2 months post HIV transmission with 168 total visits (113 pre-ART, 55 post-ART) and a median of 6.5 months of longitudinal follow up (range 0-40). In pre-ART PHI, frequencies of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were much higher in CSF than in blood, with levels similar to ART-naïve people with chronic HIV infection. Both CSF CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation increased longitudinally prior to initiation of ART. In multivariate analysis, CSF CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell activation independently predicted CSF HIV RNA. Neither CSF monocyte subtypes or α4 expression correlated with CSF HIV RNA. Blood monocyte α4 MFI correlated with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation (p<0.05). Following ART initiation, blood but not CSF T cell activation declined with days on treatment (slope=-0.06, p=0.001). During ART, blood and CSF monocyte α4 MFI correlated with T cell activation (p<0.05). Conclusions In untreated early infection after PHI, immune activation increases over time, and CSF CD4+ T cell activation but not monocyte activation correlates with CSF HIV RNA. Intrathecal T cell activation does not decline during early follow up on ART. Immunomodulating therapies may be needed to prevent neuronal injury and HIV neuroinvasion during early HIV.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The asymptomatic progression of early-stage HCC often results in diagnosis at advanced stages, significantly limiting therapeutic options and worsening prognosis. Immunotherapy, with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) at the forefront, has revolutionized HCC treatment. Nevertheless, tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and the presence of immunosuppressive components within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) continue to compromise its efficacy. Furthermore, resistance or non-responsiveness to ICIs in some patients underscores the urgent need to unravel the complexities of the TIME and to design innovative strategies that enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes. Emerging evidence has revealed the pivotal role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a prominent RNA methylation modification, in shaping the TIME in HCC. By regulating RNA stability and translation, m6A influences immune-related factors, including cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules. This modification governs PD-L1 expression, facilitating immune escape and contributing to resistance against ICIs. Advances in this field have also identified m6A-related regulators as promising biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy response and as potential therapeutic targets for optimizing treatment efficacy. This review examines the regulatory mechanisms of m6A modification within the TIME of HCC, with a focus on its impact on immune cells and cytokine dynamics. It also explores the therapeutic potential of targeting m6A pathways to improve immunotherapy efficacy and outlines emerging directions for future research. These insights aim to provide a foundation for developing novel strategies to overcome immune resistance and advance HCC treatment.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Lung cancer is among the most common and deadliest malignant tumors worldwide. It is often detected at late stages, resulting in unfavorable outcomes, with tumor cell heterogeneity and medication resistance. Tumor‐associated macrophages are among the key cells contributing to cancer progression. They are categorized into two primary phenotypes: Proinflammatory (M1) and anti‐inflammatory (M2) which are involved in the onset and progression of NSCLC. The role of common cytokines secreted by macrophages in the progression of lung cancer are described, and the effects of various substances such as RNA or protein on the differentiation and polarization of two phenotypes of macrophages are highlighted to characterize the impact of the immune state of tumors on therapeutic effect of treatments and patient prognosis. Researchers have primarily aimed to investigate innovative carriers and strategies based on macrophages to modify the tumor microenvironment. Objectives These approaches are often integrated with other treatments, particularly immunotherapy, to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Methods A comprehensive review was carried out by systematically synthesizing existing literature on PubMed, using the combination of the keywords “TAMs”, “NSCLC”, “Drug resistance”, and “therapy”. The available studies were screened for selection based on quality and relevance. Conclusions TAMs promote tumor invasion, growth, and metastasis by promoting angiogenesis and EMT. In addition, they contribute to the development of drug resistance and the immunosuppressive microenvironment establishment. The immunosuppressive factors secreted by TAM can weaken the activity of immune cells, inhibit their killing effect on tumors, leading to immune suppression and hindering the effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, TAM is a key target for the development of cancer immunotherapy. Various strategies are being explored, including reducing the recruitment of TAMs and influencing their polarization to treat NSCLC. In addition, TAMs based treatment systems can achieve precise delivery of drugs or gene interfering molecules without causing side effects.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In the tumor microenvironment (TME), hypoxia stands as a significant factor that modulates immune responses, especially those driven by T cells. As T cell-based therapies often fail to work in solid tumors, this study aims to investigate the effects of hypoxia on T cell topo-distribution in the TME, gene expression association with T cell states, and clinical responses in melanoma.


METHODS
To generate detailed information on tumor oxygenation and T cell accessibility, we used mathematical modeling of human melanoma tissue microarrays that incorporate oxygen supply from vessels, intratumoral diffusion, and cellular uptake. We created tumor maps and derived plots showing the fraction of CD4 and CD8 T cells against the distance to the nearest vessel and oxygen pressure. To assess their function and transcriptional changes caused by hypoxia, effector T cells were generated and cultured under hypoxia (0.5% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen). The T cell hypoxia-transcriptional signature was compared against datasets from msigDB, iATLAS (clinical trials of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)), ORIEN AVATAR (real-world melanoma patients treated with ICIs), and a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.


RESULTS
We made three specific observations: (1) in melanoma T cells preferentially accumulated in oxygenated areas close to blood vessels (50-100 µm from the vasculature in the regions of high oxygen availability) but not in hypoxic areas far from blood vessels. (2) Our analysis confirmed that under hypoxia, T cell functions were significantly reduced compared with normoxic conditions and accompanied by a unique gene signature. Furthermore, this hypoxic gene signature was prevalent in resting and non-activated T cells. Notably and clinically relevant, the hypoxic T cell gene set was found to correlate with reduced overall survival and reduced progression-free survival in melanoma patients, which was more pronounced in non-responder patients undergoing ICI therapy. (3) Finally, compared with a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating T cells, our hypoxia signature aligned with a population of cells at a state termed stress response state (TSTR).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study highlights the critical role of hypoxia in shaping T cell distribution and its correlation with clinical outcomes in melanoma. We revealed a preferential accumulation of T cells in oxygenated areas. Moreover, hypoxic T cells develop a distinct hypoxic gene signature prevalent in resting, non-activated T cells and TSTR that was also associated with poorer outcomes, particularly pronounced among non-responders to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cells crucial for fighting infections, exhibit both tumor-promoting and tumor-inhibiting roles in cancer. This dual behavior depends on the environment around the tumor and includes remodeling the extracellular matrix, fostering angiogenesis, inducing cancer cell death, and enhancing immune responses. A notable yet underexplored phenomenon is the engulfment of neutrophils by cancer cells, potentially mediated by LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). This process raises critical questions about its role in either aiding immune evasion or triggering cancer cell death through mechanisms such as ferroptosis. This review delves into neutrophil biology, their complex roles in cancer, the impact of LAP on neutrophil engulfment, and the therapeutic implications of modulating this pathway. Additionally, it highlights the potential of neutrophils as delivery systems for cancer therapies, underscoring the need to unravel tumor-associated neutrophil functions and LAP mechanisms to inform novel and effective cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors contains myeloid cells that modulate local immune activity. STING signaling activation in these myeloid cells enhances local type I interferon (IFN) production, inducing an innate immune response that mobilizes adaptive immunity and reprograms immunosuppressive myeloid populations to drive antitumor immunity. Here, we generated TAK-500, an immune cell directed antibody drug conjugate (iADC), to deliver a STING agonist to CCR2+ human cells and drive enhanced antitumor activity relative to non-targeted STING agonists. Preclinically, TAK-500 triggered dose-dependent innate immune activation in vitro. In addition, a murine TAK-500 iADC surrogate enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses both in vitro and in murine tumor models. Spatially resolved analysis of CCR2 and immune cell markers in the TME of >1,000 primary human tumors showed the CCR2 protein was predominantly expressed in intratumoral myeloid cells. Collectively, these data highlight the clinical potential of delivering a STING agonist to CCR2+ cells.">

        <tr id="Introduction. Immune memory is a tool of the adaptive immune system that allows it responding quickly and effectively to repeated contact with an antigen. The role of memory cell populations in the recurrence and progression of immune-dependent diseases is shown. 
Aim. To determine the trend in memory T-cell populations depending on the effectiveness of biological therapy (BT) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis (PS). 
Materials and methods. Four hundred fifty children with immunosuppressive diseases (ISD) were examined during different periods of administration of biological drugs: IBD — 162 children (infliximab /adalimumab), MS — 116 children (interferon β1α — IFNβ1α), PS — 172 children (adalimumab). The effectiveness of BT was assessed using clinical activity indices and functional methods. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry to determine populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell: central (TCM), effector (TEM), and terminally differentiated (TEMRA). Statistical data processing was carried out in the Statistica 16.0 program, using the Mann–Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation analysis (p < 0.05). In the SPSS version 25 software, ROC analysis was performed in the efficiency–inefficiency separation model. 
Results. In all forms of pathology, changes in the content of memory T-cells have been established depending on the activity of inflammation. In IBD and PS patients, with an increase in the indices of disease activity, a decrease in the levels of CD4+ naive T-cells (TNAIVE) and an increase of TCM were detected. In MS patients with active foci, an MRI scan showed a decrease in the percentage of naive CD8+ T-cells (TcytNAIVE) and an increase in the population of CD8+ TEM. The content of TNAIVE populations decreased with age, and memory T-cells increased in patients with all the studied forms of pathology. In patients with BT efficacy, a high content of TNAIVE populations and a low content of TCM were found compared with the levels in patients with insufficient BT efficacy. Thresholds have been determined for IBD, MS, and PS patients, which make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT. An increase in the levels of TNAIVE and TcytNAIVE makes it possible to predict the presence of a BT effect, an increase in the levels of TCM, CD4+ TEM, and CD8+ ТEMRA make it possible to predict the absence or insufficient effect of BT. 
Conclusion. The activity of the inflammatory process is reflected in the differentiation of populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells. With the effectiveness of BT, the number of TNAIVE increases with a decrease in the number of TCM and TEM in patients with immune-dependent diseases, regardless of the form of pathology and the drug used. Threshold values for memory T-cells populations make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT.">

        <tr id="Background The generation of functionally active, stable T regulatory cells (Tregs) is a crucial target of type 1 diabetes (T1D) immunotherapy. This study investigated therapeutic intervention for T1D/Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), wherein the diabetogenic proinflammatory Treg (intermediate) cell subset was characterized and driven to a Treg phenotype (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+). This involved simultaneous inhibition of the eukaryotic initiation factor 5a (eIF5a) and Notch pathways using GC7 (N1-Guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane) and Anti-DLL4 (Delta-like-ligand-4). Methods Peripheral blood from patients with T1D/LADA and healthy adults (n=7 each) was used to isolate the CD4+CD25− T cell population and CD4 deficient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cells were subjected to GAD65+GC7+anti-DLL4 treatment for seven days and compared with conventional anti-CD3/CD28/CD137 stimulation for conversion into the Tregs. Newly plasticized Tregs were assessed for their suppressive potential against freshly isolated autologous T responder cells. In addition, live, dead, and apoptotic cell counts were performed to evaluate the adverse effects of immunomodulatory treatment on immune cells. The data was analyzed with GraphPad Prism using 1- or 2-way ANOVA and a Student’s t-test. Results A unique population of proinflammatory cytokines expressing intermediate Tregs (CD4+CD25−IFNg+IL17+FOXP3+) was characterized in T1D/LADA patients and found significantly increased compared to age-matched healthy adults. Simultaneous inhibition of eIF5a and Notch pathways could induce Treg phenotype in Treg-deficient CD4+ T cells and CD4 deficient PBMCs from T1D/LADA patients. GAD65+GC7+anti-DLL4 treatment plasticized Tregs withstanding a proinflammatory milieu mimicking T1D/LADA, and the plasticized Tregs exhibited a stable and suppressive functional phenotype. Furthermore, GAD65+GC7+anti-DLL4 treatment had no adverse effects on immune cells. The present approach is a multipronged approach involving the inhibition of eIF5a and Notch pathways that addresses the upregulation of immune tolerance, differentiation, and proliferation of cytotoxic T cells and alleviates β-cell dysfunction. Additionally, this treatment strategy could also be leveraged to boost Treg generation following islet transplantation or as a combinational therapy along with adoptive cell transfer.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), characterized by malignant T-cell proliferation primarily in the skin, includes subtypes such as mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS). The tumor microenvironment (TME) is central to their pathogenesis, with flow cytometry and histology being the gold standards for detecting malignant T cells within the TME. Alongside emerging molecular markers, particularly clonality analysis, these tools are indispensable for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Of note, adenosine signaling within the TME has been shown to suppress immune responses, affecting various cell types. The expression of CD39, CD73, and CD38, enzymes involved in adenosine production, can be elevated in MF and SS, contributing to immune suppression. Conversely, the expression of CD26, part of the adenosine deaminase/CD26 complex, that degrades adenosine, is often lost by circulating tumoral cells. Flow cytometry has demonstrated increased levels of CD39 and CD73 on Sézary cells, correlating with disease progression and prognosis, while CD38 shows a variable expression, with its prognostic significance remaining under investigation. Understanding these markers’ roles in the complexity of TME-mediated immune evasion mechanisms might enhance diagnostic precision and offer new therapeutic targets in CTCL.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background There is a need for noninvasive immunological biomarkers that can identify stable kidney allograft immune quiescence to inform individualized immunosuppression. Methods We conducted a cross‐sectional, pilot cohort study evaluating the relative abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to effector T‐cell (Teff) populations as a surrogate marker of long‐term graft tolerance. We obtained fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients, most with recent surveillance biopsies to identify the presence or absence of chronic inflammation. Tregs were sub‐phenotyped as naïve, memory, and activated Tregs (aTreg). Treg/Teff ratios were modeled for association with chronic inflammation and in the context of potential clinical features. Results Twenty‐seven patient samples were included on standard immunosuppression (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) with a mean age of 9.2 ± 5.0 years, at 30.2 ± 21.7 months posttransplant. The ratio of aTreg (FOXP3++CD45RA−) to Th17 cells (CD4+IL‐17+) was significantly greater in patients without inflammation than in patients with graft inflammation (p < 0.01). Similarly, there was a trend toward greater aTreg/CD4+ T cells and aTreg/CD8+ Teff in patients without inflammation (p = 0.05 and 0.09, respectively). There was no significant association for inflammation with naïve or memory Treg/Teff ratios. Multiple logistic regression with all three aTreg/Teff ratios modeled allograft inflammation with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–0.98). Conclusions The proportion of peripheral blood aTregs/Teff cells in this pilot cohort of stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients was associated with immune quiescence. These data support further investigation into aTreg/Teff monitoring to inform precision immunosuppressive treatment.">

Phorbol‐12‐myristate‐13‐acetate (PMA) stimulated neutrophils to facilitate NETs formation and combined with NETs inhibitor DNase I to explore NETs mechanism on LLC cell proliferation, migration, ferroptosis resistance, and CD8(+) T cell activity. CitH3, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cell‐free DNA, and MPO‐DNA levels in LUAD were increased, indicating an increase in NETs formation in LUAD. PMA promoted NETs formation in tumours of mice, increased the number of CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells, decreased perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B, IFNγ, and TNF‐α levels, and promoted LUAD growth and the number of lung tumour nodules, indicating that PMA promoted NETs formation, reduced the activity of CD8(+)T cells, and promoted LUAD growth. DNase I partially reversed the effects of PMA. NETs promoted LLC cell proliferation and migration, while DNase I reversed NETs effects. Erastin inhibited LLC cell proliferation and migration and promoted ferroptosis. NETs partially reversed Erastin effects. Further results showed that NETs promoted LLC cell proliferation and migration and inhibited ferroptosis by promoting YTHDF2‐mediated SLC2A3 mRNA degradation. Sh‐YTHDF2 partially reversed the effect of NETs on LLC cells, whereas si‐SLC2A3 partially reversed sh‐YTHDF2 effects on LLC cells. In addition, NETs inhibited LLC cell ferroptosis by inhibiting CD8(+) T cell activity. Sh‐YTHDF2 and DNase I inhibited NETs formation in tumours, increased the activity of CD8(+) T cells and inhibited LUAD growth. Our results suggested that NETs promoted the growth of LUAD through inhibiting ferroptosis and CD8(+) T cell activity by promoting YTHDF2‐mediated SLC2A3 mRNA degradation.">

While it is plausible that HIV-induced immunosuppression could result in a more severe progression, the exact mechanisms remain undetermined. To better understand the immunopathology of MPXV in patients with and without HIV infection, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from six patients hospitalized for MPXV, three of whom had HIV infection (HIV antibody positive and HIV RNA level below the detection limit), and three patients only infected with MPXV (HIV-). We map the peripheral immune response in both the acute phase and the recovery period, showing the reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotypes in acute stage compared with recovery stage, characterized by disturbed cell subsets and intense cell interactions mediated by monocytes and neutrophils. Importantly, we also found obviously dysregulated gene expression and cell subsets in HIV+ patients proposing mechanism underlying their serious condition. Our findings provide a comprehensive cell atlas of MPXV patients, shed light on the mechanisms underlying the severe disease progression and longer recovery time in HIV+ individuals.">

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone cancer. 30-40% of all OS patients develop tumor recurrence, almost exclusively in the form of lung metastasis, which is associated with a dismal 20% 5-year survival rate. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are a critical cell type within the lung TME, which promote immune suppression, drug resistance, and tumor cell survival. Prior work shows tumor cells can co-opt fibroblasts to a pro-tumorigenic phenotype via exosome mediated intercellular communication. Currently, the mechanisms by which OS exosomes modulate resident lung fibroblast function has not been evaluated. To investigate this, we isolated exosomes from a panel of 6 OS cell lines. We assessed the uptake and response of human donor-derived primary lung fibroblasts (LF's; n=4) to OS exosome treatment in vitro via flow cytometry, confocal fluorescent microscopy, proliferation assays, phospho-kinase array, multiplex cytokine analysis and RNA-sequencing. We observed that LFs efficiently take up OS exosomes, which is associated with induction of MAPK pathway activation, fibroblast proliferation and significantly enhanced secretion of IL-6, CXCL8 and CCL2 compared to untreated LFs. RNA-seq of exosome treated LFs confirmed these responses and revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to cytokine secretion, proliferation, immune cell chemotaxis, migration, proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators. Finally, in an exosome-educated lung fibroblast-OS co-culture model, exosome educated LFs conferred significantly increased OS cell survival and proliferation as compared to untreated fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest OS-derived exosomes can induce a hallmark, CAF-like inflammatory phenotype in lung fibroblasts providing valuable insights into mechanisms that may promote recurrent OS lung metastasis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Due to their enhanced responsiveness and persistence, cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML)-natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as new immunotherapeutic tools against malignancies. However, their effects on tumor-cell spread and metastases in solid tumors remain poorly investigated. Moreover, a clear identification of the most effective CIML-NK subsets, especially in controlling cancer stem cells (CSC), is still lacking. Methods We performed combined phenotypical and functional analyses of CIML-NK cell subsets, either selected by flow-cytometry gating, or generated from sorted CD56bright/CD56dim NK cells. By co-culture experiments, we analyzed the effect of CIML-NK cells on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell spheroids, or patient-derived xenografts (PDX), assessing changes in their CSC content, tumorigenicity, and/or tumor disseminating capability in vivo. CIML-NK cells were also infused in PDX-bearing mice to validate their effect on the CSC dissemination from the PDX to the lungs. Finally, we generated and functionally analyzed CIML-NK cells from patients with stages I/III NSCLC (n=6). Results We show that CIML-NK cells exert antitumor activity mostly through their CD56bright cell subset, which greatly expands during CIML differentiation. Compared with NK cells conventionally activated with interleukin-2, CIML-NK cells express lower levels of check-point receptors, TIGIT and TIM3, and higher effector functions against NSCLC cells from PDX, and against in vitro-generated tumor spheroids. Remarkably, CIML-NK cells also significantly reduce the CSC-containing CD133+ cell subpopulation within spheroids and PDX, and limit tumor cell tumorigenicity and ability to disseminate CSCs from primary tumors to distant sites. Sorting experiments on CIML or tumor cell subsets reveal that CD56bright cells drive most of this anti-CSC activity, and suggest that such functional advantage could be related to increased expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 on CD56bright cells and CSCs, respectively. We also show that the tri-specific killer cell engager (TriKE) 1615133 significantly enhances CIML-NK cell activity against CSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that CIML-NK cells, capable of killing autologous tumor cells and responding to the 1615133 TriKE, could be induced from patients with NSCLC. Conclusions Our study discloses for the first time the therapeutic potential of CIML-NK cells in controlling CSCs and metastatic spread, highlighting the role of the CD56bright subset expansion and 1615133 TriKE for optimizing CIML-NK-based therapies against metastatic tumors.">

While the prior represents about 5% of all CRCs, the latter represent 95% and are characterized by low immunogenicity. This study investigates bis-diethyldithiocarbamate (CuET), a novel anticancer compound, and its impact on the colorectal cancer tumor microenvironment (TME). CuET is shown to convert immunologically inactive tumors into hotbeds of antitumor immune responses, marked by increased lymphocyte infiltration, heightened cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) and T cells, and enhanced non-self recognition by lymphocytes. The potent anticancer cytotoxicity and in vivo safety and efficacy of CuET are established. In summary, CuET transforms the colorectal cancer TME, bolstering NK and T cell cytotoxicity and refining tumor cell recognition through non-classical activation via the NKG2D/NKG2DL axis. This study unveils a novel mechanism of action for CuET: a potent immunomodulator capable of turning cold tumors hot.">

        <tr id="Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is broadly produced by various cell types, particularly immune cells, and functions as a key modulator of innate and adaptive immunity. Increasing evidence has linked MIF to the pathogenesis of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We previously showed that the global deletion of Mif in the TCL1 transgenic mouse model for CLL significantly delayed disease development leading to longer overall survival of the knockout mice. In this study, we demonstrated that adaptive transfer of murine CLL cells failed to establish disease in Mif-deficient recipients due to impaired homing of leukemic cells into the spleens, indicating that host-derived Mif is essential for leukemic infiltration and expansion. To identify the most relevant source of Mif in CLL, we generated two CLL mouse strains with B-lymphoid- or myeloid-lineage-specific Mif deletion. In contrast to the global Mif knockout, neither conditional Mif knockout significantly altered CLL progression, illustrating that the cellular source of Mif is less critical than its systemic presence in the tissue environment. Taken together, these in vivo findings indicate that MIF plays a relevant role in CLL pathogenesis, acting independently of its specific cellular origin.

HIF-1α-mediated tumor hypoxia drives angiogenesis, immune suppression, and extracellular matrix remodeling, creating an environment that promotes tumor progression and resistance to immunotherapies. HIF-1α regulates critical pathways, including the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and immune checkpoint upregulation, leading to tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte dysfunction and recruitment of immunosuppressive cells like regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These alterations reduce the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies. Recent studies highlight therapeutic strategies that target HIF-1α, such as the use of pharmacological inhibitors, gene editing techniques, and hypoxia-modulating treatments, which show promise in enhancing responses to immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Tumors employ a range of strategies to evade detection and eradication by the host’s immune system. These include downregulating antigen expression, altering antigen presentation processes, and inhibiting immune checkpoint pathways. etc. Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) represents a strategy that boosts anti-tumor immunity. This is achieved by amplifying or genetically engineering immune cells, which are either sourced from the patient or a donor, in a laboratory setting. Subsequently, these cells are reintroduced into the patient to bolster their immune response against cancer. ACT has successfully restored anti-tumor immune responses by amplifying the activity of T cells from patients or donors. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying tumor escape, including alterations in tumor cell antigens, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and modulation of immune checkpoint pathways. It further explores how ACT can avddress these factors to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, the review discusses the application of gene-editing technologies (such as CRISPR) in ACT, highlighting their potential to strengthen the anti-tumor capabilities of T cells. Looking forward, the personalized design of ACT, combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, is expected to significantly improve treatment outcomes, positioning this approach as a key strategy in the field of cancer immunotherapy.">

Although PMCs are known to exert multiple immune functions, their role in pleurisy remains unclear. Methods Pleurisy model was induced by intrapleural injection of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) into wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. The pleural cavity was washed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to get the immune cells. Flow cytometry was performed to identify the characteristics of the target cells. Results We found that IFN-γ prompts PMCs to act a summon role for the recruitment of inflammatory cells in pleurisy model. Our data showed that CD4+ T cells were the main producer of IFN-γ in the pleurisy model, and IFN-γ stimulated PMCs to recruit immune cells into the pleural cavity through the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis. In addition, IFN-γ can reshape PMCs to display macrophage-like polarization. These results revealed some new immune roles of PMCs in pleurisy.

        <tr id="Stem cells are highly resistant to viral infection compared to their differentiated progeny, and this resistance is associated with stem cell-specific restriction factors and intrinsic interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). In HIV infection, proviral DNA has been detected in certain bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells, yet widespread stem cell infection in vivo is restricted. Intriguingly, exposing bone marrow stem cells to HIV in vitro led to viral replication selectively only in the CD34- population, but not in the CD34+ cells. The mechanism dictating this CD34-based HIV restriction remained a mystery, especially since HIV has a capacity to antagonize restriction factors and ISGs. CD34 is a common marker of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Here, we report the intrinsic antiviral properties of CD34. Expression of CD34 in HIV-1 producer cells results in the loss of progeny virion infectivity. Conversely, removal of CD34 using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or stem cell differentiation cytokines promotes HIV-1 replication in stem cells. These results suggest that in addition to restriction factors and intrinsic ISGs, CD34 serves as a host innate protection preventing retrovirus replication in stem cells. Mechanistically, CD34 does not block viral entry, integration, and release. Instead, it becomes incorporated onto progeny virions, which inactivates virus infectivity. These findings offer new insights into innate immunity in stem cells, and highlight intriguing retrovirus-host interactions in evolution.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by an extremely poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Central to the progression and immune evasion of PDAC is the tumor (immune) microenvironment (TIME), where immune checkpoint proteins such as galectin-9 (Gal-9) play pivotal roles. Gal-9 significantly contributes to the immunosuppressive milieu of PDAC by interacting with various immune cells, such as T cells, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These interactions suppress anti-tumor immunity, thus facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. This review comprehensively examines the multifaceted role of Gal-9 in the TIME of PDAC, detailing its mechanisms of action, including the induction of regulatory T cells, polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, and modulation of apoptotic pathways via Tim-3 and caspase activation. The therapeutic potential of targeting Gal-9, either alone or in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-L1, is also discussed, highlighting preclinical findings that suggest promising avenues for enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. By elucidating the complex biological activities of Gal-9 and its interactions within the TIME, this review underscores the importance of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the immunosuppressive effects of Gal-9 in PDAC.">

        <tr id="The activation and infiltration of immune cells are hallmarks of ischemic stroke. However, the precise origins and the molecular alterations of these infiltrating cells post-stroke remain poorly characterized. Here, a murine model of stroke (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion [p-MCAO]) is utilized to profile single-cell transcriptomes of immune cells in the brain and their potential origins, including the calvarial bone marrow (CBM), femur bone marrow (FBM), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This analysis reveals transcriptomically distinct populations of cerebral myeloid cells and brain-resident immune cells after stroke. These include a novel CD14+ neutrophil subpopulation that transcriptomically resembles CBM neutrophils. Moreover, the sequential activation of transcription factor regulatory networks in neutrophils during stroke progression is delineated, many of which are unique to the CD14+ population and underlie their acquisition of chemotaxis and granule release capacities. Two distinct origins of post-stroke disease-related immune cell subtypes are also identified: disease inflammatory macrophages, likely deriving from circulating monocytes in the skull, and transcriptionally immature disease-associated microglia, possibly arising from pre-existing homeostatic microglia. Together, a comprehensive molecular survey of post-stroke immune responses is performed, encompassing both local and distant bone marrow sites and peripheral blood.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy have been successful in treating select solid and blood borne cancers. However, ICIs and CAR-T have failed to yield benefit in glioblastoma (GBM) across multiple randomized trials. The major obstacles in ICI and CAR-T stem from the complex, immunosuppressive microenvironment, brain barrier penetrance, and systemic leukopenia inherent to GBM. ICIs and CAR-T therapy bolster the immune response by mitigating tumor-cell induced exhaustion through blocking critical checkpoint pathways and equipping cytotoxic T-cells with targetable tumor-specific proteins, respectively. This review highlights the clinical trials done using ICI and CAR-T therapy and the significant challenges that GBM and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TIME) pose for future strategies. Overcoming GBM’s profound immunosuppression may lie within the abundant myeloid-derived cell population in the microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives: This study explores the immunological landscapes of non-melanoma skin neoplasms (NMSNs), specifically keratoacanthoma (KA), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and common warts (VV). Although benign, KA shares histological similarities with low-grade SCC. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a key role in tumor progression, affecting angiogenesis, inflammation, and immune evasion. Viral infections, particularly human papillomavirus (HPV), are linked to NMSN development, with various HPV types identified in KA. VV, caused by HPV, serves as a comparative model due to its similar etiopathogenesis. Materials and Methods: This research examines the expression of CTLA4, a critical regulator of T-cell homeostasis, and IFN-γ, a cytokine with immunomodulatory and antiviral effects, in the TME of 41 KA, 37 SCC, and 55 VV samples using multichannel immunofluorescence. Results: The analysis revealed distinct patterns of CTLA4 and IFN-γ expression. SCC exhibited a higher prevalence of CTLA4+IFN-γ+ double-positive lymphocytes, suggesting a more immunosuppressive TME. In contrast, VV showed the highest expression of CTLA4+ cells, while both KA and VV had lower expressions of IFN-γ+ lymphocytes compared to SCC. The increased presence of CTLA4+IFN-γ+ double-positive lymphocytes in SCC suggests that the co-expression of these markers may exert a stronger effect on TME modulation than CTLA4 alone. Conclusions: These findings underscore the potential of immune profiling as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions, such as KA and SCC. Furthermore, the presence of CTLA4+IFN-γ+ lymphocytes, particularly in SCC, may serve as a biomarker for tumor progression and a potential target for future immunotherapy strategies aimed at modulating the immune response in NMSN.">

        <tr id="Understanding both local and systemic immunity is essential to optimizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the dynamic alterations in systemic immunity during tumor development are yet to be clearly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized connection that bridges the interaction between the spleen and tumor through erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), which suppress tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. We performed the single-cell RNA-seq and RNA-seq to demonstrate the presence of EPCs and identify the characteristic and an immunomodulatory role of EPCs during tumor progression. These tumor-hijacked EPCs proliferate in situ in spleens and impaired systemic and local antitumor response through the interaction between tumor and spleen. Specifically, the splenic CD45- EPCs secreted heparin-binding growth factor to regulate PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression of splenic CD45+ EPCs. Educated CD45+ EPCs from the spleen then migrated to the tumors via the CCL5/CCR5 axis, thereby weakening local antitumor immunity. Consequently, targeting EPCs not only revitalized antitumor immunity but also improved the anti-PD-L1 effect by promoting intratumoral T cell infiltration. Importantly, CD45+ EPCs are associated with immunosuppression and reduced survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal the role of EPCs in orchestrating the interaction between the spleen and tumor, which could have significant implications for the development of more effective cancer immunotherapy.">

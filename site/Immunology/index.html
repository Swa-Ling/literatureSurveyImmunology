        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Preserving barrier integrity is of great importance in mucosal tissues while simultaneously defending against inflammatory threats and exposures to pathogens. NK cells at barrier sites are essential for viral control during infections such as herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) but must also balance pathogen response with tissue protection. We have characterized human tissue NK cells in the vaginal tissue (VT) as having distinct effector and tissue protective functions. Using scRNA-seq and high- parameter flow cytometry, we uncovered a unique signature for VT NK cells, indicating a reduced effector phenotype with increased factors related to tissue residency and immunoregulation at steady state. Despite their functionally quiescent nature, these cells were able to respond robustly to inflammatory signals, suggesting they are poised for pathogen response. We found that the gene signatures between mouse and human NK cells were remarkably similar, demonstrating the feasibility of using a mouse model to probe distinct NK cell functions during mucosal infection. In mice, VT NK cells responded robustly to acute HSV-2 infection and retained an enhanced recall potential after viral clearance. They also secreted tissue repair factors and played a role in restricting tissue damage following viral infection. Our data, using both human tissues and a mouse model, reveal an unexpected role of mucosal tissue NK cells in the VT in balancing host protection with tissue repair in the context of localized mucosal tissue infection.">

        <tr id="Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a prevalent condition whose recurrence leads to multiple adverse effects. Previous studies on INS pathogenesis primarily focused on immune dysregulation, particularly T-cell changes and their correlation with cytokine shifts. Accumulating evidence suggests that B-cell dysfunction also plays a role. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and effective treatment strategies remains incomplete. Methods This study investigates changes in gene expressions and cellular interactions of immune cells at a single-cell level using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). And subsequently validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry. Results We identified seven main clusters using unsupervised clustering of 103,213 high-quality single cells. Through unsupervised clustering, patient-specific T cells (IFI44L + CD4 + T cells) that exhibited a pronounced elevation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is identified. Activation of ISGs and interferon (IFN)-related pathways are also observed in other clusters. Specifically, this study demonstrates that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role by promoting the interaction between B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and receptors on B cells. This interaction triggers the release of autoantibodies, thereby initiating INS pathogenesis. Furthermore, telitacicept has shown efficacy in treating pediatric patients with frequent relapse NS(FRNS).

        <tr id="Background. Immunotherapy is efficacious in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the benefits are limited to a minority of patients. Most HCC patients show resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Agonists of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), potent immune stimulators, showed limited effectiveness. Using preclinical models, we studied the mechanisms of resistance to ICB and STING agonism. Methods. Murine HCA-1 and RIL-175 HCCs were orthotopically grown in mice with underlying liver fibrosis, to mimic the presentation of human HCC. Established tumors were treated with a STING agonist (BMS-986301) or anti-PD1 ICB, and mice were followed to evaluate safety and efficacy, as well as the mechanisms of treatment resistance by RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence, B-cell depletion and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) ICB. Results. Unbiased analyses of transcriptomic data from murine HCC tissues from ICB-treated mice showed an increased abundance of intratumoral CD8+ T cells and B cells. STING agonism alone showed efficacy in the ICB-responsive RIL-175 HCC model but more limited efficacy in the ICB-resistant HCA-1 model. STING agonism increased circulating IL-10 and intratumoral infiltration by B-cells, including TIM-1+ B cells, and promoted the formation of tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS)-like structures, especially in the peritumoral areas. Strikingly, adding B cell depletion to ICB or STING agonism treatment significantly increased survival. Interestingly, unlike ICB, STING agonism also had a pronounced anti-metastatic activity. In addition, the combination of STING agonism and TIM-1 blockade augmented B cell differentiation and antigen presentation in vitro and improved the anti-tumor effects in murine HCC in vivo. This approach decreased the number of TIM-1+ B cells in the tumor and shifted B cells to higher expression of CD86 and MHC class II, enhancing the antigen presentation capability and further boosting the antitumor efficacy of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that B cells are associated with ICB- and STING-mediated therapy resistance, and that depleting B-cells or targeting TIM-1 enhances both innate and acquired therapeutic efficacy in HCC.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV treated during acute infection are the group for whom achieving functional cure appears most viable. Follicular CD8+ T cells could contribute to HIV reservoir clearance by accessing B cell follicles through CXCR5 expression. This study examines peripheral follicular CD8+ T cells using flow cytometry, transcriptome analyses, and functional assays in people treated during acute (n = 37) and chronic (n = 18) infection, as well as in individuals naturally controlling HIV (n = 20) and living without HIV (n = 10). Our results reveal that early, as opposed to late, treatment initiation preserves antiviral effector functions of follicular CD8+ T cells, which are further enhanced by PD1 inhibition. We also identify a correlation between follicular CD8+ T cells and intact proviral HIV DNA levels in acute, but not chronic, infection. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of peripheral effector cells after 48 weeks of suppressive therapy indicated traits of recent antigen exposure, suggesting potential recirculation into lymphoid tissue. These findings underscore the pivotal role of follicular CD8+ T cells in anti-HIV responses and support investigating targeted cure strategies, such as anti-PD1 therapy, especially in individuals initiating treatment during acute infection.">

        <tr id="Cellular immune responses are crucial in determining outcomes of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Ineffective immune responses enable persistent HBV infection and contribute to progressive liver disease. Understanding the mechanisms underlying immunological HBV tolerance and restoring functional adaptive immune responses is essential for successful chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment. This study examined the dysregulated immune responses and immunopathological cell states associated with CHB using single‐cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to investigate immune cell composition and transcriptional differences between patients with CHB and healthy donors. Phenotypic alterations in the lymphoid and myeloid compartments were observed following HBV infection. T cell immune profiling in patients with CHB showed enrichment of exhausted CD8+ T cells, impaired cytotoxicity of effector CD8+ T cells, and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) suppressive activity. Immature neutrophils and a unique CD14+ monocyte subset (myeloid‐derived suppressor cells) exhibited potent immunosuppressive abilities. A novel population of CD14+CD163+VSIG4+ M2‐like macrophages with immunosuppressive and anti‐inflammatory phenotypes was enriched in a patient with severe CHB and liver failure, indicating a potential contribution to dysfunctional immune responses. Our study demonstrated immune exhaustion and evasion in chronic HBV infection, elucidating its immunopathological features and suggesting new therapeutic strategies for immune‐mediated disorders and unresolved chronic HBV infection.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8+ T cells are pivotal for long-term anti-tumor immunity due to their longevity and rapid response upon encountering tumor cells. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a member of the Ste20 family of kinases, restricts proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and plays critical roles in T cell priming and activation. However, the impact of HPK1 on CD8+ T cell differentiation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells derived from patients lacking HPK1 exhibit a stronger memory phenotype. HPK1 deletion promotes the formation of precursor and central memory CD8+ T cells, resulting in superior and long-lasting antitumor activity in murine cancer models compared to WT mice. Additionally, HPK1 knockout induces metabolic reprogramming by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial respiration complex activity. Mechanistically, HPK1 deletion downregulates mTOR signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of mTOR and S6. Increased mitophagy activity is observed in HPK1-depleted cells, with upregulation of key mitophagy regulators, including Pink1 and Bnip3l, maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Our study reveals that HPK1 regulates CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming, guiding cell differentiation and antitumor responses.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer cells must evade immune surveillance to metastasize to distant sites, yet this process is not well understood. The Eyes absent (EYA) family of proteins, which are crucial for embryonic development, become dysregulated in cancer, where they have been shown to mediate proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our study reveals an unusual mechanism by which EYA3 reduces the presence of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells in the premetastatic niche (PMN) to enhance metastasis, independent of its effects on the primary tumor. We find that EYA3 up-regulates nuclear factor κB signaling to enhance CCL2 expression, which, in contrast to previous findings, suppresses cytotoxic NK cell activation in vitro and their infiltration into the PMN in vivo. These findings uncover an unexpected role for CCL2 in inhibiting NK cell responses at the PMN and suggest that targeting EYA3 could be an effective strategy to reactivate antitumor immune responses to inhibit metastasis.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. The lack of ICIs efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of tumor-reprogrammed glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs) that create a “cold” immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), impeding the infiltration and activation of effector T cells. GBM-derived αvβ3/αvβ5-integrin ligands, including SPP1, were shown to mediate the emergence of GAMs. We hypothesized that a combination strategy aiming to block the reprogramming of GAMs using a synthetic 7aaRGD peptide that targets SPP1/integrin signaling might overcome resistance to ICIs and reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. Methods Matrigel invasion assay was used to test the efficacy of 7aaRGD in glioma-microglia co-cultures. We determined the impact of 7aaRGD, administered as a monotherapy or combined with PD-1 blockade, on tumor growth, GAMs accumulation and phenotypes, arginase-1 levels and neovasculature in experimental gliomas. The effects of treatments on the tumor immune landscape were dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, cytokine profiling and RNA-seq analysis of sorted GAMs followed by CITE-seq based data deconvolution. Results 7aaRGD efficiently blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in vitro. Intratumorally delivered 7aaRGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in orthotopic gliomas but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive GAMs and led to normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining 7aaRGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, with an increase in the number of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depletion of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, reflecting the restored “hot” inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. Intratumoral administration of 7aaRGD similarly modified the phenotypes of GAMs in human U87-MG gliomas in immunocompromised mice. Exploration of transcriptomic datasets revealed that high expression of integrin receptor coding genes in pre-treatment biopsies was associated with a poorer response to immune check-point blockade in patients with several types of cancers. Conclusions We demonstrate that combining the blockade of SPP1/integrin signaling with ICIs modifies innate immunity and reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses, which paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.

        <tr id="Background Myocarditis is a common inflammatory heart disease in children and young adults, with fulminant myocarditis (FM) being the most severe form due to its rapid onset and high mortality rate. However, the precise pathological immune subsets and molecular change in myocarditis, particularly FM, remain unknown. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of pediatric peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the acute and recovery phases of FM. A viral myocarditis (MC) mouse model was established using CVB3. Deletion and adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells, as well as blockade of CXCR4, were conducted in vivo. CD8+T cells were sorted and cultivated in vitro, then stimulated with CXCL12 and CXCR4 antagonists to investigate the mechanism of CD8+T cell overactivation. Results CD8+T cells show significant activation, amplification, enhanced cytotoxicity, and increased chemotactic ability in FM. Deletion of CD8+T cells alleviates myocardial injury and improves cardiac function in MC mice, while adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells from MC mice aggravates myocardial inflammation and injury. The transcriptomic analysis reveals elevated CXCR4 expression in CD8+T cells in acute FM. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis drives the overactivation and cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells. In vivo treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist effectively reduces CD8+T cell accumulation in the heart, alleviates myocardial inflammation, and improves cardiac function in MC mice. Conclusions These findings provide deeper insights into the immune landscape of pediatric FM, uncovering a novel role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in driving CD8+T cell responses in myocarditis. Furthermore, they highlight the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis as a promising therapeutic target for myocarditis treatment.

        <tr id="Neonates, especially those born prematurely, are highly vulnerable to infection-induced mortality. Numerous observational and immunological studies in newborns have shown that live attenuated vaccines have beneficial, non-specific effects (NSEs) against secondary infections to unrelated pathogens. These beneficial effects have been attributed to trained immunity, and emergency granulopoiesis plays an essential role. However, trained immunity has been shown to affect multiple myeloid subsets and how trained immunity influences the host protective response is still undefined. Here we show that Bacillus-Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination improves survival to polymicrobial sepsis by simultaneously reprogramming broad aspects of myelopoiesis. Specifically, BCG vaccination expands multiple myeloid subsets, including the lineage (Lin)−Sca- 1+c-kit+ (LSK) and granulocytic-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and increases CD11b+Gr1+ cell number, as well as their oxidative metabolism and capacity to stimulate T-cell proliferation in response to sepsis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of neonatal splenocytes suggests that BCG-vaccination changes the broad transcriptional landscape of multiple myeloid subsets. The result is the maturation of various neutrophil and monocyte subsets, stimulation of antimicrobial processes, and suppression of inflammatory pathways and myeloid-derived suppressor cell transcription. These findings reveal that BCG administration early after birth fundamentally reorganizes the myeloid landscape to benefit the subsequent response to polymicrobial infection.

 Background:
 By forming an immunological synapse between T cells and tumor antigen, bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs) like blinatumomab have shown great promise in treating B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, many relapsed and refractory (R/R) patients fail to achieve long-term survival, with 40% not surviving past 24 months. Prolonged T cell activation with blinatumomab therapy may lead to changes in differentiation that leave the T cell population unable to elicit a sustained anti-tumor response. A deeper understanding of the dynamics of the T cell compartment in R/R B-ALL patients will lead to improved treatment strategies and optimized patient selection for blinatumomab therapy.
 Methods:
 To characterize T cell persistence and response in this context, we assessed memory and exhaustion phenotypes in blinatumomab-treated T cells isolated from 10 R/R pediatric B-ALL patients treated with blinatumomab. CD8+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples and analyzed for memory and exhaustion phenotypes via flow cytometry. Absolute lymphocyte counts were measured and linked to the sample flow cytometry data to assess expansion and contraction of T cell memory subsets throughout the course of therapy. Whole genome enzymatic methyl sequencing was performed on post-treatment PD-1 High and PD-1 Low CD8 T cells to determine the multipotency of the patient T cell compartment after blinatumomab treatment.
 Results:
 After 7 days of continued blinatumomab infusion, patient T cells demonstrated a significant expansion of terminally differentiated and effector memory T cells. Notably, we observed that non-responders had a high tumor burden at the start of the therapy and possessed a large population of naïve CD8 T cells that failed to expand. These CD8 T cells exhibited a significant increase in expression of TIM-3 and PD-1 compared to responders after the 7-day infusion. Methylation analysis of post-treatment CD8 T cells showed decreased methylation of exhaustion regulators IKZF1 and CD300a in non-responders compared to the responders. Additionally,
 in vitro
 treatment of T cells with blinatumomab induced T-cell exhaustion in a target-dependent manner.
 Conclusions:
 Blinatumomab therapy in pediatric B-ALL patients induced variable epigenetic and phenotypic changes to the T cell compartment indicative of exhaustion, corresponding to differences in T cell expansion and persistence between patients. Our study is the first to link epigenetic changes in exhaustion regulators with response variability in blinatumomab-treated patients. Furthermore, our findings highlight a potential role of baseline T cell composition and tumor burden in determining therapeutic outcomes. These insights provide a novel framework for improving patient stratification and treatment strategies to mitigate T cell exhaustion in blinatumomab therapy.

        <tr id="Various inhibitors targeting T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing molecule 3 (TIM3) aimed at reversing T-cell exhaustion for better immunotherapy outcomes have demonstrated limited clinical efficacy as monotherapy, with the underlying mechanisms remaining ambiguous. TIM3 is markedly expressed in dendritic cells (DCs), and the inconsistent research findings on its role in myeloid cells underscore its vital function within DCs. Through the establishment of an in vitro differentiation model generating mature dendritic cells (mDCs) under TIM3-targeted interventions, combined with an RNA sequencing analysis, this investigation systematically examined TIM3-mediated regulation and ligand interactions in human primary DCs. The findings indicate that TIM3 inhibition hinders DC maturation, which subsequently diminishes the antigen-presenting capacity of DCs, ultimately leading to immune suppression in T cells. These findings collectively establish TIM3 as a regulator of DC differentiation that promotes DC maturation while optimizing the antigen-processing and presentation capacity. This study elucidates the rationale behind the suboptimal efficacy of TIM3 inhibitors and advocates for retaining TIM3 signaling pathways in DCs.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the main immunosuppressive cells in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, systemic Treg depletion is not favored due to the crucial role of Tregs in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and prevention of autoimmunity. Recently, CCR8 has been identified as a key chemokine receptor expressed on tumor-infiltrating Tregs and targeted blockade of CCR8 exerts anticancer effect in several cancer types, but whether this pathway is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods We determined the involvement of CCR8+ Tregs in HCC using human HCC tissues and TCGA database, and examined the anticancer effect and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the CCR8 antagonist, IPG0521m, which was developed in house, in murine liver cancer model with flow cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and Real-Time PCR. Results Remarkable increase in CCR8+ Tregs was observed in human HCC tissues. Treatment of syngeneic liver cancer model with IPG0521m resulted in dramatic inhibition of tumor growth, associated with increased CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues. Bulk RNA sequencing analysis indicated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in remarkable increase in antitumor immunity. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in a switch of Tregs from high immunosuppression to low immunosuppression phenotype, associated with elevated CD8+ T and NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, and decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor tissues. Conclusions IPG0521m inhibited liver cancer growth via reducing the immunosuppressive function of Tregs, thereby boosting anti-cancer immunity. Our study paves the way for the clinical study of CCR8 antagonist in HCC and other cancers.

        <tr id="Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have substantially improved the lives of people with HIV (PWH) and reduced HIV acquisition through pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, the long-term effect of ART on the physiological state of cells remains poorly understood. Despite the success of ART in preventing the progression of HIV infection to AIDS, PWH are suffering from a disproportional burden of non-AIDS comorbidities, including lung diseases. Given the central function of alveolar macrophages (AM) in pulmonary immunity, we evaluated the impact of time on ART on AM of PWH and people on PrEP. Employing a retrospective cross-sectional design, we showed that ART imprinted a pro-inflammatory and senescence-like epigenetic and transcriptomic state on AM. This effect of ART was detected irrespective of HIV infection. Increased epigenetic priming and gene expression of cell cycle arrest markers such as CDKN1A (p21), senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes, e.g. IL6R and CXCL8, and transcription factors subunits of the AP-1 family were a hallmark of ART exposure. The ART-linked epigenetic and transcriptomic changes were strongly dependent on the duration of ART for both the PWH and PrEP groups and consistent with dysregulated AM function. SASP contributes to the pathophysiology of multiple lung diseases such as COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma. Combined, our data suggested that long-term ART contributes to age-related pulmonary comorbidities in PWH. Given the strong correlation with time on ART and adverse effects in PWH, it is possible that long-term PrEP may result in similar clinical outcomes. While PrEP is critically important for preventing HIV acquisition in the most vulnerable populations, our study advocates for adjuvant therapies and improved drug design to prevent or mitigate potential long-term adverse effects of PrEP.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and, despite treatment advances, immune suppression remains an obstacle to effective therapy. Effector CD4+ T cells (CD4+ Teffs) are critical for antitumor immunity, but their function is often inhibited by regulatory T cells (Tregs), which accumulate in lung tumors and perform suppressive functions through multiple mechanisms. This suppression leads to tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated suppression are not fully understood. Here, we identify the extracellular ATP receptor P2RX7 as a key regulator of Treg function in lung tumors. Using a murine lung cancer model induced by Lewis lung carcinoma cells, we demonstrate that P2RX7 enhances the suppressive capacity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, promoting tumor growth. In T cell-specific P2RX7-KO mice, reduced Treg infiltration was accompanied by increased CD4+ Teff accumulation and improved tumor control. Treg-specific P2RX7-KO mice exhibit reduced tumor growth, confirming a cell-intrinsic role of P2RX7 in Tregs. Suppression assays revealed that tumor-infiltrating WT Tregs have greater suppressive activity compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs, which failed to inhibit type 1 and Tfh-like responses. This was associated with increased tumor-specific IgG production by lung B cells in P2RX7-KO mice. We also observed that WT Tregs express higher levels of the immunosuppressive surface molecule CTLA-4 when compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs. In summary, we show that P2RX7 expression on Tregs is essential for their suppressive function in lung cancer, and targeting of P2RX7 may constitute a novel strategy to improve lung cancer treatment by alleviating Treg-mediated immune suppression.">

        <tr id="First-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combinations show responses in subsets of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Nearly half of HCCs are Wnt-active with mutations in CTNNB1 (encoding for β-catenin), AXIN1/2, or APC, and demonstrate heterogeneous and limited benefit to ICI due to an immune excluded tumor microenvironment. We show significant tumor responses in multiple β-catenin-mutated immunocompetent HCC models to a novel siRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle targeting CTNNB1 (LNP-CTNNB1). Both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal cellular and zonal reprogramming, along with activation of immune regulatory transcription factors IRF2 and POU2F1, re-engaged type I/II interferon signaling, and alterations in both innate and adaptive immunity upon β-catenin suppression with LNP-CTNNB1 at early- and advanced-stage disease. Moreover, ICI enhances response to LNP-CTNNB1 in advanced-stage disease by preventing T cell exhaustion and through formation of lymphoid aggregates (LA). In fact, expression of an LA-like gene signature prognosticates survival for patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab in the IMbrave150 phase III trial and inversely correlates with CTNNB1-mutatational status in this patient cohort. In conclusion, LNP-CTNNB1 is efficacious as monotherapy and in combination with ICI in CTNNB1-mutated HCCs through impacting tumor cell-intrinsic signaling and remodeling global immune surveillance, providing rationale for clinical investigations.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common leukemia in adults, exhibits immune escape characteristics like solid tumors. The expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a well-recognized immune checkpoint, has been detected in AML blast cells and is associated with poor clinical outcome. Although an imbalance of B cell subpopulations exists in AML patients’ bone marrow microenvironment, the role of B cells and their interaction with IDO1 in AML have yet to be elucidated. Herein, with bioinformatic analysis, we found the close correlations between IDO1 expression and survival and B cell subpopulation proportions in AML patients. Further, our investigation into IDO1 expression and activity, B cell subpopulation proportions and immunosuppressive interleukin-10 (IL-10) level in AML cells and clinical samples revealed significant findings. Using a co-culture system of healthy human PBMCs and AML cell lines, we demonstrated that high IDO1 expression in AML cells could alter the proportions of total B, regulatory B and memory B cells, and increased the level of IL-10. Finally, with the IDO1 inhibitor RY103 designed by our laboratory, we found that IDO1 inhibition had good anti-leukemic effect and restored the abnormal proportions of B cell subpopulations in AML mice. Our study is the first to reveal the modulation of IDO1 on B cell subpopulations in AML, making a significant breakthrough in understanding the immune escape mechanisms of AML. Application of IDO1 inhibitor, such as RY103, targeting the imbalance of B cell subpopulations can lead to innovative treatments for AML.

        <tr id="Transplant recipients require lifelong, multimodal immunosuppression to prevent rejection by reducing alloreactive immunity. Rapamycin, a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is known to modulate adaptive and innate immunity, while the full spectrum of its immunosuppressive mechanisms remains incompletely understood. Given the broad expression of mTOR, we investigated the understudied effects of rapamycin on lymph node (LN) architecture, leukocyte trafficking, and the gut microbiome and metabolism after 3, 7, and 30 days of rapamycin treatment, to characterize the early, intermediate, and late changes. Rapamycin significantly reduced CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T (Treg) cells in peripheral LNs, mesenteric LNs, and the spleen over time. Rapamycin induced early pro-inflammation transition to pro-tolerogenic status, by modulating the LN laminin α4:α5 expression ratios through LN stromal cells laminin α5 expression and by adjusting Treg numbers and distribution. Additionally, rapamycin significantly altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic functions, shifting the Bacteroides to Firmicutes ratio and increasing amino acid bioavailability in the gut lumen. These effects were evident by 7 days and became most pronounced by 30 days in naïve mice, with notable changes as early as 3 days in allogeneic splenocyte-stimulated mice. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of rapamycin’s action through time-dependent modulation of LN architecture and gut microbiome, which orchestrates changes in immune cell trafficking, providing a new framework for understanding and optimizing immunosuppressive therapies.">

With the hypothesis that CD8+ tissue resident memory T cell (TRM) phenotypes might be more competent at controlling tissue viral recrudescence, we examined their capacity to control HIV after reactivation and the benefit of inducing TRM-like phenotypes through cytokine stimulation from blood. CD8+TRM derived from cervical tissue were more efficient at eliminating reactivated HIV-infected CD4+T cells compared to circulating effector CD8+T cells. Expansion of CD8+TRM-like phenotypes from blood through IL-15/TGF-β1 stimulation recovered functional HIV-specific CD8+T cells displaying residency features, increased clonotypic diversity and mitochondrial function, and were the most efficient phenotypes at eliminating intact viruses after reactivation. Altogether, we provide a relevant therapeutic strategy to enhance elimination of persistent antigens like HIV by generating functional CD8+TRM-like phenotypes.">

        <tr id="Mechanical forces of the tumor microenvironment change dynamically during key events of tumorigenesis such as invasion and metastasis. These changes in compressive forces often affect the breast cancer cell phenotype. However, it is lesser known how these dynamic mechanical forces in the tumor microenvironment affect the phenotypes of tumor infiltrated leukocytes (TIL) and their subsequent anticancer activities. Here we find, in primary patient-derived explant cultures (PDEC) containing resident TILs, that low compression promotes a change in the original identity of breast cancer cells from luminal to a more mesenchymal and undifferentiated state. These altered tumor cells induce an upregulation of immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β), as well as polarization of macrophages towards pro-tumor M2(Gc)-type and depletion of CD8+ effector memory T-cells. These immunosuppressive events are mediated by tumor cell derived fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). We also find that FGF2 rich areas in primary tumors show enrichment in M2-like-macrophages and diminished numbers of CD8 + T and B-cells. Our results suggest that low compressive forces in the tumor microenvironment induce local immunosuppression via FGF2 secretion arising from phenotypic plasticity of tumor cells.">

        <tr id="Background: Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment and holds great potential for them, including metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, immune resistance remains a major obstacle, limiting its efficacy and durability. Understanding the mechanisms of immune tolerance in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is pivotal for overcoming these challenges and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Methods: Over 2000 samples, including a real-world cohort of 230 advanced ccRCC patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) were analyzed. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from 13 tumor regions were categorized into ICB-exposed, ICB-resistant, and ICB-responsive groups. Multiple robust algorithms and multiplex immunofluorescence were used to explore TME composition and macrophage heterogeneity. Spatial communication dynamics were further investigated. In vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of SPP1 on 786-O and 769-P cells. Co-culture experiments with THP-1-derived macrophages, followed by Western blot, flow cytometry, and functional assays, were performed to investigate SPP1-mediated macrophage polarization and its impact on tumor progression. Results: The results revealed an elevated presence of Apolipoprotein E (APOE)+ macrophages in ICB-resistant ccRCC. Notably, higher APOE+ macrophage proportion indicated shorter prognosis and worse response to ICB (P < 0.001). Elevated expression of CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Delta (CEBPD) was markedly linked to several immunosuppressive pathways, hindering T cell recruitment, promoting exhaustion, ultimately diminishing poorer prognosis and worse ICB efficacy. Meanwhile, upregulated Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) significantly enhances the proliferation, clonal formation, and migration of ccRCC cells. Tumor-derived SPP1. Additionally, SPP1 signaling from malignant cells appeared to recruit APOE+ macrophages to tumor margins, and promotes macrophage polarization into APOE+ M2-like macrophages. In the vicinity of the tumor, these APOE+ macrophages shape immunosuppressive TME by releasing abundant TGF-β signals, limiting anti-tumor effector T cells activity in ICB-resistant tumors, and contributing to tumor progression. Conclusion: This study reveals the critical role of APOE+ macrophages in promoting immune suppression and resistance to ICB therapy in ccRCC. By promoting T cell exhaustion and immunosuppressive signaling, particularly via localized TGF-β, these spatially segregated macrophages undermine treatment efficacy. Targeting APOE+ macrophages, especially in conjunction with ICB, presents a promising strategy to overcome immune resistance and enhance outcomes for ccRCC patients.">

        <tr id="While checkpoint immunotherapy effectively mobilizes T‐cell responses against tumors, its success in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently undermined by immunosuppressive myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment. This study investigates the role of nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1), a gene prominently expressed in tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs), in mediating this suppression and influencing immunotherapy outcomes. Through comprehensive analysis of single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) datasets and functional assays in vitro and in vivo, NUPR1 is identified as a critical regulator within TAMs. The upregulation of NUPR1 is associated with enhanced M2 macrophage polarization and increased expression of immune checkpoints PD‐L1 and SIRPA, resulting in CD8+ T cell exhaustion and a diminished response to immunotherapy. Mechanistically, NUPR1 inhibits the ERK and JNK signaling pathways, thereby creating an immunosuppressive milieu conducive to tumor progression. Additionally, tumor‐derived lactate is shown to upregulate NUPR1 expression in macrophages via histone lactylation, perpetuating a feedback loop that intensifies immune suppression. Pharmacological targeting of NUPR1 reverses M2 polarization, curtails tumor growth, and augments the efficacy of PD‐1 blockade in preclinical models, positioning NUPR1 as both a potential biomarker for immunotherapy responsiveness and a therapeutic target to boost immunotherapy efficacy in HCC.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in immuno-oncology research have revolutionised our understanding of the interplay between immune cells and the tumour microenvironment (TME), profoundly impacting patient responses to therapy. The TME, comprising tumour cells, immune cells, extracellular matrix, stromal cells, and co-existing microbes, orchestrates the immune phenotype of cancers, shaping disease progression and treatment outcomes. Immune-cell infiltration serves as a significant prognostic marker in various cancers, with higher rates correlating with improved prognosis. Recent discoveries have paved the way for immune checkpoint blockade therapies, which exhibit remarkable efficacy across multiple cancer types. However, understanding the nuanced contributions of different immune-cell populations to therapeutic responses remains a challenge. The majority of research has focussed on the role of T cells in the immune response to cancer therapies, with the potential importance of B cells only recently being recognised. Here, we review the diverse phenotypes of B cells within the TME, their structural organisation within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and the role of both B cells and TLS in cancer prognosis and response to different therapies for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="The spleen, as the largest immune organ, plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Non-pharmacological manipulation, particularly splenic ultrasound stimulation (SUS), has demonstrated significant immunomodulatory efficacy in alleviating chronic inflammatory diseases, suggesting its potential to revitalize splenic immunocompetence suppressing tumor proliferation, yet remains underexplored. This study applied low-frequency pulsed focused ultrasound (FUS) noninvasively stimulating the spleen (FUS sti. spleen) to investigate the efficacy in enhancing antitumor immunity and suppressing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results showed that FUS sti. spleen significantly suppressed tumor proliferation, achieving a suppression rate of >70% for H22-HCC and >83% for Hepa1-6-HCC, along with significantly prolonged survival. Comprehensive flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and cytokine analyses demonstrated that SUS profoundly reshaped the splenic and intratumoral immune landscape, specifically activating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells while suppressing immunosuppressive cell populations. Mechanistically, FUS facilitated calcium influx in splenic immunocytes, activating multiple signaling pathways, such as TNF, NFκB, MAPK, HIF-1, and ErbB, thereby counteracting tumor-driven immunosuppressive polarization while potentiating robust immune activation that impedes malignant progression and neoplastic proliferation. Leveraging above insights, we developed spleen-targeted nanodroplets encapsulating bioavailable calcium ions (STNDs@Ca²⁺), which, upon FUS stimulation, undergo cavitation-mediated controlled release of Ca²⁺, further amplifying immunocyte activation and tumor suppression, achieving a remarkable H22-HCC suppression rate of over 90%. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of ultrasound-mediated splenic immunomodulation, both as a standalone intervention and in synergy with STNDs@Ca²⁺, as a novel and noninvasive strategy for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Although immune checkpoint blockade therapy has generated dramatic responses in certain cancer types, breast tumors are largely unresponsive. Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity leads to the assembly of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and drives resistance of breast tumors to immunotherapies. Importantly, targeting CD73 completely sensitizes quasi-mesenchymal breast tumors to anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. However, the mechanism(s) of sensitization remained unknown. We demonstrate that targeting CD73 in quasi-mesenchymal breast tumors sensitizes them to anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade therapy in a CD4+ T-cell dependent manner. Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity results in elevated expression of cancer cell-intrinsic CD73 in human triple negative breast cancers. Given the ability of quasi-mesenchymal cancer cells to metastasize and resist multiple therapies, these findings can instruct the formation of novel translational strategies for the treatment of human breast cancers. These findings also bring to the forefront the attractive possibility of utilizing the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells along with CD73 and CD4+ T-cells as a predictive criterion for immunotherapy responsiveness.

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) are versatile professional antigen-presenting cells and play an instrumental role in the generation of antigen-specific T-cell responses. Modulation of DC function holds promise as an effective strategy to improve anti-tumor immunotherapy efficacy and enhance self-antigen tolerance in autoimmune diseases. Methods Wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (KO) mice at 2 weeks of age were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to induce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Four weeks later, WT and KO mice were randomly divided into control and treatment groups and treated once every two days for 30 weeks with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and a mix of 4 TLR2-activating lactic acid-producing probiotics (LAP), respectively. Mice were euthanized after 30 weeks of LAP treatment and their liver tissues were collected for gene expression, histological, flow cytometric and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Results We demonstrate here that oral administration of a mix of TLR2-activating LAP triggers a marked accumulation of regulatory DCs (rDCs) in the liver of mice. LAP-treated mice are protected from DEN-induced liver injury, fibrosis and HCC in a TLR2-dependent manner. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that LAP treatment determines an immunosuppressive hepatic T-cell program that is characterized by a significantly reduced cytotoxic activity. The observed functional changes of T cells correlated well with the presence of a hepatic DC subset displaying a regulatory or tolerogenic transcriptional signature. Conclusion Overall, these data suggest that stimulation of regulatory dendritic cells (rDCs) in the liver by LAP suppresses cytotoxic T-cell function and alleviates DEN-induced liver damage, fibrosis and tumorigenesis.">

        <tr id="The success of cancer immunotherapies is currently limited to a subset of patients, which underscores the urgent need to identify the processes by which tumours evade immunity. Through screening a kinome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA library we identified MAP3K7 (TAK1) as a suppressor of CD8+ T cell mediated killing. We demonstrate that TAK1 acts as a cancer-intrinsic checkpoint by integrating signals from T cell-secreted TNF and IFNy effector cytokines to elicit a cytoprotective response. This cytoprotective response profoundly limits the anti-cancer activity these key effector molecules and completely abrogates bystander killing by perforin deficient T cells. Inhibition of the TAK1 checkpoint effectively redirects the combined TNF/IFNy pathway activation to promote inflammatory cell death via RIPK1 and Caspase-8 and simultaneously amplifies the output of the IFNy pathway, thereby priming cells for cytokine-induced cell death. Mechanistically, TAK1 deficiency led to proteasomal degradation of cFLIP, enhancing the formation of Complex II and subversion of other cytoprotective responses. Targeting the TAK1 checkpoint led to profound attenuation of tumour growth in immune competent mice, with minimal impact in immune deficient counterparts. Adoptive cell therapy led to preferential elimination of TAK1 deficient clones. Collectively, our study uncovers a cancer-intrinsic checkpoint controlled by TAK1 activity that switches TNF and IFNy responses from cytoprotective to apoptosis. Cancer cells exploit this to limit cell death in the presence of the cytotoxic lymphoctye cytokines TNF and IFNγ and therapeutic intervention can fully unleash the impact of these effector molecules both on the direct target and bystander cells. These findings highlight the clinical development of TAK1 biologics as a potential strategy to improve cancer immunotherapies through harnessing and enhancing the cytotoxic potential of CTL-derived cytokines. In Brief Djajawi et al. identify TAK1 as a cancer-intrinsic cytokine toxicity checkpoint that limits the efficacy of anti-cancer immune responses. Cancer cells exploit TAK1 activity to confers resistance to CD8+ T cell-derived TNF and IFNγ-induced apoptosis, limiting both direct and bystander killing. Mechanistically, TAK1 loss acts through 1. cFLIP and RIPK1 to promote cell death, 2. The inactivation of pro-survival signals and 3. Via amplification of the IFNy response. Targeting of this TAK1 checkpoint enhanced anti-tumour immunity in vivo and improved adoptive cellular therapy. These findings identify a strategy employed by transformed cells to avoid destruction by inflammatory cytokines and provide new therapeutic vulnerabilities for enhancing immunotherapies. Highlights CRISPR screens identify TAK1 as a tumour-intrinsic survival checkpoint limiting destruction by CD8+ T cells. TAK1 protects tumour cells from combined TNF and IFNγ-induced apoptosis. TAK1 loss destabilizes cFLIP, priming cells for STAT1 and RIPK1-dependent cell death. TAK1 loss promotes tumour control in immune competent animals and enhances the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Background: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to immune suppression observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MDSCs are immature myeloid cells that are hijacked during development and further reprogrammed by the tumor microenvironment (TME) to harbor immune-suppressive properties and inhibit T-cell functions. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, including BRD4, are epigenetic modulators that regulate genes implicated in CLL pathogenesis and TME interactions. Previously, we investigated how the novel BET inhibitor OPN-51107 (OPN5) prevents CLL disease expansion, modulates T-cell immune function, and alters gene expression related to MDSCs. In turn, we hypothesize that BET proteins such as BRD4 regulate MDSC functions, and subsequent pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 will alleviate MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL. Methods: Utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model of CLL, we evaluated BRD4 protein expression in MDSCs derived from the bone marrow of transgenic and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. We then investigated the ex vivo functionality of OPN5-treated MDSCs, expanded from Eµ-TCL1 and WT bone marrow in MDSC-supportive medium. Finally, we conducted an in vivo study utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 adoptive transfer mouse model to determine the in vivo effects of OPN5 on MDSCs and other immune populations. Results: Through the course of this study, we found that MDSCs isolated from Eμ-TCL1 mice upregulate BRD4 expression and are more immune-suppressive than their WT counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrated ex vivo OPN5 treatment reverses the immune-suppressive capacity of MDSCs isolated from leukemic mice, evident via enhanced T-cell proliferation and IFNγ production. Finally, we showed in vivo OPN5 treatment slows CLL disease progression and modulates immune cell populations, including MDSCs. Conclusions: Altogether, these data support BET inhibition as a useful therapeutic approach to reverse MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL.">

This study investigates the role of NK cells in modulating DC signaling pathways and the recruitment of DCs during Chlamydia muridarum infection. Transcriptomic analyses revealed significant downregulation of key genes in DCs from NK-depleted mice involved in type I immunity, including IL12rb2, IL-18rap, and chemokine signaling components such as Ccl3, Ccl5, and Ccr5. Gene ontology (GO) analyses confirmed impaired chemokine–chemokine receptor interactions in DCs from NK-depleted mice. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis showed that NK-cell depletion reduced CCR5 expression on splenic and pulmonary DCs, impairing their migration toward CCL3 and CCL5. Furthermore, IFN-γ enhanced CCR5 expression on the surface of DCs, consequently promoting their migration, which was blocked by anti-IFN-γ antibodies. In vitro migration assays showed that treatment of DCs with IFN-γ increased their responsiveness to CCL3 and CCL5, the ligands of CCR5. Collectively, this study provides new insights into the indispensable role of NK cells in orchestrating DC signaling and the recruitment of DCs during chlamydial infection.">

However, the mechanisms that shape the tumor-immune microenvironment are incompletely understood. Here, we identify Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins as novel modulators of the tumor-immune microenvironment across diverse cancers. We demonstrate that loss of tumor MBNL expression results in an attenuated response to interferon gamma and reduced tumor antigen presentation in melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer cells. Parallel experiments in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model revealed that MBNL loss reduces tumor cell killing by CD8 + T cells in vitro and facilitates tumor escape from cytotoxic CD8 + T cell infiltration in vivo. Finally, we extended these studies to 29 human cancer types to find that MBNL expression levels are strongly associated with gene expression signatures of T cell tumor infiltration. These insights suggest that MBNL proteins play important roles in shaping the immune landscape across diverse malignancies.">

        <tr id="Asthma, a chronic airway disease, is marked by allergic inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and tissue remodeling. Influenza infections in asthma patients can cause severe exacerbations, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated how pre-existing allergic inflammation affects immune responses to influenza infection in mice exposed to house dust mite (HDM). Mice were repeatedly exposed to HDM, followed by infection with the influenza A virus, and were sacrificed three days post-infection. Plasma was analyzed for HDM-specific immunoglobulins, while lung tissue was used for immune cell flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analysis. HDM exposure induced allergic inflammation, evidenced by more HDM-specific IgE, IgG1, IgG2, eosinophils, neutrophils, Th1, and Th17 cells compared to controls. Upon influenza infection, the effects of HDM and influenza co-infection interacted, showing fewer Th1 cells and regulatory T cells and more Th2 cells compared to mice exposed to the influenza virus alone. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis revealed less upregulation of Th1-related genes and antiviral pathways in co-exposed mice, suggesting impaired Th1 immunity and antiviral responses. Pre-existing allergic inflammation significantly altered immune responses in mice co-infected with influenza, revealing underdeveloped antiviral responses as early as three days post-infection. These findings may explain the increased susceptibility of patients with asthma to severe viral diseases.">

        <tr id="Recombinant interferon alpha (IFNα) has been used to treat cancer patients for over 30 years; however, its clinical utility has been limited by a narrow therapeutic index. Given the recognized anti-tumor and immunomodulatory impacts of IFNα, the development of novel strategies to harness these attributes while minimizing associated toxicity could provide significant benefit for patients. The concept of attenuating IFNα binding affinity for its receptor was conceived to address this challenge and led to the development of CD38-targeted Attenukine™, a CD38-targeted antibody attenuated IFNα immunocytokine. In this study, we sought to delineate the effects of targeting AttenukineTM specifically to tumor cells and/or immune cells using an antibody to CD38, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on certain tumor and immune cells, using different mouse models and anti-human or anti-mouse CD38-targeted Attenukine™. Our results demonstrate that an anti-human CD38 AttenukineTM inhibits tumor growth through direct anti-proliferative effects of IFNα on CD38 + tumor cells as well as by indirectly modulating the anti-tumor immune response. In various in vivo models leveraging syngeneic mice bearing tumors with or without CD38 expression, administration of CD38-murine AttenukineTM mediated anti-tumor efficacy with increased immune activation and intra-tumoral infiltration. These data point to a potential dual mechanism of action for CD38-targeted Attenukine™, involving both tumor- and immune-directed effects, and highlight the potential benefit of a CD38-targeted attenuated IFNα therapy to deliver the known effects of IFNαtreatment to a broad spectrum of patients, while limiting the toxicity typically associated with recombinant IFNα.">

        <tr id="Liver macrophages play a role in the development of liver fibrosis progression via the regulation of inflammatory signaling. However, the precise mechanisms of macrophages contributing to liver fibrosis progression remain unclear. Using a preclinical model of CCl4-treated mice, we determined the composition of immune cells and the alteration of inflammatory gene expression. Our findings revealed a significant increase in liver macrophages, particularly those derived from infiltrating blood monocytes, in fibrotic mice. Moreover, the expression levels of type I IFN signature genes such as IFNα, IFNβ, ISG15, USP18, Ifi44, Ifit1, Ifit2, IRF3, and IRF7 were elevated in fibrotic mice. To determine the role of type I IFN signaling in liver fibrosis, we administered an IFNAR-1 antibody to block this pathway for 3 days prior to harvesting the liver. Notably, IFNAR-1 blockade reduced macrophage numbers compared to control mice and alleviated liver fibrosis in mice with increased hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. The ratio of P-STAT3/P-STAT1 in monocyte-derived macrophages was increased in the IFNAR-1 blockade group compared to fibrotic mice, and this was related to the appearance of M2 macrophage differentiation. Additionally, single-cell RNA-seq analysis indicated that IFNAR blockade affected inflammatory pathways involved in hepatocyte regeneration and fibrosis prevention. Taken together, IFNAR-1 blockade alleviates liver fibrosis progression by modulating macrophage inflammatory responses. These results provide insights for developing anti-fibrotic therapies against type I IFN signaling.">

This review provides an overview of the TME’s evolving composition, emphasizing its transition from an early pro-inflammatory, immune-promoting state to a later immunosuppressive milieu characterized by metabolic reprogramming and hypoxia. It highlights the dual roles of key immunocytes—including T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells—which can either inhibit or support tumor progression based on their phenotypic polarization and local metabolic conditions. The article further elucidates mechanisms of immune cell plasticity, such as the M1/M2 macrophage switch and the balance between effector T cells and regulatory T cells, underscoring their impact on tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, emerging therapeutic strategies, including checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and NK cell therapies, as well as approaches targeting metabolic pathways, are discussed as promising avenues to reinvigorate antitumor immunity. By integrating recent molecular insights and clinical advancements, the review underscores the importance of deciphering the interplay between immunocytes and the TME to develop more effective cancer immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Background: Platelets (PLTs) from healthy donors (HD) modulate T lymphocyte responses but PLTs from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients contribute to persistent systemic inflammation. This suggests that PLTs from RA patients and HD have different immunomodulatory effects. Methods: Using cell culture, flow cytometry, proteomics, and ELISA, we compared PLTs from HD and RA patients and their effects on T lymphocyte activation and cytokine production. Results: HD PLTs suppressed T lymphocyte proliferation and IFNγ and TNF production, while RA PLTs exhibited reduced suppressive capacity. In the presence of RA PLTs, IFNγ levels correlated with T lymphocyte proliferation, greater disease activity, and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). Proteomic analysis revealed that RA PLTs show upregulation of proteins linked to acute-phase response and complement activation. RA PLTs secreted higher levels of soluble CD40L (sCD40L) and PDGF-BB that correlated with enhanced IFNγ production. Seropositive RA patients had higher levels of sCD40L, and these levels were predictive of disease remission in RA patients treated with anti-IL6R. sCD40L was found to enhance T lymphocyte activation and to contribute to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Conclusions: This study highlights the diminished ability of RA PLTs to suppress T lymphocyte activation and that sCD40L can be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in RA.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review highlights the role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options. TAMs, which constitute a substantial portion of the TME, exhibit high phenotypic plasticity and dynamically shift between pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive states. GBM exploits this plasticity to drive tumor growth by inducing TAM polarization toward the immunosuppressive phenotype through mechanisms involving cytokine secretion, immune checkpoint pathways, and metabolic interactions. This polarization contributes to immune evasion, tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs include depletion, reprogramming toward the pro-inflammatory phenotype, and inhibiting pro-tumor signals. Several approaches are under investigation, such as blocking CSF-1R, disrupting CCL2/CCR2 and PI3K pathways, targeting PD-L1 expression, and utilizing nanoparticle-based delivery systems for selective TAM modulation. Further research targeting TAM plasticity and polarization is essential for developing treatments that overcome GBM’s robust immunosuppressive TME and improve patient survival.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity serves as a de facto memory for innate immune responses, resulting in long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. It enhances resistance to pathogens and augments immunosurveillance under physiological conditions. Given that innate immune cells typically have a short lifespan and do not divide, persistent innate immune memory may be mediated by epigenetic and metabolic changes in long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. HSCs fine-tune their state and fate in various training conditions, thereby generating functionally adapted progeny cells that orchestrate innate immune plasticity. Notably, both beneficial and maladaptive trained immunity processes can comprehensively influence HSC state and fate, leading to divergent hematopoiesis and immune outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize recent advances regarding HSC state and fate in the context of trained immunity. By elucidating the stem cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory network, we aim to refine current models of innate immune memory and provide actionable insights for developing targeted therapies against infectious diseases and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for engineering precision-trained immunity through HSC-targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Objective This study examines the cellular heterogeneity of epithelial cells within pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and their contributions to tumor progression, metastasis, and immunosuppressive interactions using single-cell RNA sequencing. Methods Single-cell RNA-sequencing data from two datasets (GSE154778 and GSE158356) were integrated using the Harmony algorithm, followed by quality control, clustering, and differential gene expression analysis. Distinct subpopulations of epithelial cells were identified, and their gene expression profiles were analyzed. To assess the malignancy of these subpopulations, single-cell copy number variation (CNV) analysis and trajectory analysis were conducted. Additionally, intercellular communication was examined using the CellChat platform. Results The analysis revealed pronounced heterogeneity among PDAC epithelial cells, with specific subpopulations exhibiting distinct roles in tumor proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and metastatic dissemination. Subpopulations 4 and 6 were characterized by increased CNV levels and a more malignant phenotype, suggesting an enhanced capacity for metastasis. Single-cell trajectory analysis, along with CellChat, mapped the temporal evolution of epithelial cells, identifying key regulatory genes such as DCBLD2 and JUN. A prognostic model incorporating five key genes, including KLF6, was developed and demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for patient outcomes. Notably, KLF6 emerged as a critical prognostic marker associated with immune modulation, particularly through interactions with M2 macrophages. Conclusion The study highlights the pronounced heterogeneity of epithelial cells in PDAC and their distinct contributions to tumor progression, metastasis, and immune modulation. Through single-cell transcriptomic and CNV analyses, we identified epithelial subpopulations with varying malignant potentials and distinct interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Among these, KLF6 emerged as a key regulator associated with immune modulation and metastasis. Our findings emphasize the significance of epithelial cell heterogeneity in shaping pancreatic cancer progression. These insights provide a foundation for future investigations into novel prognostic markers and therapeutic strategies.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in combating the influenza A virus (IAV) by initiating adaptive immune responses. However, the impact of ID on DCs and their response to IAV infection remain unclear. This study showed that ID impairs the antigen‐presenting ability of DCs, thereby hindering their capacity to mediate T‐cell proliferation and clear viruses. The restrictive effects of ID on DCs begin in the bone marrow and specifically affect the monocyte DC progenitor (MDP) stage. A reduction in the number of MDPs and compromised immune potential lead to a decrease in the population and functionality of DCs in the subsequent common DC precursor (CDP) stage in the blood, spleen, and lungs. This study highlights the previously unrecognized impact of ID on DCs and provides valuable insights into immune cell responses and the application of iron supplementation in the fight against viral infections.">

We collected and quantitatively profiled the intratumoral mycobiome data from 1044 patients with RCC across four international cohorts, of which 466 patients received immunotherapy. Patients were stratified into mycobiota ecology-depauperate and mycobiota ecology-flourishing (MEF) groups based on fungal abundance. The MEF group had worse prognosis, higher fungal diversity, down-regulated lipid catabolism, and exhausted CD8+ T cells. We developed the intratumoral mycobiota signature and intratumoral mycobiota-related genes expression signature, which robustly predicted prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes in RCC and other cancers. Aspergillus tanneri was identified as a potential key fungal species influencing RCC prognosis. Our findings suggest that the intratumoral mycobiome suppresses lipid catabolism and induces T cell exhaustion in RCC.">

        <tr id="One of the earliest steps of breast cancer metastasis occurs when tumor cells (TCs) disseminate through the bloodstream. There, they interact with several blood components. Among them, platelet favor TC survival and metastatic spread. While the binding of platelet to TC is highly variable, its molecular controls and downstream consequences remain unidentified. Here, we first document that high CD24 expression correlates with increased platelet binding and poorer survival in breast cancer. We further demonstrate that CD24-mediated platelet binding regulates TC cluster formation and resistance to anoikis in vitro. Depleting CD24 expression significantly reduces TC metastatic potential by rewiring the metastatic tumor microenvironment (mTME), affecting immune compartments and secreted factors. Overall, our work identifies CD24 as a molecular cue controlling TC-platelet interaction, dictating their metastatic potential. As such, it represents a druggable target to counteract platelet-TC collaboration in metastasis.">

        <tr id="IL-17A-expressing lymphocytes, including Tc17 cells, are instrumental in immunity, immunopathology, and autoimmunity. We have previously shown that experimental attenuated live fungal vaccine-induced Tc17 cells are stable, long-lived without plasticity, and necessary to mediate sterilizing immunity during CD4+ T cell deficiency, which poses higher susceptibility to fungal infections. Cell metabolism is integral for T cell homeostasis but the metabolic adaptations of Tc17 cells are poorly defined. In this study, we hypothesized that effector Tc17 cells adopt high energy-yielding metabolic pathways to form stable, long-lived memory cells in vivo. Using a mouse model of attenuated fungal vaccination, we found that effector Tc17 cells were metabolically highly active with higher proliferation and protein synthesis than IFNγ+ CD8+ T (Tc1) cells. Glucose was necessary for effector Tc17 cell expansion but with less dependency during the late expansion despite the active metabolism. Contrary to established dogma, we found that the effector Tc17 cells preferentially channeled the glucose to OXPHOS than glycolysis, which was correlated with higher mitochondrial mass and membrane potential. Inhibition of OXPHOS shrunk the Tc17 responses while sparing Tc1 cell responses. Tc17 cells actively relied on OXPHOS throughout the expansion period, resisting adaptation to aerobic glycolysis. Our data showed that the effector Tc17 cells predominantly utilize glucose for metabolism through OXPHOS rather than aerobic glycolysis. Our study has implications in vaccine design to enhance the efficacy and immunotherapeutics to modulate the immunity and autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="The roles of circulating complement C3, produced in hepatocytes, in immune defense are well defined in the literature. Interestingly, the C3 gene evolved before the circulatory system, suggesting an essential but yet unknown role of locally produced C3. Here, we investigated the effect of C3 on cancer immunotherapy and found that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived C3, not hepatocyte-derived C3, determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Tumors developed in CAF-specific C3 knockout mice exhibited resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, with increased immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, the C3 degradation product iC3b suppressed myeloid cell infiltration via complement receptor 3 signaling, and the therapeutic targeting of this pathway restored ICB sensitivity of immunotherapy-resistant tumors. In human cancers, stromal C3 expression correlates with reduced M2-like macrophage infiltration and improved immunotherapeutic outcomes. These data demonstrate the role of locally produced C3 in the innate immune response, which may have been conserved across many organisms.">

We found that C1q leads to profound reprogramming of myeloid cell metabolism, particularly glycolysis, and exerts control over the transcriptional regulation of important metabolic and inflammatory genes. We corroborate our findings by identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms close to the C1q gene that are linked to induction of trained immunity by Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) or beta-glucan in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results reveal an immunomodulatory role for C1q and provide evidence of a molecular interaction between the complement system and innate immune memory.

        <tr id="Introduction Due to the historical dogma that host defense against intracellular pathogens is primarily mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have long been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence highlights the multifaceted role of B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. B cells accumulate at the site of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity are still being unraveled. In addition to producing antibodies, B cells secrete a wide range of cytokines that can influence the local immune response. In this study, we focused on the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-secreting B cells in the long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Methods B cell-specific IL-10 expression was assessed in IL-10 transcriptional reporter (Vert-X) mice following Mtb infection. To investigate the role of B cell-derived IL-10 in TB immunity, both male and female mice with a targeted knockout of IL-10 in B cells (IL-10flox/CD19cre) were infected with Mtb HN878. Disease progression, control of bacterial replication, and immunological changes were monitored throughout the course of infection. Results B cells contribute to IL-10 production in the Mtb-infected lung in both sexes, with CD138+ plasma cells serving as the primary source of B cell-derived IL-10. Mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 exhibited increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, demonstrated by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was associated with male-specific immune alterations. Conclusion Our research highlights a previously unrecognized sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Objectives: Pancreatic cancer remains a therapeutic challenge due to its immunosuppressive microenvironment and treatment resistance. This study aimed to develop a novel recombinant oncolytic vaccinia virus (VVL-GL7) co-expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-7 (IL-7), designed to enhance anti-tumor immunity and synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Methods: VVL-GL7 was constructed through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of TK and A49 genes, combined with the simultaneous insertion of dual cytokine-encoding cassettes. Anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated in vitro and in vivo using C57BL/6 mouse and Syrian hamster pancreatic cancer models. Comprehensive immune profiling evaluated CD8+ T-cell and macrophage infiltration dynamics while simultaneously assessing memory T-cell differentiation patterns using flow cytometry. Preclinical combination studies of VVL-GL7 and the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor were systematically evaluated in a syngeneic pancreatic cancer model. Results: VVL-GL7 exhibited potent oncolytic activity, inducing significant tumor regression in both preclinical models. VVL-GL7 therapy significantly augmented CD8+ T-cell and macrophage infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, while concomitantly driving memory T-cell differentiation. The synergistic effects of VVL-GL7 and the PD-1 blockade further improved therapeutic outcomes, resulting in significantly higher tumor remission rates compared to monotherapy and achieving complete tumor regression in pancreatic cancer models. Conclusions: VVL-GL7 reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and synergizes with anti-PD-1 antibodies to overcome resistance in pancreatic cancer.">

        <tr id="Age-associated B cells (ABCs) with autoreactive properties accumulate with age and expand prematurely in autoimmune diseases. However, the mechanisms behind ABC generation and maintenance remain poorly understood. We show that continuous B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is essential for ABC development from anergic B cells in aged and autoimmune mice. ABCs exhibit constitutive BCR activation, with surface BCRs being internalized. Notably, anergic B cells, but not nonautoreactive B cells, contributed to ABC formation in these models. Anergic B cells also showed a greater propensity for in vitro differentiation into ABCs, which was inhibited by the expression of the transcription factor Nr4a1. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk), a key BCR signaling component, was constitutively activated in ABCs from aged and autoimmune mice as well as patients with lupus. Inhibiting Btk reduced ABC numbers and ameliorated the pathogenicity of lupus mice. Our findings reveal critical mechanisms underlying ABC development and offer previously unrecognized therapeutic insights for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis) could regulate inflammatory markers, promote intestinal barrier integrity, and block tumor formation in colon. However, the regulatory effect of P. distasonis on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of P. distasonis on NSCLC and its impact on tumor immunity. Methods We first established a mouse model of Lewis lung cancer, and administered P. distasonis and intrabitoneal injection of anti-mouse PD-1 monoclonal antibody to assess the impact of P. distasonis on tumor immunity, and mouse intestinal barrier. Then, we explored the effect of P. distasonis on CD8+T cells and CXCL9 secretion mediated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). We used the TLR1/2 complex inhibitor CPT22 to evaluate its effect on macrophage activation. Finally, we explored the effect of P. distasonis on CD8+T cells and CXCL9 secreted by TAM in vivo. Results In vivo, P. distasonis enhanced anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-1 in NSCLC mice, improved intestinal barrier integrity, recruited macrophages, and promoted M1 polarization. In vitro, CD86 and iNOS levels in BMDM were elevated and CD206 and Arg1 levels were suppressed in membrane fraction of P. distasonis (PdMb) group in comparison to Control group. With additional CPT22 pre-treatment, the levels of CD86 and iNOS in BMDM were reduced, and the levels of CD206 and Arg1 were increased. Compared to PBS group, P. distasonis group exhibited higher proportion of CD8+T cells in tumor tissues, along with increased positive proportion of GZMB and IFN-γ in CD8+T cells. Additionally, in comparison to Control group, PdMb group showed an elevated proportion of GZMB+T and IFN-γ+T cells within CD8+T cells, and secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin, and GZMB in CD8+T cell supernatant increased. Moreover, the proportion of CXCL9+F4/80+ macrophages in tumor tissues was higher in P. distasonis group compared to PBS group. In comparison to Control group, CXCL9 protein level in BMDM and CXCL9 secretion level in BMDM supernatant were increased in PdMb group. Finally, P. distasonis enhanced CD8+T cell activity by secreting CXCL9 from macrophages in vivo. Conclusions P. distasonis promoted CXCL9 secretion of TAM and enhanced CD8+T cell activity to trigger anti-tumor immunity against anti-PD-1 treatment in NSCLC mice.

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic, debilitating disease with no available disease-modifying drugs. Biomarker identification in OA patients has hitherto been limited to serum proteins and bulk epigenomic feature identification.


METHODS
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 21 healthy donors, 17 OA patients, and 10 patients with degenerative meniscal tears (DMT) were immunophenotyped at single-cell resolution by mass cytometry by time-of-flight (cyTOF) using a 29-marker panel to identify OA-associated features in the circulating immune cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing was utilized to discern mechanistic attributes of perturbed immune cell populations in OA.


RESULTS
Comparison of healthy donors and OA patients' PBMC revealed distinct perturbations in OA. While subsets of naive B cells were depleted, switched memory B cells were significantly expanded in OA including a CD25hiCXCR5hiCD27+IgD- subpopulation. Single cell-RNA sequencing revealed a dysfunction of IL2/Stat3 and TNF signaling in the CD25hi switched memory B cells in OA. A similar expansion of CD25hi switched memory B cells was observed in patients with DMT, a population at enhanced risk for OA.


CONCLUSIONS
A CD25hi switched memory B cell population was identified to be a potential cellular biomarker for OA that can be detected in early stages of OA in the readily accessible circulating blood cells.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) are clonal hematologic disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and a variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite growing recognition of the role of innate immunity in MDS pathogenesis, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed bone marrow CD34+ expression data from 183 MDS patients to investigate the impact of the Toll‐like receptor (TLR) pathway on disease progression. Six key innate immunity genes (IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK4, MYD88, TRAF6, and NFKB1) were used to define two distinct immune clusters: a hyperactive immune cluster (HIC) and a moderate immune cluster (MIC). The HIC was enriched in 155 immune‐related pathways and showed higher infiltration of activated natural killer cells and M1 macrophages, while the MIC exhibited increased infiltration of naïve B cells and mast cells. Differential expression analysis identified 35 genes that distinguished the clusters. Validation in an independent cohort of 82 patients revealed that reduced expression of these genes correlated with markers of advanced disease, including lower hemoglobin levels, lower neutrophil counts, altered cytogenetics, and higher bone marrow blast percentages. These findings underscore the critical role of immune dysregulation in MDS progression and highlight novel therapeutic opportunities within the innate immunity pathway for tailored interventions.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated bone marrow failure (BMF) entails a complex immune landscape. Myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are involved in the development and progression of immune aplastic anemia (AA). We used a murine model of BMF to explore the effects of CSF-1R inhibition on immune pathophysiology. Hematopoiesis, immune cell populations, and gene expression were assessed by flow cytometry, cytokine analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing. CSF-1R inhibition with the small molecule PLX3397 intensified BMF in CByB6F1 mice, enhancing inflammation and macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. This was accompanied by increased leukocyte apoptosis, a reduction in CD11b+ myeloid cells, and worsened animal survival. In contrast, the JAK-inhibitor baricitinib attenuated BMF, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, and decreasing CD8+ T cell infiltration of bone marrow. Single-cell RNA analysis revealed upregulation of M1 signature genes in both murine BMF and also AA human samples. In patients with severe AA, there was a shift towards an M1-like monocyte phenotype, correlating with increased inflammatory cytokine expression and altered MDSC populations. These findings highlight the role of myeloid-derived cells in BMF and suggest that M1 macrophages, with defective MDSC function, contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression. Targeting macrophage polarization or MDSCs offers alternative therapeutic strategies in immune-mediated BMF.">

        <tr id="Despite the significant advances in the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), primary and acquired ICI resistance remains the primary impediment to effective cancer immunotherapy. Residing in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in tumor progression by regulating diverse signaling pathways. Notably, accumulating evidence has confirmed that TAMs interplay with various cellular components within the TME directly or indirectly to maintain the dynamic balance of the M1/M2 ratio and shape an immunosuppressive TME, consequently conferring immune evasion and immunotherapy tolerance. Detailed investigation of the communication network around TAMs could provide potential molecular targets and optimize ICI therapies. In this review, we systematically summarize the latest advances in understanding the origin and functional plasticity of TAMs, with a focus on the key signaling pathways driving macrophage polarization and the diverse stimuli that regulate this dynamic process. Moreover, we elaborate on the intricate interplay between TAMs and other cellular constituents within the TME, that is driving tumor initiation, progression and immune evasion, exploring novel targets for cancer immunotherapy. We further discuss current challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need to decode TAM-TME interactions and translate preclinical findings into clinical breakthroughs. In conclusion, while TAM-targeted therapies hold significant promise for enhancing immunotherapy outcomes, addressing key challenges—such as TAM heterogeneity, context-dependent plasticity, and therapeutic resistance—remains critical to achieving optimal clinical efficacy.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Conventional therapies are frequently limited by tumor heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Dendritic cells (DCs), central to orchestrating antitumor immunity, have become key targets for HCC immunotherapy. This review examines the biological functions of DC subsets (cDC1, cDC2, pDC, and moDC) and their roles in initiating and modulating immune responses against HCC. We detail the mechanisms underlying DC impairment within the TME, including suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Additionally, we discuss novel DC-based therapeutic strategies, such as DC-based vaccines designed to enhance antigen presentation and T cell activation. Combining DC vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockers, demonstrates synergistic effects that can overcome immune evasion and improve clinical outcomes. Despite progress, challenges related to DC subset heterogeneity, TME complexity, and patient variability require the further optimization and personalization of DC-based therapies. Future research should focus on refining these strategies, leveraging advanced technologies like genomic profiling and artificial intelligence, to maximize therapeutic efficacy and revolutionize HCC treatment. By restoring DC function and reprogramming the TME, DC-based immunotherapy holds immense potential to transform the management of HCC and improve patient survival.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic stem cell transplant and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) are the current standard treatments for patients with aplastic anemia (AA). However, IST also carries significant risks and side effects, and up to 30–50% of patients experienced refractory or relapsed disease following IST. Treating AA remains challenging and novel efficient therapies are in critical need. The IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) plays a crucial role in the T cell response and functions as a regulator of T cell activity. While ITK inhibition has shown promise in various immune-related disorders, its potential role in the pathophysiology of AA has not been thoroughly investigated. We observed elevated level of phosphorylated ITK in T cells from AA patients and AA mouse models. Moreover, we found that both treatment with an ITK inhibitor or conditional depletion of Itk in donor mice alleviated bone marrow hypoplasia, improved cytopenia, and extended survival rates. Notably, ITK inhibition orchestrates T cell quantity and function by reducing T cell infiltration and suppressing the secretion of key inflammatory cytokines in AA mice. Our data suggest that ITK inhibitor could potentially offer a new therapeutic strategy for AA.

        <tr id="Background Ovarian cancer (OC) progression is heavily influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), where immune suppression plays a critical role. This study explores the role of thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) in regulating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), T cell exhaustion, and immune checkpoint expression, as well as its transcriptional regulation by SNF2H. Methods We analyzed THBS1 expression and its clinical significance using publicly available datasets (TCGA-OV, GSE14407) and tissue microarrays containing OC and adjacent normal tissues. In vitro functional studies were conducted using OC cell lines (SKOV3, A2780) and co-cultures with macrophages. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and RNA interference were employed to investigate SNF2H-mediated transcriptional regulation of THBS1. In vivo, the role of THBS1 in immune suppression was validated using mouse tumor models. Results THBS1 was significantly overexpressed in OC tissues and associated with poor prognosis. High levels of THBS1 correlated with increased TAM infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization, and upregulation of immune checkpoints PD-L1 and GAL-3, which contribute to T cell exhaustion. Functional assays demonstrated that THBS1 promotes macrophage recruitment and induces M2 polarization through TGF-β1 and IL-4 signaling. Additionally, ChIP assays identified SNF2H as a transcriptional regulator of THBS1, contributing to its overexpression. In vitro targeting of THBS1 reduced TAM-mediated immune suppression and restored T cell cytotoxicity. Conclusion This study positions THBS1 as a key regulator of the OC TME, linking TAM recruitment and polarization to CD8+ T cell exhaustion via immune checkpoint modulation. By identifying SNF2H as a transcriptional regulator of THBS1, we offer new insights into its epigenetic dysregulation and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to reprogram the TME and improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy.

Methods HBV‐persistent C57BL/6J mice were established through hydrodynamic tail vein injection of 10 µg pAAV‐HBV1.2 plasmid. Subsequently, mice treated i.p. with anti‐PD‐L1 and/or anti‐CTLA‐4 at specified time points, with dosages of 500 µg, 250 µg, and 250 µg, respectively. Additionally, 5 × 105 magnetic bead‐purified plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were adoptively transferred i.v. into the acute mouse model followed by anti-PD-L1 treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR was employed to assess the expression levels of costimulatory and tolerogenic molecules in two dendritic cell subsets. Serum HBsAg and HBsAb were measured using ELISA. Flow cytometry was utilized to quantify T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), and germinal center (GC) B cells. Results PD-L1 blockade markedly enhanced the differentiation of Tfh cells and GC B cells in HBV-persistent C57BL/6J mice, thereby promoting HBV clearance. Additionally, pDCs exhibited an increased capacity to induce immune tolerance, with pDCs isolated from HBV carriers inducing viral persistence. This persistence was effectively counteracted by treatment with anti-PD-L1. Conclusion pDCs mediate the dysregulation of the humoral immune response to HBV through PD-L1 in chronic hepatitis B infection, highlighting a promising target for the management of chronic HBV.">

        <tr id="Th17 cells can perform either regulatory or inflammatory functions depending on the cytokine microenvironment. These plastic cells can transdifferentiate into Tregs during inflammation resolution, in allogenic heart transplantation models, or in cancer through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that NLRP3 expression in Th17 cells is essential for maintaining their immunosuppressive functions through an inflammasome-independent mechanism. In the absence of NLRP3, Th17 cells produce more inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, Granzyme B, TNFα) and exhibit reduced immunosuppressive activity toward CD8+ cells. Moreover, the capacity of NLRP3-deficient Th17 cells to transdifferentiate into Treg-like cells is lost. Mechanistically, NLRP3 in Th17 cells interacts with the TGF-β receptor, enabling SMAD3 phosphorylation and thereby facilitating the acquisition of immunosuppressive functions.

        <tr id="Severe immune aplastic anemia is a fatal disease due to the destruction of marrow hematopoietic cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes, serving as a paradigm for marrow failure syndromes and autoimmune diseases. To better understand its pathophysiology, we apply advanced single cell methodologies, including mass cytometry, single-cell RNA, and TCR/BCR sequencing, to patient samples from a clinical trial of immunosuppression and growth factor stimulation. We observe opposing changes in the abundance of myeloid cells and T cells, with T cell clonal expansion dominated by effector memory cells. Therapy reduces and suppresses cytotoxic T cells, but new T cell clones emerge hindering robust hematopoietic recovery. Enhanced cell-cell interactions including between hematopoietic cells and immune cells, in particular evolving IFNG and IFNGR, are noted in patients and are suppressed post-therapy. Hematologic recovery occurs with increases in the progenitor rather than stem cells. Genetic predispositions linked to immune activation genes enhances cytotoxic T cell activity and crosstalk with target cells.">

        <tr id="CD300 family members are immunoglobulin superfamily receptors that regulate immune cell function through either activating or inhibitory signals. Among them, CD300a is a prototypical inhibitory receptor, highly expressed in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and tumor immunity. CD300a transduces inhibitory signals in several immune cells—including mast cells, eosinophils, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells—by recruiting SHP-1 phosphatase to immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and suppressing activation pathways such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)-MyD88 and FcεRI signaling. Recent studies suggest that tumor cells may hijack CD300a-associated pathways to establish an immunosuppressive microenvironment that facilitates immune evasion, tumor survival, and potentially metastatic spread. Proposed mechanisms include reduced DC-mediated type I interferon (IFN) production, diminished NK cell cytotoxicity, and negative regulation of mast cell– and eosinophil-dependent anti-tumor responses. Although some of these findings are derived from in vivo models, the cumulative evidence positions CD300a as a critical immune checkpoint in tumor-associated immune regulation. In addition to its established roles in hematologic malignancies—including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia—CD300a has also been implicated in modulating tumor-associated immune responses in other pathological contexts. While most studies emphasize its immune cell–mediated effects, emerging evidence suggests that CD300a may directly influence tumor progression by regulating immune homeostasis, intracellular signaling, and tumor microenvironment interactions. Collectively, these findings establish CD300a as a pleiotropic immunoregulatory molecule in both hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, underscoring the need to further explore its broader relevance and therapeutic potential in cancer immunology.">

 Background:
 Reprogramming or repolarizing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has emerged as a novel strategy in tumor immunotherapy, leveraging their remarkable plasticity. Our previous studies have demonstrated that SLAMF8, predominantly expressed in macrophages, is a promising biomarker for predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to elucidate further the regulatory role of SLAMF8 in TAMs and its influence on the tumor immune microenvironment.
 Methods:
 In vitro, M2 macrophage and TAM models were established to investigate the regulatory role of SLAMF8 in macrophage immunophenotypic transition and its impact on CD8+ T cell function using qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and co-culture assays. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data and western blotting were conducted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. In vivo, SLAMF8-specific small interfering RNA (siSLAMF8) was utilized to inhibit SLAMF8 expression in subcutaneous colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor models. Subsequent observations included tumor growth monitoring and analysis of immune cell infiltration via flow cytometry. Furthermore, two subcutaneous tumor models, one sensitive and one resistant to PD-1 therapy, were constructed to explore potential synergistic effects between SLAMF8 inhibition and anti-PD-1 treatment.
 Results:
 In vitro studies reveal that SLAMF8 facilitates the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, contributing to the immunosuppressive characteristics of TAMs and dysfunction of CD8+ T cells. Inhibiting SLAMF8 in vivo significantly delayed colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the infiltration of anti-tumor TAMs (CD86+ F4/80+) and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (IFNγ+ GZMB+ CD8+ T cells) was augmented, while the infiltration of pro-tumor TAMs (CD206+ F4/80+) and exhausted CD8+ T cells (PD1+ LAG3+ CD8+ T cells) was reduced in tumors treated with SLAMF8-specific small interfering RNA (siSLAMF8). Additionally, targeting SLAMF8 enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. Mechanistically, Western blotting experiments confirmed that the phosphorylation levels of key molecules in the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways were significantly increased in SLAMF8-overexpressing macrophages.
 Conclusions:
 Inhibition of SLAMF8 delays tumor growth, enhances the sensitization to ICI therapy, and reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment by modulating TAMs via the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT3 pathways in CRC. These findings reveal the potential of SLAMF8 as a therapeutic target for immunotherapy focused on TAMs.

Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is now recognized as a major cause of septic death, and identifying effective strategies to counteract it poses a significant challenge. This immunosuppression results from the disruption of immune homeostasis, characterized by the abnormal death of immune effector cells, hyperproliferation of immune suppressor cells, release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of immune checkpoints. Preclinical studies targeting immunosuppression, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promise in reversing immunocyte dysfunctions and establishing host resistance to pathogens.

        <tr id="Background The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited by heterogeneity in individual responses to therapy. The heterogeneous phenotypes and crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in immunotherapy resistance remain largely unclear. Methods A specific CAF subset was identified by integrating comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and transcriptome profiling of patients with HCC with different responses to antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. Mouse orthotopic HCC models and a coculture system were constructed, and cytometry by time-of-flight analysis was performed to investigate the functions and mechanisms of specific CAFs in the immune context of HCC. Results We identified a distinct flavin-containing monooxygenase 2 (FMO2)+ CAF subset associated with a favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy and better clinical outcomes. FMO2+ CAFs increase anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy by promoting tertiary lymphoid structure formation and increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and M1-like macrophages through the C-C motif chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19)-C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 axis. Mechanistically, FMO2 promotes nuclear factor kappa B/p65-mediated CCL19 expression by competitively binding to glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) with praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 1 (PJA1), thereby suppressing the PJA1-mediated proteasomal degradation of GYS1. CCL19 treatment potentiated the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in mouse orthotopic HCC models. A favorable immunotherapy response was observed in patients with HCC with high serum levels of CCL19. Conclusions We identified a novel FMO2+ CAF subset that serves as a critical regulator of microenvironmental immune properties and a predictive biomarker of the immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. CCL19 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has emerged as a pivotal advancement in cancer treatment, yet its efficacy varies among patients and resistance can develop. This study focuses on TIGIT, a newly identified immune checkpoint, to explore its expression, prognostic significance, and therapeutic potential in hematologic malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we found TIGIT highest expression levels in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, with enrichment in immune cells such as NK-T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). A prognostic model incorporating TIGIT expression and other immune-related genes effectively stratified AML patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with the former displaying significantly shorter overall survival times. Our model outperformed traditional prognostic factors, highlighting TIGIT’s potential as a superior predictive biomarker. Additionally, our in vitro and in vivo studies showed that combining tiragolumab with azacitidine (AZA) synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, reducing tumor burden and extending survival in a murine AML model. Our findings underscore TIGIT’s role in hematologic malignancies and its potential as a therapeutic target in AML. The combination of AZA with TIGIT inhibition offers a promising new approach for AML treatment, warranting further clinical evaluation.">

        <tr id="Recipients’ age has emerged as a key factor that impacts on acute renal allograft rejection and graft survival. Age-related functional and structural changes in the immune system have been observed, yet the precise influence of aged immunity on kidney transplant remains unclear. In an initial retrospective analysis of clinical data gathered from two major centers in China and Germany, we found a correlation between aging and mitigated rejection outcomes in kidney recipients. To study the mechanism, we performed kidney transplantation on mice and observed attenuated allograft rejection in senescent recipients. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of allograft kidneys indicated a protective role of p21high macrophages in aged mice. Supernatant collected from p21high macrophage primary culture inhibited the cytotoxic function and proliferation of CD8+ T cells. Zfp36 is highly expressed in senescent p21high macrophages. To determine its role in renal allograft rejection, we studied mice with Zfp36 conditionally deleted in macrophages (Zfp36-cKO). These mice developed exacerbated allograft rejection with enhanced IL-27 production and CD8+ T cell hyperactivation. Inhibition of IL-27 with neutralizing antibody or deletion of IL-27 receptor on CD8+ T cells reversed acute renal allograft rejection in Zfp36-cKO mice. Moreover, in vitro silencing Zfp36 with siRNA led to impaired degradation of IL-27 p28 mRNA and a subsequent increase of IL-27 in p21high macrophages. In conclusion, senescent macrophages protect renal allograft rejection by suppressing CD8+ T cells via a Zfp36/IL-27-dependent mechanism. These findings may provide innovative therapeutic strategies for addressing kidney allograft rejection.">

 The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is a critical immunomodulatory hub governing multiple processes relating to anti-tumor immunity. TMEM33 is an ER-resident membrane protein implicated in various ER-associated functions including cholesterol metabolism, calcium oscillations, and proteostasis. We previously reported TMEM33 as a negative modulator of the innate immune signaling protein STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes). Here we identify a central role of TMEM33 in tumor immunology where its deficiency profoundly impacts infiltrating immune populations and T cell phenotype. STING-mediated ISG (interferon-stimulated gene) expression was augmented in Tmem33-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages and TMEM33-depleted Flp-In T-REx 293 cells. Strikingly, Tmem33-/- mice exhibited significantly attenuated B16F10-OVA tumor growth and enhanced CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration compared to wild-type (WT) controls, while immunosuppressive immune populations including Treg cells, monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and M2-like macrophages were diminished. CD8+ T cell enrichment was also observed in MC38 tumor-bearing Tmem33-/- hosts. Unchallenged mice displayed no overt phenotypic or immunological differences compared to WT, however. High dimensional spectral flow cytometry was leveraged to further examine effects of Tmem33-/- on T cell compartments in B16F10-OVA tumors and draining lymph nodes (DLNs). Progenitor exhausted (Tpex) TCF-1+PD-1+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were significantly enriched in Tmem33-/- hosts, notable given that Tpex are responsive to checkpoint blockade therapy and associate with improved patient prognosis. Compared to WT counterparts, OVA-specific Tmem33-/- TILs exhibited increased cytotoxicity and effector function, expressing elevated granzyme-B and TNF-α. Moreover, EOMESloT-bethi TILs were more frequent among TCF-1+PD-1+ and TCF-1+ populations in Tmem33-/- hosts further suggestive of a more persistent CD8+ precursor pool, while inhibitory receptor (LAG-3, TIGIT) abundance was blunted, indicating reduced exhaustion. In DLNs of Tmem33-/- mice, antigen-specific CD8+ populations demonstrated enhanced effector memory (CD44+CD62L-) phenotypes alongside elevated CXCR3 expression compared to WT, suggesting increased tumor-migratory potential. In summary, here we identify TMEM33 as a novel immunoregulatory factor, the loss of which in hosts majorly reshapes the tumor-immune landscape and ameliorates multiple aspects of CD8+ T cell fitness including stemness, exhaustion, memory, cytotoxicity and migratory capacity. Further analysis of T cell populations from tumor-bearing mice and ex vivo analysis will enable mechanistic refinement of the role of TMEM33. Moreover, our study supports the importance of ER-resident proteins in fine-tuning immune cell function, underlining their potential as promising targets for therapeutic intervention.

        <tr id="Background Progesterone and adipose Q receptor 5 (PAQR5), a membrane receptor characterized by seven transmembrane domains, has been indirectly implicated in pro-carcinogenic activities, though its specific role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be defined. Methods This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PAQR5 facilitates HCC progression and contributes to the immunosuppressive microenvironment through an integrative approach combining multi-omics analysis and experimental validation. Utilizing data from bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics cohorts, this study systematically assessed the expression patterns, immune landscape, and functional characteristics of PAQR5 across different levels of resolution in HCC. Results PAQR5 expression was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and correlated with poor clinical outcomes. Enrichment analysis revealed that PAQR5 activated the NF-κB signaling pathway in HCC. Single-cell transcriptomics identified PAQR5 as predominantly localized within malignant cell clusters, with significant association with NF-κB pathway activation. Spatial transcriptomics further corroborated the alignment of PAQR5 expression with tumor cell distribution. In vitro assays showed elevated PAQR5 levels in HCC cell lines, and silencing PAQR5 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and prevented the formation of immunosuppressive microenvironment. In vivo studies demonstrated that targeting PAQR5 attenuated tumorigenic potential, disrupted the invasion-metastasis cascade and inhibited the tumor immune escape. Mechanistically, PAQR5 was found to activate NF-κB signaling by inducing ERK phosphorylation, thereby driving proliferation, invasion, EMT, and immune escape in HCC through the pathway.

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in tumor immunotherapy, especially in immune checkpoint therapy, and therefore have become the focus of cancer research. However, although immune checkpoint treatment has shown some efficacy in clinical trials, its effect is still limited by tumor immune escape. Tumors weaken CD8+ T cell function by adapting to immune stress, while mechanisms such as metabolic reprogramming and regulation of immunosuppressive factors further reduce their anti-tumor activity. Based on existing research and data, this paper discusses CD8+ T cell exhaustion, immune checkpoint regulation (PD-1/CTLA-4), and tumor microenvironment metabolism, and summarizes strategies to enhance the effect of immunotherapy. Studies have shown that by inhibiting T cell exhaustion, blocking immune checkpoint signaling pathways, and optimizing metabolism, CD8+ T cell function can be significantly enhanced and the overall therapeutic effect can be improved. However, while metabolic intervention appears promising, its clinical feasibility and safety require further validation. This study provides a theoretical basis for optimizing T cell immunotherapy and provides new ideas for clinical treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Gut-liver crosstalk plays an important role in alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) pathogenesis; but underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Objective We examined the regulation of intestinal and intrahepatic CD8+ T lymphocytes and their contribution to ALD. Design ALD patients were recruited for evaluation of intestinal and liver T cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) was performed to analyse intrahepatic and peripheral T cells in ALD. Wildtype, CD8-specific Bcl2 transgenic (Cd8Bcl-2), and Cd8−/− mice were subjected to chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding. Results In ALD patients, duodenal CD8+ T cells were selectively reduced and negatively correlated with liver injury and bacterial translocation markers, while intrahepatic CD8+ T cells were markedly increased. ScRNA seq analysis of ALD patient livers revealed several populations of CD8+ T cells expressing activation and survival genes (eg, Bcl2). Transcriptomics and functional studies revealed a key role of prosurvival BCL2 in this opposite regulation of CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding reduced CD8+ T cells specifically in the duodenum where ethanol levels are high. Inducing BCL2 in CD8+ T cells reversed ethanol-induced loss of duodenal CD8+ T cells, improved gut barrier function and ameliorated ALD, while CD8 deficiency was linked to enhanced neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the liver, exacerbating ALD in mice. Conclusions ALD is associated with loss of duodenal CD8+ T cells but elevation of intrahepatic CD8+ T cells, which aggravates and ameliorates ALD, respectively. Restoration of survival and functions of intestinal and intrahepatic CD8+ T cells may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for ALD patients.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse is associated with poor prognosis. While natural killer (NK) cell therapy can induce leukemia remission, infused NK cells are prone to exhaustion. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms driving NK cell exhaustion in AML patients could provide critical insights for developing novel strategies to optimize NK cell-based immunotherapies. In this study, we systematically investigated NK cell exhaustion in relapsed AML patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) through phenotypic assessments, functional assays, and RNA sequencing analyses. Compared to NK cells from complete remission patients and healthy controls, NK cells from relapsed AML patients exhibited an exhausted phenotype, marked by reduced maturity, elevated expression of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, impaired cytotoxicity, and suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Notably, NKG2A expression levels on NK cells correlated with disease progression. Blockade or genetic knockout of NKG2A effectively reversed NK cell exhaustion both in vitro and in an AML mouse model. Furthermore, activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in exhausted NK cells. We found that excessive activation of the NKG2A/HLA-E axis was associated with PI3K-AKT pathway inhibition, and blocking the NKG2A/HLA-E interaction or knocking out NKG2A restored AKT phosphorylation in exhausted NK cells. In summary, AML cells drive NK cell exhaustion through overactivation of the NKG2A/HLA-E axis and suppression of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Targeting the NKG2A/HLA-E axis represents a promising therapeutic approach to restore PI3K-AKT signaling and reverse NK cell exhaustion.">

Several innate humoral responses to viral infections have also been identified. Adaptive immunity includes common cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and humoral responses. Th1, Th2, and Tfh CD4+ T cell responses have been shown to help activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and to help promote the class switching of antiviral antibodies. Enteroviruses were shown to induce innate immune responses and the tropism of the virus that was mediated through viral attachment proteins (VAPs) and cellular receptors was directly related to the risk of severe disease in a primary infection.

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has made important breakthroughs in cancer treatment, however, currently only parts of cancer patients benefit from ICB therapy. The suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) impedes the treatment response of immunotherapy, indicating the necessity to explore new treatment targets. Here, we reported a new potential immunotherapeutic target, Dickkopf-3 (DKK3), for cancer treatment. DKK3 expression is up-regulated in the tumors from multiple cancer types, and high DKK3 expression is associated with worse survival outcome across different cancers. We observed that DKK3 directly inhibits the activation of CD8+ T cells and the Th1 differentiation of CD4+ T cells ex vivo. Also, by establishing four different mouse cancer models, we found that DKK3 blockade triggers effective anti-tumor effects and improve the survival of tumor-bearing mice in vivo. DKK3 blockade also remodels the suppressive TIME of different cancer types, including the increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells, IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells, Th1 cells, and decreased infiltration of M2 macrophages and MDSCs in the TIME. Moreover, we found that combined blockade of DKK3 and PD-1 induces synergistic tumor-control effect in our mouse cancer model. Therefore, our study reveals the impact of DKK3 in the TIME and cancer progression, which suggests that DKK3 is a novel and promising immunotherapeutic target for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background: The chaotic, over-activated tumor vasculature promotes tumor growth and erodes most current therapies. Although Notch activation critically regulates angiogenesis, the broad roles of Notch has dampened its druggability. Methods: Gene-modified mice with a Cdh5-CreERT transgene were employed to activate/block Notch signaling in endothelial cells (ECs). Multiple transcriptome analyses were conducted to compare gene expression profiles. qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to determine gene expression level. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to observe morphological alterations and immune microenvironment in tumors. Nanoparticles (PEI-PEG-cRGD) were used to deliver siRNA into tumor ECs (TECs) in vivo. Results: Genetic Notch activation or blockade in TECs normalizes or deteriorates tumor vessels, respectively. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that Notch activation selectively reduced the proliferating TEC subset, which accounted for about 30% of TECs and gave rise to other TEC subsets. Notch activation or blockade downregulated or upregulated MYC, respectively. MYC overexpression canceled Notch activation-induced proliferation arrest of TECs in vitro, and a MYC inhibitor normalized tumor vessels in RBPj deficient mice, suggesting that MYC is the authentic Notch target in normalizing tumor vessels. Nanoparticles encapsulated with MYC siRNA (EC-siMYC) or miR-218 (EC-miR-218), a Notch-downstream miRNA suppressing MYC, were able to mitigate Notch inhibition-induced tumor vessel defects. Combination of cisplatin with MYC blockade exhibited improved therapeutic effects. Moreover, MYC blockade promoted T cell infiltration and enhanced anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Conclusions: Together, our data have demonstrated that Notch activation normalizes tumor vessels by repressing the proliferating TEC subset via MYC, and targeting endothelial MYC using nanoparticles bearing siRNA or miRNA is an efficient strategy for tumor anti-angiogenic therapy.">

        <tr id="Upon activation, B cells undergo either the germinal center (GC) or extrafollicular (EF) response. While GC are known to generate high‐affinity memory B cells and long‐lived plasma cells, the role of the EF response is less well understood. Initially, it was thought to be limited to that of a source of fast but lower‐quality antibodies until the GC can form. However, recent evidence strongly supports the EF response as an important component of the humoral response to infection. EF responses are now also recognized as a source of pathogenic B cells in autoimmune diseases. The EF response itself is dynamic and regulated by pathways that are only recently being uncovered. We have identified that the cytokine IL‐12 acts as a molecular switch, enhancing the EF response and suppressing GC through multiple mechanisms. These include direct effects on both B cells themselves and the coordinated differentiation of helper CD4 T cells. Here, we explore this pathway in relation to other recent advancements in our understanding of the EF response's role and highlight areas for future research. A better understanding of how the EF response forms and is regulated is essential for advancing treatments for many disease states.">

These receptors collectively impair T cell function via distinct molecular pathways, contributing to immune evasion and cancer progression. This review highlights the therapeutic promise of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in reversing T cell exhaustion while delving into the complex molecular processes and functional works of these important co‐inhibitory receptors in tumourigenesis.

 GBM (glioblastoma) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Despite advances in immunotherapy, current treatment modalities have only provided a modest benefit to GBM patients. We propose that enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy for GBM requires approaches that increase T cell infiltration and reprogram the myeloid cells to a more pro-inflammatory state. We previously reported that S100A4 is a critical regulator of immune suppressive myeloid and T cell phenotypes and also a major regulator of glioma stem cells in GBM. Our preliminary data show that targeting S100A4 in either glioma cells or stromal cells is sufficient to reprogram the tumor immune landscape and extend survival of glioma bearing mice, indicating that S100A4 is a promising therapeutic target. We recently developed a S100A4 blocking monoclonal antibody; however, this antibody does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) efficiently to confer significant therapeutic benefit in glioma bearing mice. To overcome this challenge, we generated a bispecific S100A4-TfR antibody (BsA) that allows robust BBB penetration and accumulation in the brain. We assessed efficacy of BsA treatment in a highly aggressive and therapy-resistant, syngeneic mouse model of GBM (SVP). Using ELISA, confocal immunofluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and bulk RNA sequencing, we report that BsA treatment accumulates in the gliomas and reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment to increase T cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory activation. Furthermore, BsA treatment in combination with αPD1 checkpoint blockade significantly extends survival in the SVP mouse glioma model. Combination treated tumors exhibit extensive CD8 T cell infiltration and increased tumor reactive CD4 and CD8 T cells compared to controls. In addition, the BsA is taken up intracellularly within GBM cells and depletes S100A4 and nuclear SOX2 protein. In vitro treatment of GBM stem cell cultures with the BsA reduced self-renewal, as measured by the secondary sphere formation assay. These results indicate that the BsA is a promising agent to reprogram the GBM immune landscape and target GBM cell stemness through inhibition of both extracellular and intracellular S100A4 protein. We are currently performing in vivo efficacy studies in additional murine glioma models, and deeper mechanistic studies using single cell RNA sequencing and functional assays.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal cancer of the central nervous system, presenting substantial treatment challenges. The current standard treatment, which includes surgical resection followed by temozolomide and radiation, offers limited success. While immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have proven effective in other cancers, they have not demonstrated significant efficacy in GBM. Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in supporting tumor growth, fostering treatment resistance, and shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Preclinical studies show promising results for therapies targeting TAMs, suggesting potential in overcoming these barriers. TAMs consist of brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, both exhibiting diverse phenotypes and functions within the tumor microenvironment. This review delves into the origin, heterogeneity, and functional roles of TAMs in GBM, underscoring their dual roles in tumor promotion and suppression. It also summarizes recent progress in TAM-targeted therapies, which may, in combination with other treatments like immunotherapy, pave the way for more effective and personalized strategies against this aggressive malignancy.">

 Pancreatic cancer, an immunologically "cold" tumor, poorly responds to immunotherapy. TAMs, key immune cells in its microenvironment, drive tumor progression. Despite recent progress in macrophage-targeted therapies like CSF1R inhibitors, clinical results in pancreatic cancer are disappointing, with unclear mechanisms. Surufatinib, a CSF1R inhibitor, hinders macrophage differentiation into an immunosuppressive state. Surufatinib alters macrophage differentiation pathways, but resistance is mediated by the emergence of damage-associated macrophages. A subset of these macrophages, characterized by high GPR34 expression, is enriched in refractory pancreatic cancer patients. Through activation of the LysoPS-GPR34 axis, these macrophages enhance efferocytosis and subsequently downregulate MHC-I, leading to CD8+ T cell exhaustion.



 Tumor immune microenvironment alterations in pancreatic cancer patients after surufatinib treatment were analyzed via scRNA-seq. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry were performed on tumor tissue microarrays and fresh surgical specimens. GPR34 conditional knockout mice with orthotopic tumors were analyzed via flow cytometry. The mechanisms of CD8+ T cell exhaustion were investigated using in vitro co-culture systems of macrophages and CD8+ T cells. The efficacy of GPR34 antagonists in combination with immunotherapy and chemotherapy was evaluated in spontaneous tumor models.



 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on tumor specimens from patients enrolled in clinical trials receiving surufatinib plus chemotherapy. The analysis revealed changes in the tumor immune microenvironment, identifying a subset of damage-response macrophages characterized by high GPR34 expression. Notably, this macrophage population was significantly enriched in treatment-resistant patients. These high expression GPR34 macrophages activated damage-response signaling via the lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS)-GPR34 axis, promoting CD8+ T cell exhaustion through the release of chronic inflammatory factors and enhanced efferocytosis. Furthermore, efferocytosis further promotes the formation of autophagolysosomes in macrophages, leading to increased degradation of MHC-I, thereby suppressing the antigen-presenting function of macrophages. Targeting GPR34+ macrophages significantly improved the efficacy of both immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

        <tr id="In a recent study published in Nature , Breart et al. 1 untangled the controversy surrounding interleukin (IL)-27 ’ s role in regulating T cell differentiation and immune responses in cancer. Their ﬁ ndings reveal that IL-27 enhances the persistence and effector functions of tumor-in ﬁ ltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes (TILs), preventing exhaustion, sustaining T cell-dependent tumor control and immunotherapy ef ﬁ cacy without signi ﬁ cant systemic side effects. Effective immune control of cancer relies on the ability of T lymphocytes to in ﬁ ltrate tumors and exert their cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, surviving neoplastic cells promptly adapt to immune-patrolled environments and evolve under immune system pressure to progressively avoid immune clearance, establishing immune-privileged conditions that sustain limitless growth. These immune evasive strategies are deployed in 3 main routes: “ camou ﬂ age ” (reduced immunogenicity and immune exclusion), “ coercion ” (impaired local immune activation through the establishment of a highly immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment [TME]), “ cytoprotection ” (avoiding neoplastic cell killing through intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms). 2 Therapeutic approaches targeting immune checkpoints and aiming to restore cancer immune surveillance signi ﬁ cantly improved the survival and life quality of cancer patients, although their ef ﬁ cacy is restricted to a fraction of patients and tumor types. Breart et al. attempted to identify novel, actionable immunological targets by charting the cytokines, which are known to be the most potent immune system regulators.

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of malignant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) disorders characterized by cytopenia, ineffective hematopoiesis, as well as the potential to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The pathogenesis of MDS is influenced by intrinsic factors, such as genetic insults, and extrinsic factors, including altered bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) composition and architecture. BMM is reprogrammed in MDS, initially to prevent the development of the disease but eventually to provide a survival advantage to dysplastic cells. Recently, inflammation or age-related inflammation in the bone marrow has been identified as a key pathogenic mechanism for MDS. Inflammatory signals trigger stress hematopoiesis, causing HSPCs to emerge from quiescence and resulting in MDS development. A better understanding of the role of the BMM in the pathogenesis of MDS has opened up new avenues for improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the disease. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current knowledge regarding the significance of the BMM to MDS pathophysiology and highlights recent advances in developing innovative therapies.">

However, their widespread use is limited by the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). This review provides a comprehensive overview of GvHD in the context of allogeneic cell-based cancer immunotherapy and evaluates current strategies to mitigate its effects. Key strategies include genetic engineering approaches such as T cell receptor (TCR) knockout (KO) and T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) CAR knock-in. Alternative immune cell types like natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells offer potential solutions due to their lower alloreactivity. Additionally, stem cell technology, utilizing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), enables standardized and scalable production of engineered CAR-T cells. Clinical trials evaluating these strategies, such as UCART19 and CTX110, demonstrate promising results in preventing GvHD while maintaining anti-tumor efficacy. The review also addresses manufacturing considerations for allogeneic cell products and the challenges in translating preclinical findings into clinical success. By addressing these challenges, allogeneic cell-based immunotherapy continues to advance, paving the way for more accessible, scalable, and effective cancer treatments.">

Although clinical detection is relatively easy, a considerable number of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, featuring local tissue infiltration and distant metastasis. Cemiplimab, along with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, enhances T cell activation by blocking the PD-1 pathway, resulting in notable improvements in clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, approximately 50% of the patients with advanced cSCC remain unresponsive to this therapeutic approach. It emphasizes the importance of finding innovative therapeutic targets and strategies to boost the success of immunotherapy across a wider range of patients. Therefore, we focused on frequently neglected functions of innate immune cells. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immune cells exhibit considerable heterogeneity and plasticity, fundamentally contributing to tumor initiation and development. The identification and eradication of cancer cells, along with the modulation of adaptive immune responses, are essential roles of these cells. Consequently, targeting innate immune cells to activate anti-tumor immune responses presents significant potential for enhancing immunotherapeutic strategies in cSCC.">

        <tr id="Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a fatal bile duct cancer with high resistance and recurrence rates, with only one fifth of patients eligible for surgical treatment. The disease resists standard chemotherapy and often relapses. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promise for hematological malignancies but faces challenges in solid tumors due to resistance mechanisms like PD-L1 expression, which tumors use to evade the immune system. To address this challenge, we developed fifth-generation CAR T cells targeting integrin αvβ6 that also secrete anti-PD-L1 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to target both tumor cells and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. We examined integrin αvβ6 and PD-L1 expression in CCA cell lines and engineered T cells to express either fourth-generation CAR T cells targeting integrin αvβ6 (A20 CAR4 T cells) or fifth-generation CAR T cells with anti-PD-L1 scFv secretion (A20 CAR5 T cells). In vitro, A20 CAR5 T cells exhibited less exhaustion and superior long-term functionality compared to A20 CAR4 T cells. In 3D spheroid models of CCA, A20 CAR5 T cells demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity and better infiltration into the spheroid core. These findings suggest that A20 CAR5 T cells have significant potential and warrant further in vivo studies and clinical trials.

Conventional interventions including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy provide only modest survival benefits, underscoring an urgent need for more effective therapies. Although immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of several solid tumors, its clinical benefit in pancreatic cancer has so far been disappointing. Mounting evidence indicates that a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), dominated by tumor−associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid−derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), drives immune evasion, tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance through complex cytokine and chemokine networks.

        <tr id="Background Multiple myeloma (MM) is a biologically heterogeneous malignancy of clonal plasma cells, often progressing from MGUS or smoldering MM. It causes anemia, bone lesions, and immune dysfunction due to abnormal plasma cell expansion in the bone marrow. Neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors may influence MM progression by affecting immune cells and the bone marrow niche. Growing evidence points to a role for neuroimmune regulation in tumor immunity. Despite therapeutic progress, disease heterogeneity and resistance highlight the need for new strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment and neuroimmune axis. Methods This investigation exploited single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze MM and high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMMh) samples, identifying 11 distinct cell types. We examined their transcriptional signatures, stemness, proliferative properties, and metabolic pathways, with particular attention to neuroimmune interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Using trajectory inference tools such as CytoTRACE, Monocle2, and Slingshot, we traced the differentiation paths of MM cell subpopulations and identified key signaling pathways that may influence immune responses and tumor progression. Results The analysis identified four distinct subpopulations of myeloma cells, with the C0 IGLC3+ myeloma cells representing the least differentiated and most proliferative subset. These cells played a critical role in MM progression and may contribute to immune evasion mechanisms. Additionally, receptor-ligand interactions within the tumor microenvironment were identified, which may be influenced by neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors. These findings suggest that the nervous system and immune modulation significantly affect tumor biology, highlighting potential therapeutic targets that could be exploited to overcome resistance to conventional therapies. Conclusion This single-cell analysis provided new insights into the cellular diversity and differentiation trajectories in MM, offering a deeper understanding of the complex neuroimmune interactions that drive tumor progression and resistance. By incorporating the role of neuroinflammation and immune modulation, our study suggested novel therapeutic strategies targeting the neuroimmune axis in oncology, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective, personalized treatment approaches for MM.">

        <tr id="Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy arising in the bone marrow. Despite advancements in therapies, this disease becomes refractory such that relapse and death is inevitable. Immune evasion and drug resistance are partly due to MM-osteoblast cell interactions in the bone marrow microenvironment (BME). We conducted complementary in-vitro and in-vivo studies, each providing insights that converge to a treatment-relevant hypothesis. Several human MM cell lines (MM.1S, U266, NCI-H929, L363) were co-cultured with osteoblasts for two days to assess proliferation in response to two proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, and carfilzomib. Osteoblasts, represented by the hFOB fetal osteoblast-derived cell line, markedly enhanced MM cell growth and conferred significant chemoresistance determined by a luciferase-based viability assay. We then performed RNA sequencing of FACS-sorted MM.1S and hFOB cells following 1 day of coculture. We found a significant upregulation of Type I Interferon (IFN) signaling pathway target genes (e.g. IRF7, ISG15, p<0.001) in co-cultured MM.1S cells compared to MM.1S cells alone. Two pro-inflammatory chemokines, CXCL1 and CXCL8, were markedly increased in hFOB co-cultured cells compared to hFOB monocultures. A 9-fold increase of CXCL1 (p<0.0001) and CXCL8 (p<0.0001) was validated by qPCR and both chemokines were elevated in co-culture supernatants in a cytokine array. Parallel studies in vivo, using the 5TGM1 MM immunocompetent mouse model, revealed that low-dose decitabine (DAC), a DNA hypomethylating agent known to induce a Type I IFN response significantly reduced MM burden (p<0.0001) and prolonged survival by 9 days (p<0.001), compared to MM-bearing mice treated with PBS vehicle. From these two lines of work, we hypothesize that low-level IFN signaling, mediated by MM cell cross-talk with osteoblasts, is supportive of MM cell proliferation and survival, while hyper-induction of the IFN pathway by DAC may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of this epigenetic-modifying agent, both alone and in combination with immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. This postulated biphasic response to Type I IFN signaling in MM cells is consistent with prior reports from other experimental systems. Our findings highlight the utility of epigenetic therapy in MM and suggest that hyper-induction of IFN signaling in MM cells, which already have low-level activation of this pathway from their interactions with osteoblasts, should be further investigated as a therapeutic mechanism.

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that plays a pivotal role in tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion. Recent advancements have highlighted the intricate interplay between immune cell infiltration patterns, immune checkpoint dysregulation, and metabolic reprogramming in driving HNSCC immune escape. Despite these insights, significant challenges remain, including the incomplete understanding of specific immune evasion pathways and the lack of personalized therapeutic strategies. To address these gaps, this review introduces a novel “Trinity” regulatory network of immune evasion in HNSCC, encompassing: (1) metabolic reprogramming-mediated immune checkpoint modulation, (2) stromal cell-driven immune dysfunction, and (3) epigenetic remodeling fostering immune tolerance. This framework provides a theoretical foundation for the development of multi-targeted combination therapies and offers innovative strategies to overcome immune evasion. Additionally, this review systematically synthesizes the current understanding of the relationship between the HNSCC microenvironment and immune escape, with a focus on emerging immunotherapeutic approaches such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy. Leveraging cutting-edge single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we elucidate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the HNSCC immune landscape and propose a new paradigm of “lineage plasticity-driven immune adaptation.” These insights not only advance our understanding of HNSCC biology but also pave the way for the development of precision immunotherapies aimed at improving patient survival and quality of life. By integrating multidisciplinary perspectives, this work underscores the importance of targeting the TME to achieve durable clinical responses and overcome immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC.">

These cells display remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity within the TME, adapting to hypoxic and nutrient-deprived conditions through metabolic reprogramming while critically influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. The metabolic reprogramming of TANs not only modulates their functional phenotypes but also reshapes tumor biological behaviors and therapeutic responses by regulating metabolic intermediates and cellular interactions within the TME. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms underlying TANs metabolic reprogramming has significant implications for deciphering the molecular basis of tumorigenesis, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and optimizing immunotherapeutic strategies.

 Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a key immune checkpoint molecule that regulates immune responses by binding to PD-1 on T cells, contributing to immune tolerance and suppression. PD-L1 expression in solid tumors has become an important biomarker for evaluating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy. Characterization of PD-L1 expression on immune cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, in patients with various solid tumors, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and breast cancer was performed using cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear samples using flow cytometry. In addition to PD-L1, co-expression of markers of T cell activation (e.g., CD69, CD86, Ki67) and exhaustion (e.g., PD-1, LAG3) was analyzed to gain a comprehensive understanding of immune cell status. PD-L1 expression was highly variable across patients within solid tumor indications, with elevated expression found on CD8+ T cells, suggesting an upregulation in response to persistent tumor antigenic stimulation. Furthermore, PD-L1+ CD8+ T cells often co-expressed markers of exhaustion, such as PD-1 and LAG-3, indicating a potential role for PD-L1 in T cell dysfunction and immune evasion. These findings underscore the complexity of PD-L1 expression by immune cells and its role in shaping immune responses in solid tumor patients. Through integrating PD-L1 profiling with other markers of immune activation and exhaustion, this highlights the potential of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response and provides insights into the mechanisms of immune evasion in solid tumor cancers.

TGM2 enhances the secretion of suppressive cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) via a microtubule-dependent pathway that secondarily impairs T-cell activation and cytotoxicity. Targeting TGM2, either genetically or with microtubule-disrupting agents, restores T cell function and promotes tumor control in preclinical PDAC models. These findings are discussed in the context of our recent work on vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling in PDAC, which independently drives immune evasion through VIP receptor (VPAC)-mediated induction of TGF-β1 secretion from tumor cells, upregulation of programmed death-ligand 1 on myeloid cells, and inhibition of effector T cells. Here, we have explored the mechanistic intersections between TGM2 and VIP signaling—including cytokine secretion, vesicle trafficking, and immune checkpoint regulation—and propose combination strategies that integrate TGM2 or VIP inhibition with checkpoint blockade. Together, these insights suggest a new framework for overcoming immune resistance in PDAC by targeting cancer cell-intrinsic secretory programs and offer a rationale for biomarker-guided, multimodal immunotherapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematologic cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). This leads to significant dysfunction and suppression of the immune system in affected patients. Myeloma cells employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate immune and non-immune cells, evading immune surveillance and enhancing their survival. One key factor in this evasion is the disruption of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune mechanisms. Extensive evidence indicates that in the presence of myeloma cells, DC numbers are notably reduced, and their phenotype and function are altered, impairing their ability to present antigens and activate robust T-cell responses effectively. Despite rapid advances in MM treatment, with promising strategies such as DC-based vaccines being already achieved, DC dysfunction remains a substantial hurdle, associated with or contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes, disease relapse, and MM’s persistence as an incurable disease. To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms through which myeloma cells transform DCs into their “accomplices,” undermining immune responses. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the role of DCs in MM. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of DCs in anti-MM immunotherapy, discussing persistent challenges and highlighting emerging perspectives that may lead to promising breakthroughs for improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological cancer. It remains incurable, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. In this study, we investigated a panel of peptides derived from a functional motif of Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family 1 (SLAMF1) with single amino acid substitutions and found that several of them exhibited potent anti-cancer activity by inducing MM cell death. The most potent peptide P7N4 significantly reduced the viability of both IL-6-dependent and -independent human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), proteasome inhibitor-resistant MM cells, and primary MM cells, while exerting minimal effects on healthy blood cells. Furthermore, P7N4 enhanced the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan. When combined with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, P7N4 potentiated the anti-cancer effect of bortezomib in a highly aggressive murine MM model. Mechanistically, P7N4 induced apoptosis in MM cells by disrupting key pro-survival pathways, leading to reduction in IRF4, MYC, and β-catenin levels, as well as inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in peptide-sensitive HMCL, P7N4 significantly altered the expression of IRF4-associated genes. These effects were likely mediated by direct interaction of peptide with IRF4, targeting this transcription factor for degradation. Overall, our findings established P7N4 as a promising therapeutic candidate for MM, warranting further optimization and in-depth mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Background Immune evasion is a crucial event in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The identification of new immunotherapeutic targets may provide a promising platform for advancing PDAC treatment. This study aims to investigate the role of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase-5 (B4GALT5) in immune evasion by pancreatic cancer cells and evaluate its potential as an immunotherapeutic target. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis using RNA sequencing data and tissue microarrays from patients with PDAC to investigate the association between B4GALT5 expression and patient prognosis. Using animal models, we further explored the impact of B4GALT5 on the quantity and activity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. RNA sequencing and co-immunoprecipitation were used to explore the mechanism by which B4GALT5 regulates major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) levels. Results Our study demonstrates that high expression of B4GALT5 in tumor cells is significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with PDAC and reduced cytotoxic activity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Specifically, B4GALT5 suppresses MHC-I expression in tumor cells through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway, enabling them to evade immune surveillance by CD8+ T cells. Conclusions B4GALT5 impairs CD8+ T-cell recognition of tumor cells by regulating MHC-I levels, thereby promoting immune evasion. This makes B4GALT5 a highly promising immunotherapeutic target for improving the poor prognosis of patients with PDAC.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a significant health problem that disproportionately affects the elderly. With the aging worldwide population being less responsive to protective vaccines, there is an urgent need for strategies that can protect the elderly from community-acquired viral infections. Background/Objectives: Allo-priming is a novel immunomodulatory vaccine concept using allogeneic, living, activated Th1 cells that are rejected by the host, creating anti-alloantigen Th1 immunity, increasing Th1 titers. Th1 cells orchestrate cellular immunity, and the age-related decline in Th1 cells contributes to weakened cellular immune response in the elderly, which correlates with poor responsiveness to vaccines and increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections. Increased Th1 cell titers in the elderly were hypothesized to reverse immunosenescence and restore cellular immune function. Restoration of cellular immune function was predicted to restore broad respiratory viral protection through a heterologous immune mechanism. Methods: A phase I/II, multi-center, open-label clinical trial was conducted in 40 healthy adults over 65 years of age to investigate the safety of allo-priming and the effects this vaccination strategy has on cellular immune function over time. Results: Allo-priming had a benign safety profile and significantly increased the titers of circulating Th1 cells. The increase in Th1 cells was shown to provide broad, self-amplifying respiratory viral protection over time in an ex vivo cytopathic effect assay without additional vaccinations and without any viral antigens included in the formulation, as well acting to increase neutralizing antibody titers in low-responding individuals previously vaccinated for COVID-19. Conclusions: These results provide support for an expanded clinical evaluation of this immunomodulatory vaccination strategy as a possible method to restore cellular immune competence to the elderly and provide broad heterologous immune protection from respiratory viral infections without the need for frequent vaccine re-formulations or booster shots (National Library of Medicine: NCT04441047).">

However, the role of EVs in the immune-suppressive milieu of MM is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of MM-derived EVs on T cells, focusing on markers of T cell exhaustion. Using activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors, we observed immunosuppressive effects such as upregulated expression of immune checkpoint markers on CD8+ T cells treated with MM-derived EVs. Proteomic analysis identified several proteins, such as IL-8, SLC1A5, PIN2, and FSP1, associated with regulation of T cell exhaustion and chronic inflammation. Surprisingly, sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) was enriched in MM cell line-derived EVs, implicating SPHK1/S1P signaling in the immunosuppressive effect of MM EVs. Thus, MM-derived EVs may promote T cell exhaustion via upregulating the expression of immune checkpoint markers and thereby contribute to the formation of the immune-suppressive milieu of MM, resulting in impaired T cell activity.">

 Solid tumors consist of tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), a dynamic system comprising various immune cells, mesenchymal cells, cytokines, microvesicles, extracellular matrix, and vascular lymphatic networks. The recruitment of lymphocytes into tumors is essential for effective anti-tumor immunity and successful immunotherapy. The tumor stroma serves as the initial site for effector immune cell infiltration, and the mesenchymal network directly influences immune cell function. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the largest proportion of TME intrinsic stromal cells, with significant heterogeneity and multiple origins, and perform different biological functions. CAFs can not only induce PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, but also promote PD-L1 expression in TME immune cells through the release of cytokines and vesicles, thereby facilitating tumor immune escape. In this study, we found that in some breast cancer patients, PD-L1 in tumor stroma was abundantly expressed and associated with immunosuppression and poor prognosis, and the distribution of tumor stromal PD-L1 was also closely related to the activation status of CAFs. Furthermore, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing on PD-L1low and PD-L1high stroma cells, respectively. We found a CAF subset in high PD-L1 expression group, which was characterized by immune exhaustion and hyperactivation. Notably, Regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) pathways were significantly upregulated in this subset. Furthermore, we confirmed that RGS4 induces fibroblasts to adopt a PD-L1 immunodepleting phenotype and establishes an immune-exhaustive mesenchymal network that modulates anti-tumor immunity. In addition, we validated in humanized murine models that targeting RGS4 significantly enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy in animal models. The spatial heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression in TME is a primary factor contributing to the limited efficacy of PD-L1/PD-1 antibody therapies. Currently, numerous studies aim to enhance the immune response by inhibiting or degrading PD-L1. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing PD-L1's spatial distribution could fundamentally enhance its clinical application. This study explored the mechanism governing the spatial distribution difference of PD-L1, and provided more possibilities for the development of targeted intervention in CAFs.

 Immunotherapy is a powerful pillar of cancer therapy that still faces barriers due to cancer-mediated immunosuppression. Immunogenic cell death recruits and activates antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through engagement of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to pro-inflammatory Signal 3 cytokine production required for full activation of adaptive immune cells, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The Fes tyrosine kinase suppresses innate immune responses in APCs by inhibiting PRR signaling and regulating cytokine trafficking. In non-cancer contexts, Fes may guard against consequences of overactive innate immunity, such as endotoxic shock or autoimmunity. However, this inhibitory effect on APCs may serve as a checkpoint to suppress successful anti-cancer immunotherapy by obstructing efficient priming of cancer specific CTLs. We hypothesize that Fes inhibition in APCs will improve Signal 3 cytokine signaling, resulting in greater adaptive immunity and tumor control.



 Using bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) from wildtype (WT) or Fes knockout (fes-/-) mice, we assessed LPS-induced PRR signalling by immunoblot analysis, production of key Signal 3 cytokines by multiplex ELISA, and the level of cell-associated cytokines by flow cytometry. The ability of BMDMs to prime CTLs was assessed in antigen cross-presentation co-cultures with OT-1 T cells. Using E0771 and B16F10 syngeneic orthotopic mouse engraftment models, we compared the efficacy of doxorubicin and anti-PD-1 to control tumor growth and prolong survival in WT and fes-/- mice. Tumors and spleen immune profiles were analyzed by flow cytometry. WT or fes-/- BMDMs were adoptively transferred into E0771 and B16F10 tumours to directly assess their relative ability to control tumour growth.



 fes-/- BMDMs displayed improved PRR signaling, increased IFNβ, IL-12, and TNFα secretion, and greater levels of internal and cell-surface IL-12 following LPS stimulation. In antigen cross-presentation assays, LPS stimulated fes-/- BMDMs had improved CTL priming. Tumor control and survival were greater in fes-/- mice in both the E0771 and B16F10 engraftment models. Doxorubicin and the combination of doxorubicin and anti-PD-1 were more effective in fes-/-. This was especially striking in the B16F10 model, which is known to be resistant to PD-1 therapy. Immune profiling of tumors showed increased CTL and NK cell activation and PD-1 positivity, and a shift from predominately M2- to M1-polarized tumor associated macrophages in fes-/- mice. Intratumorally injected M1-polarized fes-/- BMDMs were better able to control tumor growth in both E0771 and B16F10 models.



 Fes acts as an innate immune checkpoint whose inhibition may enhance anti-cancer immunotherapy. We believe this effect is due to an increase in inflammatory signalling, and improved signal 3 cytokine signalling in fes-/- APCs.

 The checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 have been clinically successful as therapeutics for melanoma due to their ability to reinvigorate the immune system. However, about half of patients do not benefit from these treatments, suggesting there are still barriers to CD8+ T cell activation or infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Additionally, while the combination therapy of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 (Ipilimumab-Nivolumab) improves response rate and overall survival compared to monotherapies, it also leads to increased toxicity and immune-related adverse events. Recent studies have demonstrated that CD8+ T cell co-stimulation through the 41BB axis is critical for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade efficacy in melanoma, yet those signals may be limited or unavailable to tumor-associated antigen-specific T cells within the TME. However, nontargeted 4-1BB signaling poses a risk of widespread peripheral immune activation and liver toxicity, as was the case for the 4-1BB agonist Urelumab. PF-08046049 (BB228) is a bispecific molecule comprised of a CD228-specific antibody and 4-1BB-directed Anticalin proteins. CD228 is highly expressed in several cancer indications but is low on normal tissues, thus BB228 targets 4-1BB co-stimulation to T cells within the TME. We tested the efficacy of BB228 as a monotherapy and in combination with the current melanoma standard of care (SOC) treatments, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4. In an IO-resistant LL2 model, neither BB228 nor anti-PD-1 monotherapy led to tumor control. However, in combination, BB228 synergized with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 to promote tumor clearance. We found that while anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 can target and expand stem-like CD8+ T cells in both the tumor-draining lymph node and TME, BB228 is able to drive the differentiation of those stem-like cells into effectors, resulting in tumor killing. These data illustrate that BB228 has a distinct and complementary mechanism of action from the current melanoma SOC treatments.

 The effectiveness of current cancer immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), adoptive T cell therapy (ACT), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, is limited in solid tumors due to the scarcity of tumor-specific immunogenic targets, impaired tumor antigen processing, and immune cell dysfunction. Cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are the primary effectors in antitumor immunity, yet their dysfunctional or exhausted states present significant challenges to successful immunotherapy. Recent study of pre-infusion CAR T cells in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have identified polyfunctional T cell subsets that exhibit engagement of diverse immune programs, characterized by the production of various cytokines and chemokines (IFN-γ, GMZB, and MIP1a) which corroborated with enhanced patient survival. In our previous clinical study involving ACT in melanoma patients (NCT00665470), we observed engraftment of CD8+ T cell clones without objective antitumor responses (non-responders), while spontaneous complete responses were noted in two patients prior to ACT (responders). A comparative analysis of CD8+ T cell clones derived from responders versus non-responders identified Cytotoxic and Regulatory T cell Molecule (CRTAM) as a differentially expressed gene in activated CD8+ T cell clones from responders. We propose CRTAM as a predictive marker for a potent and durable CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor response and to explore its potential role in enhancing the antitumor efficacy of ACT and CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors. We have thus far established the role of CRTAM in defining enhanced effector functions of murine cytotoxic CD8+ T cells by examining antigen specific P - Mel CRTAMHi Vs CRTAMLo CD8+ T cell subsets with CRTAMHi T cells showing enhanced cytotoxic profile (perforin/ GMZB), cytokine production (IFN- γ), antitumor cytotoxicity, immunophenotype and gene profile using both in vitro and in vivo models. RNA sequencing analysis reveals that CRTAMHi P-Mel T cells exhibit a unique gene expression profile associated with cytokine activity, signal transduction, cell migration, and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, increased overall survival in patients with solid tumors exhibiting T cell infiltration and increased CRTAM expression was demonstrated by query of publicly available databases, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Therefore, CRTAM identifies a unique subset of CTL with enhanced effector functions, with deployment of diverse immune programs leading to improved antitumor activity. T cells engineering to knockout and express CRTAM is currently underway to evaluate the feasibility of enhancing antitumor responses in, in vivo murine models of ACT. Engineering CD8+ T cells for CRTAM may generate more effective and durable T cell products for ACT and CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors.

        <tr id="Lung tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) are critical for the local control of respiratory tract infections caused by influenza A viruses (IAV). Here we compare TRM populations induced by intranasal adenoviral vector vaccines encoding hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein (NP) with those induced by an H1N1 infection in BALB/c mice. While vaccine-induced TRM express high levels of CD103 and persist longer in the lung parenchyma, short-lived, H1N1-induced TRM have a transcriptome associated with higher cytotoxic potential and distinct transcriptional profile as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing. In both the vaccine and H1N1 groups, NP-specific CD8+ T cells expand during heterologous influenza virus infection and protect the mice from disease. Meanwhile, lung inflammation in response to an infection with unrelated respiratory syncytial virus do not influence the fate of pre-existing TRM. Our preclinical work thus confirms that inflammatory conditions in the tissue shape the phenotypic and functional characteristics of TRM to serve relevant informations for optimizing mucosal vaccines.">

 Cytokine therapies improve antigen priming, increase effector immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and enhance cytolytic activity. There is strong interest in the interleukin (IL) family to activate effector immune cells in the TIME. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is known for its pro-inflammatory effects, T-cell differentiation properties, regulation of natural killer (NK) cell responses, and production of interferon-gamma (IFNγ). The TIME in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) impairs tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte function, decreases the production of effector cytokines, and contains suppressive immunocytes. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in several solid cancers with similar mutation burden and immune infiltration as HNSCC. However, most HNSCC patients do not respond to treatment with single-agent immunotherapy, in large part due to the immunosuppressive TIME. Therefore developing strategies to mitigate the suppressive tumor immune microenvironment and elicit a robust anti-tumor immune response through combinatorial treatments is key. Herein, we combined anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (α-PD-1) with IL-12 to reverse exhausted phenotypes and activate effector immune cells in the HNSCC TIME. We hypothesize that the combination of IL-12 and α-PD-1 therapy will stimulate anti-tumor effector immunocytes to target immune-infiltrated and immune-excluded TIME in the preclinical oral cancer models, MOC1 and MOC2. Continuous treatments of intratumoral IL-12 and systemic α-PD-1 either as monotherapies or in combination were administered to MOC1 tumor-burdened mice. We observed tumor regression in the MOC1 tumor-burdened mice with IL-12 + α-PD-1 combinatorial treatments, IL-12, and α-PD-1 monotherapies. Mice that rejected the primary tumor challenge were rechallenged with MOC1 cells. We observed complete responses in IL-12 + α-PD-1 treatment groups and tumor regression in IL-12 monotherapy groups. Additionally, in the more aggressive HNSCC preclinical model, MOC2, IL-12 treatments led to prolonged survival. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of IL-12 + α-PD-1 combinatorial treatments in an immune-infiltrated HNSCC preclinical model. Future studies will include the addition of small molecules, such as Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) agonists, to enhance antigen presentation and activate anti-tumor effector cells to combat an aggressive TIME.

        <tr id="Effective co-stimulation of CD8 T cells is critical for maintenance of TCF-1+ stem-like CD8 T cells necessary for long-term tumor control. NKG2D co-stimulation of CD8 T cells via binding of stress ligands such as membrane-bound MIC enhances CD8 T cell effector functions and is important for promoting memory development. Cancer cells often shed MIC into a soluble form (sMIC) that inhibits CD8 T cell activation. TRAMP prostate tumor mice expressing human MICB (TRAMP/MICB) treated with anti-sMIC/MIC antibody elicited potent anti-tumor responses with re-invigorated CD8 T cell immunity. However, mechanisms of CD8 T cell reprogramming by NKG2D co-stimulation in the tumor microenvironment are poorly understood. In this study, we used scRNA-seq of CD8 TILs from TRAMP/MICB mice treated or untreated with the anti-sMIC/MIC antibody to investigate the hypothesis that anti-sMIC/MIC therapy reprograms CD8 T cells via NKG2D pathway co-stimulation, optimizing TCR-dependent effector and memory responses. Adult male TRAMP/MICB mice were treated with 200µg anti-sMIC/MIC antibody intraperitoneally twice per week for 4-6 weeks. Prostate tumors were collected, and CD45+ cells were flow sorted for scRNA-seq. scRNA-seq analyses were validated using flow cytometry. Tumors from mice treated with anti-sMIC/MIC therapy revealed enhanced functional heterogeneity of CD8 T cell subtypes. In contrast to tumors from untreated mice that were populated with primarily effector and/or exhausted CD8 T cells, tumors from treated mice were enriched in NKG2D+ TCF-1+ stem-like CD8 T cells. This effect of anti-sMIC/MIC therapy was then recapitulated in the syngeneic TRAMP-C2-MICB tumor model. TCF-1+ CD8 T cells expressed higher levels of NKG2D compared to TCF-1- CD8 T cells, and displayed differential utilization of PI3K/Akt signaling pathways as well as upregulation of epigenetic regulators of CD8 T cell function such as Kdm6b and Setd2. Antigen-specific CD8 T cells chronically stimulated ex vivo with anti-sMIC/MIC antibody in complex with sMICB maintained greater proportions of TCF-1+ stem-like CD8 T cells compared to antigen stimulation alone or in combination with sMICB. The results suggest that NKG2D co-stimulation via anti-MIC/sMIC therapy reprograms CD8 TILs to promote their development of TCF-1+ stem-like function necessary for persistence of the anti-tumor response, and provides proof-of-concept for the translational potential of NKG2D signaling modulation in CD8 T cells to treat cancer.

        <tr id="The immune system plays a major role in pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a devastating lung disease with limited treatment options. Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immune cells with remarkable immunosuppressive functions. We hypothesized that their anti‐inflammatory activity may dampen PF by inhibiting inflammation and its transition to fibrosis. Here, we studied the emergence of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)‐ and monocytic (M)‐MDSCs in a murine model of PF. We assessed immunological, histopathological, and clinical changes at days 3, 7, 14, and 21 following bleomycin challenge. A comprehensive overview of the role of MDSCs during the acute lung injury and chronic phase of pulmonary fibrosis is provided, along with the effects of MDSCs adoptive transfer and depletion. Inflammation and fibrosis increased over a period of 21 days after bleomycin administration. In the lung, the number of PMN‐MDSCs increased, while M‐MDSCs decreased over the time following bleomycin challenge. Especially, M‐MDSCs showed enhanced suppressive activity on day 3 following bleomycin challenge. Adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs attenuated inflammation and fibrosis development. However, depletion of PMN‐MDSCs did not lead to an exacerbation of PF. Our results suggest that adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs can ameliorate the inflammatory responses and thus the development of fibrosis in a bleomycin‐induced pulmonary fibrosis model.">

 Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but remains largely ineffective in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). A hallmark of PDAC is local immunosuppression, driving cytotoxic T cell exclusion and deactivation, undermining immune-mediated tumor control. Better understanding of the cellular crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and identifying stromal and immune populations shaping this immunosuppressive landscape is critically needed. Oncogenic KRAS activation in PDAC cells promotes recruitment and proliferation of tumor-supporting stromal cells while excluding cancer-targeted cytotoxic T cells. Local immunosuppression is driven by interactions between subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and resident myeloid cells. Previous efforts to reverse immunosuppression by targeting individual stromal populations have largely failed, highlighting the complexity of stromal interactions in the TME. The stromal diversity of PDAC complicates investigating paracrine signaling involving multiple cell types. To address this, we use in vivo mouse models that recapitulate human disease, alongside a novel tumor explant system enabling short-term culture of intact human or murine PDAC tissue. These explants retain histopathological architecture and cellular diversity, providing a medium-throughput platform for testing drugs and mechanistic hypotheses in the native TME. Preliminary data show that Smoothened inhibition (SMOi) reduces myCAF proliferation and activity but drives CD11b-positive myeloid cell expansion in vivo. We hypothesize local immunosuppression in PDAC is sustained by a delicate balance between myCAFs and myeloid cells, collectively hindering T cell infiltration. Single-cell RNA sequencing of control vs. SMOi-treated murine PDAC identified stromal subpopulations maintaining immunosuppression and revealed specific myeloid subtypes emerging after SMOi. Strikingly, combining SMOi with anti-Gr1 or CCR1 inhibition (CCR1i) markedly increased cytotoxic T cell numbers—up to 20-fold—within the TME. We are now exploring whether these T cells’ activity can be further enhanced using additional immunomodulatory agents. Testing therapeutic combinations in the same TME allows us to identify synergistic effects that may inform future PDAC immunotherapy. Our work elucidates complex immunosuppressive mechanisms in PDAC, leveraging a novel tumor explant system and in vivo models. Our ultimate goal is to develop translatable regimens that neutralize local immunosuppression, enabling cytotoxic T cells to infiltrate, proliferate, and effectively attack cancer cells.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and highly lethal type of primary brain tumor in adults. Therapeutic failure is partly attributed to a fraction of Glioblastoma Stem Cells (GSCs) that show high levels of heterogeneity and plasticity. GSCs exist in a transcriptional gradient between two states: Developmental (Dev) and Injury Response (IR) in which IR-GSCs exhibit more invasive behaviors. While previous studies have identified fitness genes in GSCs, the genes required to establish and maintain the Dev and IR states remain poorly defined. To identify the regulators of the IR GSC state, we performed a phenotypic genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screen in patient-derived GSCs based on cell surface expression of the IR marker CD44. Notably, we found that perturbations of the histone acetyltransferase EP300 in IR GSCs led to decreased CD44 cell surface expression, significant downregulation of gene expression signatures associated with the IR state, and to decreased self-renewal and invasion. Furthermore, genetic targeting of Ep300 in a mouse GBM model delayed tumor initiation and/or progression. Collectively, our results establish EP300 as a regulator of the IR state in GSCs and provide a mechanistic basis for its therapeutic targeting in GBM. Significance A genome-wide phenotypic CRISPR-Cas9 screen in a patient-derived Glioblastoma Stem Cell line identified the genes required to maintain the Injury-Response cellular state, with a focus on the histone acetyl transferase gene EP300. This study suggests how therapeutic targeting of cellular state could reduce the aggressiveness of GBM tumors.">

        <tr id="Cellular senescence, a state of stable cell cycle arrest, acts as a double-edged sword in cancer biology. In young organisms, it acts as a barrier against tumorigenesis, but in the aging population, it may facilitate tumor growth and metastasis through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in the immune system, particularly in the surveillance, targeting, and elimination of malignant and senescent cells. However, age-related immunosenescence is characterized by declining NK cell function resulting in diminished ability to fight infection, eliminate senescent cells and suppress tumor development. This implies that preserving or augmenting NK cell function may be central to defense against age-related degenerative and malignant diseases. This review explores the underlying mechanisms behind these interactions, focusing on how aging influences the battle between the immune system and cancer, the implications of senescent NK cells in disease progression, and the potential of adoptive NK cell therapy as a countermeasure to these age-related immunological challenges.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but has yet to be translated into brain tumors. Studies in other solid tumors suggest a central role of B-cell immunity in driving immune checkpoint blockade efficacy. In glioblastoma (GBM), tumor B-cells are driven into a regulatory B-cell state that suppresses immune activation and T-cell function.


METHODS
We used spatially resolved transcriptomics and multiplex immunofluorescence to characterize B-cell neighborhoods within GBM and identify enhanced TGFβ-signaling between myeloid and B cells. We generated conditional knockouts to investigate the effects of TGFβ signaling on B-cell function and survival in vivo. Additionally, we combined TGFβ blockade with PD-1 inhibition to evaluate their combined anti-glioma efficacy.


RESULTS
Our findings reveal that myeloid cells are the primary interactors with B-cells in GBM through the TGFβ pathway. Pharmacological or genetic TGFβ blockade expanded intratumoral B-cells and synergized with PD-1 inhibition to enhance survival (60% tumor eradication in dual-treated mice). Therapeutic efficacy critically depended on B-cells, as their depletion abolished survival benefits. Dual αVβ8/PD-1 blockade reduced B-cell-mediated suppression of CD8⁺ T-cell cytotoxicity and increased plasmablast differentiation, while partial efficacy in RagKO mice implicated ancillary roles for innate immunity.


CONCLUSION
Targeting TGFβ signaling using an anti-αVβ8 blocker can impact anti-tumor immunity through different possible mechanisms, of which we highlight the rescuing of B-cell function through synergy with PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapy. Our work underscores the critical role of intratumoral B-cell immunity in enhancing immunotherapy against brain tumors.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has become standard of care in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Changes in immunophenotypes observed at first diagnosis predict therapy outcome but little is known about the resolution of these alterations in remission. Comprehensive characterization of immune changes from fresh, peripheral whole blood revealed a functionally relevant increase of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, reduced naïve T-cells, and an increase of activated and terminally differentiated T-cells before treatment which aggravated after therapy. Suggesting causal relation, injection of lymphoma in mice induced similar changes in the murine T cells. Distinct immune imprints were found in breast cancer and AML survivors. Identified alterations persisted beyond five years of ongoing complete remission and in DLBCL correlated with increased pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-6, B2M, or sCD14. The chronic inflammation was associated with functionally blunted T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides and reduced responses correlated with reduced Tn-cells. Persisting inflammation was confirmed by deep sequencing and by cytokine profiles, together pointing towards a compensatory activation of innate immunity.

 Tumor-associated factors released by cancer cells can promote immune suppression and tolerance to radiation or immune therapy. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) is a tumor-associated antigen released by cancer cells. In cervical cancer, elevated pre-treatment SCCA in the serum is seen in 28-88% of patients and these patients are more likely to experience treatment resistance and recurrence. The poor prognosis for patients with elevated SCCA shows the need for improve treatment strategies. Here, we aim to understand the mechanism of action of circulating SCCA to tumor progression and response to radiotherapy. Using sequencing analysis of paired pre- versus on-treatment biopsies, we found that patients with elevated serum SCCA had increased macrophages expressing immunosuppressive features and T-cell immune checkpoints, inversely correlated with inflammatory signaling and radiation-induced interferon-stimulated gene expression. The supplement of SCCA protein (rSCCA) to the media during in vitro macrophage differentiation promotes anti-inflammatory cytokines and gene expression. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice treated with intra-peritoneal rSCCA expressed high M2-associated markers and functional inhibition of T cell activation. Moreover, we found that mouse tumors engineered to express SCCA with a signal peptide promoting extracellular secretion displayed increased CSF1R+ TAM infiltration and decreased T cell activation, associated with reduced response to combined radiation and anti-PDL1 treatment. Giving the findings, we hypothesized that targeting TAMs in tumors with elevated SCCA is imperative. We further demonstrated that tumor-bearing mice showed improved response to radiation and immune checkpoint therapy when receiving concurrent CSF1R blockade, abolishing the protective effect of high circulating SCCA. Our results suggest that blockade of CSF1R signaling or other myeloid-targeting therapeutics will optimize response to radiation and PD-L1 blockade in cervical cancer, particularly those with high circulating SCCA.

        <tr id="Background Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is a key immune checkpoint involved in HIV-related immune escape, but its precise role and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the effects of PD-1 inhibition on HIV infection and T-cell function, focusing on the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls. T-cell subsets were analyzed for PD-1 expression via flow cytometry. The impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on T-cell numbers, apoptosis, and PD-1 expression was assessed. PD-1 blockade was performed using pembrolizumab, and its effects on T-cell survival and cytokine secretion were evaluated. MAPK/NF-κB signaling was analyzed using Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation, while latent HIV activation was assessed by measuring HIV-1 LTR transcriptional activity in J-Lat cells. Reverse-ChIP assays explored the interaction between HIV-1 Nef protein and the PD-1 promoter. Results PD-1 expression was higher in T cells from HIV-infected individuals compared to healthy controls, with no significant change following ART. PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab reduced T-cell apoptosis and enhanced cytokine secretion (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2). PD-1 inhibition also activated latent HIV in J-Lat cells. Western blotting revealed reduced phosphorylation of MAPK and NF-κB pathway components (p-MEK1/2, p-p38 MAPK, p-NF-κB p65), and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed a direct interaction between PD-1 and SHP-2, regulating these pathways. Conclusions PD-1 mediates HIV immune evasion through the MAPK/NF-κB pathways. PD-1 blockade restores T-cell function and activates latent HIV, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for HIV treatment.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by a dense tumor stroma and a five-year survival rate of less than 13%. Its poor prognosis arises from rapid progression, early metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Despite, advancements in chemotherapy and immunotherapy, outcomes remain dismal, largely due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Previous work in our lab demonstrated the efficacy of ivosidenib, an FDA-approved inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), also inhibits wild-type IDH1(wtIDH1) under conditions mimicking the PDAC TME. Here we show that targeting wtIDH1 suppresses cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and enhancing antitumor immune responses by reducing immunosuppressive immune cell populations. In vitro studies were conducted using Miapaca-2, Panc-1 and KPC cell lines. Cells were cultured in low glucose (2.5mM) and low magnesium (0.08mM) media to mimic the TME. Cell viability was assessed using Titer-Glow, Pico Green and colony formation assays. Cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels were determined via DCFDA and Mito-SOX assays using colorimetric and flow cytometry analysis. The therapeutic potential of ivosidenib, was evaluated through cell proliferation (Cell Trace assay), cell cycle arrest (BrdU) assay via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, and apoptosis detection (Annexin-V/PI staining). In vivo studies employed orthotopic and autochthonous murine models of PDAC to assess drug efficacy and its impact on immune cell infiltration in the TME. Our data revealed that targeting wtIDH1 suppress cell proliferation and DNA synthesis and elevated cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels leading to increased apoptosis. In orthotropic pancreatic murine models of pancreatic cancer, ivosidenib treatment significantly increased the infiltration of immune cells (CD45+), and CD4+ T cells in particular, including naïve T (CD45RA) and central memory T cells (CD45RO). Additionally CD127 expression was enhanced, promoting the survival and proliferation of naïve and memory T cells, potentially boosting anti-tumor immunity. Notably, treatment led to reduction of anti-inflammatory M2-like monocytes and adaptive immunity associated CD8+T cells, suggesting reshaped immune landscape favoring antitumor responses. Wild-type IDH1 plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer. Our data demonstrates that IDH1 inhibition not only reduces cancer cell proliferation in vitro but also remodels the TME in in vivo, enhancing immune responsiveness. Modulation of the TME via IDH1 inhibition offers a promising avenue to improve efficacy of existing therapies, including chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors as a part of combination treatment strategies.

        <tr id="Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) recipients often experience late-onset human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivations following termination of letermovir prophylaxis. Letermovir prophylaxis extends the window for protective B- and T-cell reconstitution; however, our understanding of humoral responses and their contribution to HCMV immune control remains limited. Combining serological and flow cytometric analyses in 42 HCMV-seropositive alloSCT recipients, we herein provide the first comprehensive longitudinal (days 90-270 post-transplant) characterization of HCMV-specific humoral responses, natural killer (NK)-cell phenotypes, and {gamma}{delta} T cells in the letermovir era. HCMV controllers showed predominantly IgG-driven responses, higher pre-reactivation V{delta}1+ T-cell frequencies, and stronger expansion of ''memory-like'' NK cells than patients with clinically significant CMV infection (csCMVi). In contrast, csCMVi patients showed delayed HCMV-specific IgG production, IgM-skewed humoral responses, and stronger post-reactivation expansion of memory B cells and V{delta}1+ {gamma}{delta} T cells. Early {gamma}{delta} T-cell reconstitution by day 90 was predictive of future HCMV control. HCMV-specific IgG levels correlated only weakly with {gamma}{delta} T cells but showed distinct associations with ''memory-like'' NK-cell reconstitution in HCMV controllers, suggesting synergisms between humoral and cellular immunity. Collectively, these findings highlight a need to study anti-HCMV immune protection beyond type-1 T cells and refine risk stratification models in alloSCT patients by inclusion of novel immune markers such as {gamma}{delta} T-cell frequencies and phenotypes. Leveraging the extended B-cell reconstitution window created by letermovir, novel immunotherapies (e.g., therapeutic antibodies) and future vaccines might boost humoral anti-HCMV immunity and benefit from synergisms with {gamma}{delta} T cells and ''memory-like'' NK cells in improving HCMV control.">

        <tr id="Background The immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) present significant hurdles in tumor therapy. The identification of therapeutic agents that can target both CSCs and the TME could be a potential approach to overcome treatment resistance. Methods We conducted an in vivo chemical screen to identify F1929-1458, which is capable of eliciting an organism-wide response to destroy stem cell tumors in Drosophila. We then performed functional validation using a mouse colorectal cancer graft tumor model established with the CT26 cell line characterized by its high content of CSCs. Single-cell sequencing was employed to analyze alterations in the TME. Small molecule pull-down mass spectrometry, cellular thermal shift assay, drug affinity experiment, and molecular docking were utilized to identify the target of F1929-1458. An in vitro co-culture system was applied to establish that the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by the tumor cells are accountable for the activation of dendritic cells (DCs). Results We demonstrated that F1929-1458 treatment enhanced T cell infiltration and T cell mediated tumor regression, its anti-tumor effect was nullified in nude mice and was abolished after anti-CD3 neutralizing antibody treatment. We found that F1929-1458 binds NFKB1 to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway in tumor cells. The activation further elicits cellular stress, causing tumor cells to release DAMPs (HMGB1-gDNA complex, ATP, and OxLDL). These DAMPs, in turn, stimulate the cGAS-STING and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in DCs, resulting in the generation of type I IFNs and IL-1β. These cytokines facilitate the maturation of DCs and antigen presentation, ultimately enhancing T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, we showed that the combination of F1929-1458 and the anti-PD-1 antibody exhibited a synergistic anti-tumor effect. Conclusion Our study identified a novel NFKB1 agonist that promotes anti-tumor immunity by remodeling the TME and activating DCs and that may provide a new way to overcome resistance to current anti-tumor immunotherapy in colorectal cancer.

EBV plays a crucial role by promoting cancer cell survival, altering immune responses, and fostering immune escape mechanisms. This subtype of lymphoma frequently arises in immunocompromised individuals, such as HIV-positive patients, transplant recipients, and those with primary immunodeficiencies, and is often resistant to standard treatments. Current classifications recognize the importance of EBV status and immune dysfunction in diagnosis and therapy planning. New strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, EBV-targeted T-cell therapies, and novel molecular approaches, show promise in improving outcomes. Understanding the complex interplay between viral infections, immune status, and genetics is essential for developing targeted treatments and personalized patient care.">

Furthermore, we highlight emerging therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells, focusing on strategies to reprogram their functions, inhibit their suppressive effects, or eliminate pathological populations altogether, as well as the latest preclinical and clinical trials advancing these approaches. By integrating insights from these studies, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of myeloid cells in hematological malignancies and their potential as therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Therapeutic innate immune stimulation within the tumor microenvironment can potentiate endogenous antitumor T cell immunity. Strategies for controlled activation of cGAS/STING signaling are currently under intense investigation. DNase 3'-repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is essential for cellular DNA disposal, which prevents autoimmunity ensuing from cGAS/STING activation by endogenous DNA. TREX1-deficient tumor cells elicit enhanced protective immunity in syngeneic models. Here, we showed that induced inactivation of the Trex1 gene in host (non-cancer) cells yields improved type I IFN- and T cell-dependent control of established TREX1-competent tumors. Host TREX1 deficiency was well tolerated and triggered selective immune cell infiltration into tumors but not into other tissues. Induced systemic loss of TREX1 in tumor-bearing mice resulted in enhanced intra-tumoral T cell proliferation and massive increase in numbers of effector and effector-like 'exhausted' cells, enabling complete rejection in combination with checkpoint inhibition. To conclude, systemic TREX1 inhibition is a promising approach to boost anti-tumor immunity and to overcome immune evasion mediated by cancer cell-intrinsic cGAS/STING inactivation.">

        <tr id="Immune resilience is the capacity of the immune system to recover from sepsis-induced organ injury and reestablish host defense. While sepsis survivors are often viewed as immunocompromised, recent studies suggest that some may acquire adaptive immune traits that enhance resistance to secondary infections.We employed a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model to study polymicrobial sepsis and subsequent immune responses. Listeria monocytogenes was used as a model intracellular pathogen to assess immune protection. We analyzed myeloid cell phenotypes using single-cell RNA sequencing and evaluated lipid metabolic changes through quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, serum cytokine assays, and plasma lipidomics.Sepsis-surviving mice showed enhanced resistance to Listeria infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed transcriptional reprogramming in splenic CD11b+Ly6Chigh myeloid cells, including downregulation of lipoprotein lipase and lipid efflux genes. CD11b+ myeloid cells exhibited increased lipid droplet accumulation, accompanied by elevated serum interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) levels. Plasma lipidomics identified systemic lipid remodeling, with increased phosphatidylserine and decreased phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol levels.Our findings suggest that sepsis survival induces lipid metabolic reprogramming in myeloid cells, contributing to enhanced immunity against intracellular pathogens. These insights reveal potential therapeutic targets within lipid metabolic pathways to improve host defense in sepsis survivors.">

        <tr id="The molecular barriers that cause acute xenograft rejection have been identified and addressed by generating genetically modified (GM) animals, knocked out for specific xenoantigens (xenoAgs), and expressing regulatory molecules for both complement and coagulation pathways among others. The focus of xenotransplantation research now lies in delayed xenograft rejection. Dendritic cells (DC) are a specific subpopulation of professional antigen‐presenting cells (APC) that play a crucial role in the context of organ transplantation. DCs, originating from both the xenograft and the recipient, have the capacity to present xenoAgs to the recipient's immune system via their respective major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules leading to rejection. These processes are known as direct and indirect presentation, respectively. However, under certain microenvironmental conditions, DC develops into anti‐inflammatory regulatory cells that can induce immunological tolerance. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the general characteristics and functions of DC from species relevant to xenotransplantation, specifically humans, non‐human primates (NHP), and pigs. It will also cover the process of xenoAg presentation, different methods for generating DC with regulatory properties in vitro, and finally, discuss the current strategies for using regulatory DC to improve xenograft acceptance by inducing tolerance.">

These checkpoints play a key role in maintaining cardiac homeostasis by preventing immune-mediated damage to critical organs like the heart. In this study, we explored the involvement of PD-1 and CTLA-4 in cardiovascular complications, particularly atherosclerosis and myocarditis, which can lead to heart failure. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using animal models and clinical data to assess the effects of immune checkpoint inhibition on cardiac function. Our findings indicate that disruption of PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways exacerbates myocardial inflammation, accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation, and promotes the development of heart failure. Additionally, we observed that immune checkpoint inhibition in these models led to increased infiltration of T lymphocytes, higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced tissue damage. These results suggest that PD-1 and CTLA-4 are critical in preserving cardiac health, and their inhibition can result in severe cardiovascular toxicity. Our study emphasizes the need for careful monitoring of cardiovascular health in patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological cancer and treatment options remain limited. In a recent first-in-class Phase I trial, the monoclonal IgE antibody MOv18, specific for the tumour-associated antigen Folate Receptor-α, was well-tolerated and preliminary anti-tumoural activity observed. Pre-clinical studies identified macrophages as mediators of tumour restriction and pro-inflammatory activation by IgE. However, the mechanisms of IgE-mediated modulation of macrophages and downstream tumour immunity in human cancer remain unclear. Here we study macrophages from patients with epithelial ovarian cancers naive to IgE therapy. High-dimensional flow cytometry and RNA-seq demonstrate immunosuppressive, FcεR-expressing macrophage phenotypes. Ex vivo co-cultures and RNA-seq interaction analyses reveal immunosuppressive associations between patient-derived macrophages and regulatory T (Treg) cells. MOv18 IgE-engaged patient-derived macrophages undergo pro-inflammatory repolarisation ex vivo and display induction of a hyperinflammatory, T cell-stimulatory subset. IgE reverses macrophage-promoted Treg cell induction to increase CD8+ T cell expansion, a signature associated with improved patient prognosis. On-treatment tumours from the MOv18 IgE Phase I trial show evidence of this IgE-driven immune signature, with increased CD68+ and CD3+ cell infiltration. We demonstrate that IgE induces hyperinflammatory repolarised states of patient-derived macrophages to inhibit Treg cell immunosuppression. These processes may collectively promote immune activation in ovarian cancer patients receiving IgE therapy.">

 mMDSCs (monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells) are recruited to solid tumors and serve as potent inhibitors of T-cell mediated antitumor immunity. Therapeutic depletion of mMDSCs presents an exciting opportunity to increase the frequency and durability of anti-tumor clinical responses achieved with immune checkpoint inhibition. Currently, no marketed or investigational agents function by specific mMDSC depletion and no specific markers for therapeutic targeting of these cells have been clinically validated. We demonstrate that mMDSCs express high and homogeneous levels of the chemokine receptor CCR2. Because of this, we have developed a CCR2 targeting Cytotoxicity Targeting Chimera, which potently binds CCR2 on cells, and when combined with the CyTAC platform antibody, eliminates target cells via enhanced effector mediated killing. We demonstrate that the CCR2 CyTAC can deplete CCR2+ monocytes and mMDSCs from the periphery and intratumorally both ex vivo and in vivo. In the MC38 syngeneic tumor model this depletion leads to T-cell dependent anti-tumor activity and increases the levels of CD8 T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. We show across multiple additional syngeneic tumor models that depletion of CCR2+ cells remodels the tumor microenvironment causing an increase in tumor infiltrating CD8 T-Cells and a decrease in regulatory T-cells and mMDSCs. These PD changes were observed in both responding and non-responding tumor models where response can be enhanced with anti-PD1.


 We have applied our CyTAC technology to specifically target CCR2 expressing cells and depletion of mMDSCs and demonstrate that this can lead to remodeling of the tumor microenvironment from a pro-tumor to pro-inflammatory phenotype. This agent has potential for treating tumors with high mMDSC content regardless of tumor type.

        <tr id="Sepsis associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe pulmonary inflammation. Previous research has suggested that allergic immune diseases are associated with a lower risk of sepsis. Therefore, we hypothesized that certain molecules involved in type 2 inflammation are beneficial for the outcome of sepsis associated ARDS. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is known to promote Th2 responses in allergic disease, however, its role in sepsis associated ARDS remains limited.To investigate the role of TSLP in sepsis associated lung injury, we administered exogenous recombinant TSLP to wild-type mice, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. At 24 hours post-treatment, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were collected for analysis. The ratio, number, phenotype, and function of immune cells and cytokine levels were measured. Additionally, murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were prepared and stimulated with LPS and TSLP to further verify our findings experimentally. To explore the molecular mechanisms of TSLP’s effect, analysis of transcriptome sequencing and single-cell transcriptome sequencing and subsequent experiments were performed.In LPS-induced acute lung injury models, pretreatment with TSLP significantly alleviated lung injury, suppressed inflammatory cytokines secretion, and reduced macrophages and neutrophils infiltration. In addition, TSLP treatment significantly inhibited M1 macrophage polarization and promoted M2 macrophage differentiation. Transcriptome sequencing suggested IFN-γ as a potential target of TSLP, and single-cell transcriptome sequencing showed that innate like T cells are important source of IFN-γ. Consistently, flow cytometry showed that proportion of IFN-γ-producing iNKT cells was decreased by TSLP administration in the acute lung injury model. Intriguingly, Jα18−/− mice, which are completely deficient in invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, exhibited not only significantly less severe lung inflammation but also a notably higher degree of anti-inflammatory Arg1+ M2 macrophages infiltration when compared with their LPS-sensitized wild-type counterparts.These findings not only underscore the crucial role of TSLP in the regulation of sepsis-associated ARDS but also demonstrate its potential clinical value as both a predictive biomarker for early detection and a molecular target for therapeutic intervention.">

 Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are the main effectors of anti-tumor immunity, and their activation is dependent on carefully coordinated interactions between antigen presenting cells (APCs) and CD4+ T cells (Th). In a pivotal model, synchronized interaction between a dendritic cell (DC), Th, and CTL were posited as requisite for effective CTL responses. Recent studies have resurrected this hypothesis in the context of anti-tumor immunity and demonstrated the function of 3 cell type clusters in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response in murine tumors and human cancer. We hypothesized intratumoral 3-cell type clusters are present in an “immune excluded tumor”, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA), outside the context of immunotherapy. Analysis of single cell RNAseq and PDA tumors identified DC:Th:CTL clusters, defined as DC, Th, and CTL within 20µm radius, occurring with ∼15% of DCs. Analysis of multiplex proteomics data from fibrolamellar carcinoma, a rare stromal dominant liver tumor with poor immune infiltration, revealed the presence of DC:Th:CTL clusters. We sought to confirm our findings in a larger dataset using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) on a tissue microarray (TMA) of >500 patients with untreated resected PDA. Using automatic image analysis software, we identified cell types based on surface marker expression, specifically tumor cells, CTL, Th, macrophages, and non-macrophage APCs. 3-cell type clusters were found in 90% of tumor samples, occurred with ∼10% of APCs, located >50µm from tumor cells, and correlated strongly with APC:Th dyads. Weak correlation was found between 3-cell type clusters and isolated cell types, suggesting cluster formation is unlikely to be related to abundance of infiltrating immune cells. DC:Th:CTL clusters were also readily seen in scST of untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Analysis of PDA, NSCLC, and CRC scST datasets revealed that CTLs within triads were more likely to have an effector-like phenotype. Th within triads were enriched in CXCL13+-like Th phenotype, which previously has been associated with immune triads. Using associated clinical data in the PDA TMA, we found that patients with the highest tertile of APC:Th:CTL clusters had improved overall survival compared to patients with the lowest tertile (HR=0.70, p=0.005). Similar findings were found for patients with the top tertile of APC:Th dyads (HR=0.63, p=6.x10-4), but not APC:CTL or CTL:Th dyads (HR=0.76 and 0.77 and p=0.16 and 0.07, respectively). Overall, our findings demonstrate 3-cell type clusters are readily found in an “immune excluded” tumor like PDA without immunotherapy and are associated with improved patient outcomes. These data are strong evidence for the role of 3-cell type clusters in endogenous anti-tumor immune responses and point toward future opportunities for immunotherapeutic intervention.

 Immune based therapies for large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) have transformed our approach to this disease. Therapies such as CD3 bispecific T cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have diverse mechanisms of action, yet they all depend on activation of T cells to affect an anti-cancer response. While the often-dramatic responses seen to immune therapies have captured wide-spread attention, the majority of patients treated with immune based therapies for relapsed lymphoma will not achieve long term cure, and poor T cell function is a common mechanism for treatment failure. Several seminal studies have identified T-cell metabolic reprogramming as a key mechanism behind T-cell exhaustion. Mechanisms to reverse metabolic exhaustion and reinvigorate T-cells has been shown to lead to increased anti-tumor responses. Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) proteins regulate a variety of cellular processes in tumor and immune cells. Inhibitors of SUMOylation (SUMOi) have shown anti-tumor activity in a CD8 T-cell dependent manner, however, the mechanism behind this T-cell dependence is unknown.
 We show that a novel covalent SUMOi, SB-4826 leads to a robust anti-tumor response which is dependent on CD8+ T-cells in lymphoma. Using single cell metabolic studies, we demonstrate that SUMOi increases the metabolic rate, glycolytic dependency and proliferative capacity of tumor infiltrating PD1+ CD8+ T cells. We further show that SUMOylation is increased following T-cell activation, and exhausted CD8+ TILs have the highest levels of total SUMOylation of T-cell subsets. We validate these findings of increased SUMOylation in CD8+ TILs in human lymphoma samples. In a CD19 CAR T-cell model, we show that pulse treatment of CAR T-cells with SUMOi leads to enhanced anti-lymphoma activity in vitro.
 Using a mass-spectroscopy/immunoprecipitation approach, we identified more than 1, 000 proteins which are SUMOylated in T-cells. We found that multiple T-cell transcriptional regulators, including TBET, LEF1 and TCF1 are all SUMOylated either during a resting or activation state in CD8+ T-cells. Together, these findings suggest a novel role for SUMOylation in regulating T-cell effector activation and exhaustion, by modulating metabolic state likely through the regulation of key transcriptional T-cell programs.

        <tr id="This review discusses reprogramming the breast tumor immune microenvironment from an immunosuppressive cold state to an immunologically active hot state. A complex interplay is revealed, in which the accumulation of metabolic byproducts—such as lactate, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ammonia—is shown to impair T-cell function and promote tumor immune escape. It is demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), and IL-35. Notably, IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells and breast cancer cells. The conversion of conventional T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells, along with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. It is further demonstrated that key immune checkpoint molecules—such as PD-1, PDL1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT—are upregulated within the TME, leading to Tcell exhaustion and diminished immune responses. The blockade of these checkpoints is shown to restore T-cell functionality and is proposed as a strategy to convert cold tumors into hot ones with robust effector cell infiltration. The therapeutic potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy is also explored, and targeting specific tumor-associated antigens, such as glycoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, is highlighted. It is suggested that CART cell efficacy can be enhanced by combining these cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents, thereby overcoming the barriers imposed by the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, the role of the microbiome in regulating estrogen metabolism and systemic inflammation is reviewed. Alterations in the gut microbiota are shown to affect the TME, and microbiome-based interventions are proposed as an additional means to facilitate the cold-to-hot transition. It is concluded that by targeting the metabolic and immunological pathways that underpin immune suppression—through combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade, CART cell therapies, and microbiome modulation—the conversion of the breast TME from cold to hot can be achieved. This reprogramming is anticipated to enhance immune cell infiltration and function, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapies and leading to better clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients.

 Among the more than 300, 000 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients every year, 5∼20% of them will develop symptomatic brain metastasis (BrM) with a lower than 20% of 1-year survival rate. Our group previously reported that brain tumor microenvironment (TME)-mediated PTEN downregulation in BrM tumor cells leads to increased secretion of the CCL2 chemokine, which enhances the infiltration of CCR2+ bone marrow derived myeloid cells to promote brain metastasis outgrowth. Here, we further assessed whether targeting CCL2 can effectively inhibit BrM progression. Indeed, targeting CCL2 through either knocking-down CCL2 or with Ccl2-blocking antibody exhibited significant inhibition of BrM growth. Mass cytometry analysis of the brain TME demonstrated dramatically decreased immune suppressive myeloid populations in the CCL2-targeted group, which is consistent with our previous findings. Remarkably, natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells were dramatically increased in the TME of CCL2-knockdown BrMs. To test the contribution of the increased NK cells and/or CD8+ T cells on BrM inhibition by CCL2-targeting, we specifically depleted NK cells or CD8+ T cells with anti-NK1.1 or anti-CD8 antibody. Our data showed that depleting NK cells, but not CD8+ T cells, blocked BrM inhibition effect of CCL2-targeting, indicating that the increased infiltration of NK cells significantly contributed to the BrM inhibition under CCL2 knockdown. These findings led us to postulate that CCL2 inhibits NK cell infiltration into BrM TME to facilitate BrM growth. Our in vitro NK cell migration assay with high- versus low-CCL2 tumor cells showed that high CCL2 level inhibited NK cell migration. In summary, our data indicate the potential of CCL2 targeting for controlling breast cancer BrM progression and highlight the pivotal role of NK cell-mediated innate immunity in combating BrM.

        <tr id="Introduction The CD4/CD8 ratio has emerged as a useful indicator of immune dysfunction and comorbid conditions in people living with HIV (PLWH). However, its optimal cut-off value is unclear. We explored the correlation between the CD4/CD8 ratio, immunosenescence markers and comorbid conditions. Methods We prospectively included PLWH on successful and stable ART (antiretroviral therapy) > 60 years old and receiving either BIC/FTC/TAF or DTG/3TC, in Nice, France. HIV-negative healthy subjects were included as controls. We measured T-cell subsets (naïve, central memory, effector memory and terminally differentiated cells) and the distribution of KLRG1 + CD57+ senescent cells. We correlated CD4/CD8 ratio, background measurements and comorbid conditions. Results We included 68 PLWH (median age 69 years, 31 years on ART, median CD4/CD8 ratio 0.76). PLWH had higher levels of senescence markers than controls (n = 8). Among PLWH, adjusting for age, gender, HIV follow-up and duration on ART, those with a CD4/CD8 ratio < 0.76 had more senescent CD8+ cells (AdjOR = 0.93, 95%CI = [0.88; 0.97], p-value = 0.003). Higher levels of CD8+ senescence persisted for lower CD4/CD8 ratios, with, in addition, a significant decrease in NK cells in case of a ratio < 0.4. After adjustment, CD8+ effector memory senescent cells were significantly more abundant in PLWH with hypertension. Conclusion PLWH on successful ART display elevated immunosenescence markers, mainly on CD8+ T-cells. A CD4/CD8 cut-off value below 0.4 showed the strongest association with immune dysfunction, including NK+ cells. Such results could be useful for identifying patients requiring closer follow-up and screening for complications.">

 A fundamental challenge in cancer biology is to understand why some people develop cancer and others do not despite similar genetic predispositions. Taking the blood system as an exemplar, we seek here to determine if the inflammatory milieu has distinct impact on the clonal fitness and selective advantage of mutant tissue stem cells at the expense of wildtype clones.
 Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an aging-associated phenomenon in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) acquire somatic mutations that result in clonal expansion of mutated blood cells and a 12-fold increased risk for myeloid neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, and other aging-associated diseases. Human lineage tracking studies have shown that pre-leukemic CH mutations often arising many decades before disease onset. Although CH has a prevalence as high as 1 in 3 in people over 60 years of age, only some individuals show a readily detectable clone size (≥2% and considered to have clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential). The mechanisms regulating CH clone size are poorly understood, but inflammation is elevated in individuals with CH. Extensive data from murine models also shows that inflammation reprograms HSCs to impair their function. This likely contributes to clonal selection in murine models of CH as acute inflammation also activates murine HSCs, skews them towards myeloid differentiation, and impairs their self-renewal. Some of these inflammatory responses include activation of target genes downstream of TNFα via NFkB, which is known to regulate HSC survival in both murine and human settings. Repeated inflammatory challenges have also been associated with sustained epigenetic changes and accelerated aging of murine HSCs, as well as expansion of clones bearing CH-associated mutations in Dnmt3a and Tet2, the two most frequently mutated genes in CH cases. However, we have shown extensive molecular and functional heterogeneity in the human HSC compartment at steady-state, and it is unclear whether all human HSC respond homogeneously to inflammation. If HSC respond heterogeneously, it is also unclear whether this would impact clonal selection such as during CH.
 To address these two questions, we developed inflammation-recovery xenograft models to determine the long-term molecular and cellular sequelae of repeated inflammatory challenge on human HSCs in an empirical fashion (Zeng, et al, in revision). No in vivo studies of inflammatory stress on human HSCs have been previously reported. In parallel, we generated a TARGET-seq+ data set of bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from nine DNMT3A or TET2-mutated CH donors and four age-matched controls with no detectable CH mutations (Jakobsen, et al, Cell Stem Cell, 2024). TARGET-seq+ combines simultaneous single cell profiling of transcriptome, genotype, and cell surface immunophenotype, enabling comparisons of mutant (CHMUT) and wild-type (CHWT) HSC obtained from individuals with CH to HSC from age-matched controls without CH. First, we established that human cord blood (CB) HSC in xenotransplantation models recapitulate phenotypes previously observed in the murine system following acute inflammatory activation for 16 hours using human TNFα or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, when we mimicked repeated inflammatory challenge through acute treatment with TNFα or LPS at 2w and 10w post-transplantation followed by analysis at 20w, we found a reduced human graft at 20w compared to PBS controls. Thus, repeated challenge resulted in a long-lasting functional HSC impairment long after the treatment. Single cell multiome analysis of human HSCs isolated from this model showed two bona fide HSC subsets: HSC-I showed few molecular changes in response to prior inflammatory stress. However, the second HSC subset, termed HSC inflammatory memory (HSC-iM) showed extensive chromatin accessibility and transcriptional changes 2.5 months after recovery from TNFα or LPS treatment. These changes are primarily in the AP-1 and NF-kB gene regulatory networks and while distinct, also bear striking similarity to epigenetic changes seen in murine epithelial stem cells following wounding. We found HSC-iM share core molecular programs with human memory T cells. Importantly, a transcriptional program reflecting HSC-iM was enriched in HSCs from recovered COVID-19 patients and in HSC from aged individuals and in HSC from individuals with CH from our TARGET-seq+ data set.
 To gain insight into the impact of the HSC-I and HSC-iM states on selective advantage in CH, we turned to our TARGET-seq+ data set. First, we directly identified both the HSC-I and HSC-iM populations in human CH cases (named HSC1 and HSC2 respectively) validating the relevance of the inflammation-recovery xenograft model established with CB HSC from which they were first identified and confirming that this is not a xenograft artifact. Second, when CHMUT and CHWT within a BM of a subject with CH are compared to each other, gene expression changes occur predominantly in HSC-iM and not HSC-I. Moreover, the presence of the CH mutation results in decreased enrichment of specific inflammatory pathways. Third, we confirmed that CHWT within HSC2-dominant hierarchies were stalled in differentiation, with reduced production of downstream progenitor populations compared to CHWT cells within HSC1-dominant hierarchies. By contrast, mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 were associated with increased progenitor abundance within HSC-iM-dominant hierarchies. Thus, HSC2/HSC-iM is inherently growth restricted, but CH mutations relieve this impairment leading to an increased HSC2/HSC-iM contribution to hematopoiesis and an overall clonal growth advantage. This lends further support to our conclusion that accumulation of HSC-iM underlies age-related hematopoietic dysfunction. We posit that HSC-iM is a “protective adaptation” to inflammation, representing a reserve pool of stem cells that requires a subsequently stronger inflammatory trigger for activation. Additionally, a key hypothesis our work is the notion that selective advantage of CHMUT HSC arises due to a decrease in differentiation output of CHWT HSC-iM. We are currently testing this hypothesis with CRISPR-mediated DNMT3A- and TET2-mutant CB HSC in our xenograft-inflammatory recovery models.
 We show that HSC-iM progeny monocytes are pro-inflammatory compared to those from HSC-I in our xenograft models, in the COVID patient recovery data, and in steady-state human BM data sets. To gain insight into whether HSC-I or HSC-iM have differing functional capacity or biases to generate downstream progeny, raw RNA sequencing data from the CD34+CD38-CD45RA- (HSC/Progenitor) scMultiome was combined with scRNA-seq data from CD33+ mature myeloid cells isolated from those same xenografts. This allowed us to examine the differentiation output of clonally defined HSC-I and HSC-iM. HSC-iM progeny, including monocytes and dendritic cells, retain transcriptional features of HSC-iM including inflammatory signaling pathways, while HSC-I do not. From a biological viewpoint, this is a step forward to addressing a conundrum in the field: many of the mature myeloid cells that respond to inflammation are extremely short-lived raising the question of how long-term inflammation can be sustained and drive the deleterious phenotypes associated with CH. Our data suggests that HSC-iM continuously produces inflammatory primed myeloid cells nominating HSC-iM as a novel cellular player in exacerbating systemic inflammation. In sum, the discovery of HSC-iM implicates the importance of the inflammatory milieu and provides a framework to address whether HSC-iM emerges as a ‘cost’ of adaptation to inflammation that modifies wildtype HSC fitness to drive selective advantage of CH-bearing HSC clones.

        <tr id="CD99 is a membrane protein critical for various immunological functions, including T-cell activation, protein trafficking, cell apoptosis, and leukocyte movement. It is also highly expressed in certain malignant tumors, contributing to the development, invasion, immune evasion, and adaptation of tumor cells to stress stimuli, including drug resistance. CD99 is crucial at the intersection of normal biological processes and pathological conditions like cancer. While research indicates that CD99 may interact homotypically, there is evidence of some heterotypic ligands that align with its roles. The development of multiple anti-CD99 antibodies has shed light on its functions, particularly regarding interactions between tumor cells that overexpress CD99 and immune cells expressing the same protein within the microenvironment. Anti-CD99 antibodies effectively eliminate tumors and attract immune cells to the tumor area. Additionally, CD99 influences the expression of specific immune checkpoint molecules, such as CD47, paving the way for potential combinations of anti-CD99 with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This review explores CD99’s role in normal physiology and cancer biology, focusing on how monoclonal antibodies affect CD99 expression and activity, thereby influencing cancer cells’ interactions with their microenvironment. It summarizes key findings about how these changes impact cancer cell behavior and the effectiveness of treatments.">

 Progenitor-exhausted T (Tpex) cells, marked by TCF1 and PD-1 expression, are essential for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like anti-PD-1 antibodies. These cells serve as precursors to intratumoral exhausted T (Tex) cells and may play a pivotal role in maintaining immune responses during cancer therapy. While Tpex cells are recognized for their importance, the detailed mechanisms by which ICIs influence their activation, proliferation, and migration remain unclear. Specifically, the dynamics of ICI-bound Tpex cells across lymph nodes (LNs) and tumors have not been fully characterized. To address this point, we investigated the spatial and functional behavior of Tpex cells in gastrointestinal cancer patients, focusing on how ICIs reprogram these cells to exert anti-tumor immunity.



 We collected tumor, lymph node (LN), and blood samples from gastrointestinal cancer patients treated with or without anti-PD-1 antibodies. Purified lymphocytes were analyzed with flowcytometry and sequencing analysis. To identify ICI-binding T cells, we developed a method using IgG4 detection, which allowed us to detect cells directly bound by therapeutic anti-PD-1 antibodies. We further used combined sequencing technique including single-cell RNA sequencing, T cell receptor sequencing and CITE-sequencing for IgG4 detection (scRNA/TCR/CITE-seq) to profile 29, 388 T cells across tissue compartments, including LNs, tumors, and blood.



 Our flowcytometry analysis revealed that CD8-Tpex cells were enriched in proximal LNs and exhibited significant proliferation following ICI treatment. Using IgG4 detection and sequencing, we confirmed that PD-1+ Tpex cells in LNs directly bound therapeutic anti-PD-1 antibodies and underwent clonal expansion. Notably, these ICI-bound Tpex cells shared TCR clonotypes with intratumoral Tex cells, suggesting that Tpex cells migrate from LNs to tumors after treatment.



 ICIs primarily target PD-1+ Tpex cells in proximal LNs, driving their proliferation and migration to tumors, where they differentiate into Tex cells and contribute to sustained tumor destruction. These results not only deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ICI therapy but also provide a robust methodological framework for tracking ICI-binding T cells across tissues.

 Immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment, but such immunotherapy regimens fail in a subset of patients. Dendritic cells (DCs) are a heterogeneous group of professional antigen-presenting innate immune cells that activate adaptive immunity and determine the efficacy of immunotherapies. While they can also be hijacked by tumor-mediated factors to contribute to immune tolerance and tumor progression. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that drive the tolerance maturation of DCs in the tumor microenvironment (TME).



 We enrolled 85 patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibiting varying response to immunotherapy, and profiled their tumor ecosystems using a single-cell transcriptomes sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) for 10 patients, and plasma protein level quantification, conducted both pre-treatment and post-treatment across all patients. We integrated our in-house data and 6 additional published scRNA-seq cohorts of 83 donors to generate a comprehensive landscape of cellular dynamics underlying different responses to immunotherapy. We verified the prognostic value in our in-house tumor microarray of 342 patients.



 UCHL1 overexpression nullifies anti-PD-L1 therapy by driving conventional DC transformation into mature DCs enriched in immunoregulatory molecule (mregDC) via tolerogenic maturation and promoting mregDC and regulatory T (Treg) cell crosstalk, thereby restrains CD8+ T anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, UCHL1 enhances glycolysis by stabilizing HIF1α and lactate accumulation in TME, which further promotes SREBP2 activation and nuclear translocation in DCs. We verified the positive correlations of UCHL1 with HIF1α/VEGFα/LAMP3/FOXP3 in 342 patients with HCC. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of UCHL1 all reduce the mregDC and Treg accumulation, restore the immuno-surveillance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and safeguard anti-tumor immunity and efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in mouse models.



 UCHL1 hijacks tolerogenic DC maturation and promotes mregDC-Treg crosstalk to nullify anti-PD-L1 therapy. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of UCHL1 unleash the immuno-surveillance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and safeguard the anti-tumor immunity. Plasma level of UCHL1 predicts the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) represent a significant barrier to the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. A comprehensive understanding of TANs' regulatory mechanisms is therefore essential for predicting ICB efficacy and improving immunotherapy strategies. Our study reveals that MYO1F is selectively downregulated in neutrophils within both human cancers and murine tumor models, showing a negative correlation with ICB response. Mechanistically, MYO1F normally inhibits neutrophil immunosuppression and proliferation by restraining STAT3 activity. However, during tumorigenesis, tumor-derived TGF-β1 disrupts the binding of SPI1 to intron 8 of Myo1f via DNA methylation, thereby suppressing Myo1f transcription. The resultant decrease in MYO1F reprograms neutrophils into an immunosuppressive state through the STAT3-dependent signaling pathways. This immunosuppressive state further contributes to tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling by inducing CTL exhaustion. These findings establish MYO1F as a critical regulator within TANs, highlighting its significant role in modulating ICB therapy efficacy.">

        <tr id="T cell exhaustion is a critical obstacle for durable treatment response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Developing drugs that control tumor growth and simultaneously bolster immune function is of great significance. Although high-mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) has been reported to be crucial to HCC prognosis, its role in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. Here, we found HMGB2+ CD8+ T cells as being associated with immune exhaustion and resistance to anti–PD-1 treatment through single-cell RNA sequencing. Mechanistically, HMGB2 impaired the oxidative phosphorylation in CD8+ T cells and inactivated the interferon-γ response in tumor cells, reducing the antitumor effector function. Tannic acid, a specific inhibitor of HMGB2, synergized with PD-1 antibody to attenuate tumor growth and reverse T cell exhaustion. Our findings highlight the unique role of HMGB2 as an immune exhaustion associated molecule. Targeting HMGB2 on both CD8+ T cells and tumor cells contributed to promising treatment strategies for HCC.">

 Solid tumors often contain patches of hypoxic regions that yield aggressive, pro-metastatic phenotypes. Prevention and understanding of metastases is critical for the future of breast cancer research, as metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to manage and treat. Recent work in our lab has shown that long-term hypoxia suppresses type I interferon (IFN) signaling in breast cancer cells. Even upon reoxygenation, these gene expression changes are maintained, indicative of “hypoxic memory.” Breast cancer cells that have disseminated from the primary tumor as circulating tumor cells with this “post-hypoxic” memory phenotype show enhanced metastatic potential. IFNs typically boost and enhance immune cell activity through interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); thus, hypoxic suppression of IFN signaling yields an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. More research is needed to understand how ISGs are downregulated in hypoxia and how those changes in gene expression contribute to immunosuppressive ability of hypoxic and post-hypoxic cells. Interferon-inducible 44-like (IFI44L) is an ISG that has been associated with tumor-suppressive properties, and correlated with presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in other cancers, but its role in breast cancer has not been studied. We found that IFI44L is significantly suppressed in breast cancer cells in hypoxia and maintained after reoxygenation as a hypoxic memory. To try to understand possible mechanisms of hypoxic suppression, we overexpressed interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are positive regulators of the type I IFN pathway. However, this did not rescue hypoxic suppression and memory of IFI44L, suggesting that IRFs are not the sole regulator of IFN and ISG expression in hypoxia. Additional experiments are currently ongoing in the lab to address other possible mechanisms of hypoxic suppression and memory of IFN signaling. Additionally, co-culture experiments of breast cancer cells with knockdown or overexpression of IFI44L with different immune cell populations will shed light on the role of IFI44L in immune interactions in the tumor and in circulation. To better understand implications of maintained IFI44L suppression, we will also examine immune cell activity and metastatic potential using in vivo mouse studies. We expect to see less immune cell effect and enhanced metastasis with IFI44L knockdown and reversed phenotypes with overexpression of IFI44L. Understanding mechanisms of immune evasion mediated via IFI44L can lead to strategies for targeting hypoxia-mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis.

        <tr id="Central trained immunity, induced via reprogramming of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), mediates sustained heightened responsiveness of mature myeloid cells to secondary challenges. We have previously demonstrated that HSPCs use TLR2 and Dectin-1 to sense Candida albicans to induce the production of trained monocytes/macrophages to fight against secondary infection. Neutrophils play an important role in innate immunity and are critical for clearance of C. albicans. In this work, we used an in vitro model of mouse HSPC differentiation to investigate the functional phenotype of neutrophils derived from HSPCs exposed to various PAMPs and C. albicans cells. We found that neutrophils derived from HSPCs stimulated by a TLR2 agonist exhibit reduced inflammatory cytokine production (tolerized neutrophils) whereas neutrophils generated from a Dectin-1 agonist or C. albicans stimulated HSPCs produce higher amounts of cytokines (trained neutrophils). We further demonstrated that a transient exposure of HSPCs to live C. albicans cells is sufficient to induce a trained phenotype of the neutrophils they produce in a Dectin-1- and TLR2-dependent manner. These trained neutrophils exhibited higher phagocytosis and microbicidal capacity than control neutrophils. Additionally, their adoptive transfer was sufficient to reduce fungal burden during invasive candidiasis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that trained neutrophils use mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) to enhance their ability to kill C. albicans cells, as they produce higher amounts of mtROS and scavenging mtROS with MitoTEMPO attenuated their yeast-killing ability to match that of control neutrophils. Altogether, these data suggest that infection-experienced HSPCs contribute to trained immunity by providing a source of trained neutrophils with enhanced antimicrobial activity which may confer prolonged protection from infection. The tailored manipulation of this mechanism might offer new therapeutic strategies for controlling fungal infections by harnessing neutrophils.">

 A major obstacle for many cancer immunotherapies is intrinsic or acquired resistance to treatment. Myeloid-derived immune cell populations such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are promoting an immunosuppressive tumor environment. This limits the effectiveness of current cancer immunotherapies. When activated, myeloid lineage immune cells express high levels of Neuropilin2 (NRP2), a single pass transmembrane protein. NRP2 forms heterodimeric complexes with other membrane receptors such as VEGF receptors, plexins and integrins. In experimental models of immune disease, NRP2 has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects. However, the role of NRP2 on immune cells in the context of tumor biology is largely unknown.



 NRP2 expression is upregulated on myeloid cells in an experimental model of acute lung injury and can be detected on myeloid cells in syngeneic tumor models. In experimental models of immune diseases like atopic dermatitis and collagen-induced arthritis, NRP2-deficient mice show a stronger immune response and worse pathology. Blocking NRP2 with a monoclonal antibody (ATYR2810) in a syngeneic, orthotopic mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM), resulted in anti-tumoral polarization of myeloid cells and a significant increase in overall survival. Additionally, in syngeneic tumor models with a large immunosuppressive myeloid population, ATYR2810 treatment improved the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibition via anti-PD-1.



 Here we demonstrate that NRP2 is a negative regulator of the inflammatory response and is highly expressed on immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the tumor environment. Blocking NRP2 with ATYR2810 was effective as a single therapy and when combined with checkpoint inhibition in syngeneic tumor models with a high prevalence of MDSCs. This suggests that modulating NRP2 offers a new approach to targeting and reversing the immunosuppressive function of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment.

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases are characterized by irregular immune responses that disrupt self-tolerance. This research explores the effects of the immunomodulatory drug celecoxib on the expression of immune checkpoint receptors in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Key receptors, including CTLA-4, VISTA, BTLA, PDL-1, B7H7, and LAG3, play critical roles in initiating and regulating immune responses and maintaining self-tolerance. Previous studies have highlighted the significance of immune checkpoints in preventing autoimmune conditions, with animal research supporting their effectiveness in immunotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that the upregulation of immune checkpoint receptors can enhance the inhibitory functions of DCs, thereby promoting self-tolerance. As a result, tolerogenic DCs present a promising therapeutic avenue for treating autoimmune diseases. Although these results are promising, further trials are required to validate this approach before it can be applied clinically. This study underscores the potential of targeting immune checkpoint receptors as a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune disorders.">

        <tr id="Background Natural killer (NK) cells are among the first immune cell populations to recover after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT ), yet their dynamic function in pediatric patients remains understudied. Investigating NK cell recovery could improve understanding of post-autoHSCT immune reconstitution and optimize clinical outcomes. Methods We characterized NK cells in 13 children (male: 8; female: 5; age range: 3–11 years) with various tumors before and up to 6 months after autoHSCT. Multiparametric flow cytometry analyses and plasma cytokine level determinations were performed. In vitro experiments, including single-cell RNA sequencing, were conducted to elucidate post-autoHSCT changes in the NK cell repertoire using 8 adult healthy donors (male: 5; female: 3; age range: 25–62 years). Results Key findings highlight a transient decidual-like NK cell phenotype emerging early post-transplant. These cells are immature and activated, with increased inhibitory receptor expression and diminished activating receptor levels. This activated and decidual-like phenotype is characterized by elevated expression of CD56, CD9, CD49a, CD151, CD38, HLA-DR, and CD55. Plasma levels of several cytokines are associated with the observed changes in NK cells’ phenotype. In addition, in vitro experiments recapitulate the alterations observed in NK cells shortly after autoHSCT. Specifically, results demonstrate that the combination of IL-15 and TGF-β induces this distinctive phenotype on NK cells after autoHSCT. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between relapse and the percentage of CD56dim NK cells shortly after autoHSCT in our cohort of pediatric patients. Conclusions Altogether, our findings provide valuable insights into the physiopathology of NK cells during immune system reconstitution after autoHSCT and can potentially help in the management of cancer in children.">

 Mature tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) characterized by the presence of germinal centers are strong predictors of response to immunotherapy. DCs play critical and decisive roles in determining the outcome of the immune responses in the TME and within TLS. Therefore, strategies to recruit and activate DC have the potential to induce TLS and enhance response to immunotherapy. Pepinemab, semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) blocking antibody, reversed myeloid suppression and promoted infiltration of activated DC and CD8+ T cells into the TME in preclinical and clinical studies. New data demonstrates the presence of mature TLS following pepinemab treatment in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in three separate clinical studies. KEYNOTE-B84 study (NCT04815720) evaluated the safety and efficacy of pepinemab in combination with pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment for immunotherapy-naïve patients with R/M HNSCC. Neoadjuvant studies in patients with surgically resectable metastatic melanoma (NCT03769155) and HNSCC (NCT03690986) received pepinemab treatment combined with nivolumab and/or ipilimumab. Screening and on-treatment tumor biopsies were evaluated using multiplex immunohistochemistry, RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics. TLS identified in biopsies of patients treated with pepinemab in combination with ICI were larger and more mature, containing high density of activated HLA-DR+ DCs, FDC, follicular B cells, and Tfh cells expressing CXCR5, characteristic of germinal centers. Importantly, comparison of matched biopsy pairs before and after treatment indicated that TLS were induced by the pepinemab combination treatment. Increased density and maturity of lymphoid aggregates, as well as significant changes in DC activation markers and the Flt3/Wnt pathway correlated with clinical benefit. We hypothesized that effects of pepinemab could be further enhanced by increasing the population of DC available in the TME. In preclinical studies, intra-tumoral vaccination with ex vivo expanded DC-1 enhanced effects of systemic treatment with SEMA4D-blocking antibody, resulting in improved DC trafficking to draining lymph nodes, and inducing tumor regression in both target and distant tumors. For in vivo expansion of DC, treatment with Flt3L improved anti-tumor activity when combined with SEMA4D-blocking antibody. Pepinemab represents a novel strategy to boost dendritic cell infiltration, activation, and organization of functional TLS to overcome limitations of immune checkpoint therapies. When combined with ICI, pepinemab induced de novo formation of TLS that correlated with clinical benefit, even in poorly immunogenic tumors that do not respond well to ICI, including HPV-negative and PD-L1 low HNSCC. When combined with modalities to further expand DC, SEMA4D blocking antibodies inhibited tumor growth in preclinical models, including in ICI-resistant models.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has significantly improved the survival of patients with various malignancies. However, immunotherapies have largely remained ineffective in tumors that have reduced infiltration of T cells, also called immune-cold tumors. Despite an extensive understanding of factors that mediate poor T cell infiltration, current therapies that target these factors have shown modest clinical benefit, indicating that other factors contribute to this process. One such factor that has been shown to contribute to immunosuppression are extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, due to significant EV heterogeneity, discovery of specific EV subpopulations that are responsible for these immunosuppressive effects has remained a challenge. Overcoming this challenge, we first established relevant lung cancer models to study EV-mediated T cell suppression and then identified a previously uncharacterized population of lung cancer-derived EVs that strongly inhibit the proliferation and activation of T cells. We further identified that this novel T cell-suppressive EV subpopulation originates from the trans-Golgi network and expresses the classic trans-Golgi marker protein, TGN46. In addition, the TGN46+ EV subpopulation lacks conventional EV markers CD81 and CD63. In the immunosuppressive lung cancer model, while total EVs suppress T cells, specifically removing the TGN46+ EV subpopulation ameliorated this effect. Conversely, overexpressing TGN46 in a lung cancer model that had no EV-mediated effect on T cells was sufficient to increase TGN46+ EV release and the ability of the EVs to suppress T cells, underscoring the physiological significance of the TGN46+ EV subpopulation. Analysis of patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicates that high TGN46 expression (both transcript and protein) correlates with worse progression-free survival in lung cancer and overall survival in other cancer types - glioblastoma, lower grade glioma, testicular cancer, and large B-cell lymphoma. Most importantly, tumor-immune association analysis of TCGA data suggests that high tumor TGN46 expression significantly correlates with an immunologically-cold tumor signature, i.e., low infiltration of CD8+ T cells and activated NK cells, and high infiltration of M2 macrophages, across several cancer types, stressing the clinical relevance of our findings. The data elucidates that TGN46+ EVs are a novel factor that potentially contributes to immune-cold tumor microenvironment. How TGN46+ EVs suppress T cells mechanistically and their role in overall tumor microenvironment modulation are currently under investigation, which may inform strategies to enhance immunotherapy effectiveness in immune-cold tumors.

 Understanding mechanisms of immune evasion to therapeutics or during responses to cancer, autoimmunity and infectious diseases requires high-dimensional functional profiling at the single-cell level. Measurement of functional immune cell signatures that include both inflammation and immunosuppression provides key insights into several facets of cancer research and therapy. If single-cell detection of cytokines spanning many cell lineages was possible, 1) determining mechanisms underlying success/failure of checkpoint blockade, 2) defining immunosuppressive activity of the tumor-resident cell subsets and 3) identifying immunological biomarkers that predict clinical outcomes would be within reach. We used CyTOF™ technology to achieve this goal of high-parameter cross-functional profiling to avoid the limitations of fluorescence-based cytometry, such as signal spillover, autofluorescence, compensation errors and spectral unmixing complications.
 A 50-marker CyTOF panel that achieves comprehensive profiling of immune subpopulations with detection of 20-plus intracellular cytokines spanning Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg lineages was developed. PBMC were cultured with an array of stimulation conditions, stained and acquired on the CyTOF XT system. Datasets were analyzed using PhenoGraph clustering and visualized with opt-SNE to determine cellular functional diversity. Our findings show clear detection of IL-5-, IL-10- and IL-13 producing cells, found in surprising co-expression patterns with pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ. More significantly, we were able to detect expression of a number of secretory analytes that are historically difficult to identify by flow cytometry at a single-cell level, including the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-β.
 Mass cytometry, in concert with this new expanded cytokine panel, provides a far wider lens of visualization of the functional diversity of human immune cells than has been achieved previously. We predict that through the use of this panel, novel immune regulatory mechanisms that abate/prevent cellular responses in tumors will be revealed. In sum, our findings indicate that the CyTOF XT platform is well positioned as a catalyst for seminal discoveries in immune profiling to drive therapeutic design and advanced disease monitoring in cancer.

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has evolved sophisticated strategies to evade host immune defenses, enabling its persistent survival in human populations. HCMV intermediate-early protein 2 (IE2) has been identified as a crucial factor in immune evasion mechanisms. However, the specific immunomodulatory effects of IE2 on antigen presentation remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we established a transgenic mouse model to systematically examine the impact and molecular mechanisms of IE2 on macrophages (Mφs) antigen presentation in vivo. Our findings demonstrated that IE2 modifies Mφs’ function by preventing their phagocytic activity and polarization. Additionally, IE2 inhibits Mφs overactivation both in vivo and in vitro, which raises IL-10 levels and activates the downstream mediator STAT3, which in turn decreases T cell immune responses by encouraging T helper 2 (Th2) type responses. In conclusion, these findings underscore the potential of IE2 as a critical regulator of immune evasion and may contribute to the development of novel, targeted therapeutic strategies against the virus.">

 Colorectal Cancer (CRC) shows limited response to immunotherapies due to 85% of cases involving proficient mismatch repair. The immune profile of CRC remains poorly understood, making it critical to investigate immune infiltration patterns in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of CRC to improve therapeutic outcomes. Adenosine accumulates at high levels in the TME, suppressing immune responses via the A2A receptor (A2AR) on immune cells, a crucial pathway in immune suppression. This study aims to characterize the immune profile of CRC and identify the immune signature associated with adenosine-mediated immunosuppression. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining was performed on 170 CRC samples from 85 patients on 12 immune markers, including CD4+ and CD8+ for T cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD68+ macrophages, CD11b+ dendritic cells, FOXP3 for Treg cells, Glut-1 (hypoxia), Ki67, IDO and PD-1 (immune checkpoints), and CD73 and A2AR of the adenosine pathway. These markers provided a comprehensive assessment of immune suppression mechanisms. Our findings showed CRC tumors with specific immune infiltrates, including high levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD11b+ dendritic cells, and CD68+ macrophages, alongside elevated Glut-1 and A2AR expression, marking A2AR’s role in the adenosine-mediated suppression in CRC. Conversely, low levels of infiltrates were observed for CD56+, CD73+, FOXP3+, IDO+, Ki67+, and PD-1+ cells. Subdividing patients into A2AR-high and A2AR-low groups revealed that A2AR-high tumors exhibited significantly higher CD68+ macrophage infiltration, suggesting A2AR may mediate adenosine effects primarily through macrophages. Notably, A2AR was predominantly expressed on CD8+ T cells in CRC tumors, suggesting that infiltrating CD8+ cells are suppressed by adenosine signaling. Markedly, high A2AR expression was observed despite significant CD73 deficiency in CRC tumors. On average, only 0.09% CD73+ cells. with 39% of tumor cores showing no CD73 expression. Moreover, 40% of CD73-deficient tumors retained high A2AR expression, indicating the presence of alternative adenosine-producing pathways independent of CD73. Significant differences in immune infiltrates were also noted between CRC subtypes. Colon adenocarcinomas (n=50) exhibited higher A2AR+ infiltrates and lower CD4+ T cell infiltration compared to rectal adenocarcinomas (n=35), suggesting stronger adenosine-mediated immunosuppression in colon adenocarcinomas. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of adenosine-driven immunosuppression in CRC and highlight potential therapeutic targets to counter immune suppression. The observed CD73 deficiency suggests the need to explore alternative adenosine-producing pathways in CRC. Continued investigation into CRC immune signatures will aid in identifying new biomarkers and developing improved immunotherapy strategies for CRC patients.

 Background:
 Tumor immunosuppression is a major obstacle in developing effective oncological therapies, particularly in pediatric, adolescent, young, and elderly adults with advanced or therapy-resistant cancers. These tumors create a microenvironment that suppresses immune responses, enabling unchecked growth. Functionalized exosomes derived from dendritic cells pre-conditioned (EDCD-PC) with the Phospholipoproteomic Complex (PLP) offer a groundbreaking approach to reprogramming the tumor microenvironment (TME). These exosomes modulate key immune pathways, promoting a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th2 balance and reducing immunosuppressive cytokines. This dual-action restores the immune system's ability to target and eliminate tumors while adapting to diverse therapeutic needs, offering personalized options.
 Methods:
 Semi-immortalized dendritic cells were pre-conditioned with PLP (50 µg/mL) for 24 hours before generating functionalized exosomes. These exosomes were evaluated in ZR-75-30 (breast) and HT-29 (colon) tumor cell lines through treatments with 10, 50, and 100 µg/mL for 72 hours. Key cytokines (IL-12, IFN-γ, IL-10) were quantified by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA), and apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V/PI staining and caspase-3 activation.
 Results:
 Immunological Modulation: o Increase in IL-12 (+57.6%, p < 0.001) and IFN-γ (+55.4%, p < 0.001). o Reduction in IL-10 (-42.3%, p < 0.01), favoring a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th2 balance. Tumor Apoptosis: o 46.3% ± 1.7 apoptosis in ZR-75-30 and 43.5% ± 2.1 in HT-29 (p < 0.01). Targeted Efficacy: o High specificity in immunosuppressive tumors, underscoring its relevance in resistant tumors.
 Conclusions:
 Functionalized exosomes derived from dendritic cells pre-conditioned with PLP represent a significant advancement in precision oncology, particularly for addressing immunosuppressive and therapy-resistant tumors. These exosomes demonstrate a unique ability to modulate the tumor microenvironment by promoting pro-inflammatory responses while reducing immunosuppressive signaling, thereby restoring immune surveillance. This dual-action mechanism not only facilitates tumor regression but also enhances the efficacy of existing treatments when used in combination. The clinical relevance of EDCD-PC exosomes extends across a broad spectrum of patients, including pediatric, adolescent, young adult, and elderly populations. Their personalization and scalability ensure adaptability to various clinical scenarios, making them an invaluable tool for TME reprogramming, ensures the stability and global applicability of these exosomes, overcoming logistical barriers in resource-limited regions.

 Hypoxia can promote immunologic, transcriptomic, and metabolic alterations in the tumor microenvironment that contribute to immune evasion. Activation of hypoxia signaling pathways has been linked to cancer cell-intrinsic immune evasion and resistance. Hypoxic tumor cells show less susceptibility to direct killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells through several mechanisms, including upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands. IFNγ and TNFα are immune cell-derived effector cytokines critical for tumor immunity. However, the effect of these cytokines in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment is less well studied. Since, kinase signaling pathways are directly activated downstream of cytokine receptor, we explored the functional activity of kinases downstream of IFNγ and TNFα.



 Murine B16F10 melanoma cells were treated with 40 ng/ml of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha under normoxia (21 % oxygen) and hypoxia (1% oxygen) conditions for 6 or 24 hours. Following treatment, cells were lysed with M-PER Mammalian Extraction Buffer supplemented with Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail and Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail EDTA free and protein quantification was determined using Pierce Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay Kit. Tyrosine and Serine/threonine kinase activity profiles were generated using PamChip® comprising 340 different phosphosites that are known downstream substrates of kinases. Peptide phosphorylation and Upstream Kinase Analysis was performed with PamGene’s tercen analysis pipeline.



 We found a global reduction of the cytokines induced kinome activation when cells were treated under hypoxia for 6h. However, after 24h a group of kinases associated mainly with the MAPK, RAS and Calcium signaling were increasingly activated in the hypoxia condition. A dynamic activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway was observed when comparing cells exposed to cytokines in normoxia or hypoxia conditions. At 6 h after IFNγ and TNFα treatment under normoxia, we observed an increased PI3K/AKT activity that decreased and became undetectable after 24h. However, when cells were exposed to the cytokines under hypoxia the reduced PI3K/AKT kinase activity at 6 h is reverted after 24h of treatment. Interestingly, the downstream mTOR pathway is predicted to have lower activity in the hypoxia conditions across both time points evaluated.



 In the present work we unveil strong diversity on the kinome of melanoma cells when exposed to the inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNFα under different oxygen levels. These results provide deeper insight into the mechanisms by which hypoxia contributes to immune evasion and response to cytokines. Our data can help inform future therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways to enhance immune-mediated tumor suppression.

 Checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but many patients show resistance. In this study, we perform integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of emerging immuno-oncology targets across multiple clinical cohorts of melanoma undergoing anti-PD-1 treatment, examining both bulk and single-cell levels. We reveal a surprising role of CD8+ T cell-intrinsic cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2) in enhancing antitumor immunity, in contrast to its well-established role as an inhibitor of apoptotic death in tumor cells. The loss of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2) expression serves as a marker of CD8+ T cell dysfunction, a critical phenotype associated with immunotherapy resistance.T cells within the solid tumor microenvironment (TME) must catabolize lipids through mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to generate energy during periods of nutrient stress. It is well-established that T cells enriched in FAO are highly effective in cancer control. However, endogenous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and unmodified cellular therapy products do not effectively sustain bioenergetics within tumors. Here, we reveal that cIAP2 overexpression enhances the antitumor effects of CD8+ T cells by promoting their differentiation into a central memory T cell (TCM) phenotype via activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, thereby facilitating a shift toward fatty acid metabolism.cIAP2 is a multifunctional protein that acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulating downstream targets. In this study, we employed deep learning techniques to construct a cIAP2 bait protein. We then performed docking analyses between the bait protein and a pre-established protein database. This process involved a sequential screening approach, starting with Megadock for initial screening, followed by Hdock for refined screening, and concluding with detailed one-on-one analysis using AlphaFold-Multimer. Ultimately, we identified the substrate protein monoacylglycerol lipase (MGLL). Mechanistically, we reveal that cIAP2 overexpression activates the PPAR signaling pathway by promoting the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of MGLL. Our results indicate a complex role of cIAP2 in the tumor ecosystem, highlighting the cell-type-dependent antagonistic effects of a single target on immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized cancer treatment by enhancing T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. However, its efficacy in glioblastoma (GBM) remains limited, as demonstrated by unsuccessful clinical trials. The primary challenge is the low abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME), which fosters an "immune-cold" or "immune-suppressive" state, rendering the tumor resistant to immunotherapy. The first-line treatment for GBM is temozolomide (TMZ), and several studies have examined whether TMZ improves patient outcomes when combined with ICIs. However, one such trial, Ipi-Glio, did not demonstrate improved outcomes with the addition of ipilimumab to TMZ. In contrast, the MAYA study in metastatic colon cancer patients showed clinical benefits when patients were treated with TMZ followed by low-dose ICIs. As a result, it remains unclear whether TMZ has synergistic effects with ICIs in GBM treatment. To address this question, we consider the following: Does TMZ increase the abundance of TILs within the GBM TME? The recruitment and activation of TILs depend on pro-inflammatory cytokines, including type I interferons (IFN-I), which bridge innate and acquired immunity. Thus, we further investigate: Does TMZ stimulate IFN-I production to enhance TIL infiltration?When the U251 GBM cell line was treated with TMZ, the cells expressed IFNB1, a type of IFN-I, as well as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). We also aimed to clarify the pathway through which IFN-I is induced. Several pathways are known to activate IFN-I, so we knocked down the expression of key intermediates in these pathways and treated the cells with TMZ. As a result, the upregulation of IFNB1 and ISGs induced by TMZ was diminished when RIG-I was knocked down. RIG-I is a pattern recognition receptor that detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This finding suggests that the IFN-I induction observed in TMZ-treated GBM cells is linked to the presence of dsRNA within the tumor cells. In this presentation, we will discuss the origins of the dsRNAs and whether TMZ-induced IFN-I is sufficiently strong to transform the "immune-cold" or "immune-suppressive" GBM TME into an "immune-hot" state.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Pemphigus is a life-threatening autoimmune disease mediated by anti-desmoglein(Dsg) autoantibodies. Ectopic lymphoid-like structures (ELSs) are frequently found in chronic skin lesions and are thought to contribute to local autoantibody production. However, the mechanisms driving ELS formation at lesion sites remain unclear.


OBJECTIVES
To investigate the role of myeloid cells in the formation of ELSs in pemphigus lesions and to identify potential therapeutic targets by better understanding the underlying mechanisms that contribute to this process.


METHODS
We used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify the myeloid subpopulation in pemphigus lesions and study their functions. Immunohistochemistry(IHC), immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were used to validate the presence of interleukin (IL)-1β-producing myeloid cells. Culture, bulk RNA sequencing and trans-well chemotaxis experiments were conducted to assess the effects of IL-34 and tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α on monocytes. Additionally, the high expression of IL-34 in pemphigus keratinocytes was validated by IHC.


RESULTS
We first confirmed the abundant presence of myeloid cells within ELSs in pemphigus skin lesions, including PV and PF. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that IL1B_Macro is the dominant myeloid subpopulation in pemphigus lesions, originating from classical monocytes. These cells have a strong inflammatory and chemotactic transcriptomic profile, expressing high levels of IL1B, IL6, and chemokines such as CCL20, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL5, promoting leukocyte infiltration. Ex-vivo experiments showed that IL1B_Macro differentiation is enhanced by the synergistic action of IL-34 and TNF-α, and this can be attenuated by a CSF-1R inhibitor. IL-34 alone also promotes IL1B and CCL20 expression, and keratinocytes were found to be the major source of elevated IL-34 in pemphigus lesions. Bulk RNA sequencing data indicated that high IL-34 expression in pemphigus keratinocytes correlates with increased levels of CCL5, IL6, and IL23A.


CONCLUSIONS
IL-1β-producing myeloid cells play a crucial role in forming ELSs in pemphigus lesions through inflammatory and chemotactic pathways. Keratinocytes contribute to this process by producing IL-34, which fuels local inflammation. These findings offer new insights into pemphigus immunopathogenesis and suggest the IL-34/CSF-1R pathway as a potential therapeutic target.">

 The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase that plays a critical role in regulating immune responses by modulating the growth, differentiation, activation and migration of various immune cells. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling, which is common in various cancers, can potentially disrupt the immune cell function, leading to weakened immune surveillance. This study evaluates the antitumor activity of an mTOR inhibitor drug, everolimus, focusing on its impact on antitumor immunity. Treatment with everolimus inhibited the growth of PD-1 resistant and poorly immunogenic ROC-1 syngeneic grafts, potentially through the activation of T cell-mediated immunity. Flow cytometry analysis of single cell suspension of tumor cells revealed increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and increased expression of class-I MHC in tumor cells in mice treated with everolimus when compared to vehicle. Moreover, everolimus reduced the number of exhausted (PD1+) CD4+, CD8+ T cells in tumors, indicating a more potent immune response against the cancer cells. The CD8+ tumor infiltrated lymphocytes (TILs) magnetically sorted and cocultured with the tumor cells showed significantly higher T cell cytotoxicity for the group of mice who received everolimus in comparison to vehicle. These findings suggest the potential of everolimus in boosting anti-tumor immunity, providing a rationale for further investigation.

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis, with a fatality rate of 20-50% in treated individuals. Although corticosteroid therapy can increase survival in HIV-negative people with TBM, better antimicrobial and host-directed therapies are required to improve outcome. There is, therefore, a need to better understand local immunopathologic pathways. Despite its power in identifying disease-specific cellular profiles, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been underutilized in cerebral samples in brain infection. We employed scRNA-seq to analyze fresh pretreatment cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from four TBM patients, along with paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). While 29 cell subtypes were present in both tissues, their relative abundance varied significantly. In particular, CSF was enriched with highly inflammatory microglia-like macrophages, GZMK-expressing CD8+ T cells, and CD56bright NK cells. The latter two subsets exhibited features associated with dysfunctional cytotoxicity. Across multiple cell types, inflammatory signaling pathways were increased and oxidative phosphorylation was decreased in CSF compared to PBMCs. This study highlights the value of scRNA-seq for exploring CSF immunopathogenesis in TBM patients and offers a resource for future studies investigating the pathophysiology of TBM and other brain infections, including potentially targetable cell populations linked with immune-mediated pathology.">

        <tr id="While immune checkpoint inhibition (CPI) has reshaped cancer treatment, the majority of cancer patients do not benefit from this approach, which can also cause immune-related adverse events. Induction of IFNγ responses is thought be necessary for anti-tumor immunity, but growing evidence also implicates IFNγ as a tumor-intrinsic mediator of CPI resistance. CPI-induced IFNγ mediates activation-induced cell death in T cells as an immune-intrinsic mechanism of resistance. In this study, we show that transient block of IFNγ signaling through administration of the JAK1 inhibitor ABT-317 enhances anti-tumor T cell responses with CPI in pre-clinical models. Importantly, sequential but not concomitant ABT-317 treatment led to significantly reduced toxicity and improved tumor efficacy. Sequential treatment reduced activation-induced T cell death and enhanced expansion of tumor-reactive T cell subsets with increased effector function in vivo and ex vivo. Only CPI in combination with ABT-317 also enhanced memory responses by protecting mice from tumor rechallenge. These results demonstrate that JAK inhibition within a discrete time window following CPI addresses an immune-intrinsic mechanism of therapeutic resistance.">

        <tr id="The functional plasticity of tumor-infiltrating B (TIL-B) cells spans from anti-tumor responses to non-canonical immune suppression. Yet, how tumor microenvironment (TME) influences TIL-B development is still underappreciated. Our current study integrated single cell transcriptomics and BCR (B cell receptor) sequencing to profile TIL-B phenotypes and clonalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using trajectory and gene regulatory network analysis, we were able to characterize plasma cells, memory and naïve B cells within the HCC TME and further revealed a downregulation of BCR-signaling genes in plasma cells and a subset of inflammatory TNF+ memory B cells. Within the TME, non-switch memory B cell subset acquires an age-associated B cell phenotype (TBET+, CD11c+) and expressed higher levels of PD-L1, CD25 and granzyme B. We further demonstrated that the presence of HCC tumor cells could confer suppressive functions on peripheral blood B cells which in turn, dampen T cell co-stimulation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent novel mechanisms of non-canonical immune suppression in HCC. While previous studies identified atypical memory B cells in chronic hepatitis and across several solid cancer types, we further highlighted their potential role as regulatory B cells (Bregs) within both the TME and peripheral blood of HCC patients.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade can facilitate tumor clearance by T cells, resulting in long term patient survival. However, the capacity of exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex), present during chronic antigen exposure, to form memory after antigen clearance remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single cell RNA/T cell receptor sequencing and ATAC-sequencing on antigen-specific T cells after the clearance of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. These data revealed the formation of a robust population of memory CD8+ T cells that transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally resemble central memory T cells (Tcm) that form after clearance of acute infection. To lineage trace the origin and memory recall response of Tex-derived memory clones, we utilized T cell receptor sequencing over the course of primary infection and rechallenge. We show that chronic Tcm are a clonally distinct lineage of Tex derived from progenitor exhausted cells, persist long-term in the absence of antigen, and undergo rapid clonal expansion during rechallenge. Finally, we demonstrate that αPD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade after chronic LCMV infection preferentially expands clones which form Tcm after clearance. Together, these data support the concept that chronically stimulated T cells form bona fide functional memory T cells through an analogous differentiation pathway to acutely stimulated T cells, which may have significant implications for enhancing immune memory to cancer through checkpoint blockade and vaccination.">

The TME has a vital role in cancer survival and progression with implications in drug resistance and immune escape. By performing spatially resolved transcriptomic analysis of primary treatment-naïve EwS samples, we discovered greater stromal enrichment in localized EwS tumors compared to metastatic EwS tumors. Through spatial ligand-receptor analysis, we show that the stromal enriched regions harbor unique extracellular matrix related cytokines, immune recruitment and proinflammatory microenvironmental signals, implying EwS stroma may play an anti-tumorigenic role by acting as an immune recruitment center. All EwS tumors expressed pro-tumorigenic MIF-CD74 immune signaling, suggesting a potential immune-evasive mechanism and immunotherapy target. Our findings provide insight into tumor cell/stromal cell interactions in EwS and serve as a valuable resource for further investigations in the tumor immune microenvironment of EwS.">

        <tr id="The success of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies targeting solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We demonstrate that endowing CAR T cells with ectopic interleukin-9 (IL-9) signaling by co-expressing an IL-9 receptor, rewires CAR T cell fate under antigen stress to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. In preclinical solid tumor models, IL-9-signaling CAR T cells exhibit increased expansion, persistence, and tumor infiltration, resulting in superior tumor control at significantly lower doses than conventional products. Trajectory and RNA velocity analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveal that IL-9 signaling alters CAR T cell differentiation under antigen stress away from dysfunction, favoring a multipotent transition toward CD8+ cell memory and effector states, and promoting a CD4+ cell proliferative state. Interrogation of transcription factor pathways indicates that IL-9-mediated activation of STAT1 and STAT4 drives the superior phenotype of IL-9-signaling CAR T cells, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting solid cancers.">

        <tr id="Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) show only modest response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, motivating ongoing efforts to identify approaches to boost efficacy. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of TNBC, we investigated combination therapy with an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy antibody plus balixafortide, a cyclic peptide inhibitor of CXCR4. Cell-based assays demonstrated that balixafortide functions as an inverse agonist, establishing a mode of action distinct from most compounds targeting CXCR4. Combination anti-PD-1 plus balixafortide significantly reduced growth of orthotopic tumors and extended overall survival relative to single agent therapy or vehicle. Adding balixafortide to anti-PD-1 increased numbers of tertiary lymphoid structures, a marker of local tumor immune responses associated with favorable response to immunotherapy in TNBC. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed that combination anti-PD-1 plus balixafortide reduced T cell exhaustion and increased markers of effector T cell activity. Combination therapy also reduced signatures of immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tumors. MDSCs isolated from mice treated with anti-PD-1 plus balixafortide showed reduced inhibition of T cell proliferation following ex vivo stimulation. These studies demonstrate that combining inhibition of CXCR4 with anti-PD-1 to enhances responses to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in TNBC, supporting future clinical trials.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Anti‐melanoma differentiation‐associated gene 5‐positive dermatomyositis (anti‐MDA5+ DM) is a rare inflammatory autoimmune disorder often complicated by life‐threatening rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP‐ILD). The underlying mechanisms driving immune dysfunction and lung injury, however, remain poorly understood. The study aims to gain insights into the disrupted immune landscape in peripheral and pulmonary compartments of severe anti‐MDA5+ DM and explore potential therapeutic targets. Methods We employed single‐cell RNA sequencing to examine cellular constituents within five patients’ bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Luminex assay and flow cytometry were further applied to validate the results. Results Our analysis revealed starkly contrasting immune landscapes between the periphery and lungs, with peripheral immune suppression juxtaposed against pulmonary immune hyperactivation. Central to this dysregulation was the monocyte–macrophage lineage. Circulating monocytes exhibited an immunosuppressive phenotype, characterised by diminished cytokine production, reduced MHC II expression, and features resembling myeloid‐derived suppressor cells. These monocytes were recruited to the lungs, where they differentiated into monocyte‐derived alveolar macrophages (Mo‐AMs) with robust proinflammatory and profibrotic activities. Mo‐AMs drove cytokine storms and produced chemokines that amplified inflammatory cell recruitment and lung tissue remodelling. Additionally, peripheral T and NK cells exhibited increased cell death and active migration into the lungs, which may be the cause of lymphopenia. Conclusions Our study underscores the pivotal role of monocyte–macrophage dynamics in the immunopathogenesis of anti‐MDA5+‐associated RP‐ILD, offering critical insights into compartment‐specific immune dysregulation. These findings suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting monocyte recruitment and macrophage activation to mitigate disease progression. Key points Peripheral immune suppression and pulmonary immune hyperactivation characterise the distinct immune landscapes in anti‐MDA5+DM with RP‐ILD. Circulating monocytes transition from an immunosuppressive phenotype in the periphery to proinflammatory and profibrotic Mo‐AMs in the lungs. Chemokines produced by Mo‐AMs drive monocyte and other immune cell recruitment to the lungs, amplifying pulmonary inflammation.">

        <tr id="Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by dysregulated humoral immunity, leading to the generation of autoreactive B cells that can differentiate both within and outside of lymph node (LN) follicles. Methods Here, we employed spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging to investigate the follicular immune landscaping and the in situ transcriptomic profile in LNs from SLE individuals. Results Our spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed robust type I IFN and plasma cell signatures in SLE compared to reactive, control follicles. Cell deconvolution revealed that follicular T cell subsets are mainly affected by the type I IFN fingerprint of SLE follicles. Dysregulation of TFH differentiation was documented by i) the significant reduction of Bcl6hi TFH cells, ii) the reduced cell density of potential IL-4 producing TFH cell subsets associated with the impaired transcriptomic signature of follicular IL-4 signaling and iii) the loss of their correlation with GC-B cells. This profile was accompanied by a marked reduction of Bcl6hi B cells and an enrichment of extrafollicular CD19hiCD11chiTbethi, age-associated B cells (ABCs), known for their autoreactive potential. The increased prevalence of follicular IL-21hi cells further reveals a hyperactive microenvironment in SLE compared to control. Discussion Taken together, our findings highlight the altered immunological landscape of SLE follicles, likely fueled by potent inflammatory signals such as sustained type I IFN and/or IL-21 signaling. Our work provides novel insights into the spatial molecular and cellular signatures of SLE follicular B and TFH cell dynamics, and points to druggable targets to restore immune tolerance and enhance vaccine responses in SLE patients.">

        <tr id="Background The bone marrow (BM) niche contains non-hematopoietic elements including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and bone marrow endothelial cells (BMEC) which provide mechanical support, and control hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation. Although it is known that multiple myeloma (MM) cells interact closely with the BM microenvironment, little is known about the impact of MM on non-hematopoietic niche-forming cells. Methods To address the role of the niche in MM pathogenesis, we utilized the 5TGM1 murine model. During the asymptomatic precursor stage of the model, we isolated the rare non-hematopoietic cells and performed single cell RNA sequencing. Using in-silico methods we characterized the individual cellular components of the niche, their relative abundance and differentiation state before and after exposure to MM cells as well as their intercellular interactions. Results MM engraftment increased the abundance of MSC-lineage cells, BMECs and enhanced endothelial to mesenchymal transition. An inflammatory and oxidative stress signal was identified together with polarization of MSC differentiation away from osteocyte formation towards adipocytes which provide growth factors that are known to support MM expansion. BMEC differentiation was polarized towards sinusoidal endothelial cells with a pro-angiogenic/pro-inflammatory phenotype. Conclusions MM cells impact the BM niche by generating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment with MSC differentiation being changed to generate cell subsets that favor MM growth and survival. In order to induce remission and improve long-term outcome for MM patients these inflammatory and oxidative stress signals need to be reduced and normal niche differentiation trajectories restored.

        <tr id="Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), either due to inherited or somatic mutation, is prevalent in colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers. While anti-PD-1 therapy is utilized in both local and advanced disease, up to 50% of MMRd CRC fail to respond. Using animal and human models of MMRd, we determined that interactions between MHC+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and TCF+ BHLHE40+ PRF1+ T cell subsets are associated with control of MMRd tumor growth, during anti-PD-1 treatment. In contrast, resistance is associated with upregulation of TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, and PD-1 expression on T cells, and infiltration of the tumor with immunosuppressive TREM2+ macrophages and monocytes. By combining anti-PD-1 with anti-LAG3/CTLA4/TREM2, up to 100% tumor eradication was achieved in MMRd CRC and remarkably, in >70% in MMRp CRC. This study identifies key T cell and macrophage subsets mediating the efficacy of immunotherapy in overcoming immune escape in both MMRd and MMRp CRC settings. Highlights Anti-PD-1 therapy leads to the accumulation and colocalization of MHCI/II+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and DCs with TCF+ CCL5+ T cells that have high TCR diversity. Resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy involves multiple T cell checkpoints, TREM2+ macrophages, IL1B+ TREM1+ monocytes and neutrophils, and IFITM+ tumor cells. Simultaneous blockade of PD-1, LAG3, CTLA-4 and TREM2 dramatically prevents progression of both MMRd and MMRp tumors. Combination therapy completely eliminates tumors by leveraging MHC+ macrophage, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell interactions, facilitating durable anti-tumor effects.">

        <tr id="Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is characterized by immune dysregulation that facilitates chronic infection. Objective: To investigate the role of T cells in the immunopathology of CL by characterizing the immune landscape of skin lesions using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods: We performed scRNA-seq to profile T cells from PBMC and skin lesions of CL patients. Results: We analyzed the transcriptional profile of distinct populations of CD4+ and CD8+ migratory T cells in CL lesions. CD8+ resident T cells displayed expression of exhaustion markers and were categorized into progenitor, transitional, and terminal stages, with HAVCR2 (TIM-3) identified as a potential driver of dysfunction. Compared to psoriasis and healthy skin, CL lesions showed a reduced frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), potentially linked to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased apoptosis. We also detected double-negative (DN) gd T cells, suggesting their potential role in antigen presentation via MHC class II through TGF-b signaling. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into immune evasion mechanisms in CL, identifying TIM-3, Treg modulation, and the functional role of DN gd T cells as distinct potential targets for future immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) play a crucial role in tumor progression and immune regulation. However, the functional heterogeneity of CAFs remains unclear. Here, we identify antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAF), characterized by high MHC II expression, in gastric cancer (GC) tumors and find that apCAFs are preferentially located near tertiary lymphoid structures. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that apCAFs promote T cell activation and enhances its cytotoxic and proliferative capacities, thereby strengthening T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, apCAFs facilitate the polarization of macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. These polarized macrophages, in turn, promote the formation of apCAFs, creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies anti-tumor immune responses. Notably, baseline tumors in immunotherapy responders across various cancer types exhibit higher levels of apCAFs infiltration. This study advances the understanding of CAFs heterogeneity in GC and highlights apCAFs as a potential biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in pan-cancer.">

        <tr id="Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) substantially limits long-term survival following lung transplantation. To identify potential targets for CLAD prevention, T cells from explanted CLAD lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes, as well as diseased and nondiseased controls were isolated and single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing were performed. TCR sequencing revealed a clonally expanded population of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) with high cytotoxic potential, including upregulation of KLRK1, encoding the co-receptor NKG2D. These cytotoxic CD8+ TRMs accumulated around the CLAD airways and had a 100-fold increase in clonal overlap with lung-draining lymph nodes when compared with non-CLAD lungs. Using a murine model of orthotopic lung transplantation, we confirmed that cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation was due to chronic rejection and not transplantation alone. Furthermore, blocking NKG2D in vivo attenuated the airway remodeling following transplantation and diminished airway accumulation of CD8+ T cells. Our findings support NKG2D as a potential therapeutic target for CLAD, affecting cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation.">

        <tr id="Background In tuberculosis (TB) infection, monocytes play a crucial role in regulating the balance between immune tolerance and immune response through various mechanisms. A deeper understanding of the roles of monocyte subsets in TB immune responses may facilitate the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies and improve TB prevention and treatment. Methods We retrieved and processed raw single-cell RNA-seq data from SRP247583. Single-cell RNA-seq combined with bioinformatics analysis was employed to investigate the roles of monocytes in TB progression. Results Our findings revealed that classical monocytes expressing inflammatory mediators increased as the disease progressed, whereas non-classical monocytes expressing molecules associated with anti-pathogen infection were progressively depleted. Pseudotime analysis delineated the differentiation trajectory of monocytes from classical to intermediate to non-classical subsets. An abnormal differentiation trajectory to non-classical monocytes may represent a key mechanism underlying TB pathogenesis, with CEBPB and CORO1A identified as genes potentially related to TB development. Analysis of key transcription factors in non-classical monocytes indicated that IRF9 was the only downregulated transcription factor with high AUC activity in this subset. The expression of IRF9 exhibited a decreasing trend in both latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB groups. Furthermore, dysregulation of transcription factor regulatory networks appeared to impair ferroptosis, with ferroptosis-associated genes MEF2C, MICU1, and PRR5 identified as potential targets of IRF9. Through cell communication analysis, we found that interactions between non-classical monocytes and other subpopulations may mediate TB progression, with MIF and LGALS9 highlighted as potential signaling pathways. Conclusion This study employs bioinformatics analysis in conjunction with single-cell sequencing technology to uncover the crucial role of monocyte subsets in tuberculosis infection.

        <tr id="Immune evasion by cancer cells involves reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) via communication with non-malignant cells. However, resistance-promoting interactions during treatment remain lesser known. Here we examine the composition, communication, and phenotypes of tumor-associated cells in serial biopsies from stage II and III high-risk estrogen receptor positive (ER+ ) breast cancers of patients receiving endocrine therapy (letrozole) as single agent or in combination with ribociclib, a CDK4/6-targeting cell cycle inhibitor. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses on longitudinally collected samples show that in tumors overcoming the growth suppressive effects of ribociclib, first cancer cells upregulate cytokines and growth factors that stimulate immune-suppressive myeloid differentiation, resulting in reduced myeloid cell- CD8 + T-cell crosstalk via IL-15/18 signaling. Subsequently, tumors growing during treatment show diminished T-cell activation and recruitment. In vitro, ribociclib does not only inhibit cancer cell growth but also T cell proliferation and activation upon co-culturing. Exogenous IL-15 improves CDK4/6 inhibitor efficacy by augmenting T-cell proliferation and cancer cell killing by T cells. In summary, response to ribociclib in stage II and III high-risk ER +  breast cancer depends on the composition, activation phenotypes and communication network of immune cells.">

        <tr id="Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown unprecedented success in a subset of immunogenic tumors, however a host of patients with advanced solid tumors fail to respond well or at all to immunotherapy. Refractory tumors commonly display a tumor microenvironment (TME) rich in immunosuppressive macrophages (M2-like) that suppress adaptive immunity and promote tumor progression. The ability to reprogram macrophages in the TME into an immune-active state holds great promise for enhancing responses to ICIs. Lucicebtide (previously referred to as ST101) is a peptide antagonist of the transcription factor C/EBPβ, a key activator of the transcriptional program in immunosuppressive macrophages. Here we show that lucicebtide exposure reprograms human immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype, restores cytotoxic T cell activation in immunosuppressed co-culture assays in vitro, and further increases T-cell activity in M1-like/T cell co-cultures. In immunocompetent, macrophage-rich triple-negative breast and colorectal cancer models, lucicebtide induces repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype and suppresses tumor growth. Lucicebtide synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy and overcomes resistance to checkpoint inhibition in anti-PD-1-refractory tumors, but in vivo responses are impaired by systemic macrophage depletion, indicating that macrophage reprogramming is integral to lucicebtide activity. These results identify lucicebtide as a novel immunomodulator that reprograms immunosuppressive macrophage populations to enhance anti-tumor activity and suggests its utility for combination strategies in cancers with poor response to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is a highly aggressive malignancy marked by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that hinders effective immune responses. A key feature of this environment is the extensive infiltration of myeloid cells, which contributes to immune evasion. This study explored how mesothelin (MSLN), a tumor-associated antigen, modulates the expression of CD24, an emerging target for immune modulation, and its role in promoting immune evasion in HGSOC. Understanding these underlying mechanisms is crucial for enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies and improving outcomes in patients with HGSOC. Methods We analyzed the expression of MSLN in HGSOC samples and examined its correlation with clinical outcome. In vitro and in vivo models were used to explore how MSLN influences CD24 expression and the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We also investigated the role of MSLN in the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and its impact on T-cell function and antitumor immunity. The effects of Msln knockdown on CD24 expression and the response to anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) therapy were evaluated in syngeneic mouse models. Results MSLN expression was found to be significantly elevated in HGSOC, with high MSLN levels correlating with poor prognosis and resistance to ICB. MSLN upregulated CD24 and promoted the protumorigenic polarization of TAMs, contributing to T-cell dysfunction. Mechanistically, MSLN activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which in turn enhanced CD24 expression. This activation forms a positive feedback loop that further promotes MSLN transcription. In contrast, Msln knockdown reduced CD24 expression, relieved cytotoxic T-cell suppression, and significantly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in syngeneic models. Conclusions This study elucidates the critical role of MSLN in immune evasion in HGSOC and its underlying mechanisms. Targeting MSLN in combination with ICB is a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and improve patient outcomes in HGSOC.">

        <tr id="Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a unique subset of innate-like T lymphocytes that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. Characterized by their semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR) and abundant localization in mucosal tissues, MAIT cells recognize microbial metabolites, primarily derived from the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related protein 1 (MR1). This interaction, along with co-stimulatory signals, triggers rapid immune responses, including cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity, highlighting their importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and combating infections. This review provides an in-depth overview of MAIT cell biology, including development, activation pathways, and functional diversity, highlighting their protective roles in immunity, contributions to diseases like cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and context-dependent dual functions in health and pathology. This review also highlights the emerging therapeutic potential of MAIT cells in immunotherapy. Their unique TCR specificity, abundance, and tissue-homing properties make them ideal candidates for engineering novel therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-MAIT cells, targeting infections, cancers, and autoimmune diseases. Challenges like antigen escape, T cell exhaustion, and CAR design optimization must be addressed to enhance clinical efficacy. In summary, MAIT cells are integral to immune function, and their therapeutic potential presents exciting opportunities for the treatment of a wide range of diseases.

        <tr id="Access to the brain for treating neurological sequalae requires a craniotomy, which can be complicated by infection. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1–/– mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1–/– animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng–/– mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1–/– animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="Excessive neutrophil infiltration can exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage, contributing to conditions like autoimmune disorders and liver diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects. Our study offers a perspective for advancing MSC-based therapies in tissue repair.">

        <tr id="Background and objectives Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) bring cancer patients tumor control and survival benefits, yet they also trigger immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), notably checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP), affecting about 5% of patients among whom 1–2% experiencing severe grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Current research points to potential links with T cell subset dysfunction and autoantibody increase, but the specific mechanisms underlying different grades of CIP are understudied. Methods Herein, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from CIP patients across varying severity levels, aiming to elucidate underlying immune environment and mechanisms of CIP progression at cellular and molecular levels. Findings Totally, 121,409 high qualified cells from BALF of 11 patients were annotated and categorized into five major cell types. Severe CIP (CIP-S) cases have a significant increase in the percentage of unreported epithelial cells in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with mild CIP (CIP-M) cases. These cells were defined as aberrant basaloid cells. They upregulated SOX9, increased the expression of CXCL3/5, recruited neutrophils, and activated the immune system. Additionally, macrophages in the CIP-S group had stronger antigen-presenting abilities and resulted in more CD8 + effective T cells infiltrated. Conclusions Utilizing single-cell sequencing of BALF, we discovered an enriched population of aberrant basaloid cells in CIP-S patients, which had not been previously reported. Aberrant basaloid cells may upregulate SOX9 via CXCL3/5-CXCR2 to recruit and activate neutrophils, and further activate the immune system, resulting in CIP-S. This finding could identify new targets for stratified treatment of CIP patients, holding promise of a novel approach for clinical guidance.

        <tr id="Significance Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate T cell immunity. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt)-expressing APCs are heterogenous regulators of T cell tolerance but their subtypes and lineage relationships are ill-defined. We report that RORγt+ dendritic cells (DCs) are evolutionarily conserved, exhibit wide tissue distribution and reconcile various RORγt+ APC populations known to promote peripheral T cell tolerance. We show that RORγt+ DCs can sense pathogens, migrate to lymph nodes, activate naïve CD4+ T cells, and accumulate in demyelinating neuroinflammation with a proinflammatory phenotype. Thus, RORγt+ DCs have a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment. This highlights their therapeutic potential and their affiliation with DCs.">

        <tr id="Background In both chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) immunotherapy determines B-depletion that leads to temporary suppression of humoral immunity, which is clinically relevant especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when most patients in the first wave received the BNT162b2 vaccine during anti-neoplastic treatment. Methods To capture changes in the immunome and microbiome composition in CLL and FL patients upon mRNA-based vaccination, we designed a prospective, longitudinal study to profile both the humoral and the cellular response after exposure to the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. Results In both CLL patients and FL patients, the second and third administrations of the BNT162b2 vaccine increased the titer of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In FL patients, vaccination induced expansion of central memory CD8 + CD57dim CD279 + T cells and reduction of the neutrophil subset myeloid 1 (CD14−CD15+CD16dimCD64+CD33−CD38+PDL1+HLA-DR−); in both cohorts, CD45RA + CD27 + CD279 + NK cells were expanded after a full cycle of vaccination. After vaccination, the genera Collinsella, Gemmiger, Lachnospiraceae, Blautia, Ruminococcus and Lactobacillus increased in both CLL patients and FL patients, whereas Faecalibacterium, Enterobacteriacae, and Enterococcus decreased. Multivariate analysis failed to identify factors associated with changes in microbiome communities among the CLL and FL cohorts, considering age, sex, exposure to anti-CD20 therapy and disease activity. Only in FL patients, alpha diversity was negatively correlated with neutrophil subsets myeloid 1 e 5 at baseline and positively correlated with neutrophil subset 6 after vaccination. PICRUSt2 analysis showed how microbiome can also affect the host health promoting chronic inflammation. The L-lysine biosynthesis pathway was more represented in CLL patients, whereas the L-valine degradation pathway and the anaerobic degradation of purine nucleobases were overrepresented in the FL cohort. Conclusions Taken together, our findings reveal the effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine in shaping the microbiome composition in CLL and FL patients, despite receiving treatment for their underlying active disease, and highlight the importance of a comprehensive analysis of the immunome and microbiome profiling to understand immune function in these cohorts of patients.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effectors with considerable heterogeneity and potent antitumor capabilities. Intraepithelial ILC1 (ieILC1)-like NK cells, a population of cytotoxic tissue-resident innate lymphoid cells, have recently been documented in the microenvironment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and other solid tumors. These cells have antitumor cytolytic potential and are potent producers of type 1 cytokines, including IFNγ. Here, we identify a subpopulation of ex vivo differentiated ieILC1-like NK cells that produce IL-13 upon stimulation. Functional characterization revealed that these cells co-expressed IFNγ and IL-13 while maintaining an ILC1 transcriptional signature. IL-13 was induced either upon co-culture with tumor cell lines, or in response to TGF-β and IL-15. IL-13-expressing ieILC1-like NK cells were identified among tumor infiltrating lymphocytes expanded from patient HNSCC tumors, in support of their in vivoexistence in primary tumors. These data demonstrate additional heterogeneity within the ieILC1-like NK cell population than previously appreciated and highlight a unique form of ILC plasticity in which cells with clear ILC1 transcriptional profiles express a type 2 cytokine. With the known roles of IL-13 in cancer cell growth dynamics and immunoregulation, the identification of this subset within tumor microenvironments presents a potential target for therapeutic manipulation.">

        <tr id="Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are capable of mounting an adequate antimicrobial inflammatory response to pathogens while tolerating commensals. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of immune sensitivity remain incompletely understood, particularly in the context of human IECs. To enhance our understanding of the immune response of IECs to bacterial epithelial barrier breach, we investigated whether epithelial responsiveness is contingent on cell identity and cell polarization. We exposed human intestinal organoids to bacterial antigens to study their immune responses. Notable discrepancies were observed in the specific reactions exhibited by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enterocytes. It was determined that basolateral exposure of IECs to bacterial antigens resulted in a robust response, whereas apical exposure elicited a significantly more modest response. We identified ISCs as the responders, while the reaction of enterocytes was found to be attenuated. The regulation of bacterial responsiveness in enterocytes occurs at multiple levels, including the modulation of NFκB activation and post-transcriptional control of mRNA stability. Our findings demonstrate that differentiated non-responsive enterocytes can be sensitized to bacterial antigens through the activation of the WNT pathway. These findings extend the crucial role of WNT signaling for intestinal epithelial homeostasis and regulation of stem cell maintenance, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue architecture in the gut. Additionally, they reveal a new function of WNT signaling in regulating microbial responses within the intestinal environment.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, the most abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes, are critical first responders to infection, and have historically been underappreciated in terms of their functional complexity within the immune response. Once viewed primarily as short-lived, innate immune cells with limited functional plasticity, recent research has illuminated their considerable heterogeneity and diverse functional roles, which extend beyond their involvement in steady-state immunity. This review seeks to provide an updated analysis of neutrophil development, maturation, heterogeneity, and plasticity, with a focus on how these characteristics influence immune modulation in both healthy and diseased tissues. Beginning with the origin of neutrophils, we explore their maturation into effector cells and their evolving roles in immune defense under homeostatic and disease-associated conditions. We then delve into their heterogeneity, discussing recent breakthroughs in neutrophil research that challenge the traditional view of neutrophils as a uniform population. We address the significant advances that have been made in identifying distinct neutrophil subsets, the emerging complexities of their plasticity, and the challenges that remain in fully understanding their functional diversity. Finally, we highlight future directions and opportunities for continued exploration in this rapidly advancing field, shedding light on how these insights could open new avenues for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Immune cell engagers (ICEs) are an emerging class of immunotherapies designed to harness the immune system’s anti-tumor potential through precise targeting and activation of immune effector cells. By engaging T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and phagocytes, ICEs overcome challenges such as immune evasion and MHC downregulation, addressing critical barriers in cancer treatment. T-cell engagers (TCEs), led by bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), dominate the field, with innovations such as half-life-extended BiTEs, trispecific antibodies, and checkpoint inhibitory T-cell engagers driving their application in hematologic and solid malignancies. NK cell engagers (NKCEs) and phagocyte cell engagers (PCEs) are rapidly progressing, drawing on NK cells’ innate cytotoxicity and macrophages’ phagocytic abilities to target tumors, particularly in immunosuppressive microenvironments. Since the FDA approval of Blinatumomab in 2014, ICEs have transformed the oncology landscape, with nine FDA-approved products and numerous candidates in clinical trials. Despite challenges such as toxicity, resistance, and limited efficacy in solid tumors, ongoing research into advanced platforms and combination therapies highlights the growing potential of ICEs to provide personalized, scalable, and effective cancer treatments. This review investigates the mechanisms, platforms, research trends, and clinical progress of ICEs, emphasizing their pivotal role in advancing precision immunotherapy and their promise as a cornerstone of next-generation cancer therapies.">

In a human to mouse reverse-engineering approach, a single amino acid substitution adjacent to the C-terminal proline-rich domain created CD28A210P mice with enhanced signaling. CD28A210P mice experienced pro-inflammatory responses to CD28 superagonist antibody, analogous to severe cytokine storm induced in a human clinical trial, with a striking increase of activated CD8 T cells. In acute and chronic viral infections, early activation and expansion of CD28A210P CD8 effector T cells increased, with accelerated exhaustion in chronic infection. Mechanistically, CD28A210P enhanced JunB, IL-2, and inhibitory receptors driven by MEK1/2. Generation of CD28A210P stem-like progenitor (Tpex) cells was enhanced in acute and chronic infections, and further expanded by PD-L1 blockade in chronically-infected mice. Thus, ‘humanized’ PYAP mice reveal key roles for CD28 signaling strength in CD8 activation, accelerating exhaustion during antigen persistence, while promoting and sustaining Tpex during acute and chronic viral infection.

        <tr id="Despite combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV causes persistent gut barrier dysfunction, immune depletion, and dysbiosis. Furthermore, ART interruption results in reservoir reactivation and rebound viremia. Both IL-21 and anti-α4β7 improve gut barrier functions, and we hypothesized that combining them would synergize as a dual therapy to improve immunological outcomes in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs). We found no significant differences in CD4+ T cell reservoir size by intact proviral DNA assay. SIV rebounded in both dual-treated and control RMs following analytical therapy interruption (ATI), with time to rebound and initial rebound viremia comparable between groups; however, dual-treated RMs showed slightly better control of viral replication at the latest time points after ATI. Additionally, following ATI, dual-treated RMs showed immunological benefits, including T cell preservation and lower PD-1+ central memory T cell (TCM) frequency. Notably, PD-1+ TCMs were associated with reservoir size, which predicted viral loads (VLs) after ATI. Finally, 16S rRNA-Seq revealed better recovery from dysbiosis in treated animals, and the butyrate-producing Firmicute Roseburia predicted PD-1–expressing TCMs and VLs after ATI. PD-1+ TCMs and gut dysbiosis represent mechanisms of HIV persistence and pathogenesis, respectively. Therefore, combining IL-21 and anti-α4β7 may be an effective therapeutic strategy to improve immunological outcomes for people with HIV.">

The immense potential MSC-EVs hold as tumour-targeted therapeutics warrants an understanding of potential adverse events to support clinical translation. This study aimed to determine whether MSC-EVs would elicit an immune response following administration in tumour-bearing immunocompetent animals. Secreted EVs were isolated from both human and murine bone marrow derived MSCs and characterized. hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs were administered intravenously into 4T1 breast tumour-bearing Balb/c mice or healthy controls. Tumour tissue, draining lymph nodes and spleens were harvested, dissociated into a single cell suspension and flow cytometry performed targeting T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The 4T1 model immune profile was first determined by comparing the spleen of tumour-bearing animals to healthy controls. T cells were increased in tumour-bearing animals (CD4+/CD25+ p=0.041; CD8+/CD25+ p=0.02). A significant elevation of GR-1+ MDSCs (p=0.002), CD11b+ macrophages (p=0.023) and CD11c+ dendritic cells (p=0.001) was also observed. In contrast, CD27+ NK cells were significantly decreased compared to the spleen of healthy animals (p=0.006). Collectively this data validated the immune profile and supported the determination of any changes in response to hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs administration. No significant activation of CD4+ (p=0.20) or CD8+ (p=0.57) T cells were seen in tumour tissue in both groups. The percentage of GR-1+ MDSCs (28% vs 27%, p=0.92), CD11b+, CD11c+ and CD27+ cells were similar regardless of EV origin. No significant changes in T cells, MDSCs, macrophages, dendritic or NK cells were observed in the lymph node or spleen of animals that received hMSC-EV versus mMSC-EVs. In conclusion, human MSC-EVs elicited no discernible immune response in mice, supporting the hypothesis that MSC-EVs retain the immune privilege of the secretory cell. This reinforces the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs.">

        <tr id="Although immune therapy has seen significant advances, the majority of breast and other solid tumors do not respond or quickly develop de novo resistance. One factor driving resistance is highly immune suppressive myeloid cells (MCs) such as macrophages. Previous work has established clinical links between cholesterol and cancer outcome, and that MC function can be regulated through disruption in cholesterol metabolism. Thus, we screened for proteins that were expressed in MCs, involved in cholesterol homeostasis and whose expression was associated with survival; we identify the cholesterol efflux protein ABCA1. Preclinical studies revealed that ABCA1 activity resulted in increased anti-cancer functions of macrophages: enhanced tumor infiltration, decreased angiogenic potential, reduced efferocytosis, and improved support of CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, different AKT isoforms are involved, through both PI3K dependent and independent mechanisms. Assessment of human blood and breast tumors revealed correlations between ABCA1 in macrophages and angiogenic potential, VEGFA, and CD8 T cell abundance and activity, highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings. The culmination of the effects of ABCA1 on MC function were demonstrated through increased tumor growth and metastasis in mice with MC specific knockout of ABCA1. Therefore, modulating ABCA1 activity within MCs may represent a novel approach to immune therapy.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes (CTL) are crucial in antiviral immune responses. However, their recruitment to infection sites renders them at risk of viral infection that could modulate their effector activity. CTL express RIG-I that detects cytosolic viral RNA and subsequently induce antiviral gene expression. Here, we investigated how influenza A virus (IAV) infection influence TCR-dependent effector responses. IAV infection of CTL stimulated RIG-I, and activated downstream pathways including TBK1 and NF-⍰B, resulting in type-I interferon secretion. Transfection of CTL with a pure RIG-I ligand, tri-phosphorylated double stranded RNA(3p-dsRNA), not only stimulated these pathways but also enhanced CTL proliferation in vitro and protected them from IAV infection. Analogous with a positive effect on CD8 effector function, both IAV infection and RIG-I ligand transfection enhanced CTL degranulation and cytokine secretion. Conversely, activation of CTL via CD3/CD28-crosslinking increased their susceptibility to IAV infection. Altogether, RIG-I stimulation either by IAV infection or 3p-dsRNA transfection promoted cell intrinsic antiviral pathways and enhanced CD8 effector functions. These findings suggest that RIG-I agonists could enhance and prolong CTL effector function in immunotherapy.">

For this reason, recent therapeutic algorithms include immunotherapeutic agents that target such cell populations for the treatment of patients with a variety of solid tumors. In contrast to solid tumors, such immunotherapeutic strategies failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this reason, the study of immunophenotypic and molecular changes in cytotoxic effector cell populations in patients with such disorders would provide the necessary evidence for the development of novel immunotherapies. In this review, we provide an overview of experimental studies describing the modulation of CD8+ T cell populations in patients with myeloid neoplasms, focusing on whether and how specific cell phenotypes are linked to disease progression and treatment.">

        <tr id="Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective treatment for aggressive hematologic malignancies. However, the risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a significant barrier to allo-HSCT. GVHD is a debilitating condition with high mortality rates and current therapeutic options for GVHD are limited, with corticosteroids being the standard treatment. However, the adverse effects of steroids make prolonged use difficult, necessitating the development of safer therapies. IL-35-producing B-cells (i35-Bregs) have emerged as critical regulators of immunity during autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated whether i35-Bregs immunotherapy can suppress and mitigate GVHD. Methods: We administered a single dose of i35-Bregs (1.5×106) to mice undergoing allo-HSCT and monitored disease severity and survival of GVHD mice over 90 days post-transplantation. We discovered that i35-Bregs secrete exosomes containing membrane-bound IL-35 (i35-Exosomes) and investigated whether ex-vivo generated i35-exosomes can be used as stand-alone immunotherapy for GVHD. i35-Breg-induced expression of cytokines or checkpoint proteins (PD-1, LAG-3, CTLA-4) was analyzed by Flow cytometry, ELISA, and RNA-seq analysis. Characterization of membrane-bound IL-35 was by Proximity ligation assay (PLA), immunohistochemistry/Confocal microscopy and Alpha Fold-Multimer modeling. Results: A single dose of 1.5×106 i35-Breg reduced severity of GVHD and prolonged GVHD survival, with more than 70% i35-Breg-treated mice surviving beyond day-90 post-transplantation while observing 100% mortality among untreated mice by day-45. Contrary to the view that IL-35 is secreted cytokine, we show here that i35-Bregs mitigate GVHD via membrane-bound IL-35 and by secreting i35-exosomes. Furthermore, i35-Bregs or ex-vivo generated i35-exosomes induce alloreactive T-cells to upregulate checkpoint proteins associated with T-cell exhaustion and anergy, inhibiting alloreactive responses and propagating infectious-tolerance mechanisms that suppress GVHD. Importantly, i35-Bregs or i35-exosomes suppresses GVHD by increasing bystander lymphocytes coated with immunosuppressive i35-exosomes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that i35-Bregs and i35-exosomes play a critical role in mitigating GVHD. The combination of i35-Breg and i35-exosome immunotherapy may be an effective strategy for treating GVHD and other inflammatory diseases.">

Streptococcus lutetiensis (S. lutetiensis) was found to be enriched in the tumour tissues of GC patients. Further analysis using single-cell sequencing and flow cytometry showed that S. lutetiensis notably affects the antitumour immunity by suppressing IL17 signalling and reducing the population of CD8+IL17A+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells by activating Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response. Mouse models confirm S. lutetiensis promotes GC progression by impairing immune responses in CD8+IL17A+TRM cells, suggesting it as a potential GC prognosis indicator and immunotherapy target, highlighting the microbiome's role in cancer progression.">

        <tr id="The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has revolutionized cancer treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. However, resistance remains a critical challenge. This study aimed to comparatively elucidate immunophenotypic changes in syngeneic mouse models sensitive (MC-38) or resistant (LLC1) to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. In the sensitive MC-38 model, anti-PD-1 therapy increased dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, while decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment. Enhanced expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I/II) and costimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86) was observed on tumor-associated DCs and macrophages. Tumor-infiltrating CD4+T, CD8+T, regulatory T, NK, and NKT cells also significantly increased. Importantly, treatment boosted lymphocyte cytotoxic potential, with perforin identified as a key marker of efficacy. Notably, perforin expression in CD4+T and NKT cells strongly negatively correlated with tumor volume. In contrast, the resistant LLC1 model exhibited minimal immunophenotypic changes upon treatment. These findings highlight critical immune modifications induced by anti-PD-1 therapy, particularly the role of perforin, and the DC/MDSC ratio in predicting therapeutic outcomes. This research offers valuable insights into potential predictive biomarkers and informs strategies to overcome resistance, emphasizing the complex interplay between anti-PD-1 treatment and the tumor microenvironment, ultimately aiming to improve immunotherapy response rates.">

        <tr id="T cells play diverse roles in cancer immunology, acting as tumor suppressors, cytotoxic effectors, enhancers of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and immune suppressors; providing memory and surveillance; modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME); or activating innate immune cells. However, cancer cells can disrupt T cell function, leading to T cell exhaustion and a weakened immune response against the tumor. The expression of exhausted T cell (Tex) markers plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune landscape of multiple cancers. Our aim was to systematically investigate the role of known T cell exhaustion (Tex) markers across multiple cancers while exploring their molecular interactions, mutation profiles, and potential implications for immunotherapy. The mRNA expression profile of six Tex markers, LAG-3, PDCD1, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CXCL13, and LAYN was investigated in pan-cancer. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), and other repositories, we characterized the differential expression of the Tex markers, their association with the patients’ survival outcome, and their mutation profile in multiple cancers. Additionally, we analyzed the effects on cancer-related pathways and immune infiltration within the TME, offering valuable insights into mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and progression. Finally, the correlation between their expression and sensitivity to multiple anti-cancer drugs was investigated extensively. Differential expression of all six markers was significantly associated with KIRC and poor prognosis in several cancers. They also played a potential activating role in apoptosis, EMT, and hormone ER pathways, as well as a potential inhibitory role in the DNA damage response and RTK oncogenic pathways. Infiltration of different immune cells was also found to be associated with the expression of the Tex-related genes in most cancer types. These findings underline that the reviving of exhausted T cells can be used to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Staphylococcus aureus poses an enormous burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Making an efficacious vaccine has however proven extremely challenging. Due to colonizing interactions, pre-existing S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells are often found in the human population and yet a detailed characterization of their phenotypes and how they might in turn impact vaccine efficacy are thus far unknown. Using an activation induced marker assay to sort for S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells in an effector function-independent manner, single cell transcriptomic analysis was conducted. Remarkably, S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells consisted not only of a broader spectrum of conventional T cells (Tcon) than previously described but also of regulatory T cells (Treg). As compared to polyclonally-activated CD4+ T cells, S. aureus-specific Tcon were enriched for the expression of the Th17-type cytokine genes IL17A, IL22 and IL26, while higher percentages of S. aureus-specific Treg expressed the T Cell Immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), a pleiotropic immune checkpoint. Notably, the antagonistic anti-TIGIT mAb Tiragolumab increased IL-1β production in response to S. aureus in vitro. Therefore, these results uncover the presence of S. aureus-specific TIGIT+ Treg in the blood of healthy subjects that could blunt responses to vaccination and indicate TIGIT as a potential targetable biomarker to overcome pre-exposure-induced immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="B cells are essential components of the immune response, primarily recognized for their ability to produce antibodies. However, emerging research reveals their important roles in regulating immune responses and influencing tumor development, independent of antibodies. The connection between tumor progression and alterations in the tumor microenvironment is well-established, as immune infiltrating cells can enhance the survival of tumor cells by modifying their surroundings. Despite this, the majority of studies have focused on T cells and macrophages, creating a gap in our understanding of B cells. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) represent a crucial subpopulation that plays a significant role in maintaining immune balance. They may have a substantial impact on tumor immunity by negatively regulating tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This paper reviews the existing literature on Bregs, examining their development, phenotypes, functions, and the mechanisms through which they exert their regulatory effects. Furthermore, we highlight their potential interventional roles and prognostic significance in cancer therapy. By addressing the current gaps in knowledge regarding Bregs within tumors, we hope to inspire further research that could lead to innovative cancer treatments and improved outcomes for patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Impairment of Akt signaling has been observed in antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) during chronic viral infections or tumor progression. Despite numerous studies emphasizing Akt’s role in driving CTL effector functions, there is limited exploration of using Akt molecules in T-cell engineering to enhance their antiviral or antitumor capabilities for therapeutic purposes. Some studies even conclude that inhibiting Akt activation during the in vitro expansion process can prevent T-cell exhaustion and boost the antitumor effector functions of chimeric antigen receptor-T cells in vivo. Given the unique expression patterns and functions of the three Akt isoforms in immune cells, we proposed that Akt isoforms in CTLs may regulate effector functions and T-cell exhaustion distinctly. Methods In this study, we genetically modified tumor/virus-antigen-specific T-cell receptor tg CTLs to ectopically express Akt isoforms via retroviral transduction. We subsequently conducted western blotting, flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing analysis to assess their Akt expression, expression of immune checkpoints, antitumor/antivirus functionalities, and transcriptome. Additionally, we employed a persistent Hepatitis B Virus mouse model and a syngeneic hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model for further evaluation of their antivirus/antitumor efficacies. Results We found that both Akt1 and Akt2 overexpression enhanced the cytotoxic capabilities of mouse CTLs, although with different dynamics. Specifically, Akt2 signaling in CTLs accelerated effector functions, leading to a rapid attack on tumor cells. Conversely, Akt1 signaling triggered calcium influx and subsequent nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation, while Akt2 signaling suppressed calcium influx, preventing excessive NFAT expression and nuclear translocation. This repression of NFAT transcriptional activity by Akt2 signaling during prolonged antigen stimulation subsequently led to reduced expression of transcription factors associated with T-cell exhaustion, such as Egr2, Nr4a, Tox, and immune checkpoints. Consequently, Akt2-overexpressed CTLs displayed reduced T-cell exhaustion within the tumor microenvironment and efficiently eradicated tumors. Conclusion These findings highlight the essential role of Akt signaling in enabling tumor-specific CTLs to eliminate cancer cells in the solid TME, with Akt isoforms differentially regulating the calcium–calcineurin–NFAT signaling pathway. This discovery suggests the potential of AKT2 in T-cell engineering technology to enhance the survival and effector functions of adoptively transferred T cells for treating liver malignancies or chronic viral infections.">

        <tr id="Introduction We investigated the impact of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associated cytokines and standard of care (SOC) RA therapeutics on immune checkpoint receptor (IR) expression on T cells to gain insights to disease pathology and therapeutic avenues. Methods We assessed IR expression by flow cytometry on T cell receptor activated T cells cultured in the presence of exogenously added single cytokines or RA patient synovial fluid. We also assessed RA synovial fluid stimulated samples in the presence of various single cytokine neutralizing antibodies or SOC therapeutics, including glucocorticoids, TNF, IL-6 receptor and JAK inhibitors. In addition to IR expression, we measured the impact on cytokine secretion profiles. Results RA-associated cytokines modulated IR expression, suggesting a role for these cytokines in regulation of disease pathology. By dissecting the influence of various inflammatory drivers within the RA inflammatory milieu, we discovered distinct regulation of IR expression by various cytokines including IL-10, IFNα/β, and TNF. Specifically, increased expression of TIM-3, PD-1, LAG-3 and CD28 in response to RA synovial fluid was driven by key cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IFNs, and TNF. In addition, SOC RA therapeutics such as glucocorticoids and TNF inhibitors modulated IR and cytokine expression in the presence of RA synovial fluid. Conclusions This study points to an important and intricate relationship between cytokines and IRs in shaping immune responses in autoimmune pathology. The modulation of IR expression by RA-associated cytokines and SOC therapeutics provides new insights for the use of targeted treatments in managing RA pathology.">

        <tr id="Development of novel vaccines and treatment approaches against tuberculosis are hampered by limited knowledge of what constitutes a protective immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Granulomas are organized immune aggregates that form in the lung in response to mycobacterial infection and are an important site of pathogen-host interaction. The composition and cellular microenvironment within the granuloma impacts the bacterial control capacity. To identify protective responses in granulomas, imaging mass cytometry was used to study archived lung tissue from low dose Mtb-infected non-human primates presenting with various levels of disease. This approach revealed that granuloma composition is correlated with the severity of lung pathology. Granulomas of animals with limited lung pathology were enriched for NK cells showing increased interactions with tissue macrophages. This work improves our understanding of local immune interactions in the lung and how these correlate with severity of tuberculosis disease. Author summary Tuberculosis remains the deadliest infectious disease in the world with 10 million new infections and 1.5 million deaths annually. The existing vaccine is not effective enough to halt the tuberculosis epidemic. In order to develop an improved vaccine, more complete and detailed knowledge on the immune responses that can successfully protect against tuberculosis is required. Individuals that are exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes tuberculosis disease, fall along a spectrum, with some individuals showing a strong innate capacity to protect against disease, while others fall ill. By studying these differences in a model organism, namely non-human primates, we can learn about protective immune responses. In primates with limited disease, the immune cell aggregates surrounding the bacteria in the lung contained more NK cells than were found in severe disease. In addition, interactions between NK cells and macrophages, cells that can eat bacteria, were seen a lot more in protected animals. This suggests that the interaction between NK cell and macrophages contributes to controlling tuberculosis disease, this knowledge can contribute to improved vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="Neuroblastoma (NB) is an immunologically “cold” tumor with poor or no inflamed substrates as most of solid pediatric tumors (SPT). Consistent data indicate that NB tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by myeloid cells, with little (but variable) T cell infiltration. The obstacles to lymphocyte infiltration and to their anti-tumor activity are due to different tumor immune evasion strategies, including loss of HLA Class I molecules, high expression of immune checkpoint molecular ligands leading to exhaustion of T effector (and NK) cells, induction of T regulatory, myeloid and stromal cells and secretion of immunosuppressive mediators. In odds with adult solid tumors, NB displays weak immunogenicity caused by intrinsic low mutational burden and scant expression of neoepitopes in the context of MHC-class I antigens which, in turn, are particularly poorly expressed on NB cells, thus inducing low anti-tumor T cell responses. In addition, NB is generated from embryonal cells and is the result of transcriptional abnormalities and not of the accumulation of genetic mutations over time, thus further explaining the low immunogenicity. The poor expression of immunogenic molecules on tumor cells is associated with the high production of immunosuppressive factors which further downregulate lymphocyte infiltration and activity, thus explaining the limited efficacy of new drugs in NB, as immune checkpoint inhibitors. This review is focused on examining the role of T effector and regulatory cells infiltrating TME of NB, taking into account their repertoire, phenotype, function, plasticity and, importantly, predictive value for defining novel targets for therapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Efficient tumor T-cell infiltration is crucial for the effectiveness of T-cell-based therapies against solid tumors. Eosinophils play crucial roles in recruiting T cells in solid tumors. Our group has previously generated induced eosinophils (iEOs) from human pluripotent stem cells and exhibited synergistic efficacy with CAR-T cells in solid tumor inhibition. However, administrated eosinophils might influx into inflammatory lungs, posing a potential safety risk. Mitigating the safety concern and enhancing efficacy is a promising development direction for further application of eosinophils.


METHODS
We developed a new approach to generate eosinophils with enhanced potency from human chemically reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (hCiPSCs) with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 signaling agonist R848.


RESULTS
R848-activated iEOs (R-iEOs) showed significantly decreased influx to the inflamed lungs, indicating a lower risk of causing airway disorders. Furthermore, these R-iEOs had enhanced anti-tumor functions, preferably accumulated at tumor sites, and further increased T-cell infiltration. The combination of R-iEOs and CAR-T cells suppressed tumor growth in mice. Moreover, the chemo-trafficking signaling increased in R-iEOs, which may contribute to the decreased lung influx of R-iEOs and the increased tumor recruitment of T cells.


CONCLUSION
Our study provides a novel approach to alleviate the potential safety concerns associated with eosinophils while increasing T-cell infiltration in solid tumors. This finding offers a prospective strategy for incorporating eosinophils to improve CAR-T-cell immunotherapy for solid tumors in the future.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND. Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating the exploration of alternate therapeutic approaches. Tumor-reactive or activated-by-cytokine killers (TRACK) are PD-L1+, highly cytolytic NK cells derived from umbilical cord blood NK cells and engineered to express soluble IL-15 (sIL15), and these cells show promise in preclinical studies against NSCLC. METHODS. We assessed safety, persistence, homing, and cytotoxic activity in 6 patients with advanced, refractory, and progressing NSCLC who received a low dose of unmatched, allogeneic, off-the-shelf sIL15_TRACK NK cells. We evaluated NK cell presence and persistence with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS. sIL15_TRACK NK cells had peak measurements at 1 hour and became undetectable 4 hours after each infusion. Cognate ligands to activating NK cell receptors were found in NSCLC. sIL15_TRACK NK cells were observed in a lung tumor biopsy 7 days after the final infusion, confirming their sustainment and tumor-homing ability. They retained cytolytic function following isolation from the lung tumor. Three of 6 patients achieved disease stabilization on repeat imaging, while the others progressed. CONCLUSION. Unmatched, allogeneic, cryopreserved, off-the-shelf sIL15_TRACK NK cells express activating receptors, home to tumor sites that express their cognate ligands, and retain cytolytic activity after infusion, underscoring their potential as a therapeutic approach in solid tumors. At low doses, the therapy was safely administered and showed preliminary evidence of activity in 3 of 6 patients with advanced and progressive NSCLC. Additional dose escalation cohorts and coadministration with atezolizumab are planned. TRIAL REGISTRATION. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05334329. FUNDING.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are effective in clinical settings; however, they present immune-related adverse effects and financial burden. Although dose reduction of ICIs may mitigate these limitations, it could compromise therapeutic efficacy. Using two adjuvants (poly(I:C) and LAG-3-Ig) combined with three neoantigen peptides (Comb), we examined whether Comb could enhance the efficacy of reduced dose of αPD-1 monoclonal antibody (RD-αPD-1 mAb), which has limited efficacy. In a murine colorectal cancer model using an MC38 cell line, Comb addition to RD-αPD-1 mAb enhanced treatment efficacy. Analysis of the tumour microenvironment (TME) in mice treated with Comb using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed decreased macrophages with highly expressing immunosuppressive genes and increased plasmacytoid dendritic cells with highly expressing antigen-presenting genes. A potent infiltration of CD8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) with an effector profile was only observed in RD-αPD-1 mAb with Comb. Additionally, single-cell T cell receptor repertoire analysis underscored an oligoclonal expansion of CD8+ TILs following treatment with RD-αPD-1 mAb with Comb. This novel immune drug combination may be a promising strategy for reducing αPD-1 mAb dosage while preserving antitumour efficacy through modulating the TME.">

Myeloid cells spontaneously home to tumors and can thus be reprogrammed and/or engineered to directly attack tumor cells or locally and selectively deliver therapeutically relevant payloads that may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy against difficult-to-access solid tumors. In the context of myeloid cell-based therapies, adoptive transfer of monocytes has often been overshadowed by infusion of differentiated macrophages or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite their promising therapeutic potential. Here, we summarize the recent improvements and benefits of using monocytes for the treatment of solid tumors, their current clinical applications and the challenges of their use as well as some possible strategies to overcome them.">

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

        <tr id="Background Cryoablation plays a key role in the comprehensive management of lung adenocarcinoma, characterized by its ability to activate antitumor immunity. This study aimed to explore the impact of cryoablation on the local immune microenvironment, focusing on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the TGF-β pathway. Methods Single-cell sequencing was employed to identify differences in immune cell populations and related pathway expression between lung adenocarcinoma tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues. Prospective observations of changes in Tregs in the peripheral blood pre- and post-cryoablation for lung adenocarcinoma were conducted at Dongfang Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. Bulk RNA-seq analysis of mouse tumor tissues was performed to predict the potential mechanisms underlying cryoablation-induced antitumor immunity. Finally, these predictions were validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments employing cell cryoablation and mouse subcutaneous tumor transplantation models. Results Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed intricate interactions between Tregs subpopulations and the regulation of the immune response in lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting the involvement of the TGF-β pathway. A significant decrease in the level of Tregs was noted at 30 days post-cryoablation compared to pre-surgical and 3-day post-surgery levels. The cellular and murine cryoablation models validated the inhibitory effect of cryoablation on Tregs and its potential to stimulate antitumor immunity. Additionally, the results of bulk RNA-seq demonstrated the role of cryoablation in regulating postoperative immunity via the TGF-β pathway. Cryoablation decreased the expression levels of TGF-β1, suppressed the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, and downregulated the expression of FOXP3, thereby inhibiting the conversion of CD4 + T cell precursors into Tregs. Moreover, cryoablation enhanced the expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), thereby promoting its antitumor activity. Conclusions This study revealed the effective modification of the lung adenocarcinoma microenvironment by cryoablation through the suppression of Tregs and activation of antitumor immunity via the TGF-β pathway. These findings hold implications for optimizing cryoablation-based therapies and guiding future clinical trials on lung adenocarcinoma treatment.

        <tr id="Toll-like receptors (TLR) are phylogenetically conserved mediators of innate immunity that are essential for establishing adaptive immune responses against invading pathogens. TLR7 is an endosomal receptor expressed predominantly in myeloid and B cells. Activation of TLR7 induces Type I interferon and proinflammatory responses; therefore, targeting TLR7 is a promising strategy for antitumor therapy. Although the use of bacterial components to trigger innate immune responses in cancer patients started a century ago, the effectiveness of systemic TLR agonists has been rather underwhelming in clinical trials, partly due to nonspecific immune activation leading to safety and tolerability issues. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) constitute a proven therapeutic modality amenable to systemic administration with limited toxicity concerns via a targeted delivery platform. We generated TLR7 agonist–antibody conjugates that recognize tumor antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Generated ADCs demonstrated robust activity in in vitro tumor antigen-presenting cell (APC) coculture systems as indicated by dose-dependent upregulation of PD-L1 and CD86 on macrophages. TLR7 agonist-ADC provided superior tumor growth control compared to intravenously (IV) administrated free TLR7 agonist. Treatment with TLR7 agonist-ADC led to prolonged activation of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with minimum immune activation in the periphery. Systemic and tissue exposure studies demonstrated tumor-specific free drug release by targeted ADC treatment. In summary, the TLR7 agonist-ADC can potentially activate immune cells in the TME to generate tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses, making it an attractive approach for precision cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Despite an initial response to platinum-based chemotherapy, most patients with extensive stage of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) have a poor prognosis due to recurrence. Additionally, the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors is more modest than non-small cell lung cancer. Natural killer (NK) cells can directly eliminate cancer cells without prior sensitization; this is largely governed by inflammatory cytokines, which serve as killing signals to cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether the combination of NK cells plus atezolizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the protein programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), has a synergistic effect against SCLC. NK cells were expanded and activated using irradiated K562 feeder cells in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2/IL-15/IL-21/41BB ligand for 14 days. Expanded and activated NK cells (eNK) were combined with atezolizumab and used to treat SCLC cells in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The results revealed increased PD-L1 expression in SCLC cells after the eNK challenge. eNK cells plus atezolizumab demonstrated increased cytotoxicity toward target SCLC cells, as evidenced by increased interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α production, and higher levels of SCLC stem cell (CD44+CD90+) suppression. Combined treatment with eNK and atezolizumab more effectively inhibited SCLC tumor growth and significantly prolonged the survival of treated mice. Our findings revealed that combining eNK with atezolizumab strongly increased cytotoxicity, significantly inhibited SCLC tumor growth, and prolonged the survival of treated mice. These results provide a framework for developing a more advanced immunotherapeutic modality for future clinical trials for patients with SCLC.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors include targeting additional immunosuppressive compartments in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Inhibitory macrophages (Mφ) can be one of the most abundant immune cells in the TME associated with poor prognosis. However, to date, selective Mφ depletion strategies as a cancer immunotherapy have not been successful in clinical trials. Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure (MARCO) is one of a family of class-A scavenger receptors expressed by Mφ in the TME and is one of the most upregulated transcripts in dendritic cells (DC) following their ex vivo uptake of dead tumor cells. The clinical significance of MARCO expression in the TME is not fully understood. Methods The therapeutic potential of targeting MARCO by an anti-murine MARCO (ED31, clone ED31) monoclonal antibody, which inhibits ligand-binding to MARCO, was explored in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) in C57BL/6J mice bearing B16F10 or Pan02 tumors. The mechanism by which ED31 impacts the TME was investigated by flow cytometry in the different treatment arms. The contribution of Mφ was assessed by both in vivo depletion and in vitro functional assays. Chemokine production was measured by a bead-based multiplex assay. Results ED31 enhanced antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4, but not of anti-PD-1. Analysis of the TME revealed that adding ED31 to anti-CTLA-4 substantially increased immune cell infiltration, including mature conventional DC recruitment, that was due to a switch to M1-pattern chemokines by Mφ. Mφ depletion completely abrogated both the increase in immune cell infiltration and chemokine production, and abolished the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy. Conclusions Targeting MARCO as an additional checkpoint in the TME can offer a strategy to improve the antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 through a mechanism involving Mφ reprogramming rather than their depletion.">

        <tr id="To provide protection, anticipatory T cell–dependent immunity is reliant on the generation and maintenance of a naïve T cell repertoire, which is sufficiently diverse to ensure recognition of newly encountered antigens. Therefore, under steady-state conditions, a given individual needs to maintain a large pool of naïve T cells, ready to respond to potential threats. Here, we demonstrate that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (Ndrg3) is essential for naïve T cell stability. Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis.">

        <tr id="Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECCA) is a malignant tumor. The precise role of T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), an emerging immunosuppressive receptor, in ECCA, and its impact on CD8+ T cell exhaustion (Tex) remains unclear. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) isolated from ECCA. We found that TIGIT was significantly overexpressed in TOX+CD8 T cells. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated that increased TIGIT expression was associated with poorer patient survival. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that TIGIT+CD8+ T cells exhibited decreased TNF-α, IFN-γ, and TCF-1 expression, accompanied by elevated PD-1 and TIM-3 expression compared to TIGIT−CD8+ T cells. In the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, the anti-TIGIT treatment group demonstrated reduced tumor weight, enhanced CD8 frequency, and an increased IFN-γ proportion compared to the PBS treatment group. The TIGIT antibody-treated group exhibited a notably higher fraction of GRZB, and anti-TIGIT treatment led to elevated TCF-1 protein levels and decreased protein levels of TOX1 and NR4A1. Moreover, TIGIT+CD8 T cells from TILs appear to be in a state of exhaustion with low potential killing capacity in ECCA, as shown by scRNA-seq. Taken together, the present study underscores the significant role of TIGIT in ECCA, contributing to T cell exhaustion and a compromised CD8+ T cell immune response. Targeting TIGIT presents a promising therapeutic avenue to enhance the CD8+ T-cell response, thereby potentially improving ECCA therapeutic benefits.">

Metabolism plays a key role in T cell function, shaping their energy requirements, activation, and differentiation. Recent studies highlight altered metabolic signaling as a pivotal factor in T cell aging, influencing the ability of T cells to maintain quiescence, respond to activation, and differentiate into functional subsets. Aberrant metabolic pathways disrupt the quiescence of aged T cells and skew their differentiation toward short-lived, pro-inflammatory effector T cells while hindering the generation of long-lived memory and T follicular helper cells. These changes contribute to a hyper-inflammatory state, exacerbate chronic low-grade inflammation, and compromise immune homeostasis. In this review, we explore how metabolic signaling is altered during T cell aging and the resulting functional impacts. We also discuss therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring proper T cell differentiation, improving vaccine responses, and rejuvenating immune function in older populations.">

Main body In this Perspectives article, we provide an overview of the biology of HLH / MAS and the critical role of interferon-g in disease pathogenesis. We discuss the recent discovery of cycling lymphocytes in HLH / MAS marked by expression of CD38 and HLA-DR, which are primary producers of IFN-γ. The expansion of cycling lymphocytes correlates with disease activity and helps to distinguish HLH / MAS from clinical mimics. We demonstrate an approach to quantify CD38+HLA-DR+ cycling lymphocytes and evaluate their utility as a diagnostic biomarker for HLH / MAS. Lastly, we discuss the treatment of MAS, including potential therapeutic options to target these pathogenic lymphocytes. Conclusion Understanding of biology of cycling lymphocytes in HLH / MAS will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches to overcome these fatal hyperinflammatory disorders.">

 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a critical treatment for hematologic disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, and specific immune deficiencies. Despite its efficacy, challenges such as engraftment failure and delayed neutrophil regeneration remain significant barriers. These complications lead to prolonged cytopenia, increased risks of infections and other complications, and elevated morbidity and mortality rates. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to play essential roles in supporting hematopoiesis, the precise mechanisms and interactions between MSCs and other cellular components in HSCT require further investigation. Methods To address these challenges, we explored the combined infusion of allotype-cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and activated T cells from the same donor along with third-party MSCs. The study assessed the effects of this triple-cell therapy on neutrophil differentiation and function ex vivo and in vivo. Using a respiratory infection model, we evaluated the accumulation of human neutrophils, cytokine secretion (IL-6 and IL-8), bacterial clearance, and overall survival compared to control groups. Results The triple-cell therapy demonstrated a significant improvement in the differentiation of human HSCs into neutrophils both in ex vivo and in vivo. In the respiratory infection model, this approach resulted in enhanced accumulation of human neutrophils, increased secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, superior bacterial clearance, and reduced mortality rates compared to the control group. These findings highlight the synergistic interplay between allo-HSCs, MSCs, and activated T cells in promoting neutrophil production and function. Conclusions Our study presents a novel therapeutic strategy combining allo-HSCs, activated T cells, and third-party MSCs to enhance neutrophil production and functionality post-transplantation. This approach not only accelerates neutrophil regeneration but also improves resistance to infections, offering a promising avenue to overcome engraftment challenges in HSCT.">

        <tr id="Introduction Hematogenous disseminated tuberculosis (DTB) has an unclear etiology that likely involves multiple factors. Understanding the underlying immunological characteristics of DTB is crucial for elucidating its pathogenesis. Methods We conducted single-cell RNA transcriptome and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on samples from seven DTB patients. Additionally, we integrated and analyzed data from two published profiles of latent TB infection, three active TB cases, and two healthy controls. Results Our analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of inflammatory immune cells (e.g., monocytes and macrophages) in DTB patients, along with a notably lower abundance of various lymphocytes (including T cells, B cells, and plasma cells), suggesting that lymphopenia is a prominent feature of the disease. T cell pseudotime analysis indicated a decrease in the expression of most hypervariable genes over time, pointing to T cell functional exhaustion. Furthermore, a marked absence of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells was observed in the peripheral blood of DTB patients. In the TCR repertoire, specific polymorphisms (TRAV9-2, TRAV13-1, TRBV20-1, and TRBV5-1) and dominant clones (TRAJ49, TRBJ2-7, and TRBJ2-1) were identified. Analysis of the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) showed that the most frequent combination was TRAV1-2/TRAJ33, with the motif “CAAMD” being significantly reduced in DTB patients. Discussion These findings suggest that lymphopenia and T cell exhaustion, along with unique TCR signatures, may play critical roles in DTB pathogenesis. The reduced “CAAMD” motif and altered TCR clonotypes provide novel insights into the complex cellular dynamics associated with the disease, potentially offering new avenues for targeted immunological interventions.">

Recent studies have shown a correlation between CD8+ TRM cells and favorable clinical outcomes in various types of cancer, indicating their potential role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, the dual nature of CD8+ TRM cells presents challenges, as their inappropriate activation may lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review highlights significant advancements in the field, focusing on the differentiation pathways and phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8+ TRM cells across different tissues and disease states. We also review their protective roles in various contexts and the implications for vaccine development against infections and treatment strategies for tumors. Overall, this comprehensive review outlines the common features of CD8+ TRM cell differentiation and biological functions, emphasizing their specific characteristics across diverse tissues and disease states, which can guide the design of therapies against infections and tumors while minimizing the risk of autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi infections range from asymptomatic (AS) to severe visceral leishmaniasis (VL). One of the manifestations is an atypical non-ulcerated cutaneous leishmaniasis (NUCL), which occurs in some locations of Central America with few cases of VL. We conducted a transcriptomic analysis of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) on blood samples from NUCL, AS, VL patients from Amapala, Honduras, and healthy controls. RNA-seq revealed a similar perturbation of gene expression in NUCL and AS. Eight gene signatures of CMI were found in NUCL involved in CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration, reactive oxygen species generation, PD-1 receptor ligand, inflammasome assembly, chemotaxis, complement receptor and suppressor immune cell infiltration. NUCL was distinguished from VL by its up-regulation of differently expressed genes (DEGs) related to T lymphocyte exhaustion, adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes, and down-regulation of oxidative stress genes. In contrast, VL exhibited up-regulated DEGs involved in antigen cross-presentation, and similar to VL from Brazil, down-regulated DEGs involved in innate immunity. Corroborating the transcriptome findings, both the Leishmanin skin test, and the immunopathology of NUCL skin lesion defined NUCL as a proinflammatory condition, intermediate between the AS and VL clinical outcomes. That condition may be the underlying element for the benign nature of the NUCL.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Targeted therapies leveraging the innate immune system are emerging as promising cancer treatments. The mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) plays a crucial role in initiating innate immune responses, but its clinical use is limited by the risk of uncontrolled activation and systemic toxicity. To address this, we developed a novel therapeutic agent, the truncated interferon activation switch (TRIAS), combining MAVS truncates with a tumor antigen-targeting single-chain variable fragment (scFv). This design ensures antigen-dependent, controlled activation. Lentiviral delivery of TRIAS induced significant antitumor responses, including complete tumor regression in some cases. Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis further confirmed that tumor cells were the predominant population expressing the transgene. TRIAS-expressing tumor cells exhibited enhanced antitumor activity, likely due to increased cytokine release and upregulated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, enabling tumor cells to function as antigen-presenting cells. This activated other immune cells, driving adaptive immune responses. Additionally, TRIAS promoted a proinflammatory shift in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In conclusion, TRIAS was validated as an innovative immunotherapeutic agent with MAVS-like immune-activating properties and tightly controlled mechanisms, offering a safer and more effective approach for clinical cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The body’s innate immune system plays a pivotal role in identifying and eliminating cancer cells. However, as the immune system ages, its functionality can deteriorate, becoming dysfunctional, inefficient, or even inactive—a condition referred to as immunosenescence. This decline significantly increases the risk of malignancies. While the pro-cancer effects of T-cell aging have been widely explored, there remains a notable gap in the literature regarding the impact of aging on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. This review seeks to address this gap, with emphasis on these cell types. Furthermore, although certain cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have demonstrated efficacy across a broad spectrum of cancers, elderly patients are less likely to derive clinical benefit from these treatments. In some cases, they may even experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While senolytic strategies have shown promise in exerting anti-cancer effects, their adverse reactions and potential off-target effects present significant challenges. This review aims to elucidate the pro-cancer effects of immunosenescence, its implications for the efficacy and safety of ICIs, and potential anti-aging treatment strategies. In addition, optimizing anti-aging therapies to minimize adverse reactions and enhance therapeutic outcomes remains a critical focus for future research endeavors.">

        <tr id="Tumors often arise in chronically inflamed, and thus immunologically highly active niches. While immune cells are able to recognize and remove transformed cells, tumors eventually escape the control of the immune system by shaping their immediate microenvironment. In this context, macrophages are of major importance, as they initially exert anti-tumor functions before they adopt a tumor-associated phenotype that instead inhibits anti-tumor immune responses and even allows for sustaining a smoldering inflammatory, growth promoting tumor microenvironment (TME). Type I interferons (IFNs) are well established modulators of inflammatory reactions. While they have been shown to directly inhibit tumor growth, there is accumulating evidence that they also play an important role in altering immune cell functions within the TME. In the present review, we focus on the impact of type I IFNs on anti-tumor responses, driven by monocytes and macrophages. Specifically, we will provide an overview of tumor-intrinsic factors, which impinge on IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, like the presence of nucleic acids, metabolites, or hypoxia. We will further summarize the current understanding of the consequences of altered IFN responses on macrophage phenotypes, i.e., differentiation, polarization, and functions. For the latter, we will focus on macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing and phagocytosis, as well as on how macrophages affect their environment by secreting cytokines and directly interacting with immune cells. Finally, we will discuss how type I IFN responses in macrophages might affect and should be considered for current and future tumor therapies.">

 Natural killer (NK) cells are crucial constituents of innate immunity, playing a vital role in the early defense against viral infections and cancer. Their antiviral capabilities stem from direct cytotoxic activity against infected cells and immunoregulatory functions that modulate adaptive immune responses. In the context of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), NK cells contribute to controlling viral replication and limiting excessive inflammatory responses.



 This review highlights the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity, focusing on their interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). We discuss potential sources of NK cells for adoptive transfer therapy, critical factors influencing their therapeutic efficacy, and considerations for clinical translation in COVID-19 treatment.



 Various NK cell sources for adoptive therapy are discussed, including peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetically engineered NK cells. Key factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of NK cell-based therapies are analyzed, including cytokine modulation, NK cell subset selection, and delivery methods.



 Understanding the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity and the factors that influence the success of adoptive NK cell therapy can inform the design of more effective immunotherapies for COVID-19 patients. Strategies for improving NK cell function, such as genetic modification and optimizing therapy protocols, are highlighted to enhance therapeutic outcomes.



 NK cells neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by releasing cytotoxic granules, inhibiting replication, and modulating inflammation. They originate from peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetic engineering. Therapeutic strategies include adoptive transfer, cytokine modulation, and optimized delivery. Inflammation is controlled, reducing excessive immune responses.

        <tr id="Background Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) initiates secondary injuries that worsen neurological damage and hinder recovery. While peripheral immune responses play a key role in stroke outcomes, clinical results from immunotherapy have been suboptimal, with limited focus on T-cell dynamics. Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) offer therapeutic potential due to their immunomodulatory properties. They can regulate immune responses and reduce neuroinflammation, potentially enhancing recovery by fostering a pro-regenerative peripheral immune environment. However, the effect of UMSCs on T-cell dynamics in AIS remains underexplored. This study investigates T-cell dynamics following AIS and examines how UMSCs may mitigate immune dysregulation to develop better treatment strategies. Methods AIS patients (NIHSS scores 0–15) were recruited within 72 h of stroke onset, with peripheral blood samples collected on Day 0 (enrollment) and Day 7. T-cell compartments were identified by flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine levels were quantified using a cytometric bead array (CBA). Mitochondria in UMSCs were labeled with MitoTracker. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients were isolated, treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cocultured with UMSCs in both direct contact and Transwell systems. Flow cytometry, CBA, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect T-cell compartments, gene expression markers for helper T (Th) cell differentiation, cytokine profiles, mitochondrial transfer, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA in UMSCs was depleted. The effects of UMSCs and mitochondria-depleted UMSCs on ischemic stroke mice were compared through behavioral assessments and analysis of the peripheral immune microenvironment. Results In AIS, T-cell compartments underwent a phenotypic shift from naïve to effector or memory states, with a specific increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells, leading to alterations in T-cell-mediated immune functions. In an ex vivo co-culture system, LPS stimulation further amplified these disparities, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in T cells. Notably, UMSCs restored mitochondrial function and reversed the shift in T-cell compartments through mitochondrial transfer. Critically, UMSC treatment significantly improved both neurological deficits and peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke mice, whereas mitochondria-depleted UMSCs failed to produce this effect. Conclusions Our comprehensive insights into the key attributes of T-cell compartments in acute ischemic stroke and the immune regulatory mechanisms of UMSCs provide a crucial theoretical foundation for understanding peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke and the therapeutic potential of UMSC treatment.

        <tr id="Abstract Checkpoint inhibitors have led to remarkable benefits in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet response rates remain below expectations. High-dimensional analysis and mechanistic experiments in clinical samples and relevant NSCLC models uncovered the immune composition of lung cancer tissues, providing invaluable insights into the functional properties of tumor-infiltrating T cells and myeloid cells. Among myeloid cells, type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) stand out for their unique ability to induce effector CD8 T cells against neoantigens and coordinate antitumoral immunity. Notably, lung resident cDC1 are particularly abundant and long-lived and express a unique tissue-specific gene program, underscoring their central role in lung immunity. Here, we discuss recent insights on the induction and regulation of antitumoral T cell responses in lung cancer, separating it from the tissue-agnostic knowledge generated from heterogeneous tumor models. We focus on the most recent studies dissecting functional states and spatial distribution of lung cDC1 across tumor stages and their impact on T cell responses to neoantigens. Finally, we highlight relevant gaps and emerging strategies to harness lung cDC1 immunostimulatory potential.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT B cells play a crucial role in autoimmune diseases, as evidenced by autoantibody responses and the effectiveness of B cell‐targeted therapies. Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), which target downstream signaling of cytokine receptors, are potent rheumatic disease‐modifying drugs. However, besides reducing inflammation, JAKi may impact the adaptive immune system. In this study, we examined the effects of JAKi on B‐cell function using in vitro cultures and multiparameter flow cytometry. The results show a JAKi‐mediated reduction in plasma cell differentiation, primarily by inhibition of memory B‐cell stimulation and proliferation. JAKi exposure resulted in stalling R848, IL‐2, and IL‐21 stimulated B cells in an intermediate activated state with elevated naïve cells displaying increased expression of CXCR5, CD71, CD22, and CD20. In addition, the data demonstrate a moderate JAKi‐mediated reduction of B cell TNF and IL‐8 cytokine expression following stimulation. Importantly, the efficacy varied greatly between drugs; tofacitinib and upadacitinib (pan JAKi; JAK1i) exhibited the strongest impact, while baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2i) showed donor‐dependent variation, and filgotinib (JAK1i) had no effect. All JAKi, except filgotinib, inhibited IL‐2 or IL‐21‐induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Still, filgotinib demonstrated similar inhibition of phospho‐STAT5 as other JAKi following IL‐21. These findings underscore the therapeutic impact of JAKi through the modulation of B‐cell functions.">

        <tr id="Recent studies on the pathogenesis of leukemia have led to remarkable advances in disease treatment. Numerous studies have shown the potential and viability of immune responses against leukemia. In the classical pathway, this process is often initiated by the upstream activity of CD39, which hydrolyzes extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to AMP. Subsequently, CD73 acts on AMP to generate adenosine, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, CD73 can also utilize substrates derived from other molecules through the non-canonical NAD+ pathway, specifically via the CD38/CD203a/CD73 axis, further enhancing adenosine production and facilitating immune escape. Targeting CD73 has shown potential in disrupting these immunosuppressive pathways, thereby enhancing anti-leukemic immune responses and improving patient outcomes. Inhibiting CD73 not only reduces the levels of immunosuppressive adenosine but also increases the efficacy of existing immunotherapies, such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, making it a versatile therapeutic target in leukemia treatment. This review discusses the potential of CD73 as a therapeutic target and emphasizes its unique position in the immune escape mechanism of leukemia. Moreover, this review provides an overview of the current research progress and future trends, emphasizing the clinical significance of targeting CD73 and other potential therapeutic strategies in leukemia.">

        <tr id="Brain metastases (BMs) are a relatively common and severe complication in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), significantly affecting patient prognosis. Metastatic tumor cells can alter the brain tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote an immunosuppressive state, characterized by reduced infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), diminished expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and changes in other proinflammatory factors and immune cell populations. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, play a pivotal role in modulating the central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment through interactions with metastatic cancer cells, astrocytes, and infiltrating T cells. The M2 phenotype of microglia contributes to immunosuppression in BM via the activation of signaling pathways such as STAT3 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. Recent advances have enhanced our understanding of the immune landscape of BMs in NSCLC, particularly regarding immune evasion within the CNS. Current immunotherapeutic strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promise for NSCLC patients with BM, demonstrating intracranial activity and manageable safety profiles. Future research is warranted to further explore the molecular and immune mechanisms underlying BM, aiming to develop more effective treatments.">

        <tr id="Background Recent evidence suggests that clonally expanded cytotoxic T cells play a role in various autoimmune diseases. Late-onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA) exhibits unique characteristics compared to other RA forms, suggesting distinct immunological mechanisms. This study aimed to examine the involvement of cytotoxic T cells in LORA. Methods Fresh peripheral blood samples were collected from 78 treatment-naïve active RA patients, 12 with difficult-to-treat RA, and 16 healthy controls. Flow cytometry was employed to measure the proportions of CX3CR1+cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in these samples. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining was performed on lymphoid node and synovial biopsy samples from patients with RA. Results CX3CR1+cytotoxic CD4+ T cells were specifically increased in untreated, active patients with LORA, displaying features of CXCR3mid age-associated T helper cells known as “ThA”. CX3CR1⁺CD4⁺ T cells were identified as a cytotoxic ThA subset, as nearly all of these cells specifically expressed granzyme B. These cells were observed in enlarged lymph nodes and were found to infiltrate synovial tissues from patients with LORA. The proportions of CX3CR1+CD4+ T cells positively correlated with arthritis activity in LORA. The number of cells decreased after treatment with methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, and interleukin-6 inhibitors, whereas T-cell activation modulators did not affect them. Moreover, PD-1+CD38+CX3CR1+CD4+ T cells were identified as a treatment-resistant T cell subset that was characteristically increased in difficult-to-treat RA. CX3CR1+CD8+ T cells showed no significant difference between RA patients and healthy individuals, and no correlation with disease activity was observed. However, a correlation with age was observed in RA patients. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the immunopathogenesis of RA differs by age of onset, with CX3CR1+ age-associated cytotoxic CD4+ T cells playing a significant role in LORA. Additionally, the presence of a specific CX3CR1+ T cell subset may be linked to treatment resistance.

        <tr id="Background The T cell compartment undergoes significant age-related changes, contributing to the decline of the adaptive immune system and increasing the risk of suboptimal antibody responses to vaccines in older adults. To better understand the association between T cell phenotypes and vaccine responsiveness, we conducted an in-depth analysis of CD4+, CD8+, and γδ + T cells on VITAL cohort participants who are low or high responders to multiple vaccines (influenza, pneumococcal, and SARS-CoV-2). Results Using spectral cytometry and FlowSOM, we identified detailed phenotypes of naïve, regulatory, and terminally differentiated T cells. We observed that the percentages of CD31 + naïve CD4+, CD31 + naïve CD8+, and CD38 + naïve CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in low vaccine responders. Notably, CD31 + naïve T cell subsets showed a stronger correlation with immune entropy, a measure of cumulative immune system perturbations, than with age itself. Conclusions These findings suggest that subsets of naïve cells could be associated with weak vaccine responsiveness and immunosenescence. Furthermore, these naive T cell signatures could help predict weak vaccine responses, potentially informing targeted vaccination strategies in older adults.

        <tr id="Introduction Ischemic stroke (IS) represents a significant global health challenge, characterized by elevated morbidity and mortality rates, largely driven by inflammatory responses. Double-negative T cells (DNTs), a distinct subset of T cells lacking both CD4 and CD8 markers, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IS, exhibiting potentially dual roles. However, the precise functional contributions of DNTs in this context remain poorly understood. Methods In this study, we investigated the role of DNTs during the acute phase of IS and assessed the influence of Huang-Lian-Jie-Du Decoction (HLJD), a traditional Chinese medicinal formula, on these cells. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we identified two distinct subtypes of DNTs: an activated, cytotoxic phenotype (Kill+) and a resting, immunosuppressive phenotype (Kill-). Results Our findings indicate that HLJD treatment modulates the balance between these DNT subtypes, specifically reducing the proportion of cytotoxic DNTs while promoting an increase in immunosuppressive DNTs. This shift was associated with a reduction in immune cell infiltration and inflammation within the brain tissue, potentially mitigating neuronal damage. Discussion These results suggest that HLJD exerts neuroprotective effects in IS by modulating the activity and distribution of DNT cells, offering valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of IS. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying DNT-mediated immune responses in IS and to explore the broader applications of HLJD in other neuroinflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Background Our team has previously found that the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays a more significant anti-tumor role in host immune cells than in tumor cells. Although STING is necessary for CD8 + T cells to exert immunological activity, its effect on CD8 + T cells remains debatable. In this study, we used both in vitro and in vivo models to explore the metabolic effects of STING on CD8 + T cells. Methods Peripheral blood lymphocytes were procured from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy to investigate the correlation between STING expression levels, CD8 + T-cell subsets, and immunotherapy efficacy. STING knockout (STING-KO) mice were used for in vivo studies. RNA-seq, seahorse, flow cytometry, electron microscopy, qPCR, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and immunoprecipitation were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms of STING in regulating CD8 + T cell function. Results We discovered that the expression level of STING in immune cells exhibited a significant correlation with immunotherapy efficacy, as well as with the proportion of central memory CD8 + T cells. Moreover, we found that the loss of the STING gene results in a reduction in the number of mitochondria and a change in the metabolic pathway selection, thereby inducing excessive glycolysis in CD8 + T cells. This excessive glycolysis generates high levels of lactate, which further inhibits IFN-γ secretion and impacts memory T cell differentiation. Correcting the glycolysis disorder partially restored function and IFN-γ secretion, rescued the central memory CD8 + T subset, and improved immunotherapy in STING-KO mice. This provides a new treatment strategy for patients with low STING expression and a poor response to immunotherapy. Conclusion Intrinsic STING of CD8 + T cells affects their function through the HK2/Lactate/IFN-γ axis and affects memory differentiation by regulating glycolysis.

        <tr id="Relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains a challenging disease with a dismal prognosis. Despite the revolutionary impact of CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19)-T cell therapy, >50% of patients relapse within a year. Both leukemia cell-intrinsic factors favoring immune escape and poor CAR-T cell persistence contribute significantly to clinical failure. Moreover, the expression of immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) and their ligands within the complex bone marrow (BM) microenvironment may contribute to leukemia progression and therapy resistance. Here, we comprehensively characterized the expression of ICRs and their ligands in leukemic blasts, T cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from B-ALL BM samples at diagnosis (n=47) and relapse (n=38), comparing them with age-matched healthy BM controls. Our findings reveal a significant upregulated expression of TIM-3 in T cells, and its ligand galectin-9 in both blasts and MSCs throughout disease progression. The expression levels of galectin-9 in B-ALL blasts and TIM-3 in CAR19-T cells negatively correlate with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that galectin-9 impairs CAR19-T cell homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Notably, an engineered TIM-3-Fc decoy receptor, delivered either by primary T cells co-administered with CAR19-T cells or via a bicistronic all-in-one CAR19-TIM-3-Fc construct, improved the anti-leukemia efficacy and persistence of CAR19-T cells in B-ALL patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, CAR19-TIM-3-Fc-T cell treatment promotes the in vivo expansion of both transduced and bystander effector and memory T cells, as determined by spectral flow cytometry. Collectively, these potent and persistent TIM-3-Fc decoy-armored CAR19-T cells offer a promising therapeutic strategy for R/R B-ALL patients.">

        <tr id="Effective treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains an urgent unmet need. Adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) against leukemia-associated antigen (LAA) has strong potential to improve AML treatment. However, the clinical translation of this therapeutic modality is hindered by the difficulty of obtaining large quantities of LAA-specific CTLs. Stimulating naïve T cells using monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) loaded with LAA is commonly used for the generation of CTLs. This approach has drawbacks as MoDCs loaded with desired antigen need to be developed repeatedly with multiple steps and have limited growth potential. We have established immortalized human dendritic cells (DC) lines (termed ihv-DCs). Here, we report the successful generation of CTLs by culturing AML patient-derived T cells with our off-the-shelf ihv-DCs that carry HLA-A2-restricted human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), a known LAA. These CTLs exert a potent cytotoxic activity against leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts in vitro. Importantly, using a highly clinically relevant PDX model where CTLs (derived from clinical donors) were adoptively transferred into NSG mice bearing patient-derived AML cells (that were partial or full HLA match with the donors), we showed that the CTLs effectively reduced leukemia growth in vivo. Our results are highly translational and provide proof of concept using the novel DC methodology to improve the strategy of adoptive T cell transfer for AML treatment.

        <tr id="In melanoma, lymphangiogenesis correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis and promotes immunosuppression. However, it also potentiates immunotherapy by supporting immune cell trafficking. We show in a lymphangiogenic murine melanoma that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) upregulate the enzyme Ch25h, which catalyzes the formation of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) from cholesterol and plays important roles in lipid metabolism, gene regulation, and immune activation. We identify a role for LECs as a source of extracellular 25-HC in tumors inhibiting PPAR-γ in intra-tumoral macrophages and monocytes, preventing their immunosuppressive function and instead promoting their conversion into proinflammatory myeloid cells that support effector T cell functions. In human melanoma, LECs also upregulate Ch25h, and its expression correlates with the lymphatic vessel signature, infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages, better patient survival, and better response to immunotherapy. We identify here in mechanistic detail an important LEC function that supports anti-tumor immunity, which can be therapeutically exploited in combination with immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing immune responses against pathogens. The fluctuation of Treg proportions in COVID-19 remains a topic of debate, and the mechanisms triggering Treg activation in COVID-19 are still unclear. Understanding these issues is essential for better managing immune responses in COVID-19 patients. Methods We collected a cohort of COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity and stage to explore the transcriptomic and functional traits of Tregs in these individuals. Using transcriptomic analysis, we evaluated the proportion and functionality of different Treg subsets, specifically HLA_DR+ Tregs, across different stages of COVID-19 patients. Results Our analysis revealed that the proportion of CCR7 + Tregs decreased as the disease advanced, while the cell proportion of HLA_DR+ regs escalated with the severity of the disease. Moreover, the transcription actor CARHSP1 exhibited apositive correlation with the proportion of HLA_DR+ Tregs. Notably, the heightened suppressive function of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients, with interactions between PF4 and CXCR3, contributed to the homeostasis of HLA_DR+ Tregs in severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that Tregs in COVID-19 patients exhibited weakened TCR clonotype expansion, and the suppression of HLA_DR+ Tregs with expanded TCR clonotypes in severe COVID-19 cases did not show a significant increase compared to asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 groups. The findings indicate that Tregs may be activated through the bystander effect, as evidenced by the analysis of TCR clonotype characteristics. Discussion Our research delineates the diversity of dynamic alterations in Tregs and sheds light on potential mechanisms underlying Treg activation, providing a theoretical foundation and offering treatment strategies for managing COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), an aggressive T-cell malignancy associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, presents significant therapeutic challenges due to high relapse rates and resistance to therapy. Here, we present the first reported case of ATLL treated with talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), an oncolytic viral immunotherapy approved for unresectable melanoma. The patient, who had experienced disease progression despite multiple lines of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, underwent experimental virotherapy with two intratumoral T-VEC injections. The treatment was well-tolerated, with no significant adverse effects, and led to substantial tumor regression and clinical stabilization, suggesting potential remission. Single-cell analysis revealed that T-VEC treatment induced robust local and systemic immune responses, including tumor necrosis, activation of M1 macrophages, and infiltration of CD8+ effector memory T cells. These findings demonstrate T-VEC’s safety and efficacy in generating both localized oncolysis and systemic anti-tumor immune response, highlighting its promise as a novel therapeutic approach for refractory ATLL.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Non‐lymphoid tissue Tregs (NLT‐Tregs) are critical for tissue homeostasis, inflammation control, and induction of tissue repair. Recent single‐cell RNA sequencing data identified the expression of CD83 as part of an NLT‐Treg signature, which is an essential molecule for the stability and differentiation of lymphoid Tregs. However, the biological significance of CD83 expression for NLT Tregs has not yet been elucidated. The present study explores for the first time the role of CD83 expression by lung‐resident Tregs in the steady state and during asthma to understand its importance in barrier tissues. We evaluated the effect of Treg‐specific CD83 deletion (CD83cKO) on the lung‐resident T‐cell compartment and cytokine profile. CD83‐deficient lung Tregs are less differentiated but more activated, resulting in unrestrained T‐cell activation. Further, CD83cKO mice were challenged in an asthma model and showed an accelerated disease progression, driven by Th2‐biased T‐cell responses. CD83cKO Tregs exhibited enhanced responsiveness to IL‐4, leading to insufficient control of Th2‐differentiation from naïve T cells. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CD83 in the NLT‐Treg‐mediated modulation of Th2 responses. Overall, our results highlight CD83 as a key player in tissue homeostasis and inflammatory responses, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for inflammatory disorders such as asthma.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Head and neck cancer (HNC) is an aggressive disease that often evades the immune system, making it difficult to treat. This study investigates how Axl, a protein overexpressed on tumor cells, contributes to the immune escape strategies of HNC by decreasing the number of immune cells within the tumor. Using mouse models, we show that removing Axl slows tumor growth by reducing the number of immune-suppressing cells and increasing immune cells that can kill tumors, such as natural killer (NK) cells. We found that Axl prevents NK cells from working properly by modulating signals that attract, activate, or inhibit them. By blocking Axl, tumors are more vulnerable to immune-mediated killing. These findings suggest that targeting Axl could improve treatments for HNC by increasing immune cell invasion within the tumor, providing a new way to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="In the realm of oncology, the tumor microenvironment (TME)—comprising extracellular matrix components, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells—plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, progression, and response to therapeutic interventions. Initially, the TME exhibits tumor-suppressive properties that can inhibit malignant transformation. However, as the tumor progresses, various factors induce immune tolerance, resulting in TME behaving in a state that promotes tumor growth and metastasis in later stages. This state of immunosuppression is crucial as it enables TME to change from a role of killing tumor cells to a role of promoting tumor progression. Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract with an alarmingly high mortality rate. While chemotherapy has historically been the cornerstone of treatment, its efficacy in prolonging survival remains limited. The emergence of immunotherapy has opened new therapeutic pathways, yet the challenge of immune tolerance driven by the gastric cancer microenvironment complicates these efforts. This review aims to elucidate the intricate role of the TME in mediating immune tolerance in gastric cancer and to spotlight innovative strategies and clinical trials designed to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches. By providing a comprehensive theoretical framework, this review seeks to advance the understanding and application of immunotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.">

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of neutrophils in the regulation of the immune system under physiological conditions.The in vivo effect of neutrophils on the immune system was examined using neutropenic mice. The interaction between neutrophils and γδ T cells was investigated using an in vitro co-culture system.Unexpectedly, we observed an accumulation of γδ T cells in the cervical lymph nodes of neutropenic mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that these γδ T cells exhibited unique expression profiles of cell surface molecules and genes involved in defense responses. Further characterization indicated that the accumulated γδ T cells were IL-17 producing CD44+CD62L−CD27− memory cells. Additionally, in vitro experiments demonstrated that neutrophils could inhibit the function of IL-17A producing γδ T cells by inducing cell death in a contact-dependent manner.This present study demonstrates that neutrophils negatively regulate IL-17 producing γδ T cells under physiological conditions. Given that IL-17A is a critical cytokine for the recruitment of neutrophils to peripheral tissues, our study suggests that the crosstalk between neutrophils and IL-17A producing γδ T cells is a crucial mechanism for maintaining immune homeostasis under physiological conditions.">

        <tr id="Co-stimulatory molecules are imperative for CD8+ T cells to eliminate target cell and maintain sustained cytotoxicity. Despite an advanced understanding of the co-stimulatory molecules deficiency that results in tumor escape, the tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms that regulate co-stimulatory molecules remain enigmatic, and an in-depth dissection could facilitate the improvement of treatment options. To this end, in this study, we report that the deficiency of the critical costimulatory molecule CD58, mediated by the expression of ATF4 in tumor cells, impairs the formation of immunological synapses (IS) and leads to the deterioration of antitumor immune function of CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, ATF4 transcriptionally upregulated dynamin 1 (DNM1) expression leading to DNM1-dependent endocytosis (DDE)-mediated degradation of CD58. Furthermore, administration of DDE inhibitor prochlorperazine or ATF4 knockdown effectively restored CD58 expression, boosting CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and immunotherapy efficiency. Thus, our study reveals that ATF4 in tumor cells weakens CD58 expression to interfere with complete IS formation, and indicates potential approaches to improve the cytolytic function of CD8+ T cell in tumor immunotherapy.

Traditionally their suppressive function has been assayed by mixing purified cell populations, which does not provide an accurate picture of a physiologically relevant response. To overcome this limitation, we here develop ‘single cell suppression profiling of human Tregs’ (scSPOT). scSPOT uses a 52-marker CyTOF panel, a cell division detection algorithm, and a whole PBMC system to assess the effect of Tregs on all other cell types simultaneously. In this head-to-head comparison, we find Tregs having the clearest suppressive effects on effector memory CD8 T cells through partial division arrest, cell cycle inhibition, and effector molecule downregulation. Additionally, scSPOT identifies a Treg phenotypic split previously observed in viral infection and propose modes of action by the FDA-approved drugs Ipilimumab and Tazemetostat. scSPOT is thus scalable, robust, widely applicable, and may be used to better understand Treg immunobiology and screen for therapeutic compounds.">

This study investigates the value of dendritic cells derived from leukemic blasts (DCleu) to enhance anti-leukemic immunity after T-cell-enriched mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLCs). We correlated induced anti-leukemic activity with patient data, including biological, clinical and prognostic factors. Additionally, we correlated the frequencies of DC/DCleu and leukemic-specific T cells with the achieved anti-leukemic activity after MLC. We show that mature DC/DCleu can be generated using the immunomodulating Kit-M, which contains granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), without inducing blast proliferation from leukemic whole blood (WB) samples. Activated leukemia-specific immune and memory cells increased after MLC with Kit-M-pretreated WB, leading to improved blast lysis. Enhanced anti-leukemic activity positively correlated with the frequencies of generated DC/DCleu, proliferating leukemic-specific T cells and memory T cells, but not with leukemic blast counts, hemoglobin levels or platelet counts at diagnosis. No correlation was found between improved blast lysis and patients’ prognostic data, including age, gender, ELN risk groups, disease stage and response to induction chemotherapy. These findings underscore the potential of DC/DCleu to evoke robust immune responses and potential immunological memory against AML. Overall, this innovative approach could pave the way for the development of improved immunotherapeutic strategies that function in vivo.">

        <tr id="Background: α-Galactosylceramide (α-Galcer), a specific ligand for invariant natural killer T (NKT) cell activation, has been actively investigated in clinical trials such as antitumor therapy; however, treatment with α-Galcer is well known to induce acute hepatitis due to enriched NKT cells in the liver. The molecular mechanisms underlying NKT-mediated hepatitis still remain obscure. The object of this study was to investigate whether and how myeloid cells affect NKT-mediated hepatitis. Methods: α-Galcer–induced NKT hepatitis was used in this study. microRNA-223 (miR-223) and neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (Ncf1)–deficent mice were generated and subjected to α-Galcer–induced NKT hepatitis. Results: In this study, we demonstrated that α-Galcer–induced NKT cell activation resulted in neutrophil and monocyte-derived macrophage accumulation in the liver. Importantly, serum levels of several hepatic myeloid cell infiltration–related cytokines and chemokines were significantly elevated after α-Galcer administration. Among these myeloid cells, blockade of neutrophil or macrophage migration through using different inhibitors of (C-X-C Motif) receptor 2, (C-C motif) receptor 2, and (C-C motif) receptor 5 signaling ameliorated α-Galcer–induced liver injury, mainly due to the decrease of reactive oxygen species production and inflammation. Depletion of neutrophils reduced α-Galcer–induced liver injury and hepatitis. Interestingly, genetic deletion of neutrophil-specific miR-223 markedly enhanced while Ncf﻿1﻿ deficiency significantly ameliorated liver inflammation and oxidative damage caused by α-Galcer. Conclusions: Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration through multiple inflammatory mediators is required for NKT cell activation–induced hepatitis, which sheds light on the myeloid cell infiltration–related molecular mechanisms of NKT cell–mediated liver injury. Our study may provide a novel therapeutical strategy for the treatment of NKT cell hepatitis.">

        <tr id="Background: Two novel malaria vaccines, RTS,S and R21, mark a significant step forward in malaria research, but eradication demands vaccines with higher efficacy. Recent trials using late-arresting genetically attenuated parasites (LA-GAP) highlight their effectiveness as next-generation vaccines, likely through CD8+ T-cell activation targeting late liver-stage parasites. However, the distribution of LA-GAP-activated T cells in different organs that culminate towards high-level protection in the liver remains unclear. Methods: This study aimed to map immune responses in the livers and lungs of mice immunized with LA-GAP, shedding light on the role of different organs in priming T-cell responses towards immunity. Results: Particularly in the lungs we found an impressive increase of CD8+, double negative T cells (5%), γδ (2.5%), effector memory CD8+ T cells (46%), and tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (3%). These lung T cells are highly activated (expressing CD11c, Ki67, KLRG1) and exhibited 4-fold higher Granzyme A expression and significant TNF+ cell increases as compared to their liver counterparts (10.2% vs 2.6%). These differences start already at the early 2-day timepoint at which time the lungs show an impressive 10.2% increase in TNF+ CD8+ T cells, whereas the liver shows a more modest increase of 2.6% of these cells. Conclusion: These findings highlight the lungs as a crucial site for immune priming and T-cell activation, underscoring the need for further investigation of organ-specific responses to fully understand the potential of LA-GAP immunization as a powerful strategy in the fight against malaria.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (Trm) constitute a distinct population of non-circulating memory T cells 1-5 vastly exceeding the number of circulating T cells 5 , and play a pivotal role in protective immunity against pathogens 6-8 . How to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm remains an important challenge. Whether Trm contribute also to immune control of tumors or just correlate with an unrelated process linked to clinical outcome has not been unequivocally established 9,10 , and phenotypic markers such as co-expression of CD69 and CD103 or CD49a integrins commonly used to monitor tumor infiltrating Trm do not unambiguously define this subset. Here we tested the hypothesis that transient downregulation of KLF2, the most conserved feature of Trm ontogeny 4,11,12 , will promote the differentiation of vaccine activated CD8+ T cells into Trm and enhance antitumor immunity. We show that 4-1BB antibody targeted delivery of a KLF2 siRNA to tumor bearing mice led to the downregulation of KLF2 in vaccine activated CD8+ T cells and the accumulation of phenotypically defined intratumoral CD69+CD103+ and CD69+CD49a+ CD8+ T cells which correlated with enhanced control of tumor growth. This study could serve as the foundation of a broadly applicable and clinically useful way to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm and provides direct evidence that intratumoral CD8+CD69+CD103+ and CD8+CD69+CD49a+ cells are indeed Trm and that Trm contribute to tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="The gut plays a crucial role in digestion and immunity, so its balance is essential to overall health. This balance relies on dynamic interactions between intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, and crypt stem cells. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which consists of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract closely related to immune dysfunction. Stem cells, known for their ability to self-renew and differentiate, play an important role in repairing damaged intestinal epithelium and maintaining homeostasis in vivo. Macrophages are key gatekeepers of intestinal immune homeostasis and have a significant impact on IBD. Current research has focused on the link between epithelial cells and stem cells, but interactions with macrophages, which have been recognized as attractive targets for the development of new therapeutic approaches to disease, have been less explored. Recently, the developing field of immunometabolism has reinforced that metabolic reprogramming is a key determinant of macrophage function and subsequent disease progression. The aim of this review is to explore the role of the macrophage–stem cell axis in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and to summarize potential approaches to treating IBD by manipulating the cellular metabolism of macrophages, as well as the main opportunities and challenges faced. In summary, our overview provides a framework for understanding the critical role of macrophage immunometabolism in maintaining gut health and potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were first recognized over twenty years ago as a key immunomodulatory cell population. Since their initial identification, a growing body of literature points to the importance of MDSC as a heterogeneous, immunosuppressive cell population and as a therapeutic target in adults with cancer. MDSC are potent suppressors of T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells and can be helpful or harmful to the host depending on the pathophysiology. For example, MDSC are beneficial in pregnancy and prevent spontaneous abortion by promoting maternal-fetal tolerance. Increased MDSC are also associated with improved outcomes in patients with graft vs. host disease by decreasing T cell-driven inflammation. However, MDSC can also be harmful and are known to be pathologic in adults with cancer and chronic infections by promoting tumor escape and impairing pathogen clearance, respectively. Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of MDSC and their immune suppression effects in adults, much less is known regarding the role of MDSC in children. Research investigating MDSC in children lags significantly behind adult studies. In fact, while over 5,000 publications on PubMed discuss MDSC in immune regulation, fewer than 50 of these publications focus specifically on their role in children. This review aims to summarize the existing literature on the role of MDSC in children and identify important directions for future research, including targeting these cells in the pediatric population to improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The occurrence of inflammation subsequent to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with an elevated risk of transplant‐related mortality (TRM). However, the duration of inflammation and the potential efficacy of anti‐inflammatory agents in reducing TRM remain uncertain. We performed a comprehensive investigation to examine the post‐transplantation alterations of inflammatory mediators and to ascertain the correlation between inflammation level and TRM through the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, ELISAs and cytometric bead array. The findings revealed that the 30‐day interval following transplantation is characterised by the most pronounced inflammatory response in both human and murine subjects, thereby elevating the risk of TRM. The inflammation is primarily caused by myeloid bias during haematopoietic reconstitution, which is a commonly overlooked aspect in clinical transplantation, additionally, a lesser extent of irradiation‐induced injury. The administration of the anti‐inflammatory agent resveratrol has the potential to reduce systemic inflammation and TRM by suppressing the NOD‐like receptor signalling pathway and slowing down granulocyte implantation in HSCT mice. This approach did not impair the differentiation potential of haematopoietic stem cells. These findings demonstrate that the 30‐day post‐transplant period represents an opportunity to facilitate HSCT colonisation, mitigate transplant‐related adverse effects, and potentially reap the benefits of anti‐inflammatory treatments.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Adoptive cell therapy including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 has been approved by FDA to treat B cell-derived malignancies with remarkable success. The success has not yet been expanded to treating Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). We previously showed that a nanobody and single-chain fragment variable (scFv) CD13 (Nanobody)/TIM-3 (scFv) directed bispecific split CAR (bissCAR) T cells, while effective in eliminating AML in preclinical models, also caused substantial toxicity to human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and other lineages. To maintain the bissCART specificity and efficacy, yet reduce toxicity to normal cells including HSCs, we generated new anti-TIM-3 nanobodies and constructed new cognate nanobodies-directed CD13/41BB and TIM3/CD3zeta nbiCARTs. The resultant nbiCARTs showed strong antitumor activity to CD13/TIM3 positive leukemic cells in vitro and in preclinical models. Importantly, the 3rd generation of nbiCARTs had little toxicity to human bone marrow-derived colony forming progenitors ex vivo and the human HSCs in mice with a humanized immune system. Together, the current studies generated novel and 3rd G CD13/TIM-3 nbiCARTs that displayed stronger antitumor activity yet minimal toxicity to normal tissues like HSCs that express a moderate level of CD13, paving the way to further evaluate the novel CD13/TIM-3CARTs in treating aggressive and refractory AML in clinical studies.">

        <tr id="Background Cancer immunotherapy has shown promising results in the clinic, but it faces great challenges such as low response rates and low efficacy in solid tumors. c-Rel, a member of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB family, is a newly described immune checkpoint for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which contribute to the formation of immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. How to selectively target myeloid c-Rel for the treatment of cancer is not well established. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and efficacy of knocking down myeloid c-Rel with siRNA-loaded peptide-based nanoparticles as a new cancer immunotherapy strategy. Methods The knockdown of c-Rel gene by the siRNA-loaded peptide nanoparticles was confirmed on MDSCs in vitro and in vivo. The effects of c-Rel silencing on cell number and immune suppressive function of the murine bone marrow-derived MDSCs were then investigated. To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of the c-Rel siRNA loaded nanoparticles, female C57BL/6 mice with subcutaneous B16 tumor were treated with PBS, c-Rel siRNA loaded nanoparticles, control siRNA loaded nanoparticles or empty nanoparticles. The tumor growth and body weight of mice were monitored, and the numbers and immune activities of tumor infiltrated immune cells in different groups were analyzed at the end of the experiment. The immune function of MDSCs isolated from tumor bearing mice received different treatments were further investigated ex vivo by T cell proliferation assays. Results The c-Rel siRNA nanoparticles significantly reduced c-Rel expression in MDSCs, diminished both the number and immune suppressive function of MDSCs, and enhanced intratumor CD8+ T cell responses. Significantly reduced tumor growth was observed in mice treated with the c-Rel siRNA nanoparticles compared to control mice. Conclusion Our data indicates that peptide-based nanoparticles can be successfully utilized to target the myeloid immune checkpoint c-Rel for the treatment of cancer.">

        <tr id="A diverse naive CD8 T cell repertoire is essential to provide broad protection against infection and cancer. Aging diminishes naive T cells, reducing potential diversity and leading to lymph node contraction. Here, we revealed that this decline occurs earlier in males, resulting in significant sex differences in immunity during middle age. Earlier in life, naive CD8 T cells in males become virtual memory cells prone to premature senescence. Due to androgen-driven thymic atrophy in males, naïve CD8 T cells are insufficiently replenished. Therapeutic thymus rejuvenation via testosterone ablation restored naive CD8 T cells in lymph nodes of middle-aged male mice, leading to enhanced tumor recognition. These findings show the crucial role of sex and age on lymph node T cell repertoires and suggest potential strategies to restore immune function in males during aging.">

        <tr id="Anti-tumor immunity, including innate and adaptive immunity is critical in inhibiting tumorigenesis and development of tumor. The adaptive immunity needs specific lymph organs such as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which are highly correlated with improved survival outcomes in many cancers. In recent years, with increasing attention on the TLS in tumor microenvironment, TLSs have emerged as a novel target for anti-tumor therapy. Excitingly, studies have shown the contribution of TLSs to the adaptive immune responses. However, it is unclear how TLSs to form and how to more effectively defense against tumor through TLS formation. Recent studies have shown that the inflammation plays a critical role in TLS formation. Interestingly, studies have also found that gut microbiota can regulate the occurrence and development of inflammation. Therefore, we here summarize the potential effects of gut microbiota- mediated inflammation or immunosuppression on the TLS formation in tumor environments. Meanwhile, this review also explores how to manipulate mature TLS formation through regulating gut microbiota/metabolites or gut microbiota associated signal pathways for anti-tumor immunity, which potentially lead to a next-generation cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) therapy has been proved for treatment of metastatic melanoma and is under investigation for other types of solid tumors. However, these successes are threatened by discontinued supply of GMP-grade anti-CD137 agonist, a key TIL preparation reagent. Therefore, exploring a GMP-adherent method for expanding endogenous TILs without anti-CD137 agonist is urgent. Toward this end, we aimed to establish an anti-CD137–independent and clinically feasible TIL expansion protocol to prepare TILs from under investigated sarcoma tumors. Methods We collected resected tumors from patients and cut tissues into fragments. We used IL-2 and T-cell activator CD3/CD28 without anti-CD137 agonist to expand nonselected TILs in 2-3 weeks, then rapidly expanded them over 2 weeks. Their phenotypes were characterized using flow cytometry. Their antitumor activity was validated in vitro using cytotoxic T lymphocyte assays measuring CD107a on the TILs and the viability of tumor cells and in vivo using an autologous patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor model. Results We successfully expanded TILs in > 90% of collected samples. TILs generated preferentially increased CD8+ T cells but suppressed CD4+ T cells. A small portion of TILs were resident memory T cells. The expanded TILs reduced autologous tumor cells by 37.5% within 24 hours. Infusion of TILs in mice bearing autologous PDX tumors strongly inhibited liposarcoma growth. FDA has approved use of this GMP-feasible protocol in our clinical trial (IND 30562). Conclusion It is feasible to generate antitumor TILs using CD3/CD28 activator to replace the unavailable anti-CD137 agonist. Our study supports the further development of TIL-based therapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In the tumor microenvironment (TME), hypoxia stands as a significant factor that modulates immune responses, especially those driven by T cells. As T cell-based therapies often fail to work in solid tumors, this study aims to investigate the effects of hypoxia on T cell topo-distribution in the TME, gene expression association with T cell states, and clinical responses in melanoma.


METHODS
To generate detailed information on tumor oxygenation and T cell accessibility, we used mathematical modeling of human melanoma tissue microarrays that incorporate oxygen supply from vessels, intratumoral diffusion, and cellular uptake. We created tumor maps and derived plots showing the fraction of CD4 and CD8 T cells against the distance to the nearest vessel and oxygen pressure. To assess their function and transcriptional changes caused by hypoxia, effector T cells were generated and cultured under hypoxia (0.5% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen). The T cell hypoxia-transcriptional signature was compared against datasets from msigDB, iATLAS (clinical trials of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)), ORIEN AVATAR (real-world melanoma patients treated with ICIs), and a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.


RESULTS
We made three specific observations: (1) in melanoma T cells preferentially accumulated in oxygenated areas close to blood vessels (50-100 µm from the vasculature in the regions of high oxygen availability) but not in hypoxic areas far from blood vessels. (2) Our analysis confirmed that under hypoxia, T cell functions were significantly reduced compared with normoxic conditions and accompanied by a unique gene signature. Furthermore, this hypoxic gene signature was prevalent in resting and non-activated T cells. Notably and clinically relevant, the hypoxic T cell gene set was found to correlate with reduced overall survival and reduced progression-free survival in melanoma patients, which was more pronounced in non-responder patients undergoing ICI therapy. (3) Finally, compared with a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating T cells, our hypoxia signature aligned with a population of cells at a state termed stress response state (TSTR).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study highlights the critical role of hypoxia in shaping T cell distribution and its correlation with clinical outcomes in melanoma. We revealed a preferential accumulation of T cells in oxygenated areas. Moreover, hypoxic T cells develop a distinct hypoxic gene signature prevalent in resting, non-activated T cells and TSTR that was also associated with poorer outcomes, particularly pronounced among non-responders to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Much remains to be understood about COVID-19, but the protective role of antibodies (Igs) is widely accepted in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Igs’ functions are mainly carried out by receptors that bind to their Fc portion (FcR), and less attention has been dedicated to the cytoplasmic members of this family. In this work, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to discern cell populations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from healthy individuals and patients with mild or severe COVID-19. Then, we evaluated the transcription of neonatal FcR (FcRn, FCGRT gene) and tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) and its downstream signaling components. The TRIM21 pathway is vital for virus infections as it has a dual function, leading opsonized viruses to degradation by proteasomes and the activation of innate inflammatory anti-virus response. The transcriptional level of FCGRT showed no statistical differences in any cell population comparing the three groups of patients. On the other hand, TRIM21 transcription was significantly higher in myeloid cells collected from patients with mild COVID-19. When comparing mild with severe cases, there was no statistical difference in TRIM21 transcription in lung adaptive lymphoid cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). Yet, we analyzed the transcription of all downstream signaling molecules in myeloid and, as most cells expressed the receptor, in adaptive lymphoid cells. Moreover, ILCs from mild cases and all cell populations from severe cases were missing most downstream components of the pathway. We observed that members of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and other components associated with TRIM21 proteasomal degradation were transcribed in mild cases. Despite the transcription of the danger sensors DDX58 and IFIH1, the transcriptional level of inflammatory IL1B and IL18 was generally very low, along with the NLRP3 danger sensor, members of the NF-κB pathway, and TNF. Therefore, our data suggest that TRIM21 may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 protection by reducing the viral load, while the inflammatory branch of the pathway would be silenced, leading to no pathogenic cytokine production.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can address an unmet clinical need for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its effect is often modest in the setting of high tumor burden. In this study, we postulated that strategies to lower the AML apoptotic threshold will augment T cell killing of AML cells. BH3 mimetics, such as venetoclax, are a clinically approved class of compounds that predispose cells to intrinsic apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins. We explored the anti-leukemic efficacy of BH3 mimetics combined with WT1-specific CD8+ T cells on AML cell lines and primary samples from patients with a diverse array of disease characteristics to evaluate if lowering the cellular apoptotic threshold via inhibition of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins can increase leukemic cell sensitivity to T cell therapy. We found that the combination approach of BH3 mimetic and CD8+ T cells led to significantly increased killing of established AML lines as well as of adverse-risk primary AML leukemic blast cells. In contrast to the hypothesis that enhanced killing would be due to combined activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, our data suggests that CTL-mediated killing of AML cells was accomplished primarily through activation of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This highly effective combinatorial activity due to convergence on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was conserved across multiple AML cell lines and primary samples, suggesting that mitochondrial priming may represent a novel mechanism of optimizing adoptive cell therapy for AML patients.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has made significant advancements over the past few decades, with immune checkpoint and cytokine-based drugs being successfully implemented in clinical settings. Nonetheless, the effective and safe clinical application of these therapies is hindered by critical issues, such as severe toxicity to healthy tissues due to on-target off-tumor effects. In this study, we have developed a novel immunogene therapy characterized by high tumor selectivity and safety in vivo, effectively mitigating the off-tumor effects associated with current antibody-based immune checkpoint therapies. We engineered a gene expression vector that is specifically activated by NF-κB activity to co-express artificial microRNAs targeting two key immune checkpoints (PD-L1 and CD47) and cytokine IL-15. This vector is capable of selectively and effectively down regulating the expression of PDL1 and CD47 while over expressing IL-15 just exclusively in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Through this mechanism, both adaptive and innate immune responses can be simultaneously activated and enhanced via the transfection of this vector. The in vivo administration of this vector via recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) demonstrated significant antitumor activity, high tumor selectivity, and safety in murine models. Consequently, this vector may offer a potential more effective and safer alternative to the current immune checkpoint inhibitors in future clinical applications.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Lung cancer is among the most common and deadliest malignant tumors worldwide. It is often detected at late stages, resulting in unfavorable outcomes, with tumor cell heterogeneity and medication resistance. Tumor‐associated macrophages are among the key cells contributing to cancer progression. They are categorized into two primary phenotypes: Proinflammatory (M1) and anti‐inflammatory (M2) which are involved in the onset and progression of NSCLC. The role of common cytokines secreted by macrophages in the progression of lung cancer are described, and the effects of various substances such as RNA or protein on the differentiation and polarization of two phenotypes of macrophages are highlighted to characterize the impact of the immune state of tumors on therapeutic effect of treatments and patient prognosis. Researchers have primarily aimed to investigate innovative carriers and strategies based on macrophages to modify the tumor microenvironment. Objectives These approaches are often integrated with other treatments, particularly immunotherapy, to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Methods A comprehensive review was carried out by systematically synthesizing existing literature on PubMed, using the combination of the keywords “TAMs”, “NSCLC”, “Drug resistance”, and “therapy”. The available studies were screened for selection based on quality and relevance. Conclusions TAMs promote tumor invasion, growth, and metastasis by promoting angiogenesis and EMT. In addition, they contribute to the development of drug resistance and the immunosuppressive microenvironment establishment. The immunosuppressive factors secreted by TAM can weaken the activity of immune cells, inhibit their killing effect on tumors, leading to immune suppression and hindering the effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, TAM is a key target for the development of cancer immunotherapy. Various strategies are being explored, including reducing the recruitment of TAMs and influencing their polarization to treat NSCLC. In addition, TAMs based treatment systems can achieve precise delivery of drugs or gene interfering molecules without causing side effects.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has brought hope for patients with cancer and showed promising results and a high cure rate in various types of hematological malignancies. However, cellular therapy can lead to profound immunodeficiency of the innate and adaptive immune systems, whether at the systemic or at the local cellular immune response, which is a major predisposing risk factor for invasive opportunistic infection, including fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogens. The role of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and their antigen specificity in humans remains largely unknown, but Tregs have been implicated in a wide range of modulating viral and fungal infections. Though there have been many advancements regarding the use of CAR T-cells in treating hematological malignancies, the intricate and homeostatic role of Tregs in influencing therapeutic outcomes and infection risk remains underexplored. Most published literature on this topic focuses on the role of Treg in the immunosuppression necessary for successful CAR T-cell therapy rather than the dual function of Treg in immunosuppression and immune recovery. We intend to bridge this gap with a specific focus on the contribution of Tregs in the modulation of CAR T-cell efficacy and their role in opportunistic infections after therapy. In this review, we described the potential role and dynamics of Tregs following CAR T-cell therapy, offering an expanded understanding of their impact on patient outcomes and highlighting areas for future research.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Statins, a class of HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors, exhibit prophylactic benefits against immune rejection induced by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo‐HSCT). Despite the protective function is confirmed, the precise mechanism to induce immune tolerance of statin in the initial stages of transplantation remains incompletely understood. Given that Treg cells play a critical role in preventing graft versus host response and Foxp3 as a transcription factor of Treg can be induced by statins, we hypothesize that the immunosuppressive effects of statins are partially mediated through regulation of Treg cells expansion. Methods T cells were stimulated in vitro under anti‐CD3/anti‐CD28/IL‐2/TGF‐β condition or allo‐reactive system with or without the addition of statins. The induction of Tregs were detected using flow cytometry. Allo‐HSCT models were established by transferring donor cells alone or combined with recipient treated by fluvastatin. The proportions of Treg and phenotypes of effector T cells were identified. Cytokine secretion and antigen‐presenting cell (APC) function were tested in irradiated mice. Results Statins induced higher Treg production in classical and allogeneic cell co‐culture conditions in vitro. In the early stage of models treated with fluvastatin only in donors or combined treatment of donors and recipients, a similar phenomenon was observed with elevated levels of Foxp3+ Treg along with increased expression of CCR7, CD62L, and S1P1 on allo‐reactive T cells. Fluvastatin treatment suppressed the secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines IFN‐γ and TNF‐α by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in irradiated mice. Furthermore, fluvastatin also contributed to restraining the numbers and activation of APCs, including dentritic cells (DCs) and macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Our finding demonstrated that statin exposure modulates immune responses during the initial phase of allo‐HSCT by promoting Treg expansion and suppressing inflammatory reactions, which supply a promising strategy for aGVHD prevention.">

Last, we introduce how organoid technology offers a potentially valuable approach to advance our understanding of MAIT cell tissue homing by providing a more physiologically relevant model that mimics the human gut tissue. These models may enable a detailed investigation of the gut-specific homing mechanisms of MAIT cells.

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors contains myeloid cells that modulate local immune activity. STING signaling activation in these myeloid cells enhances local type I interferon (IFN) production, inducing an innate immune response that mobilizes adaptive immunity and reprograms immunosuppressive myeloid populations to drive antitumor immunity. Here, we generated TAK-500, an immune cell directed antibody drug conjugate (iADC), to deliver a STING agonist to CCR2+ human cells and drive enhanced antitumor activity relative to non-targeted STING agonists. Preclinically, TAK-500 triggered dose-dependent innate immune activation in vitro. In addition, a murine TAK-500 iADC surrogate enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses both in vitro and in murine tumor models. Spatially resolved analysis of CCR2 and immune cell markers in the TME of >1,000 primary human tumors showed the CCR2 protein was predominantly expressed in intratumoral myeloid cells. Collectively, these data highlight the clinical potential of delivering a STING agonist to CCR2+ cells.">

        <tr id="The nature of the effector and memory T cell response in the lungs following acute SARS-CoV-2 infections remains largely unknown. To define the pulmonary T-cell response to COVID-19, we compared effector and memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) in mice. Both viruses elicited potent effector T cell responses in lungs, but memory T cells showed exaggerated contraction in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, unlike the T-bet/EOMES-driven effector transcription program in IAV lungs, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells embarked on a STAT-3-centric transcriptional program, a defining characteristic of a pro-fibro-inflammatory program: limited cytotoxicity, diminished expression of tissue-protective inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT), and augmented mucosal imprinting (CD103). Circulating CD45RO+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients expressed elevated levels of STAT-3 and low levels of TIGIT. IL-6 blockade experiments implicated IL-6 in STAT-3 induction and downregulation of PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific primary effector CD8 T cells. Memory CD8 T cells specific to a single epitope, induced by mucosal vaccination, differentiated into cytotoxic effectors and expressed high levels of CD103, effectively reducing viral burden in lungs following a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings have implications for developing targeted immunotherapies to mitigate immunopathology and promote protective T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2.">

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex system composed of tumor cells, immune and non-immune cells, and non-cellular components. Evidence indicates that dynamic changes in TME during TKI treatment are associated with the development of resistance. Research has focused on identifying how each component of the TME interacts with tumors and TKIs to understand therapeutic targets that could address TKI resistance.

        <tr id="Introduction. Immune memory is a tool of the adaptive immune system that allows it responding quickly and effectively to repeated contact with an antigen. The role of memory cell populations in the recurrence and progression of immune-dependent diseases is shown. 
Aim. To determine the trend in memory T-cell populations depending on the effectiveness of biological therapy (BT) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis (PS). 
Materials and methods. Four hundred fifty children with immunosuppressive diseases (ISD) were examined during different periods of administration of biological drugs: IBD — 162 children (infliximab /adalimumab), MS — 116 children (interferon β1α — IFNβ1α), PS — 172 children (adalimumab). The effectiveness of BT was assessed using clinical activity indices and functional methods. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry to determine populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell: central (TCM), effector (TEM), and terminally differentiated (TEMRA). Statistical data processing was carried out in the Statistica 16.0 program, using the Mann–Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation analysis (p < 0.05). In the SPSS version 25 software, ROC analysis was performed in the efficiency–inefficiency separation model. 
Results. In all forms of pathology, changes in the content of memory T-cells have been established depending on the activity of inflammation. In IBD and PS patients, with an increase in the indices of disease activity, a decrease in the levels of CD4+ naive T-cells (TNAIVE) and an increase of TCM were detected. In MS patients with active foci, an MRI scan showed a decrease in the percentage of naive CD8+ T-cells (TcytNAIVE) and an increase in the population of CD8+ TEM. The content of TNAIVE populations decreased with age, and memory T-cells increased in patients with all the studied forms of pathology. In patients with BT efficacy, a high content of TNAIVE populations and a low content of TCM were found compared with the levels in patients with insufficient BT efficacy. Thresholds have been determined for IBD, MS, and PS patients, which make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT. An increase in the levels of TNAIVE and TcytNAIVE makes it possible to predict the presence of a BT effect, an increase in the levels of TCM, CD4+ TEM, and CD8+ ТEMRA make it possible to predict the absence or insufficient effect of BT. 
Conclusion. The activity of the inflammatory process is reflected in the differentiation of populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells. With the effectiveness of BT, the number of TNAIVE increases with a decrease in the number of TCM and TEM in patients with immune-dependent diseases, regardless of the form of pathology and the drug used. Threshold values for memory T-cells populations make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT.">

        <tr id="South Africa has the highest HIV prevalence globally, often co-occurring with helminth infections in impoverished regions. The coexistence of these infections leads to immunological interactions, potentially enhancing oncogenesis by upregulating immune checkpoint molecules (ICs) among other effects. Notably, most ICs are overexpressed in cancer and correlated with its progression. Helminth infections trigger Th2-type immunity, increasing immunosuppressive M2 macrophages, regulatory T cells, and associated IC molecules. PD-L2 is reported to contribute to Th2-type immunity induced by helminth infections. Similarly, TIM-3, elevated during chronic viral infections, induces a similar immunosuppressive profile. CTLA-4 and PD-1 impact T-cell function by interacting with CD28, crucial for T-cell function. CD28 is downregulated in chronic infections and cancer. This study investigated the impact of HIV-helminth co-infection on co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecule profiles associated with antitumor immunity. Using 78 serum samples collected from March 2020 to May 2021, participants were categorized into uninfected control (no HIV and helminth infections), HIV-infected, helminth-infected, and HIV-helminth co-infected groups. Multiplex immune regulatory molecule assay analysis was conducted. The data were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis and adjusted for confounders (age, gender, BMI, ART, supplements, and other chronic diseases). The uninfected control group was used as the baseline reference group for analysis. HIV-infected individuals had higher PD-1 (adjusted β = 0.12, p = 0.034) and TIM-3 (adjusted β = 23.15, p = 0.052) levels, with the latter showing a trend toward significance. However, lower CD28 levels (adjusted β = −651.95, p = 0.010) were observed. Helminth-infected individuals had higher TIM-3 levels (adjusted β = 20.98, p = 0.020). The co-infected group had higher PD-1 (unadjusted β = 0.18, p = 0.0046) and PD-L2 (adjusted β = 7.95, p = 0.033) levels. A significant decrease in CD28 profile was observed across all infected groups: HIV-infected (adjusted β = −651.95, p = 0.010), helminth-infected (adjusted β = −674.32, p = 0.001), and co-infected (adjusted β = −671.55, p = 0.044). The results suggest that HIV-helminth co-infections alter immune checkpoint markers, potentially increasing cancer risk by promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment that hinders anti-cancer immunity. CD28’s downregulation underscores immune inefficiency in chronic diseases. Addressing these co-infections is crucial for improving HIV care and potentially reducing cancer risks through targeted strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Although repeated exposure to HIV‐1 can result in infection, some individuals remain seronegative without clinical or serologic evidence of infection; these individuals are known as HIV‐1‐exposed seronegative individuals. This population has been extensively studied to understand the mechanisms associated with natural resistance to HIV infection. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain this resistance: some researchers associated resistance with a low activation phenotype characterized by a decrease in the activation and proliferation of immune system cells linked with infection control and decreased production of cytokines and pro‐inflammatory molecules, whereas others suggest that resistance is related to immune system activation and the expression of high levels of chemokines, pro‐inflammatory cytokines and antiviral molecules. Aims Our study aims to review and analyze the most relevant evidence supporting the role of the activation level of the immune system during natural resistance to HIV‐1 infection. Methods A search was conducted via the PubMed, SciELO and ScienceDirect databases. The literature search was performed in a nonsystematic manner. Articles published in the last five decades addressing immune activation mechanisms in natural resistance to HIV were reviewed. Results A low‐activation phenotype, characterized by a high frequency of Treg cells; reduced expression of CD25, CD38, and HLA‐DR; and lower production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in peripheral and mucosal tissues, plays a key role in reducing the number of activated cells susceptible to infection, but it minimizes chronic inflammation, facilitating viral entry and spread. In contrast, the activation phenotype is associated with high expression of markers such as CD25, CD38, and HLA‐DR, along with elevated high levels of interferon‐stimulated genes and pro‐inflammatory cytokines. This profile could promote infection control while increasing the number of virus‐susceptible cells. Conclusion The complexity of the immune response during HIV exposure, reflected in the conflicting evidence concerning whether low or high immune activation offers protection against infection, suggests that there may be multiple pathways to HIV‐1 resistance, influenced by factors such as the type of viral exposure, the immune environment, and individual genetics. Further research is needed to determine which immune states are protective and how these responses can be modulated to prevent infection.">

        <tr id="In the initial phase of infections, prior to the development of the follicular antibody response, an extrafollicular B cell response develops in lymphoid organs, with activation of cells displaying B cell receptors with low affinity to the different epitopes of the invading pathogen. To evaluate if this response allows early protection in the murine host, we investigated its role during infection with Sylvio X10/4 (a low virulence Trypanosoma cruzi parasite) of CD28KO mice, a mouse strain that does not develop a follicular antibody response, in parallel with infected C57BL/6 mice (used as control). We observed that T. cruzi infection allowed CD28KO mice to survive for a long period of time, ranging from a few weeks to almost a year. However, the CD28KO mice showed higher levels of subpatent parasitemia than C57BL/6 mice, as well as more intense and long-lasting inflammatory infiltrates in the heart. Following the CD28KO mice throughout the infection, we found a significant reduction in the number of CD8+ T cells in the spleen, but not CD4+ T cells, as well as a strong fluctuation in the number of B cells. Meanwhile, although the production of IFN-γ in the spleen was not affected by CD28 deficiency, a reduction in IL-2 production was observed in anti-CD3 stimulated CD4+ T cells from infected CD28KO mice. Regarding the humoral response, after confirming that the T follicular helper (TFH) cells and germinal center B cells (GC-B) were absent in the infected CD28KO mice, we demonstrated that the extrafollicular antibodies, present in CD28KO infected mice, allowed an early protection in the murine host, since the transfer of serum from chronic CD28KO mice to naïve CD28KO mice, which were infected with T. cruzi 24 hours later, promoted a significant reduction in parasitemia. These results demonstrate that low-affinity anti-T cruzi extrafollicular antibodies contribute to the control of circulating parasites, allowing Sylvio X10/4-infected CD28KO mice to survive for a long time.

MAIT cell activation patterns change significantly during COVID‐19, with a notable decrease in their frequency in peripheral blood of severe cases. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiles of various immune checkpoint pathways on MAIT, MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells in moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients undergoing cytokine storm. Despite numerous studies comparing MAIT cell characteristics based on COVID‐19 disease severity, none have delved into the critical differences in MAIT cell immune checkpoint profiles between moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients, all experiencing a cytokine storm. Flow cytometry was used to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 35 patients, comprising 18 moderate and 17 severe cases, alongside 14 healthy controls. Our investigation specifically focuses on severe COVID‐19 presentations, revealing a marked deletion of MAIT cells. Further exploration into the regulatory dynamics of MAIT cell functionality reveals shifts in the expression profiles of critical immune checkpoint receptors, notably PD‐1 and CD226. In severe COVID‐19 patients, MAIT cells showed a significant decrease in the expression of CD226, whereas MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of PD‐1 compared to healthy individuals. The expression of the TIGIT receptor remained unaltered across all investigated groups. Our findings contribute to the existing knowledge by elucidating the changes in MAIT cell subpopulations and their potential role in COVID‐19 disease severity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that poses a severe threat to human health. A variety of highly immunogenic tuberculosis proteins have been used as targets in vaccine development to mitigate the spread of TB. Although Th1-type immunity has long been considered a crucial part of resistance to Mtb, γδ T cells, the predominant source of IL-17, are not negligible in controlling the early stages of TB infection. In addition to classical phosphoantigens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat-resistant antigens (HAg), a complex containing 564 proteins obtained from live tuberculosis bacteria after heat treatment at 121 °C for 20 min, have been confirmed to be highly effective γδ T cell stimulators as well. Several studies have demonstrated that HAg-activated γδ T cells can participate in TB immunity by secreting multiple cytokines against Mtb or by interacting with other innate immune cells. In this review, we present a possible mechanism of HAg stimulation of γδ T cells and the role of HAg-activated γδ T cells in anti-TB immunity. We also highlight the limitations of studies on HAg activation of γδ T cells and suggest further research directions on the relationship between HAg and γδ T cells.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity provides the critical first line of defense against infection and sterile triggers. Cell death is a key component of the innate immune response to clear pathogens, but excessive or aberrant cell death can induce inflammation, cytokine storm, and pathology, making it a central molecular mechanism in inflammatory diseases. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one such inflammatory disease, but the specific innate immune mechanisms driving pathology in this context remain unclear. Here, by leveraging RNAseq and tissue expression in clinical samples, we identified increased expression of the innate immune sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) in patients with ALD. We discovered that ZBP1 expression correlated with ALD progression in patients, and that ethanol induced ZBP1-dependent lytic cell death, PANoptosis, in immune (macrophages, monocytes, Kupffer cells) and non-immune cells (hepatocytes). Mechanistically, the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) IRF9 and IRF1 upregulated ZBP1 expression, allowing ZBP1 to sense Z-NAs through its Zα2 domain and drive PANoptosis signaling, cell membrane rupture through NINJ1, and DAMP release. Furthermore, the expressions of ZBP1 and NINJ1 were upregulated in both liver and serum samples from patients with ALD. In mouse models of chronic and acute ALD, ZBP1-deficient mice were significantly protected from disease pathology and liver damage. Overall, our findings establish the critical role of the ZBP1-NINJ1 axis regulated by IRFs in driving inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in liver cells, suggesting that targeting these molecules will have therapeutic potential in ALD and other inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), characterized by malignant T-cell proliferation primarily in the skin, includes subtypes such as mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS). The tumor microenvironment (TME) is central to their pathogenesis, with flow cytometry and histology being the gold standards for detecting malignant T cells within the TME. Alongside emerging molecular markers, particularly clonality analysis, these tools are indispensable for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Of note, adenosine signaling within the TME has been shown to suppress immune responses, affecting various cell types. The expression of CD39, CD73, and CD38, enzymes involved in adenosine production, can be elevated in MF and SS, contributing to immune suppression. Conversely, the expression of CD26, part of the adenosine deaminase/CD26 complex, that degrades adenosine, is often lost by circulating tumoral cells. Flow cytometry has demonstrated increased levels of CD39 and CD73 on Sézary cells, correlating with disease progression and prognosis, while CD38 shows a variable expression, with its prognostic significance remaining under investigation. Understanding these markers’ roles in the complexity of TME-mediated immune evasion mechanisms might enhance diagnostic precision and offer new therapeutic targets in CTCL.">

        <tr id="Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is broadly produced by various cell types, particularly immune cells, and functions as a key modulator of innate and adaptive immunity. Increasing evidence has linked MIF to the pathogenesis of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We previously showed that the global deletion of Mif in the TCL1 transgenic mouse model for CLL significantly delayed disease development leading to longer overall survival of the knockout mice. In this study, we demonstrated that adaptive transfer of murine CLL cells failed to establish disease in Mif-deficient recipients due to impaired homing of leukemic cells into the spleens, indicating that host-derived Mif is essential for leukemic infiltration and expansion. To identify the most relevant source of Mif in CLL, we generated two CLL mouse strains with B-lymphoid- or myeloid-lineage-specific Mif deletion. In contrast to the global Mif knockout, neither conditional Mif knockout significantly altered CLL progression, illustrating that the cellular source of Mif is less critical than its systemic presence in the tissue environment. Taken together, these in vivo findings indicate that MIF plays a relevant role in CLL pathogenesis, acting independently of its specific cellular origin. Highlights CLL cells failed to establish disease in Mif-deficient hosts due to impaired tissue homing Conditional deletion of Mif in B lymphoid- or myeloid cells did not significantly impact CLL progression in vivo Systemic MIF is critical for CLL pathogenesis, independent of its cellular source">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Due to their enhanced responsiveness and persistence, cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML)-natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as new immunotherapeutic tools against malignancies. However, their effects on tumor-cell spread and metastases in solid tumors remain poorly investigated. Moreover, a clear identification of the most effective CIML-NK subsets, especially in controlling cancer stem cells (CSC), is still lacking. Methods We performed combined phenotypical and functional analyses of CIML-NK cell subsets, either selected by flow-cytometry gating, or generated from sorted CD56bright/CD56dim NK cells. By co-culture experiments, we analyzed the effect of CIML-NK cells on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell spheroids, or patient-derived xenografts (PDX), assessing changes in their CSC content, tumorigenicity, and/or tumor disseminating capability in vivo. CIML-NK cells were also infused in PDX-bearing mice to validate their effect on the CSC dissemination from the PDX to the lungs. Finally, we generated and functionally analyzed CIML-NK cells from patients with stages I/III NSCLC (n=6). Results We show that CIML-NK cells exert antitumor activity mostly through their CD56bright cell subset, which greatly expands during CIML differentiation. Compared with NK cells conventionally activated with interleukin-2, CIML-NK cells express lower levels of check-point receptors, TIGIT and TIM3, and higher effector functions against NSCLC cells from PDX, and against in vitro-generated tumor spheroids. Remarkably, CIML-NK cells also significantly reduce the CSC-containing CD133+ cell subpopulation within spheroids and PDX, and limit tumor cell tumorigenicity and ability to disseminate CSCs from primary tumors to distant sites. Sorting experiments on CIML or tumor cell subsets reveal that CD56bright cells drive most of this anti-CSC activity, and suggest that such functional advantage could be related to increased expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 on CD56bright cells and CSCs, respectively. We also show that the tri-specific killer cell engager (TriKE) 1615133 significantly enhances CIML-NK cell activity against CSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that CIML-NK cells, capable of killing autologous tumor cells and responding to the 1615133 TriKE, could be induced from patients with NSCLC. Conclusions Our study discloses for the first time the therapeutic potential of CIML-NK cells in controlling CSCs and metastatic spread, highlighting the role of the CD56bright subset expansion and 1615133 TriKE for optimizing CIML-NK-based therapies against metastatic tumors.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by an extremely poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Central to the progression and immune evasion of PDAC is the tumor (immune) microenvironment (TIME), where immune checkpoint proteins such as galectin-9 (Gal-9) play pivotal roles. Gal-9 significantly contributes to the immunosuppressive milieu of PDAC by interacting with various immune cells, such as T cells, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These interactions suppress anti-tumor immunity, thus facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. This review comprehensively examines the multifaceted role of Gal-9 in the TIME of PDAC, detailing its mechanisms of action, including the induction of regulatory T cells, polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, and modulation of apoptotic pathways via Tim-3 and caspase activation. The therapeutic potential of targeting Gal-9, either alone or in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-L1, is also discussed, highlighting preclinical findings that suggest promising avenues for enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. By elucidating the complex biological activities of Gal-9 and its interactions within the TIME, this review underscores the importance of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the immunosuppressive effects of Gal-9 in PDAC.">

        <tr id="Stem cells are highly resistant to viral infection compared to their differentiated progeny, and this resistance is associated with stem cell-specific restriction factors and intrinsic interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). In HIV infection, proviral DNA has been detected in certain bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells, yet widespread stem cell infection in vivo is restricted. Intriguingly, exposing bone marrow stem cells to HIV in vitro led to viral replication selectively only in the CD34- population, but not in the CD34+ cells. The mechanism dictating this CD34-based HIV restriction remained a mystery, especially since HIV has a capacity to antagonize restriction factors and ISGs. CD34 is a common marker of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Here, we report the intrinsic antiviral properties of CD34. Expression of CD34 in HIV-1 producer cells results in the loss of progeny virion infectivity. Conversely, removal of CD34 using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or stem cell differentiation cytokines promotes HIV-1 replication in stem cells. These results suggest that in addition to restriction factors and intrinsic ISGs, CD34 serves as a host innate protection preventing retrovirus replication in stem cells. Mechanistically, CD34 does not block viral entry, integration, and release. Instead, it becomes incorporated onto progeny virions, which inactivates virus infectivity. These findings offer new insights into innate immunity in stem cells, and highlight intriguing retrovirus-host interactions in evolution.">

        <tr id="Uveitis refers to a diverse group of inflammatory diseases that affecting the uveal tract, comprising the iris, ciliary body, and choroid, with potential repercussions ranging from visual impairment to blindness. The role of autoimmunity in uveitis etiology is complex and still under investigation. CD4+ T cells intricately regulate immune responses in uveitis through their diverse subtypes: Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg (T regulatory), and Tfh (follicular T helper) cells. Each T cell subtype secretes specific cytokines with either pathogenic or protective implications in uveitis. Th1 cells, characterized by IFN-γ secretion and T-bet expression, drive type 1 immune responses against intracellular pathogens. Conversely, Th2 cells, which produce interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and express the transcription factor GATA3, mediate type 2 immune responses to larger extracellular threats like helminths. Th17 cells, generating IL-17 and IL-22 and controlled by RORγt, engage in type 3 immune responses against select pathogens. Tfh cells, releasing IL-21 and governed by Bcl6, aid B cell antibody production. Conversely, Tregs, identified by Foxp3, exert regulatory functions in immune homeostasis. This review delves into the roles of CD4+ T cell-derived cytokines in uveitis, emphasizing their intricate involvement in disease progression and resolution. Insight into these mechanisms might guide therapeutic approaches targeting CD4+ T cell responses in uveitis management.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background There is a need for noninvasive immunological biomarkers that can identify stable kidney allograft immune quiescence to inform individualized immunosuppression. Methods We conducted a cross‐sectional, pilot cohort study evaluating the relative abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to effector T‐cell (Teff) populations as a surrogate marker of long‐term graft tolerance. We obtained fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients, most with recent surveillance biopsies to identify the presence or absence of chronic inflammation. Tregs were sub‐phenotyped as naïve, memory, and activated Tregs (aTreg). Treg/Teff ratios were modeled for association with chronic inflammation and in the context of potential clinical features. Results Twenty‐seven patient samples were included on standard immunosuppression (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) with a mean age of 9.2 ± 5.0 years, at 30.2 ± 21.7 months posttransplant. The ratio of aTreg (FOXP3++CD45RA−) to Th17 cells (CD4+IL‐17+) was significantly greater in patients without inflammation than in patients with graft inflammation (p < 0.01). Similarly, there was a trend toward greater aTreg/CD4+ T cells and aTreg/CD8+ Teff in patients without inflammation (p = 0.05 and 0.09, respectively). There was no significant association for inflammation with naïve or memory Treg/Teff ratios. Multiple logistic regression with all three aTreg/Teff ratios modeled allograft inflammation with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–0.98). Conclusions The proportion of peripheral blood aTregs/Teff cells in this pilot cohort of stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients was associated with immune quiescence. These data support further investigation into aTreg/Teff monitoring to inform precision immunosuppressive treatment.">

        <tr id="Tumors employ a range of strategies to evade detection and eradication by the host’s immune system. These include downregulating antigen expression, altering antigen presentation processes, and inhibiting immune checkpoint pathways. etc. Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) represents a strategy that boosts anti-tumor immunity. This is achieved by amplifying or genetically engineering immune cells, which are either sourced from the patient or a donor, in a laboratory setting. Subsequently, these cells are reintroduced into the patient to bolster their immune response against cancer. ACT has successfully restored anti-tumor immune responses by amplifying the activity of T cells from patients or donors. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying tumor escape, including alterations in tumor cell antigens, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and modulation of immune checkpoint pathways. It further explores how ACT can avddress these factors to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, the review discusses the application of gene-editing technologies (such as CRISPR) in ACT, highlighting their potential to strengthen the anti-tumor capabilities of T cells. Looking forward, the personalized design of ACT, combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, is expected to significantly improve treatment outcomes, positioning this approach as a key strategy in the field of cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The activation and infiltration of immune cells are hallmarks of ischemic stroke. However, the precise origins and the molecular alterations of these infiltrating cells post-stroke remain poorly characterized. Here, a murine model of stroke (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion [p-MCAO]) is utilized to profile single-cell transcriptomes of immune cells in the brain and their potential origins, including the calvarial bone marrow (CBM), femur bone marrow (FBM), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This analysis reveals transcriptomically distinct populations of cerebral myeloid cells and brain-resident immune cells after stroke. These include a novel CD14+ neutrophil subpopulation that transcriptomically resembles CBM neutrophils. Moreover, the sequential activation of transcription factor regulatory networks in neutrophils during stroke progression is delineated, many of which are unique to the CD14+ population and underlie their acquisition of chemotaxis and granule release capacities. Two distinct origins of post-stroke disease-related immune cell subtypes are also identified: disease inflammatory macrophages, likely deriving from circulating monocytes in the skull, and transcriptionally immature disease-associated microglia, possibly arising from pre-existing homeostatic microglia. Together, a comprehensive molecular survey of post-stroke immune responses is performed, encompassing both local and distant bone marrow sites and peripheral blood.">

        <tr id="Background: Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular cancer in adults; however, it remains rare. Despite its rarity, metastatic uveal melanoma poses significant treatment challenges. Tebentafusp, a T-cell receptor–bispecific molecule targeting glycoprotein 100 and CD3, has shown substantial survival benefits for HLA-A*02:01 positive patients. A notable complication associated with tebentafusp and similar immunotherapies is cytokine release syndrome (CRS), occurring in nearly 90% of tebentafusp-treated patients. Although typically mild, severe CRS (grade 3) affects around 1% of patients. The unpredictable nature of CRS complicates patient management during treatment. Methods: Monitoring cytokine levels, as key indicators of inflammation, may therefore be crucial for understanding and managing CRS. Advanced proteomic technologies enable the simultaneous measurement of multiple cytokines, providing a comprehensive view of inflammatory responses. Results: In this case, a patient with metastatic uveal melanoma developed CRS after tebentafusp treatment. A proteomic analysis tracked the cytokine changes from baseline to post-treatment, revealing significant elevations in inflammatory markers. Conclusions: These findings suggest potential strategies for more personalized CRS management in similar therapies.">

Being critical to CNS homeostasis, microglia also have been shown to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancer. Hence, microglia are regarded as a potential therapeutic target in CNS diseases, resulting in an increased demand for reliable in vitro models. Two human microglia cell lines (HMC3 and C20) are being used in multiple in vitro studies, however, the knowledge of their biological and immunological characteristics remains limited. Our aim was to identify and compare the biological changes in these immortalised immune cells under normal physiological and immunologically challenged conditions. Using high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, we have examined in-depth proteomic profiles of non-stimulated and LPS or IFN-γ challenged HMC3 and C20 cells. Our findings reveal that HMC3 cells responded to both treatments through upregulation of immune, metabolic, and antiviral pathways, while C20 cells showed a response associated with mitochondrial and immune activities. Additionally, the secretome analysis demonstrated that both cell lines release IL-6 in response to LPS, while IFN-γ treatment resulted in altered kynurenine pathway activity, highlighting distinct immune and metabolic adaptations.">

        <tr id="Background: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are key players in the colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor microenvironment (TME), representing the most abundant immune cells within it. The interplay between the intestinal microbiota, macrophages, and cancer cells significantly impacts tumor progression by driving macrophage polarization. Particularly, the polarization into the pro-tumoral M2-like TAM phenotype promotes the extracellular matrix remodeling, cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, immune suppression, and therapy resistance. Probiotic metabolites can disrupt this crosstalk, possibly reverting the TAM polarization toward a pro-inflammatory anti-tumoral phenotype, thus potentially benefiting the intestinal mucosa and opposing CRC progression. Previously, we showed that Lactiplantibacillus plantarum OC01 metabolites counter interleukin (IL)-6-induced CRC proliferation and migration. Methods: Here, we explore how probiotics affect CRC secretome and how this influences TAM polarization, which then impacts CRC malignancy. Results: The conditioning medium (CM) from CRC cells indeed promoted the polarization of macrophage toward the M2-like phenotype, whereas the CM from CRC pre-treated with L. plantarum OC01 metabolites induced a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype, characterized by NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and by decreased expression of the M2 phenotype markers CD206 and CD163. Consistently, the expression of tumor growth factor (TGF)-β, a promoter of M2 macrophage polarization, was reduced in CRC cells treated with L. plantarum OC01. The pro-inflammatory macrophages inhibited CRC proliferation and migration. Conclusions: Overall, our study highlights the potential of metabolites from L. plantarum OC01 to reprogram the metabolism in cancer cells and thus reshape the TME by shifting TAMs toward a more inflammatory and anti-tumoral phenotype, emphasizing the promise of probiotics in advancing novel therapeutic approaches for CRC.">

        <tr id="Understanding both local and systemic immunity is essential to optimizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the dynamic alterations in systemic immunity during tumor development are yet to be clearly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized connection that bridges the interaction between the spleen and tumor through erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), which suppress tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. We performed the single-cell RNA-seq and RNA-seq to demonstrate the presence of EPCs and identify the characteristic and an immunomodulatory role of EPCs during tumor progression. These tumor-hijacked EPCs proliferate in situ in spleens and impaired systemic and local antitumor response through the interaction between tumor and spleen. Specifically, the splenic CD45- EPCs secreted heparin-binding growth factor to regulate PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression of splenic CD45+ EPCs. Educated CD45+ EPCs from the spleen then migrated to the tumors via the CCL5/CCR5 axis, thereby weakening local antitumor immunity. Consequently, targeting EPCs not only revitalized antitumor immunity but also improved the anti-PD-L1 effect by promoting intratumoral T cell infiltration. Importantly, CD45+ EPCs are associated with immunosuppression and reduced survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal the role of EPCs in orchestrating the interaction between the spleen and tumor, which could have significant implications for the development of more effective cancer immunotherapy.">

This review systematically discusses the types of hematopoietic progenitors that give rise to macrophages, including primitive hematopoietic progenitors, erythro-myeloid progenitors, and hematopoietic stem cells. These progenitors have distinct genetic backgrounds and developmental processes. Accordingly, macrophages exhibit complex and diverse functions in the body, including phagocytosis and clearance of cellular debris, antigen presentation, and immune response, regulation of inflammation and cytokine production, tissue remodeling and repair, and multi-level regulatory signaling pathways/crosstalk involved in homeostasis and physiology. Besides, tumor-associated macrophages are a key component of the TME, exhibiting both anti-tumor and pro-tumor properties. Furthermore, the functional status of macrophages is closely linked to the development of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic conditions, and trauma. Targeting macrophages has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in these contexts. Clinical trials of macrophage-based targeted drugs, macrophage-based immunotherapies, and nanoparticle-based therapy were comprehensively summarized. Potential challenges and future directions in targeting macrophages have also been discussed. Overall, our review highlights the significance of this versatile immune cell in human health and disease, which is expected to inform future research and clinical practice.">

        <tr id="CCR2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, is widely expressed on monocytes, macrophages, activated T cells, and other cell types, and plays a critical role in coordinating the immune response to various infections. Here we demonstrate that CCR2 expression is significantly elevated during Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) respiratory infection, and its absence leads to exacerbated susceptibility, as evidenced by significant weight loss, higher bacterial loads, severe lung pathology, and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (il-1β, tnfα, and il-6). The absence of ccr2 impairs both myeloid cell infiltration and T cell responses, which are crucial for effective immune defense. Specifically, ccr2 deficiency disrupts the differentiation and response of Th1 cells, which are the primary effector lineage responsible for clearing chlamydia through secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). As a result, there is a significant decrease in CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells in the lung and spleen, accompanied by reduced levels of IFN-γ protein and mRNA, as well as downregulated mRNA expression of Th1-promoting cytokines (il-12p35, il-12p40) and transcription factors (stat4, T-bet), which play crucial roles in Th1 differentiation. Moreover, ccr2 deficiency greatly diminishes STAT1 phosphorylation, a key regulator of IFN-γ secretion by Th1 cells. Meanwhile, we also observed a significant reduction in IFN-γ secretion by CD8+ T cells following ccr2 deficiency. Conversely, ccr2-/- mice exhibit an exaggerated Th2-type immune response, with elevated levels of Th2-promoting cytokines (IL-4), transcription factors (STAT6 and gata3), and il-5, which together lead to more severe lung tissue damage and increased susceptibility to infection. Furthermore, these mice show higher levels of IL-17 along with an enhanced Th17-type immune response, characterized by increased Th17-promoting cytokines TGFB, transcription factors stat3 and RORγt, and il-21, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that drives neutrophil infiltration to exacerbate lung inflammation. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CCR2, a chemokine receptor, in orchestrating the immune response to Chlamydia infection by facilitating Th1 cells differentiation while restraining Th2-type and Th17-type immune responses, thereby alleviating pulmonary inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Chromium, a common environmental and occupational sensitizer, frequently induces allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). This study investigates the role of CD4+ (T helper), CD8+ (T cytotoxic), regulatory (Tregs: CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+), and gamma delta (Tγδ) T cells in chromium tolerance versus hypersensitivity. Methods: Six chromium-allergic patients and six healthy controls were recruited, confirmed via patch testing. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured, with chromium exposure and proliferation assays conducted. Specific T cell subtypes were isolated and analyzed for chromium-specific proliferative responses, cytokine production, and metabolic activity. Results: Chromium-allergic individuals exhibited broad proliferation across PBMC and T cell subsets, contrasting with restricted responses in controls. Treg cells in healthy subjects effectively suppressed T cell proliferation in response to chromium, while allergic individuals showed unmodulated T cell activity, indicative of impaired regulatory function. Cytokine analysis revealed elevated IL-2 and TNF-α but absent IL-10 in allergic patients. Metabolic assessments showed higher glycolytic activity in Tregs of healthy controls, suggesting enhanced regulatory potential. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of balanced effector and regulatory T cell interactions for chromium tolerance. Dysregulated Treg and Tγδ cell functions in allergic individuals may contribute to hypersensitivity, with implications for targeted therapeutic strategies to restore immune balance and reduce allergic responses in chromium-sensitive patients.">

        <tr id="T-cell recruiting bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are in clinical development for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite promising results, early clinical trials have failed to demonstrate durable responses. We investigated whether activation of the innate immune system through stimulator of interferon genes (STING) can enhance target-cell killing by a BsAb targeting CD33 (CD33 BiTE® molecule, AMG 330). Indeed, we show that cytotoxicity against AML mediated by AMG 330 can be greatly enhanced when combined with the STING agonist 2',3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), or diABZI. We used in vitro cytotoxicity assays, immunoblotting, transcriptomic analyses, and extensive CRISPR-Cas9 knockout experiments to investigate the enhancing effect of a STING agonist on the cytotoxicity of AMG 330 against AML. Importantly, we validated our findings with primary AML cells, and in a xenograft AML model. Mechanistically, in addition to direct cytotoxic effects of STING activation on AML cells, activated T cells render AML cells more susceptible to STING activation through their effector cytokines interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), resulting in enhanced type I interferon production and induction of interferon-stimulated genes. This feeds back to the T cells, leading to a further increase in effector cytokines and an overall cytotoxic T-cell phenotype, contributing to the beneficial effect of cGAMP/diABZI in enhancing AMG 330-mediated lysis. We established a key role for IFNγ in AMG 330-mediated cytotoxicity against AML cells, and in rendering AML cells responsive to STING agonism. Here, we propose to improve the efficacy of CD33-targeting BsAbs by combining them with a STING agonist.">

        <tr id="T lymphocytes (T cells) are essential components of the adaptive immune system that play a vital role in identifying and eliminating infected and tumor cells. In tumor immunotherapy, T cells have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy due to their high specificity, potent cytotoxic capability, long-lasting immune memory, and adaptability within immunotherapeutic approaches. However, tumors can evade the immune system by depleting T cells through various mechanisms, such as inhibitory receptor signaling, metabolic exhaustion, and physical barriers within the tumor microenvironment. This review provided an overview of the mechanisms underlying T-cell depletion in tumors and discussed recent advances in clinical research related to T-cell immunotherapy for tumors. It highlighted the need for in-depth studies on key issues such as indications, dosage, and sequencing of combined therapeutic strategies tailored to different patients and tumor types, providing practical guidance for individualized treatment. Future research on T-cell depletion would be necessary to uncover the fundamental mechanisms and laws of T-cell depletion, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance for the selection and optimization of tumor immunotherapy. Furthermore, interdisciplinary, cross-disciplinary, and international collaborative innovations are necessary for developing more effective and safer treatments for tumor patients.">

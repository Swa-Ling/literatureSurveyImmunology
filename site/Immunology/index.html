        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The gut microbiota crucially regulates the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) based immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear at the single-cell resolution. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and subsequent validations, we investigate gut microbiota-ICI synergy by profiling the tumor microenvironment (TME) and elucidating critical cellular interactions in mouse models. Our findings reveal that intact gut microbiota combined with ICIs may synergistically increase the proportions of CD8+, CD4+, and γδ T cells, reduce glycolysis metabolism, and reverse exhausted CD8+ T cells into memory/effector CD8+ T cells, enhancing antitumor response. This synergistic effect also induces macrophage reprogramming from M2 protumor Spp1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to Cd74+ TAMs, which act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These macrophage subtypes show a negative correlation within tumors, particularly during fecal microbiota transplantation. Depleting Spp1+ TAMs in Spp1 conditional knockout mice boosts ICI efficacy and T cell infiltration, regardless of gut microbiota status, suggesting a potential upstream role of the gut microbiota and highlighting the crucial negative impact of Spp1+ TAMs during macrophage reprogramming on immunotherapy outcomes. Mechanistically, we propose a γδ T cell-APC-CD8+ T cell axis, where gut microbiota and ICIs enhance Cd40lg expression on γδ T cells, activating Cd40 overexpressing APCs (e.g., Cd74+ TAMs) through CD40-CD40L-related NF-κB signaling and boosting CD8+ T cell responses via CD86-CD28 interactions. These findings highlight the potential importance of γδ T cells and SPP1-related macrophage reprogramming in activating CD8+ T cells, as well as the synergistic effect of gut microbiota and ICIs in immunotherapy through modulating the TME.">

        <tr id="Preserving barrier integrity is of great importance in mucosal tissues while simultaneously defending against inflammatory threats and exposures to pathogens. NK cells at barrier sites are essential for viral control during infections such as herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) but must also balance pathogen response with tissue protection. We have characterized human tissue NK cells in the vaginal tissue (VT) as having distinct effector and tissue protective functions. Using scRNA-seq and high- parameter flow cytometry, we uncovered a unique signature for VT NK cells, indicating a reduced effector phenotype with increased factors related to tissue residency and immunoregulation at steady state. Despite their functionally quiescent nature, these cells were able to respond robustly to inflammatory signals, suggesting they are poised for pathogen response. We found that the gene signatures between mouse and human NK cells were remarkably similar, demonstrating the feasibility of using a mouse model to probe distinct NK cell functions during mucosal infection. In mice, VT NK cells responded robustly to acute HSV-2 infection and retained an enhanced recall potential after viral clearance. They also secreted tissue repair factors and played a role in restricting tissue damage following viral infection. Our data, using both human tissues and a mouse model, reveal an unexpected role of mucosal tissue NK cells in the VT in balancing host protection with tissue repair in the context of localized mucosal tissue infection.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms driving immune evasion in early-stage I high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Our findings revealed a highly immunosuppressive HGSOC microenvironment, characterized by abundant infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Trajectory analysis uncovered differentiation pathways of naïve Tregs, which underwent either activation and proliferation or transcriptional instability. The predicted Treg-cell interaction network, including crosstalk within tumor cells, facilitates Treg mobility and maturation while reinforcing their immunosuppressive function and persistence in the tumor. Moreover, their interactions with immune cells likely inhibit CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting cells, supporting tumor immune escape. Additionally, more immunogenic tumor conditions, marked by IFNγ production, may contribute to Treg destabilization. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of Tregs in early immune evasion of HGSOC and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting their activity and differentiation fate.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 have shown remarkable antitumor efficacy, but can also cause immune-related adverse events, including checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (ChILI). This multi-omic study aimed to investigate changes in blood samples from treated cancer patients who developed ChILI. PBMCs were sequenced for by transcriptomic and T cell receptor repertoire (bulk and single-cell immune profiling), and extracellular vesicle (EV) enrichment from plasma was analyzed by mass spectroscopy proteomics. Data were analyzed by comparing the ChILI patient group to the control group who did not develop ChILI and by comparing the onset of ChILI to pre-ICI treatment baseline. We identified significant changes in T cell clonality, gene expression, and proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma in response to liver injury. Onset of ChILI was accompanied by an increase in T cell clonality. Pathway analysis highlighted the involvement of innate and cellular immune responses, mitosis, pyroptosis, and oxidative stress. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that these changes were primarily found in select T cell subtypes (including CD8 + effector memory cells), while CD16 + monocytes exhibited enrichment in metabolic pathways. Proteomic analysis of plasma extracellular vesicles showed enrichment in liver-associated proteins among differentially expressed proteins. Interestingly, an increase in PBMC PD-L1 gene expression and plasma PD-L1 protein was also found to be associated with ChILI onset. These findings provide valuable insights into the immune and molecular mechanisms underlying ChILI as well as potential biomarkers of ChILI. Trial registration number NCT04476563.

        <tr id="The glioblastoma tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is an immunosuppressive barrier to therapy that encumbers glioblastoma responses to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Immunosuppressive cytokines, pro-tumor myeloid cells, and exhausted T-cells are hallmarks of the glioblastoma TIME. Here we integrate spatial and single-cell analyses of patient-matched human glioblastoma samples before and after ICI with genetic, immunologic, single-cell, and pharmacologic studies in preclinical models to reveal that interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibition reprograms the glioblastoma TIME to sensitize mouse glioblastoma to ICI and radiotherapy. Rare human glioblastoma patients who achieve clinical responses to ICI have lower pre-treatment IL-6 levels compared to glioblastomas who do not respond to ICI. Immune stimulatory gene therapy suppresses IL-6 tumor levels in preclinical murine models of glioblastoma. Furthermore, survival was longer in Il-6 knockout mice with orthotopic SB28 glioblastoma relative to wild-type mice. IL-6 blockade with a neutralizing antibody transiently sensitizes mouse glioblastoma to anti-PD-1 by increasing MHCII+ monocytes, CD103+ migratory dendritic cells (DCs), CD11b+ conventional DCs, and effector CD8+ T cells, and decreasing immunosuppressive Tregs. To translate these findings to a combination treatment strategy for recurrent glioblastoma patients, we show that IL-6 blockade plus ICI durably sensitizes mouse glioblastoma to high-dose radiotherapy.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cell (Treg) heterogeneity exists in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but we have limited understanding of context-dependent functions and spatiotemporal regulators of heterogenous Treg states, especially during perinatal life when immune tolerance is established. Here, we revealed that the class III PI3K Vps34 orchestrates effector Treg (eTreg) transitional heterogeneity during perinatal life. We found that loss of Vps34 reduced terminal eTreg accumulation in lymphoid tissues, associated with decreased Treg generation in non-lymphoid tissues and development of an early-onset autoimmune-like disease. After perinatal life, Vps34-deficient eTreg accumulation was further impaired due to reduced cell survival, highlighting temporal regulation of eTreg heterogeneity and maintenance by Vps34. Accordingly, inhibition of Vps34 in mature Tregs disrupted immune homeostasis but boosted anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, multiomics profiling approaches uncovered that Vps34-orchestrated transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling promotes terminal eTreg programming. Further, via genetic deletion of the Vps34-interacting proteins Atg14 or Uvrag in Tregs, we established that Atg14 but not Uvrag was required for the overall survival, but not terminal differentiation, of eTregs, suggesting that autophagy but not endocytosis partly contributed to Vps34-dependent effects. Accordingly, mice with Treg-specific loss of Atg14, but not Uvrag, had moderately disrupted immune homeostasis and reduced tumor growth, with Vps34- or Atg14-dependent gene signatures also being elevated in intratumoral Tregs from human cancer patients. Collectively, our study reveals distinct Vps34-orchestrated signaling events that regulate eTreg heterogeneity and functional adaptation and the pathophysiological consequences on autoimmunity versus anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8+ T cells are pivotal for long-term anti-tumor immunity due to their longevity and rapid response upon encountering tumor cells. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a member of the Ste20 family of kinases, restricts proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and plays critical roles in T cell priming and activation. However, the impact of HPK1 on CD8+ T cell differentiation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells derived from patients lacking HPK1 exhibit a stronger memory phenotype. HPK1 deletion promotes the formation of precursor and central memory CD8+ T cells, resulting in superior and long-lasting antitumor activity in murine cancer models compared to WT mice. Additionally, HPK1 knockout induces metabolic reprogramming by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial respiration complex activity. Mechanistically, HPK1 deletion downregulates mTOR signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of mTOR and S6. Increased mitophagy activity is observed in HPK1-depleted cells, with upregulation of key mitophagy regulators, including Pink1 and Bnip3l, maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Our study reveals that HPK1 regulates CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming, guiding cell differentiation and antitumor responses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Arginine methyltransferase protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are crucial modulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses, and their differentiation into tumor-associated macrophages is critical in shaping the TME. Despite ongoing clinical trials of small molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 for cancer therapy, their effects on macrophages, a key component of the immune system, remain poorly understood. Methods A pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis was initially conducted to investigate the expression of PRMT5 in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 in mice, as well as the use of a PRMT5-specific inhibitor, was performed to evaluate the impact of PRMT5 on macrophage polarization and tumor progression. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics were employed to explore the mechanistic roles of PRMT5 in regulating lipid metabolism and macrophage polarization. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy was assessed to study its effects on antitumor immunity in vivo. Results The pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis revealed that PRMT5 is highly expressed in the PPARG-macrophage subset, which correlates with poor patient survival. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 reprogrammed macrophages towards an antitumor phenotype, effectively inhibiting tumor progression. Mechanistically, PRMT5 was found to regulate lipid metabolism and drive macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory state via the STAT6-PPARγ pathway, fostering an immunosuppressive TME conducive to tumor growth. Notably, Prmt5 deletion induced PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells. Combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-PD-L1 therapy significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy, demonstrating a synergistic therapeutic effect. Conclusions These findings uncover a crucial role for PRMT5 in macrophage biology and suggest that targeting PRMT5 in myeloid cells offers a promising new approach for cancer immunotherapy. The combination of PRMT5 inhibition with anti-PD-L1 therapy may provide a potent strategy to reprogram the TME and enhance antitumor immune responses.">

It remains unknown whether a similar phenomenon contributes to immune evasion. Here we report a persister state which survives weeks of direct cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) attack. In contrast to previously known immune evasion mechanisms that avoid immune attack, antigenic persister cells robustly activate CTLs which deliver Granzyme B, secrete IFNγ, and induce tryptophan starvation resulting in apoptosis initiation. Instead of dying, persister cells paradoxically leverage apoptotic caspase activity to avoid inflammatory death. Furthermore, persister cells acquire mutations and epigenetic changes which enable outgrowth of CTL-resistant cells. Persister cell features are enriched in inflamed tumors which regressed during immunotherapy in vivo and in surgically resected human melanoma tissue under immune stress ex vivo. These findings reveal a persister cell state which is a barrier to immune-mediated tumor clearance. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Neonates, especially those born prematurely, are highly vulnerable to infection-induced mortality. Numerous observational and immunological studies in newborns have shown that live attenuated vaccines have beneficial, non-specific effects (NSEs) against secondary infections to unrelated pathogens. These beneficial effects have been attributed to trained immunity, and emergency granulopoiesis plays an essential role. However, trained immunity has been shown to affect multiple myeloid subsets and how trained immunity influences the host protective response is still undefined. Here we show that Bacillus-Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination improves survival to polymicrobial sepsis by simultaneously reprogramming broad aspects of myelopoiesis. Specifically, BCG vaccination expands multiple myeloid subsets, including the lineage (Lin)−Sca- 1+c-kit+ (LSK) and granulocytic-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and increases CD11b+Gr1+ cell number, as well as their oxidative metabolism and capacity to stimulate T-cell proliferation in response to sepsis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of neonatal splenocytes suggests that BCG-vaccination changes the broad transcriptional landscape of multiple myeloid subsets. The result is the maturation of various neutrophil and monocyte subsets, stimulation of antimicrobial processes, and suppression of inflammatory pathways and myeloid-derived suppressor cell transcription. These findings reveal that BCG administration early after birth fundamentally reorganizes the myeloid landscape to benefit the subsequent response to polymicrobial infection.

        <tr id="Introduction The tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, with tumor-associated macrophages significantly influencing immune suppression and tumor growth. Colorectal cancers (CRC) classified as Consensus Molecular Subtype 4 (CMS4) and triple-negative breast cancers subsets are particularly characterized by a mesenchymal phenotype, immune exclusion, and extensive macrophage infiltration. This study aimed to investigate how targeting cancer cell stemness with specific inhibitors could modulate macrophage polarization in CRC in vitro and breast cancer in vivo, potentially shifting the immune balance from pro-tumor M2-like to anti-tumor M1-like macrophages. Methods We used four stemness inhibitors—salinomycin, SB-431542, JIB-04, and napabucasin—each targeting different pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β, histone demethylation, and STAT3, respectively), to evaluate their effects on CMS4 CRC cell lines (HCT116 and SW620) and human peripheral blood-derived macrophages in an indirect co-culture model. Results Our results showed that CMS4 CRC cell lines induced distinct macrophage polarization patterns, with HCT116 promoting M2-like macrophages and SW620 leaning toward M1-like profile. Notably, the combination of stemness inhibitors reduced stemness markers (CD133, CD44) in colorectal cancer cells and shifted macrophage polarization toward an M1-like phenotype, particularly in co-culture with HCT116. In vivo studies using the syngeneic immunocompetent EO771 breast cancer mouse model demonstrated that combination of stemness inhibitors increased the M1/M2 macrophage ratio. Conclusions Our study highlights the dual potential of stemness inhibitors to target both cancer cells and the immune microenvironment. These findings offer promising strategies for enhancing favorable immunomodulation in mesenchymal-like colorectal tumors.">

        <tr id="Attempts to activate an anti-tumor immune response in glioblastoma (GBM) have been met with many challenges due to its inherently immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The degree and mechanisms by which molecularly and phenotypically diverse tumor-propagating glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to this state are poorly defined. In this study, our multifaceted approach combining bioinformatics analyses of clinical and experimental datasets, single-cell sequencing, and the molecular and pharmacologic manipulation of patient-derived cells identified GSCs expressing immunosuppressive effectors mimicking regulatory T cells (Tregs). We showed that this immunosuppressive Treg-like (ITL) GSC state is specific to the mesenchymal GSC subset and is associated with and driven specifically by TGFβ type II receptor (TGFBR2) in contrast to TGFBR1. Transgenic TGFBR2 expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres promoted a mesenchymal transition and induced a six-gene ITL signature consisting of CD274 (PD-L1), NT5E (CD73), ENTPD1 (CD39), LGALS1 (galectin-1), PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2), and TGFB1. This TGFBR2-driven ITL signature was identified in clinical GBM specimens, patient-derived GSCs, and systemic mesenchymal malignancies. TGFBR2high GSCs inhibited CD4+ and CD8+ T cell viability and their capacity to kill GBM cells, effects reversed by pharmacologic and shRNA-based TGFBR2 inhibition. Collectively, our data identify an immunosuppressive GSC state that is TGFBR2-dependent and susceptible to TGFBR2-targeted therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the main immunosuppressive cells in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, systemic Treg depletion is not favored due to the crucial role of Tregs in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and prevention of autoimmunity. Recently, CCR8 has been identified as a key chemokine receptor expressed on tumor-infiltrating Tregs and targeted blockade of CCR8 exerts anticancer effect in several cancer types, but whether this pathway is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods We determined the involvement of CCR8+ Tregs in HCC using human HCC tissues and TCGA database, and examined the anticancer effect and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the CCR8 antagonist, IPG0521m, which was developed in house, in murine liver cancer model with flow cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and Real-Time PCR. Results Remarkable increase in CCR8+ Tregs was observed in human HCC tissues. Treatment of syngeneic liver cancer model with IPG0521m resulted in dramatic inhibition of tumor growth, associated with increased CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues. Bulk RNA sequencing analysis indicated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in remarkable increase in antitumor immunity. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in a switch of Tregs from high immunosuppression to low immunosuppression phenotype, associated with elevated CD8+ T and NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, and decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor tissues. Conclusions IPG0521m inhibited liver cancer growth via reducing the immunosuppressive function of Tregs, thereby boosting anti-cancer immunity. Our study paves the way for the clinical study of CCR8 antagonist in HCC and other cancers.

        <tr id="The absence of signaling pathways related to intrinsic immune activation in tumor cells and the immunosuppressive microenvironment limit lymphocyte infiltration, constitutes an “immune-desert” tumor displaying insensitivity to various immunotherapies. This study investigates strategies to activate intrinsic immune pathways in glioma cells, reverse immunosuppression, and induce tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) within the glioma microenvironment (GME) to enhance natural and adaptive immune responses. We successfully induced antigen-presenting cell activation, macrophage/microglia polarization, and TLS formation in GME by intracranial delivery of BafA1@Rexo-SC, which comprises exosomes from irradiated bone marrow-derived stem cells overexpressing CD47 nanobodies and STING, loaded with the autophagy inhibitor BafA1. These exosomes efficiently activated the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to the formation of “lymphoid tissue organizer cells (Lto)” cells, VEGFA release for high endothelial microvessel formation, and chemokine release for T and B cell recruitment. BafA1@Rexo-SC also promoted macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells and enhanced effector T cell function by blocking CD47, while releasing type I interferon. Our findings suggest novel therapeutic approaches for glioma treatment.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with dismal clinical prognosis and resistance to current therapies. GBM progression is facilitated by the tumor microenvironment (TME), with an immune infiltrate dominated by tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The TME is also characterized by hypoxia and the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), with HIF-2α emerging as a potential regulator of tumor progression. However, its role in GBM immunosuppression remains unknown. Here, we investigate HIF-2α and the use of the HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 to modulate the TME in the immunocompetent GL261 mouse GBM model. PT2385 administration in vivo decreased tumor volume and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice, without affecting GL261 viability in vitro. Notably, HIF-2α inhibition alleviated the immunosuppressive TME and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) using αPD-1 and αTIM-3 antibodies to promote long-term survival. Comprehensive analysis of the immune infiltrate through single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry revealed that combining PT2385 with ICB reduced numbers of pro-tumoral macrophages and Tregs while increasing numbers of microglia, with a corresponding transcriptional modulation towards an anti-tumoral profile of these TAMs. In vitro, deletion of HIF-2α in microglia impeded their polarization towards a pro-tumoral M2-like profile, and its inhibition impaired Treg migration. Our results show that targeting HIF-2α can switch an immunosuppressive TME towards one that favors a robust and sustained response to ICB based immunotherapy. These findings establish that clinically relevant HIF-2α inhibitors should be explored not only in malignancies with defects in the HIF-2α axis, but also in those exhibiting an immunosuppressive TME that limits immunotherapy responsiveness.

        <tr id="Background The immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME) reduces immune response effectiveness in stromal-rich tumours, including CMS4 colorectal cancer (CRC). Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), precursors to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), promote cancer progression by suppressing anti-tumour immune responses. Hypersialylation of glycans on tumours engages Siglec receptors on immune cells, driving immune dysfunction, but its role in stromal-mediated immunosuppression remains unclear. Methods Sialic acids and Siglec ligands were measured on CRC tissue, primary human CAFs, and tumour-conditioned-mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCTCS) and CAF using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The effect of stromal cell sialylation on macrophages and NK cells was assessed in ex vivo primary stromal and immune cell co-cultures and expression of Siglec-10 and immune cell phenotype markers and function were measured by flow cytometry. Using an immunocompetent Balb/c CT26 mouse model, we induced tumours with/without conditioned stromal cells, with/without pre-treatment of stromal cells with sialyltransferase inhibitor (3FAX) or sialidase (E610). We assessed the effect of stromal cell sialylation on macrophages and NK cells in the tumour and secondary lymphoid tissues by flow cytometry. Results Stromal cells, including CAFs, in CRC tumours are highly sialylated compared to epithelial cancer cells and are associated with high expression of ST6GalNAC6. Genetic knockdown of ST6GalNAC6 reduced the expression of stromal cell Siglec-10 ligands in MSCs. CAFs and MSCTCS induced Siglec-10 on macrophages and NK cells and impaired NK cell cytotoxicity. Sialidase treatment reduced Siglec-10 expression, restoring NK cell function. In vivo, desialylation of stromal cells increased macrophage activation (CD11b+CD80+) and reduced immunosuppressive marker expression (CD206, PD-L1, Siglec-G) in lymphoid tissues, indicating sustained systemic anti-tumour immunity. Intratumoural NK cells exhibited high Siglec-G expression and impaired cytotoxicity, and granzyme B expression significantly increased with sialidase treatment of stromal cells. In an inflammatory tumour model, inflammatory tumour-conditioned (iTCS) MSCs promoted metastasis and Siglec-G induction on NK cells and macrophages, both reversed by sialyltransferase inhibition, underscoring the effects of stromal modulation of innate immune cell function in inflammatory tumours. Conclusion Stromal cell sialylation modulates innate immune suppression in CRC via the sialic acid/Siglec axis. Targeting stromal sialylation restores NK cytotoxicity and macrophage activation, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for immunosuppressive stromal-rich tumours. What is already known on this topic The tumour microenvironment of consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4) colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with high stromal burden, poor immune infiltration, poor response to anti-cancer therapies and thus poor patient prognosis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have limited impact on stromal-rich CRC tumours, therefore highlighting the need to discover and target novel mechanisms of tumour immune evasion. Emerging studies have highlighted that stromal cells in CRC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are highly sialylated, expressing even higher levels of sialic acid on their cell surface than epithelial cancer cells. Targeting stromal cell sialylation has unveiled promising data in restoring the anti-tumour activity of T cells and macrophages. There is a need to explore the effects of targeting stromal cell sialylation on other immune cells of the TME and to evaluate the Siglec/sialic acid axis of stromal and immune cells in resistant CRC tumours. What this study adds: We reveal ST6GalNAC6 as a sialyltransferase enzyme that regulates the production of Siglec-10 ligands in CRC stromal cells. Overexpression of ST6GalNAC6 and Siglec-10 correlated with poor survival in CRC and mesenchymal CRC tumours. We show for the first time an induction of Siglec-10 expression on macrophages and NK cells in stromal-immune co-culture experimental models with hypersialylated MSCs and CAFs in vitro and ex vivo. Targeting stromal cell sialylation increased NK cell cytotoxicity of CRC cells, indicating a direct functional role for stromal cell sialylation in immunosuppression. An immunogenic mouse model of CRC was used to evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy of targeting stromal cell sialylation in overcoming stromal cell-mediated immunosuppression in CRC. Sialic acid-targeting of stroma slowed tumour growth and reduced inflammation-driven metastasis. This was associated with greater infiltration and activation of macrophages and NK cells with stromal cell sialic acid depletion, highlighting stromal cell sialylation as a mechanism of innate immune cell suppression in stromal-rich CRC. How this study might affect Research, Practice or Policy Our research provides insight into a novel mechanism of stromal cell-mediated immunosuppression of innate immune cells in CRC and may open up new avenues of research for targeting stromal cells in stromal-rich TMEs such as pancreatic, breast and ovarian cancers. Our research identifies a stromal cell effect of enhancing Siglec expression on tumour infiltrating innate immune cells as a novel immune checkpoint, which may be useful in identifying potential novel immunotherapeutic combinations in future.

        <tr id="Transplant recipients require lifelong, multimodal immunosuppression to prevent rejection by reducing alloreactive immunity. Rapamycin, a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is known to modulate adaptive and innate immunity, while the full spectrum of its immunosuppressive mechanisms remains incompletely understood. Given the broad expression of mTOR, we investigated the understudied effects of rapamycin on lymph node (LN) architecture, leukocyte trafficking, and the gut microbiome and metabolism after 3, 7, and 30 days of rapamycin treatment, to characterize the early, intermediate, and late changes. Rapamycin significantly reduced CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T (Treg) cells in peripheral LNs, mesenteric LNs, and the spleen over time. Rapamycin induced early pro-inflammation transition to pro-tolerogenic status, by modulating the LN laminin α4:α5 expression ratios through LN stromal cells laminin α5 expression and by adjusting Treg numbers and distribution. Additionally, rapamycin significantly altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic functions, shifting the Bacteroides to Firmicutes ratio and increasing amino acid bioavailability in the gut lumen. These effects were evident by 7 days and became most pronounced by 30 days in naïve mice, with notable changes as early as 3 days in allogeneic splenocyte-stimulated mice. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of rapamycin’s action through time-dependent modulation of LN architecture and gut microbiome, which orchestrates changes in immune cell trafficking, providing a new framework for understanding and optimizing immunosuppressive therapies.">

CD8+TRM derived from cervical tissue were more efficient at eliminating reactivated HIV-infected CD4+T cells compared to circulating effector CD8+T cells. Expansion of CD8+TRM-like phenotypes from blood through IL-15/TGF-β1 stimulation recovered functional HIV-specific CD8+T cells displaying residency features, increased clonotypic diversity and mitochondrial function, and were the most efficient phenotypes at eliminating intact viruses after reactivation. Altogether, we provide a relevant therapeutic strategy to enhance elimination of persistent antigens like HIV by generating functional CD8+TRM-like phenotypes.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality but heterogeneity in patient responsiveness remains. Thus, greater understanding of the immunologic factors that dictate response to immunotherapy is critical to improve patient outcomes. Here, we show that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is elevated in the setting of melanoma in humans and mice and plays a functional role in inhibiting the CD8+ T cell response. Surprisingly, the tumor itself is not the major cellular source of Fgl2. Instead, we found that macrophage-secreted Fgl2 dampens the CD8+ T cell response through binding and apoptosis of FcγRIIB+CD8+ T cells. This regulation was CD8+ T cell autonomous and not via an antigen-presenting cell intermediary, as absence of Fcgr2b from the CD8+ T cells rendered T cells insensitive to Fgl2 regulation. Fgl2 is robustly expressed by macrophages in 10 cancer types in humans and in 6 syngeneic tumor models in mice, underscoring the clinical relevance of Fgl2 as a therapeutic target to promote T cell activity and improve patient immunotherapeutic response.">

        <tr id="Background: Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment and holds great potential for them, including metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, immune resistance remains a major obstacle, limiting its efficacy and durability. Understanding the mechanisms of immune tolerance in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is pivotal for overcoming these challenges and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Methods: Over 2000 samples, including a real-world cohort of 230 advanced ccRCC patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) were analyzed. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from 13 tumor regions were categorized into ICB-exposed, ICB-resistant, and ICB-responsive groups. Multiple robust algorithms and multiplex immunofluorescence were used to explore TME composition and macrophage heterogeneity. Spatial communication dynamics were further investigated. In vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of SPP1 on 786-O and 769-P cells. Co-culture experiments with THP-1-derived macrophages, followed by Western blot, flow cytometry, and functional assays, were performed to investigate SPP1-mediated macrophage polarization and its impact on tumor progression. Results: The results revealed an elevated presence of Apolipoprotein E (APOE)+ macrophages in ICB-resistant ccRCC. Notably, higher APOE+ macrophage proportion indicated shorter prognosis and worse response to ICB (P < 0.001). Elevated expression of CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein Delta (CEBPD) was markedly linked to several immunosuppressive pathways, hindering T cell recruitment, promoting exhaustion, ultimately diminishing poorer prognosis and worse ICB efficacy. Meanwhile, upregulated Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) significantly enhances the proliferation, clonal formation, and migration of ccRCC cells. Tumor-derived SPP1. Additionally, SPP1 signaling from malignant cells appeared to recruit APOE+ macrophages to tumor margins, and promotes macrophage polarization into APOE+ M2-like macrophages. In the vicinity of the tumor, these APOE+ macrophages shape immunosuppressive TME by releasing abundant TGF-β signals, limiting anti-tumor effector T cells activity in ICB-resistant tumors, and contributing to tumor progression. Conclusion: This study reveals the critical role of APOE+ macrophages in promoting immune suppression and resistance to ICB therapy in ccRCC. By promoting T cell exhaustion and immunosuppressive signaling, particularly via localized TGF-β, these spatially segregated macrophages undermine treatment efficacy. Targeting APOE+ macrophages, especially in conjunction with ICB, presents a promising strategy to overcome immune resistance and enhance outcomes for ccRCC patients.">

        <tr id="A significant proportion of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) remain refractory to standard immunosuppressive therapy, and biomarkers to help guide treatment decisions are lacking. Here, we examined the circulating immune profile of patients with acetylcholine receptor antibody positive MG of differing treatment requirements compared to controls. Refractory patients displayed the highest frequency of memory B cells, and increased production of IL-6 and TNF-α upon toll-like receptor/ CD40 activation in vitro, suggesting an enhanced inflammatory phenotype. This was mirrored by a dramatic loss of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and dendritic cells in refractory disease. Refractory MG was also characterised by higher circulating complement proteins C3, C5 and clusterin as well as increased expression of complement receptors on B and T cells. Following anti-CD20 therapy, residual plasmablasts were found in circulation, likely to be drivers of ongoing disease. Baseline low B cell frequency (<3%), and high complement receptor expression were associated with poor response to rituximab, suggesting that alternative treatment strategies such as complement inhibition might be more favourable in these patients. Overall, our findings highlight an altered lymphocyte signature in patients with refractory MG and support the use of plasma cell depletion and therapies that promote Treg expansion as promising therapeutic avenues. One Sentence Summary Refractory myasthenia gravis is associated with a loss of Tregs, an expansion of pro-inflammatory B cells and elevated lymphocyte complement receptor expression.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease. The pathomechanism of RA depends on both B and T cells. Regulatory B cells (Breg) have been shown to suppress T-cell immune responses and play a key role in modulating autoimmune processes. We aimed to investigate the possibility of utilizing PD-L1+ Breg cells in downregulating the Th cells’ immune response in healthy individuals and RA patients. We hypothesized that the PD-1/PD-1L interaction plays a key role in this process, which may be defective in autoimmune diseases. We separated T and B cells from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and RA patients by magnetic cell sorting, and Th cells and Treg cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The cytokine production by CD4+ Th cells was detected by intracellular flow cytometry. CpG and CD40L stimulations were applied to induce PD-L1hi expressing Breg cells. We found that the frequency of PD-L1hi cells is significantly lower in all B-cell subsets in RA compared to healthy controls. Functional analysis of induced PD-L1+ Breg cells in coculture with activated autologous Th cells has shown that healthy control samples containing higher levels of PD-L1hi Breg cells significantly inhibit IFN-ү and IL-21 production by Th cells. In contrast, RA patients’ samples with lower levels of PD-L1hi Breg cells failed to do so. Since the expression of PD-L1 on B cells can be modulated in vitro to induce Breg cell suppressive capacity, these data may provide new perspectives for future therapy for RA.">

        <tr id="Introduction MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88) is a key adaptor protein mediate immune responses, primarily through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling. The TLR/MYD88 pathway plays a critical role in dendritic cells (DC) maturation and function, contributing to the body’s innate immunity. Recent studies have further highlighted MYD88’s pivotal role in intrinsic immunity and its regulatory influence on the tumor microenvironment (TME) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of MYD88 in DCs and its regulatory role in the TME have gained increasing attention. Methods RNA-sequencing data retrieved from the TCGA and GEO databases were utilized for both the training and validation of our signature. Single-cell RNA transcriptome data from GEO were analyzed to investigate the correlation among subclusters of T cells, myeloid cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) within the HCC tumor microenvironment (TME). A combination of bioinformatics and machine learning approaches was employed to perform statistical analyses.Additionally, flow cytometry was conducted to quantify T cell subtypes and assess biomarker expression in DCs. A BALB/c-derived xenograft mouse model was established to evaluate the functional role of MyD88 in tumor progression and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to reassess the biological effects of MyD88 in HCC patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Results Our pan-cancer data analysis further highlights the significant impact of MYD88 on clinical outcomes in HCC. Analysis of TCGA and GEO databases confirms that MYD88 serves as a key signaling molecule in DCs, reinforcing its critical role in immune regulation. Our in vitro experiments demonstrates that MyD88 modulates T cell function through DCs. In vivo, H22 tumor cells exhibited accelerated growth in MyD88 knockout mice and a reduced response to anti-PD-1 treatment, whereas wild-type mice showed the opposite trend. Discussion These findings underscore the critical role of MYD88 in DC function, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for immunoregulation in HCC. By shaping the TME, MYD88 not only regulates the immune response in HCC but also influences patient clinical outcomes. Both ex vivo and in vivo experiments further validate that MYD88 impacts DC functionality, contributing to variations in HCC progression">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Curative responses to immunotherapy require the generation of robust systemic immunity with limited toxicity. Recruitment of T cell populations such as precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex) from lymphoid tissues to tumors is a hallmark of effective treatment. However, the ability to efficiently induce this recruitment is lacking in current immunotherapy approaches. Furthermore, systemic administration of immunotherapies frequently results in dose-limiting toxicities, yielding an inadequate therapeutic window for eliciting durable responses. Methods In this investigation, we evaluated the safety and antitumor efficacy of locally administered interleukin 12 (IL-12) using a clinically translatable cytokine delivery platform (NCT05538624) to identify Tpex recruitment capabilities at tolerable cytokine doses. Results We show IL-12 cytokine factories can effectively treat a broad spectrum of cancer types. Single-cell RNA sequencing data suggests that the antitumor efficacy seen in our studies was due to retinal pigmented epithelial cells-mIL12 treatment inducing differentiation of Tpex cells within the tumor microenvironment. When administered in combination with checkpoint therapy, IL-12 cytokine factory treatment generated systemic abscopal immunity, preventing subcutaneous tumor outgrowth in 8/9 mice with colorectal cancer and lung metastasis in mice with melanoma. Furthermore, this platform was well tolerated in a non-human primate without signs of toxicity. Conclusions Our new immunotherapy approach provides a robust strategy for inducing Tpex recruitment and systemic immunity against a range of solid peritoneal malignancies, many incurable with current immunotherapy strategies. Notably, these features were achieved using IL-12, and by leveraging our technology, we avoided the toxicities that have prevented the translation of IL-12 to the clinic. Our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of IL-12 cytokine factories.">

        <tr id="CD4+FOXP3+ Treg cells maintain self tolerance, suppress the immune response to cancer, and protect against tissue injury during acute inflammation. Treg cells require mitochondrial metabolism to function, but how Treg cells adapt their metabolic programs to optimize their function during an immune response occurring in a metabolically stressed microenvironment remains unclear. Here, we tested whether Treg cells require the energy homeostasis–maintaining enzyme AMPK to adapt to metabolically aberrant microenvironments caused by malignancy or lung injury, finding that AMPK is dispensable for Treg cell immune-homeostatic function but is necessary for full Treg cell function in B16 melanoma tumors and during influenza virus pneumonia. AMPK-deficient Treg cells had lower mitochondrial mass and exhibited an impaired ability to maximize aerobic respiration. Mechanistically, we found that AMPK regulates DNA methyltransferase 1 to promote transcriptional programs associated with mitochondrial function in the tumor microenvironment. During viral pneumonia, we found that AMPK sustains metabolic homeostasis and mitochondrial activity. Induction of DNA hypomethylation was sufficient to rescue mitochondrial mass in AMPK-deficient Treg cells, linking AMPK function to mitochondrial metabolism via DNA methylation. These results define AMPK as a determinant of Treg cell adaptation to metabolic stress and offer potential therapeutic targets in cancer and tissue injury.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combination with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) are versatile professional antigen-presenting cells and play an instrumental role in the generation of antigen-specific T-cell responses. Modulation of DC function holds promise as an effective strategy to improve anti-tumor immunotherapy efficacy and enhance self-antigen tolerance in autoimmune diseases. Methods Wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knockout (KO) mice at 2 weeks of age were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to induce hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Four weeks later, WT and KO mice were randomly divided into control and treatment groups and treated once every two days for 30 weeks with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and a mix of 4 TLR2-activating lactic acid-producing probiotics (LAP), respectively. Mice were euthanized after 30 weeks of LAP treatment and their liver tissues were collected for gene expression, histological, flow cytometric and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Results We demonstrate here that oral administration of a mix of TLR2-activating LAP triggers a marked accumulation of regulatory DCs (rDCs) in the liver of mice. LAP-treated mice are protected from DEN-induced liver injury, fibrosis and HCC in a TLR2-dependent manner. Single-cell transcriptome profiling revealed that LAP treatment determines an immunosuppressive hepatic T-cell program that is characterized by a significantly reduced cytotoxic activity. The observed functional changes of T cells correlated well with the presence of a hepatic DC subset displaying a regulatory or tolerogenic transcriptional signature. Conclusion Overall, these data suggest that stimulation of regulatory dendritic cells (rDCs) in the liver by LAP suppresses cytotoxic T-cell function and alleviates DEN-induced liver damage, fibrosis and tumorigenesis.">

        <tr id="In solid tumors, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex mix of tumor, immune, stromal cells, fibroblasts, and the extracellular matrix. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute a fraction of immune cells that may infiltrate into the TME. The primary function of these T-cells is to detect and eliminate tumor cells. However, due to the immunosuppressive factors present in the TME primarily mediated by Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) as well as the tumor cells themselves, T-cells fail to differentiate into effector cells or become dysfunctional and are unable to eliminate the tumor. In addition, chronic antigen stimulation within the TME also leads to a phenomenon, first identified in chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, where the T-cells become exhausted and lose their effector functions. Exhausted T-cells (Tex) are characterized by the presence of remarkably conserved inhibitory receptors, transcription and signaling factors and the downregulation of key effector molecules. Tex cells have been identified in various malignancies, including melanoma, colorectal and hepatocellular cancers. Recent studies have indicated novel strategies to reverse T-cell exhaustion. These include checkpoint inhibitor blockade targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), or combinations of different immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) or combination of ICTs with cytokine co-stimulation. In this review, we discuss aspects of T-cell dysfunction within the TME with a focus on T-cell exhaustion. We believe that gaining insight into the mechanisms of T-cell exhaustion within the TME of human solid tumors will pave the way for developing therapeutic strategies to target and potentially re-invigorate exhausted T-cells in cancer.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a malignant hematologic disorder with limited curative options, primarily reliant on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Anemia, a prevalent symptom of MDS, has few effective treatment strategies. Realgar, though known for its therapeutic effects on MDS, remains poorly understood in terms of its mechanism of action. In this study, both in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted using Realgar and its primary active component, As2S2, to examine their impact on mouse erythroblasts at the single-cell level. Realgar treatment significantly altered the transcriptional profiles and cellular composition of bone marrow in mice, both in vivo and in vitro. Differentially expressed genes in erythroblasts regulated by Realgar were identified, unveiling potential regulatory functions and signaling pathways, such as heme biosynthesis, hemoglobin production, oxygen binding, IL-17 signaling, and MAPK pathways. These findings suggest that Realgar enhances the differentiation of erythroblasts in mouse bone marrow and improves overall blood cell counts. This work offers preliminary insights into Realgar’s mechanisms, expands the understanding of this mineral medicine, and may inform strategies to optimize its therapeutic potential in hematologic diseases.

        <tr id="Tumor dissemination is a key event in tumor progression. During this event, a main role is played by circulating tumor cells (CTCs), immune cells, and their interaction. How the immune system supports the survival and proliferation of CTCs is not fully elucidated. In this study we established an in-vitro co-culture system consisting of immune cells and CTCs from the same patient, which increased the success rate in the establishment of CTC-derived long-term cell cultures. In this system, we characterized the immune cells of successful co-cultures and the signals they exchange with cancer cells, including cytokines and extracellular vesicle (EV) content. Using this protocol, we stabilized four CTC-derived cell lines from patients with metastatic gastroesophageal cancer, which were cultured for over a year and characterized from a genetic and molecular point of view. The four cell lines harbor shared chromosomal aberrations including the amplification at 8q24.21 containing MYC and deletion 9p21.3 containing CDKN2A/B and the IFN type I cluster. The transcriptomic profile of CTC cell lines is distinct from primary tumors, and we detected the activation of E2F, G2M and MYC pathways and the downregulation of interferon response pathway. Each cell line shows a degree of invasiveness in zebrafish in-vivo, and the most invasive ones share the same mutation in RAB14 gene. In addition, the four cell lines secrete cell-line specific EVs containing microRNAs that target YAP, BRG1-AKT1, TCF8-HDAC pathways. Overall, we highlight how the immune system plays a key role in the proliferation of CTCs through EV signaling, and how CTC cell line genomic and transcriptomic alterations make these cells less visible from the immune system and likely responsible for the survival advantage in sites distant from the microenvironment of origin.">

        <tr id="Exploiting the immune system to eradicate cancer cells is an area of intense clinical study. However, the mechanisms that shape the tumor-immune microenvironment are incompletely understood. Here, we identify Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins as novel modulators of the tumor-immune microenvironment across diverse cancers. We demonstrate that loss of tumor MBNL expression results in an attenuated response to interferon gamma and reduced tumor antigen presentation in melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer cells. Parallel experiments in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model revealed that MBNL loss reduces tumor cell killing by CD8 + T cells in vitro and facilitates tumor escape from cytotoxic CD8 + T cell infiltration in vivo. Finally, we extended these studies to 29 human cancer types to find that MBNL expression levels are strongly associated with gene expression signatures of T cell tumor infiltration. These insights suggest that MBNL proteins play important roles in shaping the immune landscape across diverse malignancies.">

        <tr id="In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (Tregs) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD+), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes Tregs by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD+ with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing Tregs back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral Tregs, sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD+ axis disrupts Tregs metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.">

        <tr id="Recent studies have shown that the antitumor immunity of adaptive immune cells is regulated by Vitamin A (retinoic acid, RA). However, it remains unclear whether RA and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) signaling can modulate antitumor immunity by reversing immune exhaustion of innate-like γδ T cells in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Periphery blood samples from patients with NPC were prospectively collected, and phenotypic and functional analyses of γδ T cells were performed using flow cytometry. Tumor-bearing models and RAR inhibitor approaches were utilized to investigate RA/RAR-mediated regulation of T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) and the antitumor activity of γδ T cells. Here, our findings indicate that immune exhaustion markers are highly expressed on peripheral αβ and γδ T cells in NPC patients. Serum RA levels are negatively correlated with the abundance of Tim-3 on circulating Vδ2 T cells. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that RA/RAR signaling directly targets Vδ2 T cells, repressing Tim-3 expression, promoting NF-κB activation, and enhancing the production of antitumor-related cytokines. Notably, RA supplementation improved the efficacy of Vδ2 T cell-mediated immunotherapy in human NPC by suppressing Tim-3 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that RA/RAR signaling plays a crucial role in reversing immune exhaustion and represents a promising target for γδ T cell antitumor immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Objective Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in orchestrating anti-tumor immune responses. However, various factors can suppress DCs function and compromise anti-tumor immunity. Itaconate, a metabolite activated during inflammation and infection, has been identified to possess immunomodulatory properties, but its role on DCs remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of itaconate in regulating the maturation and function of DCs and its underlying molecular mechanism. Methods Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were treated with 4-octyl itaconate (4OI). The expression levels of CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC-II on BMDCs were analyzed by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of cytokines was assessed using RT-qPCR. BMDCs with different treatment were adoptively transferred to B16-OVA tumor-bearing mice. The production of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α in CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein level of NRF2 in BMDCs was analyzed by Western blot. Results Treatment with 4OI represses DC maturation and function. Specifically, 4OI-treated DCs exhibited impaired phenotypic and functional maturation, characterized by decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86, as well as lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-12, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β. Furthermore, these DCs demonstrated a diminished capacity to stimulate T cell responses both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 4OI inhibits DCs maturation and function through enhancing and activating KEAP1/NRF2 pathway. Conclusion This study reveals that 4OI inhibits DC function through NRF2 activation, elucidating the immunomodulatory mechanisms of itaconate and emphasizing its pivotal role in developing targeted DC-based tumor immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Esophageal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death, often preceded with chronic inflammation and injuries. The NFκB/IKKβ pathway plays a central role in inflammation, yet its role in early esophageal carcinogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated the role of epithelial IKKβ in early esophageal carcinogenesis. Mice were treated with the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) or a vehicle for one month to induce precancerous lesions. Esophagi were harvested and examined through histological, protein, flow cytometry, and RNA analyses. Histological analysis revealed that 4-NQO treatment led to increased inflammation, intraepithelial CD45+ immune cells, and elevated IKKβ phosphorylation levels. Mice with esophageal epithelial-specific Ikkβ deletion (4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO) showed delayed progression to a precancerous state, with reduced immune cell recruitment compared to 4-NQO/controls. Immunophenotyping showed decreased recruitment of T cells, including CD4+, CD8+ and regulatory (Tregs) T cells, and increased recruitment of macrophages in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice compared to 4-NQO/controls. RNA sequencing data identified 262 differentially expressed genes in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice, implicating pathways related to inflammation and wound healing. Notably, the chemokine CXCL9, a T cell chemoattractant, was significantly upregulated in 4-NQO control mice, but not in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice. Further analysis identified IFNγ as an upstream regulator of Cxcl9 expression, and neutralization of IFNγ reduced Cxcl9 expression levels in 4-NQO treated mice. Additionally, in vitro studies demonstrated that IFNγ upregulates Cxcl9 in an NF-ĸB dependent manner in esophageal keratinocytes. These findings suggest that epithelial IKKβ regulates the immune microenvironment in early esophageal carcinogenesis through the IFNγ/CXCL9 axis and influencing T cell recruitment and inflammatory responses. Summary In a mouse model of early esophageal squamous cell carcinogenesis, loss of epithelial Ikkβ reduced inflammation and T cell recruitment, increased macrophage recruitment, inhibited IFNγ/CXCL9 signaling, and delayed the transition to a precancerous state.">

        <tr id="A primary obstacle for HIV elimination is the long-term viral reservoir in lymphoid tissues (LT) that can cause rebound viremia if therapy is stopped. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are critical for control of HIV and SIV viremia; however, CD8+ T cells that migrate to LT are primarily non-cytotoxic, calling into question whether these cells could reduce the viral reservoir on ART or control viral replication when therapy is halted. To determine if CD8+ T cells can inhibit viral replication when retained in lymphoid tissues, we inhibited lymphocyte egress from LTs in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RM) during analytic treatment interruption (ATI) using the S1PR modulator FTY720 alone or in combination with anti-PD1 and the IL-15 receptor superagonist N-803 to increase cytolytic function. FTY720 retained migrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in LT, whereas cytotoxic CD8+ T cells remained in the vasculature. After ATI and viral rebound, activated SIV-specific CD8+ T cells increased in frequency in LT of FTY720-treated RM but failed to become cytotoxic or control plasma viremia compared to controls, even when combined with anti-PD1 and N-803. These findings indicate that LT-localized CD8+ T cells alone are insufficient to delay or prevent plasma viral rebound during ATI. Significance Statement HIV therapeutic and cure strategies have all operated under the assumption that CD8+ T cells can become cytotoxic in lymph nodes to eliminate infected cells from reservoir repositories. Using FTY720 to prevent lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes, we demonstrated that lymphoid tissue-restricted CD8+ T cells are insufficient to prevent SIV rebound during antiretroviral treatment interruption, even in the presence of immunomodulators such as IL-15 receptor superagonist and PD-1 blockade. These findings call into question the ability of lymph node CD8+ T cells to control or eliminate SIV/HIV infection from lymphoid tissues without substantial immunomodulation, a notion contrary to current efforts to engage CD8+ T cells for therapeutic elimination of HIV viral reservoirs during ART.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor immune evasion extends beyond T cells, affecting innate immune elements like natural killer cells (NK) and macrophages within the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME). Nevertheless, translational strategies to trigger collaboration of NK cells and macrophages to initiate sufficient anti-tumor cytoxicity remain scarce and are urgently needed. Methods In this study, TCGA datasets was used to confirm the prognosis value of the expression level of NLR family pyrin domain containing 4 (NLRP4) in NSCLC and the tumor tissues microarray was used to further check its clinical-relevance at protein-level. Subsequently, a tumor cell line with stable NLRP4 overexpression was established and subcutaneous tumor models in C57BL/6J mice were used to validate the anti-tumor characteristics of NLRP4. After analyzing the tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence, we further validated our findings through co-culture transwell assays and TCGA analysis. Utilizing bulk-RNA sequencing, proteomics, and mass spectrometry of mouse tumor tissues, we innovatively identified the downstream pathways of NLRP4 and verified them through co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and Western blot (WB) experiments. Results NLRP4 could trigger a distinct anti-tumor ecosystem organized by TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1 in lung cancer, discovered in TCGA analysis and verified in murine model. NLRP4-eco exerted tumor-suppression capacity through chemokine reprogramming including CCL5 and CXCL2. Meanwhile, the cytoxicity of NK could be facilitated by iNOS+M1. Mechanistically, NLRP4 stimulated PI3K/Akt-NF-kB axis through suppression of the activity of PP2A. Besides, knockdown of CCL5 and blockade of CXCL2-CXCR2 axis abolished chemotaxis of TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1 respectively, as well as for LB-100, a PP2A inhibitor. Conclusion Altogether, we delineated NLRP4’s unexplored facets and discovered an NLRP4-driven anti-tumor ecosystem composed of TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1. Finally, targeting PP2A by its inhibitor successfully mimicked the anti-tumor capacity of the overexpression of NLRP4.

        <tr id="In the tumor host, neutrophils may exhibit protumor or antitumor activity. It is hypothesized that in response to host-derived or therapy-induced factors, neutrophils adopt diverse functional states to ultimately execute these differential functions. Here, we provide an alternative scenario in which the response of an individual tumor cell population determines the overall protumor versus antitumor outcome of neutrophil‒tumor interactions. Experimentally, we show that human neutrophils, which are sequentially stimulated with bacteria and secreted factors from tumor cells, kill a certain proportion of tumor target cells. However, the majority of the tumor cells remained resistant to this neutrophil-mediated killing and underwent a functional, phenotypic and transcriptomic switch that was reminiscent of partial epithelial‒to-mesenchymal transition. This cell biological switch was associated with physical escape from NK-mediated killing and resulted in enhanced metastasis to the lymph nodes in a preclinical orthotopic mouse model. Mechanistically, we identified the antimicrobial neutrophil granule proteins neutrophil elastase (NE) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) as the molecular mediators of this functional switch. We validated these data in patients with head and neck cancer and identified bacterially colonized intratumoral niches that were enriched for mesenchymal tumor cells and neutrophils expressing NE and MMP-9. Our data reveal the parallel execution of tumor cytotoxic and prometastatic activity by activated neutrophils and identify NE and MMP-9 as mediators of lymph node metastasis. The identified mechanism explains the functional dichotomy of tumor-associated neutrophils at the level of the tumor target cell response and has implications for superinfected cancers and the dysbiotic tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Cancer cells harbor cell-intrinsic programs capable of sculpting immunogenic landscapes, yet molecular brakes that enforce immune evasion remain poorly defined. Here, we identify C9ORF50, a previously uncharacterized intrinsically disordered protein, as a liquid-liquid phase separation-driven regulator of RNA processing and actionable immunotherapy target. Genetic ablation of C9ORF50 induces selective intron retention in spliceosome component transcripts, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This dsRNA activates type I interferon pathway that in turn orchestrates a chemokine secretory program critical for T cell recruitment. The resultant enhancement of tumor immunogenicity and reprogramming of tumor immune microenvironment drives robust antitumor immunity, effectively converting immunologically “cold” tumors to “hot” phenotypes. Therapeutic targeting of C9ORF50 via RNA interference achieved robust tumor suppression in syngeneic models, suggesting its translational relevance. Notably, C9ORF50 exhibits tumor-predominant expression, with minimal baseline levels detected in healthy tissues or immune cell populations, underscoring its potential safety as a therapeutic target. Our study not only identifies C9ORF50 as a novel LLPS-dependent regulator of RNA splicing but also establishes it as a promising and potentially safe therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex, dynamic ecosystem where tumor cells interact with diverse immune and stromal cell types. This review provides an overview of the TME’s evolving composition, emphasizing its transition from an early pro-inflammatory, immune-promoting state to a later immunosuppressive milieu characterized by metabolic reprogramming and hypoxia. It highlights the dual roles of key immunocytes—including T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells—which can either inhibit or support tumor progression based on their phenotypic polarization and local metabolic conditions. The article further elucidates mechanisms of immune cell plasticity, such as the M1/M2 macrophage switch and the balance between effector T cells and regulatory T cells, underscoring their impact on tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, emerging therapeutic strategies, including checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T and NK cell therapies, as well as approaches targeting metabolic pathways, are discussed as promising avenues to reinvigorate antitumor immunity. By integrating recent molecular insights and clinical advancements, the review underscores the importance of deciphering the interplay between immunocytes and the TME to develop more effective cancer immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy, remains incurable and is highly prone to relapse. Immunosuppressive cells in the bone marrow environment inhibit endogenous T-lymphocytes activity and reduce the efficacy immunotherapies. Abnormal bone marrow monocytes in MM have been associated with inferior outcomes. This study explored the mechanism of T-lymphocytes suppression by bone marrow CD14+ monocytes in MM. Methods Single-cell RNA sequence data (GSE124310) derived from MM samples were analyzed. CD14+ monocytes from the bone marrow of patients with newly-diagnosed MM were detected, and RNA sequencing was performed. Interactions between CD14+ monocytes and T-lymphocytes, as along with the corresponding downstream signaling mechanism, were assessed through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results The alterations in MHC II signaling related to outgoing interaction were decreased in CD14 + monocytes from patients with MM. Abnormal numbers, defective antigen presentation, and downregulated surface co-stimulatory molecules in bone marrow CD14+ monocytes were also observed. RNA sequencing identified upregulated expression of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2 (ULK2) in these monocytes, a protein involved in the antigen processing and presentation pathway. CD14+ monocytes from patients with NDMM suppressed T-lymphocyte activity, and treatment of CD14+ monocytes with a ULK1/ULK2 inhibitor alleviated this suppression. MM xenograft model showed that CD14+ monocytes high-expressing ULK2 suppressed T-lymphocytes and promoted tumor growth. Conclusion We demonstrated that CD14+ monocytes from MM can disrupt the delivery of antigenic peptides through the antigen processing and presentation pathway. This disruption affects T-lymphocytes activity and attenuates their ability to kill malignant cells and secrete cytokines. These findings lay the foundation for understanding the immuno-suppressive environment in MM, improving the efficacy of immunotherapy based on T-lymphocytes, and developing new therapeutic targets.

Here, we performed in-depth analyses of the acute immune response to MTBVAC, a candidate vaccine engineered from Mtb with the aim of protecting adults from pulmonary TB disease, still a major global challenge. scRNA-seq shows expansion of CD4+ and cytotoxic γδ T-cells, data confirmed by flow cytometry.

        <tr id="Trained immunity serves as a de facto memory for innate immune responses, resulting in long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. It enhances resistance to pathogens and augments immunosurveillance under physiological conditions. Given that innate immune cells typically have a short lifespan and do not divide, persistent innate immune memory may be mediated by epigenetic and metabolic changes in long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. HSCs fine-tune their state and fate in various training conditions, thereby generating functionally adapted progeny cells that orchestrate innate immune plasticity. Notably, both beneficial and maladaptive trained immunity processes can comprehensively influence HSC state and fate, leading to divergent hematopoiesis and immune outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize recent advances regarding HSC state and fate in the context of trained immunity. By elucidating the stem cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory network, we aim to refine current models of innate immune memory and provide actionable insights for developing targeted therapies against infectious diseases and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for engineering precision-trained immunity through HSC-targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetic regulators of T cell maturation and exhaustion. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs influence T cell function in tumor environments remain unclear. This study focuses on miR-379-5p, which counteracts T cell exhaustion and enhances antitumor responses. Methods Native CD8+ T cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors and subjected to chronic stimulation to induce exhaustion. RNA sequencing and miRNA sequencing were performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. These miRNAs underwent bioinformatics analyses, including DESeq enrichment, immune cell infiltration assessment, and patient prognostic outcomes in The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets to assess their potential involvement in T cell exhaustion and antitumor immunity. The biological functions of miRNA on T cell differentiation, cytotoxic killing, and immune checkpoint regulation were investigated using in vitro assays, OT-I B16F10-OVA models, and patient-derived tumor organoids. Results MiR-379-5p is downregulated in exhausted T cells and negatively associated with exhausted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in advanced tumors. It correlates positively with better survival outcomes in breast cancer, cervical cancer and melanoma. In CD8+ T cells, miR-379-5p reduces the expression of immune checkpoint proteins T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3) and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) by targeting their 3’ untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-379-5p in CD8+ T cell promotes differentiation into memory-like T effector cells and enhances cytotoxic killing of cancer cells. The transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) with increased expression in exhausted T cells and negatively regulates miR-379, restoring immune checkpoint expression and suppressing cancer-killing ability. In contrast, OT-I T cells expressing ectopic miR-379-5p show increased cytotoxicity against B16F10-OVA tumors in mice. Autologous T cells isolated from patients with breast cancer transduced with miR-379-5p significantly improve killing of tumor organoids derived from the same patients. Conclusions MiR-379-5p acts as an epigenetic tumor suppressor by enhancing CD8+ T cell effector functions and suppressing T cell exhaustion. MiR-379-5p could represent a novel marker and strategy for cancer immunotherapy, offering promising avenues for enhancing antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by immune cell-driven demyelination and progressive neurodegeneration. Senescent cells (SCs) have recently been observed in chronic MS lesions indicating their possible involvement in disease progression. However, the role of SCs and the potential therapeutic benefit of their reduction through senolytic therapy remains to be determined in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely used preclinical model of MS. Here, we show that senescent-like myeloid cells accumulate in the spinal cord parenchyma and meninges in mice after myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG33–55) EAE induction. Treatment with the senolytic cocktail, Dasatinib and Quercetin (DQ), effectively reduces the senescent-like myeloid cells, but this does not translate into improved clinical outcomes in EAE mice. Increasing DQ dosage or using INK-ATTAC transgenic mice also failed to ameliorate EAE severity. Additionally, histopathological analysis shows no significant differences in demyelination or axonal degeneration between treated and control groups. Our findings indicate that senescent-like myeloid cells are present in an immune-mediated demyelinating model of MS and can be reduced through senolytic therapy with Dasatinib and Quercetin. However, their reduction through DQ does not significantly impact inflammation or recovery, suggesting that the therapeutic potential of senolytics as disease-modifying drugs in MS may be limited.

Patients were stratified into mycobiota ecology-depauperate and mycobiota ecology-flourishing (MEF) groups based on fungal abundance. The MEF group had worse prognosis, higher fungal diversity, down-regulated lipid catabolism, and exhausted CD8+ T cells. We developed the intratumoral mycobiota signature and intratumoral mycobiota-related genes expression signature, which robustly predicted prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes in RCC and other cancers. Aspergillus tanneri was identified as a potential key fungal species influencing RCC prognosis.

        <tr id="Despite advances in engineered adaptive immune cell therapies, current options for innate immune cell therapies are sparse. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a neutrophil progenitor-based cell therapy. Murine conditionally-immortalized neutrophil progenitors (NPs) overcome the hurdles of alternative cell therapies by engrafting in the unconditioned host and substantially contributing to the host neutrophil population. Here we demonstrate the therapeutic value of NPs using a murine model of the primary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Those with CGD are highly susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus because of genetic mutations that impair neutrophil antimicrobial function. We find that the prophylactic treatment of CGD mice with transfused NPs rescue them from an otherwise lethal S. aureus pulmonary infection. In investigating the mechanisms behind the improved clearance of S. aureus and survival of CGD mice, our data suggests that the antimicrobial function of host CGD neutrophils is rescued by the presence of donor-derived wild-type neutrophils. We also observe that survival is improved to >50% in the CGD model when mice receive NPs post-infection. This work highlights the application of NPs to improving outcomes to acute bacterial infection in CGD, demonstrating the translational potential of conditionally-immortalized myeloid progenitors as a cellular therapy.">

        <tr id="Understanding flavivirus immunity is critical for the development of pan-flavivirus vaccines. Dendritic cells (DC) coordinate antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses, and they can be targeted by flaviviruses as a mechanism of immune evasion. Using an unbiased genome-wide approach designed to specifically identify flavivirus-modulated pathways, we found that, while dengue virus (DENV) robustly activates DCs, Zika virus (ZIKV) causes minimal activation of genes involved in DC activation, maturation, and antigen presentation, reducing cytokine secretion and the stimulation of allogeneic and peptide-specific T cell responses. Mechanistically, ZIKV inhibits DC maturation by suppressing NF-κB p65 recruitment and the subsequent transcription of proinflammatory and DC maturation-related genes. Thus, we identify a divergence in the effects of ZIKV and DENV on the host T cell response, highlighting the need to factor such differences into the design of anti-flavivirus vaccines.">

While multiple myeloma impacts the bone, it is not classified as a primary bone cancer. The bone marrow microenvironment significantly influences the progression of myeloma and its treatment response. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in this environment engage with myeloma cells and other bone marrow components via direct contact and the secretion of soluble factors. This review examines the established roles of MSCs in multiple facets of MM pathology, encompassing their pro-inflammatory functions, contributions to tumor epigenetics, effects on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), influence on reprogramming, chemotherapy resistance, and senescence. This review investigates the role of MSCs in the development and progression of MM.

        <tr id="Despite the success of cancer immunotherapy in treating hematologic malignancies, their efficacy in solid tumors remains limited due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which is mainly formed by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs not only exert potent immunosuppressive effects that hinder the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and adaptive cellular therapies, but they also promote tumor advancement through non-immunological pathways, including promoting angiogenesis, driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and contributing to the establishment of pre-metastatic environments. While targeting MDSCs alone or in combination with conventional therapies has shown limited success, emerging evidence suggests that MDSC checkpoint blockade in combination with other immunotherapies holds great promise in overcoming both immunological and non-immunological barriers. In this review, we discussed the dual roles of MDSCs, with a particular emphasis on their underexplored checkpoints blockade strategies. We discussed the rationale behind combination strategies, their potential advantages in overcoming MDSC-mediated immunosuppression, and the challenges associated with their development. Additionally, we highlight future research directions aimed at optimizing combination immunotherapies to enhance cancer therapeutic effectiveness, particularly in solid tumor therapies where MDSCs are highly prevalent.">

        <tr id="One of the earliest steps of breast cancer metastasis occurs when tumor cells (TCs) disseminate through the bloodstream. There, they interact with several blood components. Among them, platelet favor TC survival and metastatic spread. While the binding of platelet to TC is highly variable, its molecular controls and downstream consequences remain unidentified. Here, we first document that high CD24 expression correlates with increased platelet binding and poorer survival in breast cancer. We further demonstrate that CD24-mediated platelet binding regulates TC cluster formation and resistance to anoikis in vitro. Depleting CD24 expression significantly reduces TC metastatic potential by rewiring the metastatic tumor microenvironment (mTME), affecting immune compartments and secreted factors. Overall, our work identifies CD24 as a molecular cue controlling TC-platelet interaction, dictating their metastatic potential. As such, it represents a druggable target to counteract platelet-TC collaboration in metastasis.">

Myeloid cells spontaneously home to tumors and can thus be reprogrammed and/or engineered to directly attack tumor cells or locally and selectively deliver therapeutically relevant payloads that may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy against difficult-to-access solid tumors. In the context of myeloid cell-based therapies, adoptive transfer of monocytes has often been overshadowed by infusion of differentiated macrophages or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite their promising therapeutic potential.

        <tr id="The tumour microenvironment (TME) is a highly structured ecosystem that surrounds a tumour and plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis. As one of the most abundant cell types in the TME, tumour-associated-macrophages (TAMs) can promote disease progression and resistance to therapy. Syndecan-3 (SDC3) is a cell-surface heparan sulphate proteoglycan expressed by TAMs, although its functional relevance in these cells remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines drive the expression of SDC3 on the cell surface of macrophages. Genetic ablation of SDC3 in macrophages led to aberrant proliferation, adhesion and expression of CD40 and CD86 surface markers. Moreover, SDC3 defective macrophages exhibited distinctive gene expression patterns, leading to impaired tumour cell phagocytosis and increased tumour cell proliferation. Mechanistically, a decrease in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in SDC3 KO macrophages, concomitant with impaired T cell effector functions. Additionally, a higher angiogenic capacity was observed in endothelial cells when co-cultured with macrophages deficient for SDC3, possibly mediated through an increased release of VEGFA, PECAM-1 and IL-8 by SDC3 KO cells. Collectively, we have identified SDC3 as a modulator of macrophage functions aiming at supporting a pro-inflammatory and anti-tumour phenotype in these cells.

        <tr id="Introduction Due to the historical dogma that host defense against intracellular pathogens is primarily mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have long been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence highlights the multifaceted role of B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. B cells accumulate at the site of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity are still being unraveled. In addition to producing antibodies, B cells secrete a wide range of cytokines that can influence the local immune response. In this study, we focused on the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10)-secreting B cells in the long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Methods B cell-specific IL-10 expression was assessed in IL-10 transcriptional reporter (Vert-X) mice following Mtb infection. To investigate the role of B cell-derived IL-10 in TB immunity, both male and female mice with a targeted knockout of IL-10 in B cells (IL-10flox/CD19cre) were infected with Mtb HN878. Disease progression, control of bacterial replication, and immunological changes were monitored throughout the course of infection. Results B cells contribute to IL-10 production in the Mtb-infected lung in both sexes, with CD138+ plasma cells serving as the primary source of B cell-derived IL-10. Mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 exhibited increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, demonstrated by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was associated with male-specific immune alterations. Conclusion Our research highlights a previously unrecognized sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT People living with HIV (PLWH) exhibit accelerated aging, characterized by systemic inflammation, termed “inflammaging.” While T-cell expansion is prevalent in PLWH, its connection to inflammaging remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the TCRβ repertoire of 257 healthy controls (HC) and 228 PLWH, revealing pronounced T cell clonal expansion in PLWH. The expansion was only partially reversed following antiretroviral therapy (ART) and closely associated with ART duration, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio. TCR-based age modeling showed a continuous accelerated trajectory of aging in PLWH, especially in younger individuals, in stark contrast to the nonlinear aging acceleration pattern seen in HC. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA combined TCR sequencing and in vitro experiments, we identified GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the primary population driving clonal expansion and maintenance in PLWH. These cells are characterized by high cytotoxicity and low exhaustion and are activated by interleukin-15 (IL-15) in vitro. Notably, GNLY+CD8+ T cells predominantly express the pro-inflammatory 15 kDa form of granulysin(GNLY). The supernatant from IL-15-stimulated CD8+ T cells induces monocytes to secrete inflammatory factors and disrupts the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells, which can be partially restored by the anti-GNLY antibodies. These findings identify GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the central drivers of persistent clonal expansion, highlighting their crucial role for mitigating inflammaging in PLWH.">

The expansion of cycling lymphocytes correlates with disease activity and helps to distinguish HLH / MAS from clinical mimics. We demonstrate an approach to quantify CD38+HLA-DR+ cycling lymphocytes and evaluate their utility as a diagnostic biomarker for HLH / MAS. Lastly, we discuss the treatment of MAS, including potential therapeutic options to target these pathogenic lymphocytes.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Mechanisms underlying the T-cell-dependent anti-cancer effect of cyclophosphamide (CTX) are not fully understood. We found that CTX chemotherapy induces long-term survival of mice bearing metastasized breast cancer with chromosomal instability. Given that CTX induces DNA damage and type I interferon (IFN-I) in vivo and that cGAS senses cytosolic double-stranded DNA, we investigated the role of the host cGAS–STING–IFN-I pathway in CTX therapy. We found that CD8+ T cells, the cGAS of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells, the STING of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), and the IFN-I response of non-cDC1 myeloid cells are essential for CTX efficacy. Moreover, the cGAS and STING of BM-derived cells positively modulate intratumoral CD8+ T cell populations. Our study shows that the T-cell-dependent anti-tumor effect of CTX critically involves the cGAS–STING–IFN-I axis, the IFN-I response, and the STING-independent cGAS function of host myeloid cells, which supports the deployment of CTX in treating advanced solid tumors by bypassing the often-failed IFN-I production by tumor cells due to a chronic activation of the intrinsic cGAS–STING caused by chromosomal instability.">

 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a critical treatment for hematologic disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, and specific immune deficiencies. Despite its efficacy, challenges such as engraftment failure and delayed neutrophil regeneration remain significant barriers. These complications lead to prolonged cytopenia, increased risks of infections and other complications, and elevated morbidity and mortality rates. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to play essential roles in supporting hematopoiesis, the precise mechanisms and interactions between MSCs and other cellular components in HSCT require further investigation. Methods To address these challenges, we explored the combined infusion of allotype-cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and activated T cells from the same donor along with third-party MSCs. The study assessed the effects of this triple-cell therapy on neutrophil differentiation and function ex vivo and in vivo. Using a respiratory infection model, we evaluated the accumulation of human neutrophils, cytokine secretion (IL-6 and IL-8), bacterial clearance, and overall survival compared to control groups. Results The triple-cell therapy demonstrated a significant improvement in the differentiation of human HSCs into neutrophils both in ex vivo and in vivo. In the respiratory infection model, this approach resulted in enhanced accumulation of human neutrophils, increased secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, superior bacterial clearance, and reduced mortality rates compared to the control group. These findings highlight the synergistic interplay between allo-HSCs, MSCs, and activated T cells in promoting neutrophil production and function. Conclusions Our study presents a novel therapeutic strategy combining allo-HSCs, activated T cells, and third-party MSCs to enhance neutrophil production and functionality post-transplantation. This approach not only accelerates neutrophil regeneration but also improves resistance to infections, offering a promising avenue to overcome engraftment challenges in HSCT.">

        <tr id="Neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (NATI) significantly prolonged outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Residual tumor cells that survive NATI represent high-risk cell populations with metastatic potential and usually evade immunosurveillance by NK cells. Using an 82-protein panel, we here profiled single-cell membrane proteomics of CD56+ (NCAM1+) NK cells from tumor, peri-cancerous tissue, as well as peripheral blood from 28 TNBC patients post-NATI of residual cancer burden II/III. Unsupervised clustering resulted in several distinct clusters: 2 tumor-infiltrating NK (TINK) clusters with divergent functions of immune activation (TNFRSF7+) and suppression (SELL+); 2 immuno-suppressive peri-cancerous clusters; and 1 periphery-specific cluster. Considering the contradiction of the 2 TINK clusters, we further tested cytokine functions of SELL + and TNFRSF7 + TINKs by single-cell secreting proteomics using a 32-cytokine panel. Consistently, SELL + TINK clusters were characterized by immuno-suppressive secretion patterns (IL10+). A low proportion of SELL + TINK cluster and low proportion of IL10 + secreting SELL + TINK cluster (single-cell secreting proteomics) were both associated with better progression-free survival time. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 15 patients during 16-month follow-up. Overall, we identified a distinct immuno-suppressive TINK cell group, featuring IL10 + secreting and SELL expression with a strong relation to poor survival prognosis in TNBC patients post-NATI.

        <tr id="Purpose of review Mucosal-associated invariant T-cells (MAIT) have been associated with lung cancer and pulmonary infections. The treatment of patients with cancer or infections includes host-directed therapies (HDTs). MAIT play a role in shaping the ‘milieu interne’ in cancer and infections and this review addresses the biology of MAIT in pulmonary pathophysiology. Recent findings MAIT represent an attractive target for therapy in pulmonary malignancies and infections. T-cells are often difficult to exploit therapeutically due to the diversity of both T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and its ligandome. MAIT-cells are restricted by the major histocompatibility complex class I-related gene protein (MR1) that presents nondefined tumor-associated targets, bacterial products, vitamin and drug derivates. Due to their plasticity in gene expression, MAIT are able to conversely switch from IFN-γ to IL-17 production. Both cytokines play a key role in protective immune responses in infections and malignancies. MAIT-derived production of interleukin (IL)-17/TGF-β shapes the tumor micro-environment (TME), including tissue re-modelling leading to pulmonary fibrosis and recruitment of neutrophils. MAIT contribute to the gut-lung axis associated with clinical improved responses of patients with cancer to checkpoint inhibition therapy. MAIT are at the crossroad of HDTs targeting malignant and infected cells. Clinical presentations of overt inflammation, protective immune responses and tissue re-modeling are reviewed along the balance between Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 responses associated with immune-suppression or protective immune responses in infections. Summary MAIT shape the TME in pulmonary malignancies and infections. Drugs targeting the TME and HDTs affect MAIT that can be explored to achieve improved clinical results while curbing overt tissue-damaging immune responses.">

        <tr id="Abstract Melanoma brain metastases (BMs) pose a significant clinical challenge. This commentary highlights the emerging understanding of the mechanisms behind immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) efficacy in melanoma BMs. Specifically, we focus on a recent study by Fife et al, which revealed a non-canonical role for natural killer (NK) cells in shaping the tumor microenvironment following ICB therapy against melanoma BMs. Instead of direct tumor cell killing, this study demonstrates that ICB triggers NK cell chemokine release, CD8 T cell recruitment and enhanced antitumor immunity. The findings from this study highlight that the ICB mechanisms of action are complex and extend beyond the direct interference of inhibitor receptor–ligand interactions between cytotoxic CD8 T cells and tumor cells.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic stem cell transplant and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) are the current standard treatments for patients with aplastic anemia (AA). However, IST also carries significant risks and side effects, and up to 30–50% of patients experienced refractory or relapsed disease following IST. Treating AA remains challenging and novel efficient therapies are in critical need. The IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) plays a crucial role in the T cell response and functions as a regulator of T cell activity. While ITK inhibition has shown promise in various immune-related disorders, its potential role in the pathophysiology of AA has not been thoroughly investigated. We observed elevated level of phosphorylated ITK in T cells from AA patients and AA mouse models. Moreover, we found that both treatment with an ITK inhibitor or conditional depletion of Itk in donor mice alleviated bone marrow hypoplasia, improved cytopenia, and extended survival rates. Notably, ITK inhibition orchestrates T cell quantity and function by reducing T cell infiltration and suppressing the secretion of key inflammatory cytokines in AA mice. Our data suggest that ITK inhibitor could potentially offer a new therapeutic strategy for AA.

        <tr id="Th17 cells can perform either regulatory or inflammatory functions depending on the cytokine microenvironment. These plastic cells can transdifferentiate into Tregs during inflammation resolution, in allogenic heart transplantation models, or in cancer through mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that NLRP3 expression in Th17 cells is essential for maintaining their immunosuppressive functions through an inflammasome-independent mechanism. In the absence of NLRP3, Th17 cells produce more inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, Granzyme B, TNFα) and exhibit reduced immunosuppressive activity toward CD8+ cells. Moreover, the capacity of NLRP3-deficient Th17 cells to transdifferentiate into Treg-like cells is lost. Mechanistically, NLRP3 in Th17 cells interacts with the TGF-β receptor, enabling SMAD3 phosphorylation and thereby facilitating the acquisition of immunosuppressive functions. Consequently, the absence of NLRP3 expression in Th17 cells from tumor-bearing mice enhances CD8 + T-cell effectiveness, ultimately inhibiting tumor growth.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors, enhancing clinical outcomes by releasing T cells from inhibitory effects of receptors like programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Despite these advancements, achieving durable antitumor responses remains challenging, often due to additional immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute significantly to the immunosuppressive TME and play a pivotal role in shaping T cell-mediated antitumor responses. Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2), expressed on myeloid cells, including TAMs, is an inhibitory receptor, which contributes to macrophage-mediated immunosuppression. In this study, we present AZD2796, a high-affinity anti-LILRB2 antibody designed to repolarize TAMs from an immunosuppressive to a proinflammatory phenotype. Methods Anti-LILRB2 antibodies were identified using single-B-cell encapsulation Immune Replica technology. The ability of AZD2796 to enhance proinflammatory responses from macrophages treated with CD40 ligand or lipopolysaccharide was assessed using a macrophage stimulation assay. A tumor cell/macrophage/T cell co-culture assay was developed to evaluate the effect of AZD2796, as a single agent and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody, on the cytolytic activity of antigen-specific T cells. In vivo assessments were then carried out to determine the ability of AZD2796 to alter tumor growth rate in mice humanized with CD34 hematopoietic stem cells. Results In preclinical assessments, AZD2796 skewed macrophage differentiation away from an immunosuppressive phenotype and enhanced the proinflammatory function of macrophages. AZD2796 significantly increased the anti-tumor response of T cells following PD-1 checkpoint blockade, while AZD2796 monotherapy reduced tumor growth in humanized mouse models. Conclusions These findings support the potential of AZD2796 as an anti-cancer therapy, with the ability to synergize with T-cell-based therapeutics.">

        <tr id="The paradigm in the field of oncolytic virotherapy proposes that tumor cell killing by an oncolytic virus (OV) culminates in the priming of antitumor CD8 T cells. However, this ignores the impact a highly immunodominant antiviral response against the OV has on the antitumor response which has been weakened by mechanisms of central tolerance. Here, we show that inflammatory Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) failed to prime an adoptively transferred, or pre-existing, population of tumor-reactive T cells. Combination with αPD1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy improved survival only when VSV expressed tumor associated antigens (TAA). These data show that, in this model, the highly inflammatory OV VSV alone actively outcompetes antitumor immunity. However, we also show that viral expression of a mutant near-self TAA can break central tolerance expanding heteroclitic self-reactive and near-self-reactive T cells, thus overcoming viral immunodominance by promoting tumor-specific T cell proliferation in parallel with expanding antiviral T cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited by heterogeneity in individual responses to therapy. The heterogeneous phenotypes and crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in immunotherapy resistance remain largely unclear. Methods A specific CAF subset was identified by integrating comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and transcriptome profiling of patients with HCC with different responses to antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. Mouse orthotopic HCC models and a coculture system were constructed, and cytometry by time-of-flight analysis was performed to investigate the functions and mechanisms of specific CAFs in the immune context of HCC. Results We identified a distinct flavin-containing monooxygenase 2 (FMO2)+ CAF subset associated with a favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy and better clinical outcomes. FMO2+ CAFs increase anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy by promoting tertiary lymphoid structure formation and increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and M1-like macrophages through the C-C motif chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19)-C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 axis. Mechanistically, FMO2 promotes nuclear factor kappa B/p65-mediated CCL19 expression by competitively binding to glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) with praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 1 (PJA1), thereby suppressing the PJA1-mediated proteasomal degradation of GYS1. CCL19 treatment potentiated the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in mouse orthotopic HCC models. A favorable immunotherapy response was observed in patients with HCC with high serum levels of CCL19. Conclusions We identified a novel FMO2+ CAF subset that serves as a critical regulator of microenvironmental immune properties and a predictive biomarker of the immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. CCL19 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.">

        <tr id="Background. B cells play a crucial role in kidney transplantation through antibody production and cytokine secretion. To better understand their impact on kidney transplantation, this retrospective study aimed to characterize circulating B-cell phenotypes and cytokine production in a cohort of kidney transplant patients to identify whether pretransplant donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) or biopsy-proven rejection is associated with different B-cell profiles. Methods. Pretransplant cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 96 kidney transplant recipients, of whom 42 had pretransplant DSAs. The cells underwent surface marker staining using a 33-color spectral flow cytometry panel for B-cell phenotyping. Simultaneously, cells were stimulated for interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 production, and analyzed with a 6-color panel. Results. Rejection was linked to decreased naive B cells and increased plasmablasts, CD27+ memory B cells, and memory B-cell subsets (all P < 0.04) compared with no rejection. Cytokine-producing B cells and immune regulatory molecule expression showed no significant differences. Multivariate analysis identified resting memory B cells (CD27+CD21+) and pretransplant DSAs as significantly associated with rejection (P = 0.01; odds ratio [OR], 1.07; P = 0.02; OR, 3.10, respectively). Cox regression analysis revealed resting memory B cells were associated with early antibody-mediated rejection (P = 0.04; OR, 1.05). Conclusions. B-cell subset distributions differed between patients with and without rejection. Resting memory B-cell frequency was associated with increased early antibody-mediated rejection risk, whereas cytokine production and immune checkpoint expression did not influence rejection. The results suggest that B-cell subset composition could aid in rejection risk assessment and serve as a potential pretransplant diagnostic parameter.">

        <tr id="Recipients’ age has emerged as a key factor that impacts on acute renal allograft rejection and graft survival. Age-related functional and structural changes in the immune system have been observed, yet the precise influence of aged immunity on kidney transplant remains unclear. In an initial retrospective analysis of clinical data gathered from two major centers in China and Germany, we found a correlation between aging and mitigated rejection outcomes in kidney recipients. To study the mechanism, we performed kidney transplantation on mice and observed attenuated allograft rejection in senescent recipients. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of allograft kidneys indicated a protective role of p21high macrophages in aged mice. Supernatant collected from p21high macrophage primary culture inhibited the cytotoxic function and proliferation of CD8+ T cells. Zfp36 is highly expressed in senescent p21high macrophages. To determine its role in renal allograft rejection, we studied mice with Zfp36 conditionally deleted in macrophages (Zfp36-cKO). These mice developed exacerbated allograft rejection with enhanced IL-27 production and CD8+ T cell hyperactivation. Inhibition of IL-27 with neutralizing antibody or deletion of IL-27 receptor on CD8+ T cells reversed acute renal allograft rejection in Zfp36-cKO mice. Moreover, in vitro silencing Zfp36 with siRNA led to impaired degradation of IL-27 p28 mRNA and a subsequent increase of IL-27 in p21high macrophages. In conclusion, senescent macrophages protect renal allograft rejection by suppressing CD8+ T cells via a Zfp36/IL-27-dependent mechanism.

        <tr id="Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the proliferation of dysfunctional B cells, resulting in significant immune dysregulation. Patients with CLL exhibit varied responses to B cell receptor (BCR) targeted therapies, emphasizing the need for tailored immunotherapy approaches. This study investigated B cell function in untreated patients with CLL, and we further explored the effects of ex vivo protein kinase C activation on immune checkpoint expression and B cell profiles. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 21 untreated patients with CLL at King Edward Hospital in South Africa, between 2019 and 2022. B cells were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. Using flow cytometry, the study explored the levels of B cell subsets and immune checkpoint proteins programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) expression on various B cell subsets. Results: PMA and ionomycin B cell stimulation upregulated PD-1, CTLA-4 and PD-L2 expression on B cell subsets (p < 0.01). As expected, monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 significantly downregulated the CTLA-4 expression of B cell subsets (p < 0.05), while PD-L2 exhibited varied responses in different B cell subsets. Moreover, PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on total B cells significantly declined following their blockage (p < 0.01). In addition, these monoclonal antibodies increased the levels of CD19+CD27+ B cells (p < 0.0128) and activated CD19+CD27+ B cells (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Protein kinase C activation on B cells stimulates immune checkpoint expression. The use of monoclonal antibodies on B cells plays a critical role in the B cell function through the reduction in CD38 expressing activated B cells and upregulation of CD19+CD27+ B cells. Moreover, the monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 are effective in reducing the expression of CTLA-4 on B cell subsets, while PD-1 and PD-L1 blockage may be effective in reducing the expression of these immune checkpoints on total B cells.">

        <tr id="Newborns exhibit a heightened vulnerability to inflammatory disorders due to their underdeveloped immune system, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report that plasma spermidine is correlated with the maturity of human newborns and reduced risk of inflammation. Administration of spermidine led to the remission of neonatal inflammation in mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that spermidine enhanced the generation of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) via downstream eIF5A hypusination. Genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS), a key enzyme of hypusinated eIF5A (eIF5AHyp), diminished the immunosuppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs, leading to aggravated neonatal inflammation. The eIF5AHyp pathway was found to enhance the immunosuppressive function via histone acetylation–mediated epigenetic transcription of immunosuppressive signatures in PMN-MDSCs. These findings demonstrate the spermidine-eIF5AHyp metabolic axis as a master switch to restrict neonatal inflammation.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic killing is an essential immune function, yet its cellular mechanisms have been characterized in only a few model species. Here, we show that planarian flatworms harness a unique cytotoxic strategy. In planarians, activin, a hormone regulating regeneration and reproduction, also acts as an inflammatory cytokine. Overactivation of activin signaling – through protein injection, genetic chimerism, or bacterial infection – triggers ‘ruptoblasts’, an undocumented immune cell type, to undergo ‘ruptosis’, a unique mode of cell bursting that eliminates nearby cells and bacteria in mere minutes, representing one of the fastest cytotoxic mechanisms observed. Ablating ruptoblasts suppresses inflammation but compromises bacterial clearance, highlighting ruptoblasts’ broad-spectrum immune functions. We further identified ruptoblast-like cells in diverse basal bilaterians, unveiling an alternative strategy that couples hormonal regulation with immune defense and expanding the landscape of evolutionary immune innovations.">

        <tr id="Myeloid cells are a major component of immune cells infiltrating tumors, interacting with each other, with tumor cells and other stromal cells, and demonstrating a prominent plasticity. Neutrophils, as a population of such cells, contribute to cancer progression via multiple mechanisms, including stimulation of angiogenesis and the regulation of adaptive immune responses. Importantly, neutrophils were demonstrated to be associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with different kinds of cancer, including head and neck cancer, renal cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma or melanoma. Enrichment of neutrophils was also associated with metastases in various tumor entities. 
Activity of neutrophils strongly depends on the cytokines or growth factors present in the microenvironment. Since these cells are highly plastic and their functionality can be easily altered, they are ideal target for anti-tumor therapies. Since we observe that elevated STAT3 is associated with pro-tumoral activity of neutrophils, we tested here the approach to functionally reprogram these cells by the inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway. We could show that such STAT3 inhibition solely in neutrophils led to decreased tumor growth and metastasis in cancer, which was accompanied by a significant expansion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Comprehensive multiparameter analyses of tumors and TDLNs revealed a significant enrichment of CD8+ T cell subsets with strongly cytotoxic activity, which effectively killed cancer cells in vitro. These findings provide novel insights in therapeutic avenues and suggest neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition as a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains a challenging disease with a dismal prognosis. Despite the revolutionary impact of CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19)-T cell therapy, >50% of patients relapse within a year. Both leukemia cell-intrinsic factors favoring immune escape and poor CAR-T cell persistence contribute significantly to clinical failure. Moreover, the expression of immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) and their ligands within the complex bone marrow (BM) microenvironment may contribute to leukemia progression and therapy resistance. Here, we comprehensively characterized the expression of ICRs and their ligands in leukemic blasts, T cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from B-ALL BM samples at diagnosis (n=47) and relapse (n=38), comparing them with age-matched healthy BM controls. Our findings reveal a significant upregulated expression of TIM-3 in T cells, and its ligand galectin-9 in both blasts and MSCs throughout disease progression. The expression levels of galectin-9 in B-ALL blasts and TIM-3 in CAR19-T cells negatively correlate with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that galectin-9 impairs CAR19-T cell homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Notably, an engineered TIM-3-Fc decoy receptor, delivered either by primary T cells co-administered with CAR19-T cells or via a bicistronic all-in-one CAR19-TIM-3-Fc construct, improved the anti-leukemia efficacy and persistence of CAR19-T cells in B-ALL patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, CAR19-TIM-3-Fc-T cell treatment promotes the in vivo expansion of both transduced and bystander effector and memory T cells, as determined by spectral flow cytometry. Collectively, these potent and persistent TIM-3-Fc decoy-armored CAR19-T cells offer a promising therapeutic strategy for R/R B-ALL patients.">

        <tr id="Chronic inflammation is a well-established risk factor for cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using a mouse model of colitis, we demonstrate that colonic stem cells retain an epigenetic memory of inflammation following disease resolution, characterized by a cumulative gain of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor activity. Further, we develop SHARE-TRACE, a method that enables simultaneous profiling of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and clonal history in single cells, enabling high resolution tracking of epigenomic memory. This reveals that inflammatory memory is propagated cell-intrinsically and inherited through stem cell lineages, with certain clones demonstrating dramatically stronger memory than others. Finally, we show that colitis primes stem cells for amplified expression of regenerative gene programs following oncogenic mutation that accelerate tumor growth. This includes a subpopulation of tumors that have exceptionally high AP-1 activity and the additional upregulation of pro-oncogenic programs. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic link between chronic inflammation and malignancy, revealing how long-lived epigenetic alterations in regenerative tissues may contribute to disease susceptibility and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate cancer risk in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Chronic inflammation in autoimmunity is driven by T cell hyperactivation. This unregulated response to self is fuelled by heightened metabolic programmes, which offers a promising new direction to uncover novel treatment strategies. α/β-hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase that maintains the catalytic function of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH), and its expression in CD4+ T cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the importance of ABHD11 in regulating T cell metabolism and function – and thus, the downstream implication for autoimmunity – is yet to be explored. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ABHD11 dampens cytokine production by human and mouse T cells. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory effects of ABHD11 inhibition are attributed to increased 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) biosynthesis and subsequent liver X receptor (LXR) activation, which arise from a compromised TCA cycle. The impaired cytokine profile established by ABHD11 inhibition is extended to two patient cohorts of autoimmunity. Importantly, using a murine model of accelerated type 1 diabetes (T1D), we show that targeting ABHD11 suppresses cytokine production in antigen-specific T cells and delays the onset of diabetes in vivo. Collectively, our work provides pre-clinical evidence that ABHD11 is an encouraging drug target in T cell-mediated autoimmunity. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has made important breakthroughs in cancer treatment, however, currently only parts of cancer patients benefit from ICB therapy. The suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) impedes the treatment response of immunotherapy, indicating the necessity to explore new treatment targets. Here, we reported a new potential immunotherapeutic target, Dickkopf-3 (DKK3), for cancer treatment. DKK3 expression is up-regulated in the tumors from multiple cancer types, and high DKK3 expression is associated with worse survival outcome across different cancers. We observed that DKK3 directly inhibits the activation of CD8+ T cells and the Th1 differentiation of CD4+ T cells ex vivo. Also, by establishing four different mouse cancer models, we found that DKK3 blockade triggers effective anti-tumor effects and improve the survival of tumor-bearing mice in vivo. DKK3 blockade also remodels the suppressive TIME of different cancer types, including the increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells, IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells, Th1 cells, and decreased infiltration of M2 macrophages and MDSCs in the TIME. Moreover, we found that combined blockade of DKK3 and PD-1 induces synergistic tumor-control effect in our mouse cancer model. Therefore, our study reveals the impact of DKK3 in the TIME and cancer progression, which suggests that DKK3 is a novel and promising immunotherapeutic target for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background: The chaotic, over-activated tumor vasculature promotes tumor growth and erodes most current therapies. Although Notch activation critically regulates angiogenesis, the broad roles of Notch has dampened its druggability. Methods: Gene-modified mice with a Cdh5-CreERT transgene were employed to activate/block Notch signaling in endothelial cells (ECs). Multiple transcriptome analyses were conducted to compare gene expression profiles. qRT-PCR and western blotting were used to determine gene expression level. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to observe morphological alterations and immune microenvironment in tumors. Nanoparticles (PEI-PEG-cRGD) were used to deliver siRNA into tumor ECs (TECs) in vivo. Results: Genetic Notch activation or blockade in TECs normalizes or deteriorates tumor vessels, respectively. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that Notch activation selectively reduced the proliferating TEC subset, which accounted for about 30% of TECs and gave rise to other TEC subsets. Notch activation or blockade downregulated or upregulated MYC, respectively. MYC overexpression canceled Notch activation-induced proliferation arrest of TECs in vitro, and a MYC inhibitor normalized tumor vessels in RBPj deficient mice, suggesting that MYC is the authentic Notch target in normalizing tumor vessels. Nanoparticles encapsulated with MYC siRNA (EC-siMYC) or miR-218 (EC-miR-218), a Notch-downstream miRNA suppressing MYC, were able to mitigate Notch inhibition-induced tumor vessel defects. Combination of cisplatin with MYC blockade exhibited improved therapeutic effects. Moreover, MYC blockade promoted T cell infiltration and enhanced anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Conclusions: Together, our data have demonstrated that Notch activation normalizes tumor vessels by repressing the proliferating TEC subset via MYC, and targeting endothelial MYC using nanoparticles bearing siRNA or miRNA is an efficient strategy for tumor anti-angiogenic therapy.">

        <tr id="γδT cells represent a unique and versatile subset of T cells characterized by the expression of T-cell receptors (TCRs) composed of γ and δ chains. Unlike conventional αβT cells, γδT cells do not require major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-dependent antigen presentation for activation, enabling them to recognize and respond to a wide array of antigens, including phosphoantigens, stress-induced ligands, and tumor-associated antigens. While γδT cells are relatively rare in peripheral blood, they are enriched in peripheral tissues such as the skin, intestine, and lung. These cells play a crucial role in tumor immunotherapy by exerting direct cytotoxicity through the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-17 (IL-17)) and cytotoxic molecules (e.g., perforin and granzyme). Recent advances in γδT cell research have elucidated their mechanisms of tumor recognition, including the detection of phosphoantigens and stress-induced ligands like MICA (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A), MICB (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B), and ULBP (UL16-binding protein). Furthermore, various strategies to enhance γδT cell-based tumor immunotherapy have been developed, such as in vitro expansion using phosphoantigen-based therapies, cytokine stimulation, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-γδT cell engineering. These advancements have shown promising results in both preclinical and clinical settings, paving the way for γδT cells to become a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy. This review highlights the key mechanisms, functions, and strategies to harness the potential of γδT cells for effective tumor immunotherapy.">

Initially, it was thought to be limited to that of a source of fast but lower‐quality antibodies until the GC can form. However, recent evidence strongly supports the EF response as an important component of the humoral response to infection. EF responses are now also recognized as a source of pathogenic B cells in autoimmune diseases. The EF response itself is dynamic and regulated by pathways that are only recently being uncovered. We have identified that the cytokine IL‐12 acts as a molecular switch, enhancing the EF response and suppressing GC through multiple mechanisms. These include direct effects on both B cells themselves and the coordinated differentiation of helper CD4 T cells. Here, we explore this pathway in relation to other recent advancements in our understanding of the EF response's role and highlight areas for future research. A better understanding of how the EF response forms and is regulated is essential for advancing treatments for many disease states.">

        <tr id="γδ T cells are a unique subset of unconventional T cells and an important component of the innate immune system. Unlike conventional αβ T cells, γδ T cells can respond rapidly during the early stages of infection, and their antigen recognition is not restricted by MHC molecules. These distinctive features underscore the important role of γδ T cells in viral clearance and infection control. Therefore, γδ T cell-based immunotherapies have been extensively explored for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including viral infections and cancers. Several therapeutic strategies based on γδ T cells have advanced to clinical trials, demonstrating promising safety and efficacy. Currently, there are no effective treatments for flavivirus infections, which are typically characterized by acute onset. Research has shown that γδ T cells can rapidly expand during the early phases of flavivirus infections and effectively suppress viral replication, making them an attractive target for the development of novel therapies for flavivirus infections. This review aims to highlight the immunological roles of γδ T cells in flavivirus infections and to explore the potential of γδ T cell-based therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of these infections.">

        <tr id="Background Flagellin, a potent mucosal adjuvant administered via the intranasal route, has been widely recognized for its capacity to enhance immune responses against diverse pathogens. However, the effects and the underlying mechanisms by which flagellin modulates CD4+ T cell differentiation remain incompletely understood. Methods Recombinant flagellin proteins, including full-length flagellin (SF) and a TLR5-binding deficient variant (SFΔ90–97), were produced and purified. An OT-II derived CD4+ T cell adoptive transfer model, a classical intranasal immunization model and dendritic cell (DC)-CD4+ T co-culturing system were used. The proliferation and differentiation of CD4+ T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry analysis. RNA sequencing and neutralizing antibody blocking experiments were performed to determine the essential cytokines involved in flagellin modulated Th17 differentiation. Results Flagellin preferentially promotes Th17 cells differentiation. Respiratory epithelial cells (RECs), acting as sentinel cells, are the first to encounter exogenous stimuli during intranasal immunization. Flagellin stimulates the secretion of various soluble cytokines by binding to TLR5 on the surface of RECs, with GM-CSF facilitating the functional activation of airway DCs. GM-CSF-conditioned DCs exhibit upregulated IL-6 expression which in turn drives the polarization of naïve CD4+ T cells toward the Th17 phenotype. Furthermore, TLR5-regulated REC-derived IL-6 synergizes with TLR5-modulated DCs to amplify Th17 polarization signals, thereby enhancing the Th17 induction. Conclusion Flagellin preferentially induced a Th17-enhanced immune response and RECs were highlighted its essential roles during this process through both indirect and direct pathways. For indirect pathway, RECs modulate DC function through GM-CSF. Moreover, RECs directly contribute to Th17 differentiation by secreting IL-6.

        <tr id="Background CD169+ macrophages in lymph nodes (LNs) activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which play a crucial role in anticancer immunity, through antigen presentation and co-stimulation by CD169. Interferon alpha (IFNα) is capable of inducing the CD169+ phenotype of macrophages; however, its clinical applications have been hindered by pharmacokinetic limitations—low LN distribution and an inability to target macrophages. To overcome these issues, this study genetically fused mouse IFNα (mIFNα) with mannosylated mouse serum albumin (Man-MSA), and investigated the antitumor effects of the hybrid protein (Man-MSA-mIFNα) or its add-on effects with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade. Methods To confirm the possibility of CD169+ macrophage-mediated T cell priming, positional information about individual immune cells in LNs of cancer patients was obtained. Traits of Man-MSA-mIFNα, which was prepared using Pichia pastoris to form the high-mannose structure, were characterized by several physicochemical methods. To evaluate the lymphatic drainage of Man-MSA-mIFNα, radioiodine or Cy5-labeled Man-MSA-mIFNα was subcutaneously administered in mice, and then the radioactivity or fluorescence in LNs was analyzed. CD169-diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor (CD169-DTR) mice in which LN CD169+ macrophages can be depleted by DT injection were used to verify whether the antitumor effect of Man-MSA-mIFNα is dependent on LN CD169+ macrophages. Results Multiplex tissue imaging predicted close proximity of CD169+ macrophages and T cells and positive correlation between the number of CD169+ macrophages and T cells in neighborhoods in LNs of cancer patients. Physicochemical analyses showed that Man-MSA-mIFNα was formed from the fusion of the intact Man-MSA and mIFNα. Man-MSA-mIFNα efficiently induced the CD169+ phenotype of macrophages by its high LN distribution and macrophage-targeting capability, and significantly exerted antitumor activity through CD8+ T cell activation in the LNs, whereas its antitumor effects were canceled in CD169-DTR mice. Finally, combination therapy with PD-L1 blockade markedly suppressed tumor growth in MB49-bearing mice, which exhibit resistance to PD-L1 blockade monotherapy. Conclusions The present study successfully designed and developed Man-MSA-mIFNα, which efficiently induces the CD169+ phenotype in LN macrophages, contributing to the antitumor immunity. The findings suggest that our novel strategy targeting CD169⁺ macrophages could be a promising immunotherapy for cancer patients who are unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal cancer of the central nervous system, presenting substantial treatment challenges. The current standard treatment, which includes surgical resection followed by temozolomide and radiation, offers limited success. While immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have proven effective in other cancers, they have not demonstrated significant efficacy in GBM. Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in supporting tumor growth, fostering treatment resistance, and shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Preclinical studies show promising results for therapies targeting TAMs, suggesting potential in overcoming these barriers. TAMs consist of brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, both exhibiting diverse phenotypes and functions within the tumor microenvironment. This review delves into the origin, heterogeneity, and functional roles of TAMs in GBM, underscoring their dual roles in tumor promotion and suppression. It also summarizes recent progress in TAM-targeted therapies, which may, in combination with other treatments like immunotherapy, pave the way for more effective and personalized strategies against this aggressive malignancy.">

The TME plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulating processes such as cancer cell migration, proliferation, tumor vascularization, and the modulation of anti-cancer immune responses. 2 Effects of the TME are partially mediated by secreted factors, including exosomes, metabolites, cytokines, chemokines, and a remodeled extracellular matrix produced by CAFs, which profoundly in ﬂ uence cancer progression. 2 Numerous studies revealed that the TME plays a pivotal role in modulating anti-cancer immune responses, either promoting or suppressing these processes in a manner that appears highly context-dependent. 3 Effective immune responses against cancer cells basically involve three different key mechanisms. (i) tumor-antigen-speci ﬁ c CD8 + T cells are activated in draining lymph nodes and then (ii) recruited into the tumor. (iii) Recruited CD8 + T cells are maintained in an activated state within specialized niches in the TME. 1 The TME controls these mechanisms through multiple pathways.

        <tr id="The potential of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination against cancer is not fully achieved. Little is known about the precise nature of the anti-cancer immune response triggered by different natural DC subsets and their relevance in preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence. Here, we use mouse splenic conventional DC1s (cDC1s) or cDC2s pulsed with tumor cell lysates to generate DC vaccines. cDC1-based vaccination induces a stronger effector and memory CD4+ and CD8+ anti-tumor T cell response, leading to a better control of tumors treated either therapeutically or prophylactically. Using an experimental model of tumor relapse, we show that adjuvant or neoadjuvant cDC1 vaccination improves anti-tumor immune memory, particularly by increasing the infiltrates of CD4+ tissue resident memory (Trm) and CD8+ memory T cells. This translates into complete prevention of tumor relapses. Moreover, elevated abundance of cDC1s positively correlates with CD4+ Trm presence, and both associate with enhanced survival in human breast cancer and melanoma. Our findings suggest that cDC1-based vaccination excels at immune memory induction and prevention of cancer recurrence.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal disease with an unknown etiology and complex pathophysiology that are not fully understood. The disease involves intricate cellular interplay, particularly among various immune cells. Currently, there is no treatment capable of reversing the fibrotic process or aiding lung regeneration. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has demonstrated antifibrotic properties, whereas the adoptive transfer of modified T cells is a well‐established treatment for various malignancies. We aimed to understand the dynamics of T cells in the progression of lung fibrosis and to study the therapeutic benefit of adoptive T cell transfer in a bleomycin‐injured mouse lung (BLM) model. Methods T cells were isolated from the spleen of naïve mice and transfected in vitro with mouse HGF plasmid and were administered intratracheally to the mice lungs 7 days post‐bleomycin injury to the lung. Lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage were collected and analyzed using flow cytometry, histology, qRT‐PCR, ELISA, and hydroxyproline assay. Results Our findings demonstrate the successful T cell therapy of bleomycin‐induced lung injury through the adoptive transfer of HGF‐transfected T cells in mice. This treatment resulted in decreased collagen deposition and a balancing of immune cell exhaustion and cytokine homeostasis compared with untreated controls. In vitro testing showed enhanced apoptosis in myofibroblasts induced by HGF‐overexpressing T cells.

        <tr id="In a recent study published in Nature , Breart et al. 1 untangled the controversy surrounding interleukin (IL)-27 ’ s role in regulating T cell differentiation and immune responses in cancer. Their ﬁ ndings reveal that IL-27 enhances the persistence and effector functions of tumor-in ﬁ ltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes (TILs), preventing exhaustion, sustaining T cell-dependent tumor control and immunotherapy ef ﬁ cacy without signi ﬁ cant systemic side effects. Effective immune control of cancer relies on the ability of T lymphocytes to in ﬁ ltrate tumors and exert their cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, surviving neoplastic cells promptly adapt to immune-patrolled environments and evolve under immune system pressure to progressively avoid immune clearance, establishing immune-privileged conditions that sustain limitless growth. These immune evasive strategies are deployed in 3 main routes: “ camou ﬂ age ” (reduced immunogenicity and immune exclusion), “ coercion ” (impaired local immune activation through the establishment of a highly immunosuppressive tumor micro-environment [TME]), “ cytoprotection ” (avoiding neoplastic cell killing through intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms). 2 Therapeutic approaches targeting immune checkpoints and aiming to restore cancer immune surveillance signi ﬁ cantly improved the survival and life quality of cancer patients, although their ef ﬁ cacy is restricted to a fraction of patients and tumor types.

        <tr id="Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) play a crucial role in modulating tumor immune responses and influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, our current understanding of the microenvironment within these lymph nodes remains limited. Tumors not only impair the anti-tumor activity of CD8+ T cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment, but they also facilitate immune evasion and promote metastasis by altering the structure and function of TDLNs. Research has shown that tumor-specific memory CD8+ T cells (TTSM) within TDLNs are essential for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockers. Moreover, the abnormal structure of TDLNs, along with the presence of immunosuppressive cells—such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), and immunosuppressive dendritic cells (DCs)—contributes to tumor-mediated immune evasion. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the immune microenvironment within TDLNs is essential for improving the effectiveness of immunotherapies and developing novel therapeutic strategies. This review explores various TDLN-based therapeutic strategies, addressing the controversies surrounding lymph node dissection, the use of TDLNs as a source of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for therapy, targeting immunosuppressive cells within TDLNs, and methods to reverse the structural abnormalities of TDLNs.

        <tr id="Allogeneic cell-based immunotherapies, particularly CAR-T cell therapy, represent a significant advancement in cancer treatment, offering scalable and consistent alternatives to autologous therapies. However, their widespread use is limited by the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). This review provides a comprehensive overview of GvHD in the context of allogeneic cell-based cancer immunotherapy and evaluates current strategies to mitigate its effects. Key strategies include genetic engineering approaches such as T cell receptor (TCR) knockout (KO) and T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) CAR knock-in. Alternative immune cell types like natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells offer potential solutions due to their lower alloreactivity. Additionally, stem cell technology, utilizing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), enables standardized and scalable production of engineered CAR-T cells. Clinical trials evaluating these strategies, such as UCART19 and CTX110, demonstrate promising results in preventing GvHD while maintaining anti-tumor efficacy. The review also addresses manufacturing considerations for allogeneic cell products and the challenges in translating preclinical findings into clinical success. By addressing these challenges, allogeneic cell-based immunotherapy continues to advance, paving the way for more accessible, scalable, and effective cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Background The role of T cell immunity during antineoplastic therapy is poorly understood. In the BEGYN-1 study, patients with breast cancer underwent quarterly assessments prior to and during antineoplastic therapy over a period of 12 months. Methods We used flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassays to quantify 25 T cell subpopulations and seven T cell associated plasma cytokines in peripheral blood from 92 non-metastatic breast cancer patients, respectively. In addition, the association between T cell dynamics and the outcome of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy was investigated. Results In patients undergoing chemotherapy, a significant reduction in T helper (Th) cells, particularly naïve central and effector cells and thymus positive Th cells, was observed over time. Interestingly, Th1 immune response-associated cytokines (IL-12, TNF, IFN-γ) declined while Th2 cells and cytotoxic T cells increased over time. Conclusions We conclude that in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy is associated with a transition from a Th1 immune response towards Th2 and an increase in cytotoxic T cells, whereas in patients without chemotherapy, these alterations were less pronounced. Future studies should clarify whether patterns of T cell subsets or plasma cytokines can be used as biomarkers to monitor or even improve therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), professional type I interferon (IFN) producing cells, have been implicated in host responses against bacterial infections. However, their role in host defense is debated and the operating molecular mechanisms are unknown. Certain Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule Family (SLAMF) members act as microbial sensors and modulate immune functions in response to infection. Here by analyzing multiple human blood transcriptomic datasets, we report the involvement of SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 in many infectious diseases, with elevated levels associated with type I IFN responses in salmonellosis and brucellosis patients. We further identify SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 as key regulators of human pDC function. Silencing of these receptors hinders pDC maturation and abrogates cytokine production during infection with acute (Salmonella) or chronic (Brucella) inflammation-inducing bacteria. Mechanistically, we show that SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 signal through NF-κB, IRF7 and STAT-1, and limit mitochondrial ROS accumulation upon Salmonella infection. This SLAMF7/8-dependent control of mitochondrial ROS levels favors bacterial persistence and NF-κB activation. Overall, our results unravel essential shared roles of SLAMF7 and SLAMF8 in finely tuning human pDC responses to intracellular bacterial infections with high diagnosis and therapeutic perspectives.">

        <tr id="Background: α-Galactosylceramide (α-Galcer), a specific ligand for invariant natural killer T (NKT) cell activation, has been actively investigated in clinical trials such as antitumor therapy; however, treatment with α-Galcer is well known to induce acute hepatitis due to enriched NKT cells in the liver. The molecular mechanisms underlying NKT-mediated hepatitis still remain obscure. The object of this study was to investigate whether and how myeloid cells affect NKT-mediated hepatitis. Methods: α-Galcer–induced NKT hepatitis was used in this study. microRNA-223 (miR-223) and neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 (Ncf1)–deficent mice were generated and subjected to α-Galcer–induced NKT hepatitis. Results: In this study, we demonstrated that α-Galcer–induced NKT cell activation resulted in neutrophil and monocyte-derived macrophage accumulation in the liver. Importantly, serum levels of several hepatic myeloid cell infiltration–related cytokines and chemokines were significantly elevated after α-Galcer administration. Among these myeloid cells, blockade of neutrophil or macrophage migration through using different inhibitors of (C-X-C Motif) receptor 2, (C-C motif) receptor 2, and (C-C motif) receptor 5 signaling ameliorated α-Galcer–induced liver injury, mainly due to the decrease of reactive oxygen species production and inflammation. Depletion of neutrophils reduced α-Galcer–induced liver injury and hepatitis. Interestingly, genetic deletion of neutrophil-specific miR-223 markedly enhanced while Ncf﻿1﻿ deficiency significantly ameliorated liver inflammation and oxidative damage caused by α-Galcer. Conclusions: Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration through multiple inflammatory mediators is required for NKT cell activation–induced hepatitis, which sheds light on the myeloid cell infiltration–related molecular mechanisms of NKT cell–mediated liver injury. Our study may provide a novel therapeutical strategy for the treatment of NKT cell hepatitis.">

        <tr id="Lactate has emerged as a key regulator in the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing both tumor progression and immune dynamics. As a byproduct of aerobic glycolysis, lactate satisfies the metabolic needs of proliferating tumor cells while reshaping the TME to facilitate immune evasion. Elevated lactate levels inhibit effector immune cells such as CD8+ T and natural killer cells, while supporting immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, thus fostering an immunosuppressive environment. Lactate promotes epigenetic reprogramming, stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and activates nuclear factor kappa B, leading to further immunological dysfunction. In this review, we examined the role of lactate in metabolic reprogramming, immune suppression, and treatment resistance. We also discuss promising therapeutic strategies targeting lactate metabolism, including lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, monocarboxylate transporter inhibitors, and TME neutralization methods, all of which can restore immune function and enhance immunotherapy outcomes. By highlighting recent advances, this review provides a theoretical foundation for integrating lactate-targeted therapies into clinical practice. We also highlight the potential synergy between these therapies and current immunotherapeutic strategies, providing new avenues for addressing TME-related challenges and improving outcomes for patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="High grade gliomas (HGG) are incurable brain cancers, where inevitable disease recurrence is driven by tumour-initiating glioma stem cells (GSCs). GSCs survive and expand in the brain after surgery, radiation and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, amidst weak immune and natural killer (NK) cell surveillance. The present study was designed to understand how to enhance the contribution of innate immunity to post TMZ disease control. Strikingly, molecular subtypes of HGG impacted the repertoire of NK cell sensitivity markers across human HGG transcriptomes, and in a panel of GSCs with either proneural (PN-GSC) or mesenchymal (MES-GSC) phenotypes. Indeed, only MES-GSCs (but not PN-GSCs) were enriched for NK cell ligands and sensitive to NK-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. While NK cells alone had no effect on HGG progression in vivo, the post-chemotherapy (TMZ) recurrence of MES-GSC-driven xenografts was aborted by timed intracranial injection of live or irradiated NK (NK92MI) cells, resulting in long term survival of animals. This curative effect declined when NK cell administration was delayed relative to TMZ exposure pointing to limits of the immune control over resurging residual tumour stem cell populations that survived chemotherapy. Overall, these results suggest that chemotherapy-dependent tumour depopulation may create a unique window of opportunity for NK-mediated intervention with curative effects restricted to a subset of HGGs driven by mesenchymal brain tumour initiating cells.

        <tr id="Sepsis, a leading cause of death in intensive care units, is associated with immune alterations that increase the patients’ risk of secondary infections and mortality, so better understandings of the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced immunosuppression is essential for the development of therapeutic strategies. In a murine model of sepsis that recapitulates immune alterations observed in patients, here we demonstrate that PD-L1+CD44+B220LowCD138+IgM+ regulatory plasma cells are induced in spleen and regulate ex vivo proliferation and IFNɣ secretion induced by stimulation of T splenocytes. This effect is mediated both by cell-cell contact through increased PD-L1 expression on plasma cells and by production of a soluble factor. These observations are recapitulated in three cohorts of critically ill patients with bacterial and viral sepsis in association with increased mortality. Our findings thus reveal the function of regulatory plasma cells in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced immune alterations, and present a potential therapeutic target for improving immune cell function impaired by sepsis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Only a minority of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) respond favourably to immunotherapy. The oral oncogenic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.nucleatum) was recently observed to suppress the anti‐tumour immune response, although the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from F.nucleatum (F.n‐OMVs) promoted HNSCC progression by inducing immunosuppressive phenotypes of tumour‐associated macrophages (TAMs), resulting in decreased cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration in vivo. Mechanistically, TAMs internalized tryptophanase presented in F.n‐OMVs, which activated the tryptophan‐2,3‐dioxygenase 2/aryl hydrocarbon receptor (TDO2/AHR) pathway and upregulated the transcription of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoints. TDO2 inhibitor enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti‐programmed death‐1 in a tumour‐bearing mouse model. Both TDO2 and F.nucleatum demonstrated excellent performance in predicting the immunotherapy outcomes in patients with HNSCC. These results indicate that F.n‐OMVs induce immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC, providing novel insights into the microbiota–tumour immunity crosstalk.">

        <tr id="The spleen, the largest lymphatic organ, comprises a diverse array of immunocytes in approximately one quarter of the body, including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells (such as dendritic cells, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and macrophages). These immune cells undergo dynamic transitions and mobilization, enabling the spleen to execute a wide range of immunological functions. The spleen's structural organization and multicellular composition, along with its reservoir of lymphocytes, facilitate the capture and clearance of blood-borne antigens while also orchestrating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, the spleen plays critical roles in hematopoiesis and the removal of aged or damaged red blood cells. Despite being innervated by sympathetic (catecholaminergic) nerve fibers, the spleen lacks parasympathetic (vagal or cholinergic) innervation. The neuroimmune axis, particularly the interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system immune circuits, significantly influences disease onset and progression. Extensive research employing physical, genetic, and pharmacological approaches has sought to directly modulate splenic immunocytes and activate neuroimmune interactions to restore immune homeostasis and counteract disease. Two primary mechanisms underlie these immunomodulatory interventions: (1) the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, wherein norepinephrine released by splenic catecholaminergic fibers binds to β2-adrenergic receptors on CD4⁺ T cells, triggering acetylcholine secretion, which in turn suppresses inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling, and (2) direct immunomodulation of splenic immunocytes, which regulates key genes and signaling pathways, alters cytokine secretion, and modulates ion flux to influence cellular functions. Among various therapeutic strategies, physical methods, particularly electrical stimulation and splenic ultrasound stimulation, have demonstrated the greatest promise for clinical applications in splenic immunomodulation and disease management.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), pivotal immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), exhibit dual potential in both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects. These cells display remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity within the TME, adapting to hypoxic and nutrient-deprived conditions through metabolic reprogramming while critically influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and immune evasion. The metabolic reprogramming of TANs not only modulates their functional phenotypes but also reshapes tumor biological behaviors and therapeutic responses by regulating metabolic intermediates and cellular interactions within the TME. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms underlying TANs metabolic reprogramming has significant implications for deciphering the molecular basis of tumorigenesis, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and optimizing immunotherapeutic strategies. This review systematically summarizes current knowledge regarding metabolic reprogramming mechanisms of TANs in the TME and their impact on tumor progression. We particularly focus on: 1) TAN-specific alterations in glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism within the TME; 2) Emerging immunotherapeutic strategies targeting TANs metabolic pathways; 3) Recent advances in understanding TAN-mediated immune evasion and therapy resistance. Furthermore, this review discusses potential challenges and corresponding solutions in targeting TANs metabolic reprogramming for therapeutic intervention, aiming to provide novel insights for advancing cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of hematologic cancer characterized by the uncontrolled clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). This leads to significant dysfunction and suppression of the immune system in affected patients. Myeloma cells employ sophisticated strategies to manipulate immune and non-immune cells, evading immune surveillance and enhancing their survival. One key factor in this evasion is the disruption of dendritic cell (DC)-mediated immune mechanisms. Extensive evidence indicates that in the presence of myeloma cells, DC numbers are notably reduced, and their phenotype and function are altered, impairing their ability to present antigens and activate robust T-cell responses effectively. Despite rapid advances in MM treatment, with promising strategies such as DC-based vaccines being already achieved, DC dysfunction remains a substantial hurdle, associated with or contributing to poor therapeutic outcomes, disease relapse, and MM’s persistence as an incurable disease. To address these challenges, it is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms through which myeloma cells transform DCs into their “accomplices,” undermining immune responses. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the role of DCs in MM. Additionally, it evaluates the potential of DCs in anti-MM immunotherapy, discussing persistent challenges and highlighting emerging perspectives that may lead to promising breakthroughs for improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are essential innate immune cells with unusual anti-microbial properties while dysfunctions of neutrophils lead to severe health problems such as lethal infections. Generation of neutrophils from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is highly promising to produce off-the-shelf neutrophils for transfusion therapies. However, the anti-microbial potencies of hiPSCs derived neutrophils (iNEUs) remain less documented. Here, we develop a scalable approach to generate iNEUs in a chemical defined condition. iNEUs display typical neutrophil characters in terms of phagocytosis, migration, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), etc. Importantly, iNEUs display a strong killing potency against various bacteria such as K.pneumoniae, P.aeruginosa, E.coli and S.aureus. Moreover, transfusions of iNEUs in mice with neutrophil dysfunction largely enhance their survival in lethal infection of different bacteria. Together, our data show that hiPSCs derived neutrophils hold strong anti-microbial potencies to protect severe infections under neutrophil dysfunction conditions.

        <tr id="Understanding how different contributors within the tumor microenvironment (TME) function and communicate is essential for effective cancer detection and treatment. The TME encompasses all the surroundings of a tumor such as blood vessels, fibroblasts, immune cells, signaling molecules, exosomes, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Subsequently, effective cancer therapy relies on addressing TME alterations, known drivers of tumor progression, immune evasion, and metastasis. Immune cells and other cell types act differently under cancerous conditions, either driving or hindering cancer progression. For instance, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) include lymphocytes of B and T cell types that can invade malignancies, bringing in and enhancing the ability of immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. Therefore, TILs display a promising approach to tackling the TME alterations and have the capability to significantly hinder cancer progression. Similarly, exosomes and inflammasomes exhibit a dual effect, resulting in either tumor progression or inhibition depending on the origin of exosomes, type of inflammasome and tumor. This review will explore how cells function in the presence of a tumor, the communication between cancer cells and immune cells, and the role of TILs, exosomes and inflammasomes within the TME. The efforts in this review are aimed at garnering interest in safer and durable therapies for cancer, in addition to providing a promising avenue for advancing cancer therapy and consequently improving survival rates.">

        <tr id="Colon cancer (CC) remains a primary contributor to cancer-related fatalities worldwide, driven by difficulties in early diagnosis and constrained therapeutic options. Recent studies underscore the importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME), notably tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in fostering malignancy progression and therapy resistance. Through their inherent plasticity, TAMs facilitate immunosuppression, angiogenic processes, metastatic spread, and drug tolerance. In contrast to M1 macrophages, which promote inflammatory and tumoricidal responses, M2 macrophages support tumor expansion and dissemination by exerting immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic influences. Consequently, manipulating TAMs has emerged as a potential avenue to enhance treatment effectiveness. This review outlines the origins, polarization states, and functions of TAMs in CC, highlights their role in driving tumor advancement, and surveys ongoing efforts to target these cells for better patient outcomes. Emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating TAM functions - including depletion strategies, reprogramming approaches that shift M2-polarized TAMs toward an M1 phenotype, and inhibition of key signaling pathways sustaining TAM-mediated immunosuppression-are currently under active investigation. These approaches hold promise in overcoming TAM - induced resistance and improving immunotherapeutic efficacy in CC.">

        <tr id="Despite recent advancements, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a therapeutic challenge. While monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) leveraging natural killer (NK) cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity show great potential, none have gained clinical approval for AML. Immunocytokines have emerged as a promising strategy to overcome the limited efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. IL-15 stimulates activation, proliferation cytotoxic activity of NK cells, but its clinical use is prevented by short half-life, poor accumulation in the tumor, and toxicity due to systemic off-target immune activation. Here we report on the generation and preclinical characterization of modified immunocytokines consisting of an Fc-optimized CLEC12A (CLL-1) antibody fused to an IL-15 moiety with E46K mutation. The mutation abrogates binding to IL-15Rα, thereby enabling substitution of physiological trans-presentation by target binding and thus conditional IL-15Rβ/γ stimulation to reduce systemic toxicity. An optimal CLEC12A binder was selected from a range of murine mAbs, based on analysis of AML cell lines and leukemic cells from patients. This antibody was then used to construct an immunocytokine (MIC12) that subsequently was characterized functionally. Analysis of NK cell activation, cytokine release, proliferation and anti-leukemia reactivity demonstrated that MIC12 induced superior target cell killing and NK cell expansion compared to Fc-optimized CLEC12A antibody, with efficacy being dependent on target antigen binding. Our results show that novel immunocytokines with conditional IL-15 activity are capable of inducing potent NK cell responses against AML cells and identify MIC12 as promising therapeutic candidate for leukemia treatment.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can address an unmet clinical need for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its effect is often modest in the setting of high tumor burden. In this study, we postulated that strategies to lower the AML apoptotic threshold will augment T cell killing of AML cells. BH3 mimetics, such as venetoclax, are a clinically approved class of compounds that predispose cells to intrinsic apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins. We explored the anti-leukemic efficacy of BH3 mimetics combined with WT1-specific CD8+ T cells on AML cell lines and primary samples from patients with a diverse array of disease characteristics to evaluate if lowering the cellular apoptotic threshold via inhibition of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins can increase leukemic cell sensitivity to T cell therapy. We found that the combination approach of BH3 mimetic and CD8+ T cells led to significantly increased killing of established AML lines as well as of adverse-risk primary AML leukemic blast cells. In contrast to the hypothesis that enhanced killing would be due to combined activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, our data suggests that CTL-mediated killing of AML cells was accomplished primarily through activation of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This highly effective combinatorial activity due to convergence on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was conserved across multiple AML cell lines and primary samples, suggesting that mitochondrial priming may represent a novel mechanism of optimizing adoptive cell therapy for AML patients.">

While vaccine-induced TRM express high levels of CD103 and persist longer in the lung parenchyma, short-lived, H1N1-induced TRM have a transcriptome associated with higher cytotoxic potential and distinct transcriptional profile as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing. In both the vaccine and H1N1 groups, NP-specific CD8+ T cells expand during heterologous influenza virus infection and protect the mice from disease. Meanwhile, lung inflammation in response to an infection with unrelated respiratory syncytial virus do not influence the fate of pre-existing TRM. Our preclinical work thus confirms that inflammatory conditions in the tissue shape the phenotypic and functional characteristics of TRM to serve relevant informations for optimizing mucosal vaccines.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an exceedingly aggressive primary brain tumor defined by rapid growth, extensive infiltration, and resistance to standard therapies. A central factor driving these malignancies is the subpopulation of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which possess self-renewal capacity, multipotency, and the ability to regenerate tumor heterogeneity. GSCs contribute to key hallmarks of GBM pathobiology, including relentless progression, resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and inevitable recurrence. GSCs exhibit distinct molecular signatures, enhanced DNA repair, and metabolic adaptations that protect them against conventional treatments. Moreover, they reside within specialized niches—such as perivascular or hypoxic microenvironments—that sustain stemness, promote immunosuppression, and facilitate angiogenesis. Recent discoveries highlight signaling pathways like Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, STAT3-PARN, and factors such as TFPI2 and HML-2 as critical regulators of GSC maintenance, plasticity, and immune evasion. These findings underscore the complexity of GSC biology and their pivotal role in driving GBM heterogeneity and therapeutic failure. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to target GSCs through multiple avenues, including surface markers, immunotherapeutics (e.g., CAR T cells), metabolic vulnerabilities, and combination regimens. Advances in patient-derived organoids, single-cell omics, and 3D co-culture models enable more accurate representation of the tumor ecosystem and personalized therapeutic approaches. Ultimately, improved understanding of GSC-specific targets and the tumor microenvironment promises more effective interventions, paving the way toward better clinical outcomes for GBM patients.">

        <tr id="Background Allergic asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by an allergic response and altered immune tolerance. CD4+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are crucial in the chronic and relapsing pathogenesis of asthma. Furthermore, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is an essential transcription factor involved in asthmatic tolerance and has been implicated in the regulation of CD4+CD44+ memory T cells. However, the role of CD4+ TRM cells in asthmatic tolerance, as well as their potential modulation by PLZF, remain unclear. Therefore, in the current study, we explore the role of CD4+ TRM cells in asthmatic immune tolerance and as well as the regulatory role of PLZF in this process. Methods To elucidate the role of CD4+ TRM cells in immune tolerance, asthma memory mouse models were treated with the immunomodulator FTY720. Subsequently, CD4+ T cells were isolated from the lungs and spleens and transferred to oral tolerance mouse models. To explore the regulation of PLZF in CD4+ TRM cells, asthma and oral tolerance were established in Zbtb16flox/flox CD4Cre and wild-type mice. Flow cytometry, histological analysis, and cytokine measurements were performed to characterize the immune response. The regulatory activity of PLZF on CD4+ TRM cells was analyzed through quantitative proteomics and verified in vitro and vivo. Results The CD4+ TRM cell proportion positively correlated with the pathological phenotypes and molecular characteristics of asthma. Adoptive transfer of CD4+ TRM cells induced asthmatic phenotypes. This suggested that CD4+ TRM cells contributed to the pathogenesis of asthma. Conditional knockout of PLZF substantially reduced the proportion of CD4+ TRM cells, relieved asthmatic symptoms, and suppressed the interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15Rα signaling pathway. Furthermore, exposure to the IL-15Rα agonist restored asthma-related Th2 inflammation, accompanied by a markedly increased proportion of CD4+ TRM cells. Meanwhile, IL-15 and ovalbumin(OVA)-primed Beas2b supernatant co-stimulation in vitro enhanced the differentiation of pulmonary PLZF-expressing CD4+ T cells into CD4+ TRM cells. Conclusions This study identified CD4+ TRM cells as key mediators of immune tolerance in asthma. This process is regulated by the transcription factor PLZF in CD4+ T cells through IL-15/IL-15Rα signaling. Thus, targeting PLZF or the IL-15/IL-15Rα pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating asthma.

        <tr id="Immune-mediated disorders are a broad range of diseases, arising as consequence of immune defects, exaggerated/misguided immune response or a mixture of both conditions. Their frequency is on a rise in the developed societies and they pose a significant challenge for diagnosis and treatment. Traditional pharmacological, monoclonal antibody-based or polyclonal antibody replacement-based therapies aiming at modulation of the immune responses give very often dissatisfactory results and/or are burdened with unacceptable adverse effects. In recent years, a new group of treatment modalities has emerged, utilizing cells as living drugs, especially with the use of the up-to-date genetic engineering. These modern cellular therapies are designed to offer a high potential for more targeted, safe, durable, and personalized treatment options. This work briefly reviews the latest advances in the treatment of immune-mediated disorders, mainly those related to exaggeration of the immune response, with such cellular therapies as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and others. We highlight the main features of these therapies as new treatment options for taming the dysregulated immune system. Undoubtfully, in near future such therapies can provide lasting remissions in a range of immune-mediated disorders with reduced treatment burden and improved quality of life for the patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to better understand immune failure mechanisms during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which are critical for developing targeted vaccines and effective treatments. We collected 34 cases representing different disease severities and performed high‐quality single‐cell TCR/BCR sequencing to analyze the peripheral immune cell profiles. Additionally, we assessed antibody‐neutralizing activity through in vitro experiments. Our integrated multiomics analysis uncovers a profound immune paradox in severe COVID‐19: hyperinflammation coexists with immunosuppression, driven by distinct yet interconnected dysregulatory mechanisms. Severe patients develop robust humoral immunity, evidenced by clonally expanded plasma cells producing neutralizing antibodies (e.g., IGHG1‐dominated responses) and antigen‐specific T cell activation. However, these protective responses are counteracted by myeloid‐driven immunosuppression, particularly CD14+ HMGB2+ monocytes exhibiting metabolic reprogramming and HLA‐DR downregulation, coupled with progressive T cell exhaustion characterized by IFN‐γ/TNF‐α hyperactivation and impaired antigen presentation. Importantly, prolonged viral persistence in severe cases arises from a failure to coordinate humoral and cellular immunity—antibody‐mediated neutralization cannot compensate for defective cytotoxic T cell function and monocyte‐mediated immune suppression. These findings highlight the necessity for therapeutic strategies that simultaneously enhance antibody effector functions (e.g., Fc optimization), restore exhausted T cells, and reverse myeloid suppression. They also highlight the importance of vaccines designed to elicit balanced B cell memory and durable T cell responses, which are critical to preventing severe disease progression. By addressing the dual challenges of hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, such approaches could restore immune coordination and improve outcomes in severe COVID‐19.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis represents an emerging, iron-dependent form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation. In recent years, it has garnered significant attention in the realm of cancer immunotherapy, particularly in studies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors. This form of cell death not only enhances our comprehension of the tumor microenvironment but is also considered a promising therapeutic strategy to address tumor resistance, investigate immune activation mechanisms, and facilitate the development of cancer vaccines. The combination of immunotherapy with ferroptosis provides innovative targets and fresh perspectives for advancing cancer treatment. Nevertheless, tumor cells appear to possess a wider array of ferroptosis evasion strategies compared to CD8+T cells, which have been conclusively shown to be more vulnerable to ferroptosis. Furthermore, ferroptosis in the TME can create a favorable environment for tumor survival and invasion. Under this premise, both inducing tumor cell ferroptosis and inhibiting T cell ferroptosis will impact antitumor immunity to some extent, and even make the final result run counter to our therapeutic purpose. This paper systematically elucidates the dual-edged sword role of ferroptosis in the antitumor process of T cells, briefly outlining the complexity of ferroptosis within the TME. It explores potential side effects associated with ferroptosis-inducing therapies and critically considers the combined application of ferroptosis-based therapies with ICIs. Furthermore, it highlights the current challenges faced by this combined therapeutic approach and points out future directions for development.">

Given the increasing application of ICIs in cancer therapy, ECP might offer a promising alternative to glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive treatments that may diminish therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy. 2 ECP is an immunomodulatory therapy initially developed for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Its clinical applications have expanded to include conditions such as acute graft-versus-host disease and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. 3 The procedure involves leukapheresis, photoactivation, and reinfusion of treated cells. This article explores the mechanisms of action in immune regulation in the context of irAEs.

This resistance makes the disease challenging to treat, emphasizing the need for new treatment strategies.

Essential metabolic alterations such as lactate and lipid accumulation, and lack of tryptophan disrupt DC maturation, antigen presentation, and T cell activation. In recent years, melanoma immunotherapy has increasingly focused on reprogramming the metabolism of DCs.

        <tr id="TRIMELVax is an innovative immunotherapeutic vaccine for malignant melanoma, which combines heat shock-conditioned human melanoma cell lysates with a mollusk hemocyanin as an adjuvant. Preclinical studies demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in mice with melanoma and colorectal tumors. However, the precise immunological mechanisms behind its anti-tumor effects have remained unclear. We focused on understanding how TRIMELVax induces inflammation at the injection site, recruits innate immune cells, triggers DC migration to draining lymph nodes, and affects tumor microenvironment and growth. To achieve this, C57BL/6 mice were injected in the footpad with TRIMELVax, PBS, or control vaccines, and then the skin and the popliteal lymph node were harvested for qPCR or FACS analysis. Results showed that TRIMELVax rapidly induced a specific pattern of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a differential acute innate immune response in the injection site. Neutrophils, type 1 macrophages, monocytes, cDC1, Langerhans cells, and monocyte derived-DCs were recruited to the footpad, while type 2 macrophages decreased. This early inflammation facilitated a superior migration of cDC1 and a new subtype of antigen-presenting neutrophils to the draining lymph node compared to controls. Depleting neutrophils before vaccination reduced DC migration, especially cDC1, to the draining lymph node and suppressed TRIMELVax's ability to control tumor growth, demonstrating that vaccine-induced neutrophils play a fundamental role in TRIMELVax's mechanism of action. At the tumor microenvironment level, it was observed that TRIMELVax induces a more intense infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes than controls, with a low level of exhaustiveness and greater cytotoxic capacity. A phase I clinical trial in twenty nivolumab-refractory patients showed that TRIMELVax is well tolerated with no grade 3-5 side effects and induces a Delayed-Type hypersensitivity reaction against melanoma antigens after four doses of the vaccine with an impact on disease stability and patient survival. In summary, TRIMELVax triggers a rapid and potent activation of the innate immune system, which seems crucial for a more effective adaptive immune response against aggressive melanoma tumors. These results underscore the promise of TRIMELVax as a potential immunotherapeutic approach for melanoma treatment.">

        <tr id="Innate immunity provides the critical first line of defense against infection and sterile triggers. Cell death is a key component of the innate immune response to clear pathogens, but excessive or aberrant cell death can induce inflammation, cytokine storm, and pathology, making it a central molecular mechanism in inflammatory diseases. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one such inflammatory disease, but the specific innate immune mechanisms driving pathology in this context remain unclear. Here, by leveraging RNAseq and tissue expression in clinical samples, we identified increased expression of the innate immune sensor Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) in patients with ALD. We discovered that ZBP1 expression correlated with ALD progression in patients, and that ethanol induced ZBP1-dependent lytic cell death, PANoptosis, in immune (macrophages, monocytes, Kupffer cells) and non-immune cells (hepatocytes). Mechanistically, the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) IRF9 and IRF1 upregulated ZBP1 expression, allowing ZBP1 to sense Z-NAs through its Zα2 domain and drive PANoptosis signaling, cell membrane rupture through NINJ1, and DAMP release. Furthermore, the expressions of ZBP1 and NINJ1 were upregulated in both liver and serum samples from patients with ALD. In mouse models of chronic and acute ALD, ZBP1-deficient mice were significantly protected from disease pathology and liver damage. Overall, our findings establish the critical role of the ZBP1-NINJ1 axis regulated by IRFs in driving inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, in liver cells, suggesting that targeting these molecules will have therapeutic potential in ALD and other inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Hematological malignancies are a diverse group of cancers that originate in the blood and bone marrow and are characterized by the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Myeloid blasts, which are derived from normal myeloid progenitors, play a central role in these diseases by disrupting hematopoiesis and driving disease progression. In addition, other myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, adapt dynamically to the tumor microenvironment, where they can promote immune evasion and resistance to treatment. This review explores the unique characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of myeloid blasts, the immunosuppressive roles of myeloid cells, and their complex interactions within the TME. Furthermore, we highlight emerging therapeutic approaches targeting myeloid cells, focusing on strategies to reprogram their functions, inhibit their suppressive effects, or eliminate pathological populations altogether, as well as the latest preclinical and clinical trials advancing these approaches. By integrating insights from these studies, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of myeloid cells in hematological malignancies and their potential as therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Stem cells are highly resistant to viral infection compared to their differentiated progeny, and this resistance is associated with stem cell-specific restriction factors and intrinsic interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). In HIV infection, proviral DNA has been detected in certain bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells, yet widespread stem cell infection in vivo is restricted. Intriguingly, exposing bone marrow stem cells to HIV in vitro led to viral replication selectively only in the CD34- population, but not in the CD34+ cells. The mechanism dictating this CD34-based HIV restriction remained a mystery, especially since HIV has a capacity to antagonize restriction factors and ISGs. CD34 is a common marker of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Here, we report the intrinsic antiviral properties of CD34. Expression of CD34 in HIV-1 producer cells results in the loss of progeny virion infectivity. Conversely, removal of CD34 using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout or stem cell differentiation cytokines promotes HIV-1 replication in stem cells. These results suggest that in addition to restriction factors and intrinsic ISGs, CD34 serves as a host innate protection preventing retrovirus replication in stem cells. Mechanistically, CD34 does not block viral entry, integration, and release. Instead, it becomes incorporated onto progeny virions, which inactivates virus infectivity. These findings offer new insights into innate immunity in stem cells, and highlight intriguing retrovirus-host interactions in evolution.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The molecular barriers that cause acute xenograft rejection have been identified and addressed by generating genetically modified (GM) animals, knocked out for specific xenoantigens (xenoAgs), and expressing regulatory molecules for both complement and coagulation pathways among others. The focus of xenotransplantation research now lies in delayed xenograft rejection. Dendritic cells (DC) are a specific subpopulation of professional antigen‐presenting cells (APC) that play a crucial role in the context of organ transplantation. DCs, originating from both the xenograft and the recipient, have the capacity to present xenoAgs to the recipient's immune system via their respective major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules leading to rejection. These processes are known as direct and indirect presentation, respectively. However, under certain microenvironmental conditions, DC develops into anti‐inflammatory regulatory cells that can induce immunological tolerance. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the general characteristics and functions of DC from species relevant to xenotransplantation, specifically humans, non‐human primates (NHP), and pigs. It will also cover the process of xenoAg presentation, different methods for generating DC with regulatory properties in vitro, and finally, discuss the current strategies for using regulatory DC to improve xenograft acceptance by inducing tolerance.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) cross-present tumor antigens to cognate T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs). ICAM-1 is a key adhesion molecule involved in the formation of diverse cell-cell contacts between immune cells as well as blood vessels and stromal cells. We have recently found that ICAM-1 expressed by lymph node DCs can stabilize antigen-dependent contacts with naïve CD8 T cells but is dispensable for CD8 T cell differentiation and proliferation into effector and memory lymphocytes generated in various models of vaccination and virus infections. To follow the role of DC ICAM-1 in CD8 proliferation and differentiation triggered by tumor expressed neoantigens, we orthotopically implanted breast cancer E0771 cells expressing the model OVA neoantigen in immunocompetent mice conditionally deleted of ICAM-1 expression in all CD11c expressing -conventional  DCs (cDCs), monocyte derived DCs (mDCs) and pDCs. Strikingly, in contrast to viral challenges, the tumor challenge drove naïve tumor-antigen specific CD8 differentiation almost exclusively into T-stem-like central memory T cells (TSL) with high expression of L-selectin (CD62L), PD-1, and the transcription factor TCF-1 implicated in T cell stemness and proliferative potential. Early CD8 activation and differentiation into these central memory T cells remained normal in these mice. This indicated that tumor antigen transfer by migratory DCs to lymph node DCs and its initial cross presentation to naïve T cells do not require ICAM-1 expression by all types of DCs. Furthermore, deletion of ICAM-1 selectively in XCR1 conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), specialized in tumor antigen uptake and cross priming of tumor specific T cells in tumor draining lymph nodes, did not impair early tumor specific CD8 activation and differentiation. Nevertheless, the maintenance of resident self-renewing stem-like tumor specific CD8 memory cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes was diminished in the absence of ICAM-1 expression by cDC1. We currently explore the possibility that ICAM-1 deficiency in these DCs impairs the stability of survival niches generated by Ag-specific CD8 TSL and cDC1. Our results highlight a specialized instructive role of cDC1 ICAM-1 in antigen dependent maintenance of a pool of lymph node stem-like tumor-specific lymphocytes. This pool is a main source of tumor specific CD8 T cells which egress the draining lymph nodes and home into primary tumors, where they differentiate into short-lived terminally differentiated effector T cells (CTLs) critical for tumor eradication.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) mediates durable and complete regression of various cancers. However, its efficacy is limited by the long-term persistence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, given their irreversible dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we aimed to establish an artificial lung metastasis model to examine T-lymphocyte subsets, in order to identify potential effective cell subsets for ACT.


METHODS
A metastatic lung melanoma mouse model was established using OVA-expressing melanoma B16 cells. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to examine the surface markers, transcription factors, and secreted cytokines of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells within metastatic tissues. The infiltrated cells were sorted by flow cytometry for in vitro tumor cell killing assays or in vivo cell infusion therapy combined with chemotherapeutic drugs and immune checkpoint blockade antibodies.


RESULTS
Exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex) exhibited high heterogeneity in metastatic tissues. Among Tex cells, the CXCR6- precursor cell showed certain memory characteristics, including phenotype, transcription factors, and maintenance, whereas the CXCR6+ subpopulation partially lost these traits. Moreover, CXCR6+ precursor cells effectively replenished effector-like Tex cells in metastatic tissues and exerted direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Notably, transferring these tumor-specific CXCR6+ precursor-exhausted T (Texp) cells into recipients induced a substantial regression of metastasis. In addition, these cells could respond to immune checkpoint blockade, which could better control tumor metastasis.


CONCLUSIONS
In our study, a subset of antigen-specific CXCR6-expressing Texp cells was observed within the metastatic tissue. The cells served as a crucial source of effector-like Tex cells and exerted direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. Adoptive transfer of CXCR6+ Texp cells effectively mitigated lung metastasis in mice. This study helps elucidate the role of Texp cells in metastasis, thereby offering novel insights into enhancing the efficacy and durability of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Glatiramer acetate (GA) is the first-line therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and is increasingly demonstrating promising therapeutic benefits in a range of other conditions. Despite its extensive use, the precise pharmacological mechanism of GA remains unclear. In addition to T and B cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play significant roles in the neuroinflammation associated with MS, positioning them as potential initial targets for GA. Here, we investigated GA’s influence on the differentiation of human monocytes from healthy donors into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and assessed their activation status. Our results indicate that GA treatment does not hinder the differentiation of monocytes into moDCs or macrophages. Notably, we observed a significant increase in the expression of molecules required for antigen recognition, presentation, and co-stimulation in GA-treated moDCs. Conversely, there was a significant downregulation of CD1a, which is crucial for activating auto-aggressive T cells that respond to the lipid components of myelin. Furthermore, GA treatment resulted in an increased expression of CD68 on both CD14+CD16+ and CD14+CD16− monocyte subsets. These in vitro findings suggest that GA treatment does not impede the generation of moDCs under inflammatory conditions; however, it may modify their functional characteristics in potentially beneficial ways. This provides a basis for future clinical studies in MS patients to elucidate its precise mode of action.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in extracellular vesicle (EV) research in organ transplantation have highlighted the crucial role of donor-derived EVs in triggering alloimmune responses, ultimately contributing to transplant rejection. Following transplantation, EVs carrying donor major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules activate recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs), initiating both alloreactive and regulatory T-cell responses. While immunosuppressive drugs are essential for preventing rejection, they may also influence the biogenesis and release of EVs from donor cells. This review examines the impact of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy on EV biogenesis and release post-transplantation. In addition, EV release and uptake may be influenced by specific factors such as the patient's end-stage organ disease and the transplant procedure itself. In-vitro studies using primary human parenchymal and immune cells—integrated with cutting-edge multi-omics techniques, including genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and single-EV analysis—will offer deeper insights into EV biology and the mechanisms by which immunosuppressive agents regulate EV-initiated immune processes. A detailed understanding of how organ failure, the transplantation procedure and immunosuppressive drugs affect the biology of EVs may uncover new roles for EVs in immune activation and regulation in patients, ultimately leading to improved immunosuppressive strategies and better transplant outcomes.">

        <tr id="This review discusses reprogramming the breast tumor immune microenvironment from an immunosuppressive cold state to an immunologically active hot state. A complex interplay is revealed, in which the accumulation of metabolic byproducts—such as lactate, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ammonia—is shown to impair T-cell function and promote tumor immune escape. It is demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ), and IL-35. Notably, IL-35 is produced by regulatory T cells and breast cancer cells. The conversion of conventional T cells into IL-35-producing induced regulatory T cells, along with the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity. It is further demonstrated that key immune checkpoint molecules—such as PD-1, PDL1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT—are upregulated within the TME, leading to Tcell exhaustion and diminished immune responses. The blockade of these checkpoints is shown to restore T-cell functionality and is proposed as a strategy to convert cold tumors into hot ones with robust effector cell infiltration. The therapeutic potential of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)T cell therapy is also explored, and targeting specific tumor-associated antigens, such as glycoproteins and receptor tyrosine kinases, is highlighted. It is suggested that CART cell efficacy can be enhanced by combining these cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunomodulatory agents, thereby overcoming the barriers imposed by the immunosuppressive TME. Moreover, the role of the microbiome in regulating estrogen metabolism and systemic inflammation is reviewed. Alterations in the gut microbiota are shown to affect the TME, and microbiome-based interventions are proposed as an additional means to facilitate the cold-to-hot transition. It is concluded that by targeting the metabolic and immunological pathways that underpin immune suppression—through combination strategies involving checkpoint blockade, CART cell therapies, and microbiome modulation—the conversion of the breast TME from cold to hot can be achieved. This reprogramming is anticipated to enhance immune cell infiltration and function, thereby improving the overall efficacy of immunotherapies and leading to better clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients.

        <tr id="Background Antigen-specific immunotherapy shows potential for inducing long-term immune tolerance in type 1 diabetes (T1D), yet its clinical application is hampered by uncertainty regarding dominant epitopes. Conversely, non-antigen-specific treatments such as anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) present a more straightforward approach but struggle to maintain tolerance after treatment. Addressing these issues is critical for advancing T1D therapies. Methods The phenotypic and metabolic properties of two subsets of exhausted CD8+ T cells were analyzed in both humans and NOD mice. T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity and Bulk RNA sequencing provided insights into the transcriptomic profiles and TCR reactivity of these cells. Mechanistic studies were conducted using the HEK-293 T cell line and primary cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was applied to evaluate the characteristics of different CD8+ T cell subsets following two types of immunotherapies. In NY8.3 mice, the effect of mitochondrial fission inhibitors on immunotherapy results was evaluated. Final validation was carried out with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from T1D patients. Results Our study reveals the diversity of two distinct exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets in T1D through flow cytometry, highlighting unique clinical features, phenotypes, and functions. Notable differences in TCR reactivity and metabolic pathways between these subsets were identified through TCR sequencing and transcriptomic analyses in NOD mice. Both antigen-specific and non-antigen-specific stimuli produced unique exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets. Our research identified leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (Lrrk2) as a key regulator of mitochondrial fission, influencing the interconversion of exhausted CD8+ T cell subsets by phosphorylating dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) at serine 637 (Ser637) and serine 616 (Ser616). scRNA-seq confirmed that antigen-specific immunotherapy effectively suppresses T cell signaling, induces exhaustion, and promotes the development of terminally exhausted T (TEX) cells. Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) enhanced the therapeutic effect of anti-CD3 mAb treatment by promoting the development of more TEX cells. Conclusions Our results point to a new immunotherapeutic approach that targets exhausted CD8+ T cells’ energy metabolism, offering valuable insights for advancing clinical strategies in T1D therapy.

        <tr id="Gamma–delta (γδ) T cells are a unique subset of T lymphocytes that play diverse roles in immune responses, bridging innate and adaptive immunity. With growing interest in their potential for cancer immunotherapy, a comprehensive and inclusive exploration of γδ T cell families, their development, activation mechanisms, functions, therapeutic implications, and current treatments is essential. This review aims to provide an inclusive and thorough discussion of these topics. Through our discussion, we seek to uncover insights that may harbinger innovative immunotherapeutic strategies. Beginning with an overview of γδ T cell families including Vδ1, Vδ2, and Vδ3, this review highlights their distinct functional properties and contributions to anti-tumor immunity. Despite γδ T cells exhibiting both anti-tumor and pro-tumor activities, our review elucidates strategies to harness the anti-tumor potential of γδ T cells for therapeutic benefit. Moreover, our paper discusses the structural intricacies of the γδ T cell receptor and its significance in tumor recognition. Additionally, this review examines conventional and emerging γδ T cell therapies, encompassing both non-engineered and engineered approaches, with a focus on their efficacy and safety profiles in clinical trials. From multifunctional capabilities to diverse tissue distribution, γδ T cells play a pivotal role in immune regulation and surveillance. By analyzing current research findings, this paper offers insights into the dynamic landscape of γδ T cell–based immunotherapies, underscoring their promise as a potent armamentarium against cancer. Furthermore, by dissecting the complex biology of γδ T cells, we learn valuable information about the anti-cancer contributions of γδ T cells, as well as potential targets for immunotherapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Abstract Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone cancer. Thirty to forty percent of all patients with OS develop tumor recurrence, almost exclusively in the form of lung metastasis, which is associated with a dismal 20% 5-year survival rate. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are a critical cell type within the lung tumor microenvironment that promote immune suppression, drug resistance, and tumor cell survival. Prior work shows tumor cells can co-opt fibroblasts to a protumorigenic phenotype via exosome-mediated intercellular communication. Currently, the mechanisms by which OS exosomes modulate resident lung fibroblast (LF) function have not been evaluated. To investigate this, we isolated exosomes from a panel of six OS cell lines. We assessed the uptake and response of human donor–derived primary LFs (n = 4) to OS exosome treatment in vitro via flow cytometry, confocal fluorescent microscopy, proliferation assays, phosphokinase array, multiplex cytokine analysis, and RNA sequencing. We observed that LFs efficiently take up OS exosomes, which are associated with the induction of MAPK pathway activation, fibroblast proliferation, and significantly enhanced secretion of IL-6, CXCL8, and CCL2 compared with untreated LFs. RNA sequencing of exosome-treated LFs confirmed these responses and revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to cytokine secretion, proliferation, immune cell chemotaxis, migration, proinflammatory, and profibrotic mediators. Finally, in an exosome-educated LF–OS coculture model, exosome-educated LFs conferred significantly increased OS cell survival and proliferation compared with untreated fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that the OS-derived exosomes can induce a hallmark cancer-associated fibroblast–like inflammatory phenotype in LFs, providing valuable insights into mechanisms that may promote recurrent OS lung metastasis. Significance: These findings provide a critical first step in characterizing the capacity of OS-derived exosomes to reprogram primary LFs toward a tumor-promoting inflammatory phenotype in vitro, offering novel molecular targets for the modulation of fibroblasts in the lung microenvironment as potential therapeutic strategies to prevent OS metastasis.">

        <tr id="Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, as one of the subtypes of CD4+ T cells, are the crucial gatekeeper in the pathogenesis of self-antigen reactive diseases. In this context, we demonstrated that the selective ablation of early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) in CD4+ T cells exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in murine models. The absence of Egr-1 in CD4+ T cells, obtained from EAE mice and naïve CD4+ T cells, impeded the differentiation and influence of Treg. Importantly, in CD4+ T cells of multiple sclerosis patients, both Egr-1 and Foxp3 were found to decrease. Further studies showed that distinct from the classical Smad3 route, TGF-β could activate Egr-1 through the Raf–Erk signaling route to promote Foxp3 genetic modulation, thereby promoting Treg cell differentiation and reducing EAE inflammation. A novel natural Egr-1 agonist, calycosin, was found to attenuate EAE progression by regulating the differentiation of Treg. Together, the above results indicate the value of Egr-1, as a novel Foxp3 transactivator, for the differentiation of Treg cells in the development of self-antigen reactive diseases.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases are characterized by irregular immune responses that disrupt self-tolerance. This research explores the effects of the immunomodulatory drug celecoxib on the expression of immune checkpoint receptors in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Key receptors, including CTLA-4, VISTA, BTLA, PDL-1, B7H7, and LAG3, play critical roles in initiating and regulating immune responses and maintaining self-tolerance. Previous studies have highlighted the significance of immune checkpoints in preventing autoimmune conditions, with animal research supporting their effectiveness in immunotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that the upregulation of immune checkpoint receptors can enhance the inhibitory functions of DCs, thereby promoting self-tolerance. As a result, tolerogenic DCs present a promising therapeutic avenue for treating autoimmune diseases. Although these results are promising, further trials are required to validate this approach before it can be applied clinically. This study underscores the potential of targeting immune checkpoint receptors as a therapeutic strategy for autoimmune disorders.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The immune tumor microenvironment (TME) is increasingly recognized as a dynamic ecosystem where B cells play pivotal roles in modulating therapeutic responses, particularly in the context of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. While B cells have traditionally been viewed as bystanders in tumor immunity, recent evidence suggests they may actively influence anti-tumor immunity, albeit with conflicting reports regarding their pro-tumor or anti-tumor roles. This study explores the crucial roles played by B cells and their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) in shaping melanoma responses to ICB therapy. We show a significant enrichment of B cells in ICB therapy responders compared to non-responders, pre-treatment, through retrospective analyses of melanoma patient tumors. Functional assays demonstrate that B cell depletion impairs T cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, underscoring the importance of B cells in anti-tumor responses. To investigate the clinical relevance, EVs were isolated from melanoma patient tumors, and fractioned into tumor and immune subpopulations. MiRNA profiling of CD19+ EVs identifies miR-99a-5p as a top candidate, among several others, upregulated in responders. Functional assays show that miR-99a-5p silencing in B cells diminishes T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity, suggesting its role in promoting B cell-mediated immune responses. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p influences B cell maturation within the TME by mediating class-switch recombination. Our findings highlight the important role of B cells and their derived EVs in shaping the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting B cell-related pathways.

        <tr id="Self-antigens that are obscure to immune cells under homeostasis, are exposed following tissue damage and can trigger autoimmunity. Our previous work showed that conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) mediate immunoregulation after traumatic skeletal muscle injury. Here, we found that, immune responses to injury in cDC1-depleted mice (Batf3-/-) mirror those of autoimmune mice (Aire-/-). Mechanistically, we determined that cDC1s prime killer regulatory T cells (CD8+/-Ly49+Tregs) which express Ly49 inhibitory receptors and HELIOS. These killer-like Tregs are clonally diverse and carry T cell receptors associated with self-reactivity and response to hydrophobicity. cDC1 or CD8 deletion promoted CD62L+CCR7+ naïve T cell retention and B cell recruitment to injured muscle. These naïve T cells, which are implicated in autoimmunity, strongly correlate with B cell abundance in the muscle and are selectively pruned by CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs. Furthermore, clinically used materials that promote wound healing enrich CD8+/-Ly49+ Treg function whereas those that are associated with pathology promote naïve T cell and B cell accumulation. We hypothesize that CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs maintain self-tolerance after tissue damage and avert autoimmunity by eliminating naive T cells and preventing pathogenic B cell activation.">

        <tr id="Signal transduction downstream of activating stimuli controls CD8+ T cell biology, however these external inputs can become uncoupled from transcriptional regulation in Primary Immune Regulatory Disorders (PIRD). Gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT3 amplify cytokine signaling and cause a severe PIRD characterized by early onset autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, recurrent infections, and immune dysregulation. In both primary human and mouse models of STAT3 GOF, CD8+ T cells have been implicated as pathogenic drivers of autoimmunity. The molecular mechanisms by which STAT3 GOF variants drive this pathology remain unclear. We found that naïve CD8+ T cells have an increased capacity for IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion. Given this dysregulation of CD8+ T cell function, we evaluated changes in immunoregulatory pathways and found evidence of dysregulated purinergic signaling via high dimensional immune profiling, single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional assessment. Specifically, while expression of CD39, which transforms ATP to AMP, was increased on CD8+ T cells from patients with STAT3 GOF, downstream purinergic family members, CD73 and the adenosine receptor, A2AR, were downregulated, impairing the potential to produce or sense inhibitory adenosine. Patients with STAT3 GOF can be clinically treated with JAK inhibitors and this partially normalized naïve CD8+ T cell dysregulation, including aberrant cytokine production. The extent of normalization of cytokine secretion scaled with normalization of CD73 and A2AR. This suggests that a dysregulated purinergic signaling axis plays an important role in CD8+ T cell dysregulation in STAT3 GOF, which may have implications for other inflammatory disorders with amplified STAT signaling. One Sentence Summary Amplified STAT3 signaling in CD8+ T cells from STAT3 GOF patients alters purinergic signaling and dysregulates CD8+ T cell function.">

        <tr id="Defining consequential differences in intestinal epithelial stem cells in healthy humans versus those with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) is essential for the development of much needed therapies to restore the epithelial barrier and maintain its fidelity. Employing single cell transcriptomic/epigenomic approaches and colonoid models from children and adults with Crohn’s disease led us to identify an inflammatory secretory progenitor (ISP) cell state present almost exclusively in patients with Crohn’s disease compared to control subjects. ISPs exhibit gene expression profiles consistent with normal secretory progenitor cells but concomitantly express a suite of distinguishing pro-inflammatory genes. Mechanistically, ISPs exhibit open chromatin and gene expression of ISP signature genes. While these ISP-specific genes are not expressed in intestinal stem cells, their chromatin is accessible in Crohn’s disease stem cells suggesting that ISP genes are epigenetically poised in stem cells and are transcriptionally activated in ISP cells in the presence of inflammatory stimuli. Consistently, Crohn’s disease colonoids exhibit sustained ISP gene expression that can be elicited further with pro-inflammatory cytokines or via co-culture with pro-inflammatory macrophages. In summary, we define differences in the epithelial stem and progenitor compartment of patients with Crohn’s disease suggesting aberrant stem cell differentiation and inflammatory gene expression arises during disease. HIGHLIGHTS We identify an inflammatory secretory progenitor cell state in endoscopically non-inflamed tissue from pediatric and adult patients with Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s disease epithelial stem and progenitor cells display increased chromatin accessibility preceding the emergence of inflammatory secretory progenitor cell states.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 induce durable responses in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the therapeutic response after CAR-T cell treatment remains incompletely understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry-based analyses of bone marrow-resident immune cells from B-ALL patients before and after CAR T-cell treatment. We observed profound changes in the microenvironment in response to CAR T cell-mediated inflammation, including an increase in myeloid cells. Significant induction of the IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling was associated with expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and endogenous exhausted CD8+ T cells. PD1 expression in endogenous T cells post-treatment was associated with a lack of durable response in the cohort of patients analyzed. Further, we revealed that HIF1α, VEGF, and TGFBR2 are key players in the intercellular communication between CAR T cells and the immune niche, driving widespread T-cell dysfunction. Infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells led to increased accumulation of human MDSCs, exacerbation of a hypoxic environment and T-cell exhaustion in HSPC-humanized mice bearing a human tumor. In conclusion, CAR T-cell-mediated myeloid activation is associated with pathways of immune dysregulation that may antagonize the effects of therapy. Key points The tumor immune context post-treatment affects CAR T-cell fate and endogenous immunity in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling result in endogenous T-cell exhaustion and compromise CAR T-cell efficacy.">

        <tr id="Many helminth parasites migrate through multiple host organs during infection but how immunity is regulated across these tissues is still poorly understood. To investigate the cellular and molecular aspects of inter-tissue communication during infection we established a percutaneous infection model with the tissue-migrating nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. High-dimension profiling of the initial cutaneous immune response revealed that dermal γδ T cells become activated, engage cell motility-associated transcriptional pathways and leave the skin after parasite invasion. Chemical and genetic inhibition of leukocyte migration prevents the accumulation of IL-17-producing γδ T cells in the lungs. Notably, bypassing the skin phase of infection, and therefore preventing dermal γδ T cell migration, dampens the increase in early IL-17 production in the lungs, and, instead, leads to enhanced IFN-γ responses together with increased lung damage. Collectively, our data highlights a critical skin–lung axis regulating host-parasite interactions and safeguarding lung health.">

VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain.">

        <tr id="High-dose steroids constitute the cornerstone of first-line treatment for immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, but compromise antitumor immunity. A deeper understanding of irAEs and their response to steroids can contribute to more targeted irAE management regimens. We took a multi-omics approach to identify blood- and tissue-based predictors of steroid response and to explore underlying mechanisms of steroid non-response in irAEs. In the blood, steroid non-response correlated with trends for elevated Tc1/Tc17 CD8+ T cells and serum interleukin (IL)-17, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 prior to initiation of steroids, along with persistent (CD8+) T cell proliferation and activation after start of steroids. A remarkably fast decrease in inflammatory gene signatures and lymphocyte infiltration was observed in colitis tissue of steroid responders obtained within 24h after initiation of steroids. Peripheral T cell PD-1 receptor occupancy was not associated with steroid response. Colitis tissue of steroid non-responders was enriched for activated CD4+ memory T cells and a pronounced type 1/17 immune response. Together, our findings suggest rapid immunological effects of steroids in circulating cells and irAE-affected tissue and support that an enhanced type 1/type 17 response is associated with steroid non-response in irAEs.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells play a critical role in supporting antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses. Although these responses often coexist, one can sometimes dominate at the expense of the other. For instance, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induces a strong cellular immune response but generates a suboptimal neutralizing antibody (nAb) response, hindering viral clearance and enabling persistent infection. Recent findings indicate that this skewed preference toward cellular immunity is determined already during the differentiation of CD4+ T cells. Specifically, subcutaneous (s.c.) LCMV infection predominantly induces T-bet+ T helper 1 (TH1) differentiation while largely neglecting T follicular helper (TFH) differentiation, a key driver of humoral immunity. Here, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for this impaired TFH differentiation. We found that T-bet+ cells induced by s.c. LCMV infection are heterogeneous and encompass a terminally differentiated TH1 subset expressing Granzyme-B (GzmB) and a Tcf-1+ subset that retains the potential for TFH differentiation but that does not express CXCR5 and other mature TFH markers. Interestingly, T cell-derived IFN-γ facilitated the proliferation of the GzmB+ subset and inhibited Tcf-1+ cells’ progression into TFH. The suppression of TFH cells by IFN-γ was not directly mediated through CD4+ T cells but rather involved another cell type, likely dendritic cells. Consistently, inhibition of IFN-γ enabled robust TFH differentiation, formation of germinal centers and increased antibody production. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms inhibiting nAb production in response to viruses and lays a foundation for the development of advanced vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are a key cell type of the innate immune system and are involved at all steps of inflammation: (i) they present antigens to initiate inflammation, (ii) they clear up foreign bodies through phagocytosis, and (iii) they resolve inflammation by removing or deactivating mediator cells. Many subtypes of macrophages have been identified, classified by their niche and/or embryonic origin. In order to better develop therapies for conditions with macrophage dysfunction, it is crucial to decipher potential sex-differences in key physiological mediators of inflammation so that treatment efficacy can be ensured regardless of biological sex. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis approach of transcriptomics datasets for male vs. female mouse macrophages across 8 niches to characterize conserved sex-dimorphic pathways in macrophages across origins and niches. For this purpose, we leveraged new and publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets from murine macrophages, preprocessed these datasets and filtered them based on objective QC criteria, and performed differential gene expression analysis using sex as the covariate of interest. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were compared across datasets and macrophage subsets, and functional enrichment analysis was performed to identify sex-specific functional differences. Consistent with their presence on the sex chromosomes, three genes were found to be differentially expressed across all datasets (i.e. Xist, Eif2s3y, and Ddx3y). More broadly, we found that female-biased pathways across macrophage niches are more consistent than male-biased pathways, specifically relating to components of the extracellular matrix. Our findings increase our understanding of transcriptional similarities across macrophage niches and underscore the importance of including sex as a biological variable in immune-related studies. Highlights Across 17 independently transcriptomic macrophage datasets, three genes are always differentially expressed between males and females: Ddx3y, Eif2s3y, and Xist. Jaccard analysis reveals female macrophages have more stereotypical transcriptional profile than male macrophages across niches. Functional enrichment analyses show that female-biased pathways across macrophage subtypes are enriched for extracellular matrix-related genes.">

        <tr id="HIV causes intense polyclonal activation of B cells, resulting in increased numbers of spontaneously antibody-secreting cells in the circulation and hypergammaglobulinemia. It is accompanied by significant perturbations in various B cell subsets, such as increased frequencies of immature/transitional B cells, activated memory B cells, atypical memory B cells, short-lived plasmablasts and regulatory B cells, as well as by decreased frequencies of resting memory and resting naïve B cells. Furthermore, both memory and antigen-inexperienced naïve B cells show exhausted and immune-senescent phenotypes. HIV also drives the expansion and functional impairment of CD4+ T follicular helper cells, which provide help to B cells, crucial for the generation of germinal center reactions and production of long-lived plasma and memory B cells. By suppressing viral replication, anti-retroviral therapy reverses the virus-induced perturbations and functional defects, albeit inadequately. Due to HIV’s lingering impact on B cells, immune senescence and residual chronic inflammation, people with HIV (PWH), especially immune non-responders, are immunocompromised and mount suboptimal antibody responses to vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review how functionally and phenotypically distinct B cell subsets are induced in response to a vaccine and an infection and how HIV infection and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) impact them. We also review the role played by HIV-induced defects and perturbations in B cells in the induction of humoral immune responses to currently used anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in PWH on ART. We also outline different strategies that could potentially enhance the vaccine-induced antibody responses in PWH. The review will provide guidance and impetus for further research to improve the immunogenicity of these vaccines in this human population.">

Here, we report that the novel combination of SUMO inhibition with a small molecule, TAK-981, plus antibody-mediated CD40 agonism improves survival in an aggressive orthotopic mouse model of PDAC by enhancing anti-tumoral immunogenicity.

TAK-981 also leads to enhanced cancer specific MHC-I expression both in vitro and in vivo by augmenting interferon signaling. We show that the improvement in survival is mediated by macrophages. Our findings show that SUMO inhibition complements CD40 agonism to enhance immune activity in PDAC via interferon signaling, improving survival in an aggressive pre-clinical model of PDAC and translating previous findings to a characteristically immunosuppressive and highly aggressive solid malignancy.">

        <tr id="Dermal macrophages (macs) protect the skin from invading pathogens. They are derived from embryonic as well as hematopoietic progenitors. However, the functional impact of their diverse origin and the control networks defining different subsets remain unclear. Here, using multidimensional analysis of dermal macs, we reveal that the absence of circulating monocytes in interferon regulatory factor 8 (Irf8) deficient mice delays mac renewal during the steady state. Yet, the functional mosaic of dermal macs remains largely intact, i.e., major dermal mac subsets develop independently of monocyte replenishment. Thus, the tissue microenvironment is sufficient to induce alternative differentiation pathways and functional specialization of resident cells. Mycobacterial skin infection induces a steep increase in mac density due to monocyte-derived macs which execute urgent antibacterial functions and differentiate into site-adapted mac subsets in wildtype but not Irf8-/-mice, while long-term resident macs are required to initiate a tissue repair program already in early stages of infection. In summary, we introduce a model, where an intricate network of specialized mac subsets develops to meet microanatomical needs and external cellular input is required only during immunological emergency situations. Highlights Irf8-/--driven monocytopenia has negligible impact on homeostatic dermal macrophage diversity. Resident dermal macrophages have diverse specializations but remain flexible to adapt to challenges such as lacking monocyte influx Bone marrow-derived macrophages differentiate into specialized resident cells, with microenvironmental cues overriding origin-dependent programming. In chronic bacterial infections, distinct specialized bone-marrow-derived macrophages mount the defense, while resident macrophages activate a tissue-modifying program from early on.">

        <tr id="Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi), the causative agent of typhoid disease, remains a major public health concern. Owing to the human-restricted nature of S. Typhi, current studies of typhoid pathogenesis in animal models are limited to a murine non-typhoidal pathogen. Furthermore, human studies are limited to analyses of peripheral immune responses which are blind to tissue-specific immunity and do not allow perturbations. What is now needed is an integrative approach that will provide mechanistic insights into S. Typhi pathogenesis and immune correlates of infection outcome. Here, we performed an integrated single-cell analysis of immune responses from the human S. Typhi challenge model and mouse model of typhoid disease, to associate biological mechanism with human infection outcome. Most prominent, we revealed immune subsets with a hypoxia-related signature in circulating immune cells from individuals that develop disease in the human challenge model. This signature was also evident in the mouse model in activated macrophages infiltrating into the Peyer’s patches, but not during infection with a mutant strain impaired for gut invasion. We further identified hypoxia-related signature as a general immune correlate of disease outcome in other infection- and inflammatory-related diseases. Collectively, using integrated analysis of mouse and human infection models, we revealed a hypoxia-related signature that link immune responses during bacterial invasion to increased risk of developing typhoid disease in humans, suggesting a possible causative role during the development of typhoid disease.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells are critical for immunosurveillance yet become dysfunctional in contexts such as chronic stimulation by viral infections or cancer. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less well characterized, which limits therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, which have remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Tumor clearance by T cells is impaired by insufficient tumor antigen recognition, insufficient tumor infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although targeted T cell therapy circumvents failures in tumor antigen recognition, suppression by the TME and failure to infiltrate the tumor can hinder tumor clearance by these T cells. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) promises to reverse T cell suppression in the TME and can be combined with bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapy to improve clinical outcomes. CPIs require the target pathway of inhibition to be active in the TME to elicit a therapeutic response. We hypothesize that adoptively transferred T cell function may be improved by the addition of CPI if the inhibitory pathway is functionally active. This study develops a kinetic-dynamic model of serial killing of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer cells mediated by BATs using single-cell transcriptomic and temporal protein data to identify T cell phenotypes and quantify inhibitory receptor expression. LAG3, PD-1, and TIGIT were identified as inhibitory receptors expressed by cytotoxic effector CD8 BATs upon exposure to HR+ breast cancer cell lines. These data were combined with real-time tumor cytotoxicity data in a multivariate statistical analysis framework to predict the relevant contributions of T cells expressing each receptor to tumor reduction. A mechanistic kinetic-dynamic mathematical model was developed and parametrized using protein expression and cytotoxicity data for in silico validation of the findings of the multivariate statistical analysis. The model corroborated the predictions of the multivariate statistical analysis which identified LAG3+ BATs as the primary effectors, while TIGIT expression dampened cytotoxic function. These results inform CPI selection for BATs combination therapy and provide a framework to maximize BATs anti-tumor function against HR+ cancers. Our model provides a means to optimize targets for CPIs used in combination with BATs in clinical strategies. What is already known on this topic Bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapies are adoptive T cell therapies that can effectively reroute T cell cytotoxicity toward cancerous cells, but lack consistent and durable anti-tumor responses. Checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of activated T cells dampen immune responses and can be overstimulated in solid tumors to hamper tumor clearance by T cells. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs can improve T cell anti-tumor response by blocking checkpoint protein signaling but are only effective if the targeted checkpoint protein is expressed on the T cell and activated in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting an opportunity to enhance BAT efficacy by combining treatment with synergistic CPI. What this study adds This study characterizes dynamic, time-resolved patterns in checkpoint protein expression by breast cancer-targeting adoptive T cells and predicts the significance of high-prevalence checkpoint proteins on T cell function. It also demonstrates the use of multivariate statistic and mathematical modeling toward rational design of targets and timing strategies for synergistic combination therapies. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy The output of this study provides justification for therapeutic strategies combining adoptive T cell therapies with checkpoint inhibitor drugs targeting TIGIT and LAG3 as a means of improving patient responses in HER2-/HR+ breast cancers.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterised by an overwhelming immune response and high fatality. While most research has focused on its acute phase, many sepsis survivors remain immunologically weakened leaving them susceptible to serious complications from even mild infections. The mechanisms underlying this prolonged immune dysregulation remain unclear, limiting effective interventions. Here, we analysed whether sepsis induced long-term “training” in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), imprinting changes that persist in their myeloid progeny. Peripheral blood analysis of 8 sepsis survivors, 12 patients with septic shock, and 10 healthy donors revealed a significant expansion of CD38+ progenitors in survivors, with increases in megakaryocyte-erythroid and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and reduced mature neutrophil counts. This shift suggests impaired granulopoiesis, favouring immature, immunosuppressive granulocytes. Differentiated macrophages from survivors’ HSPCs exhibited impaired metabolic pathways after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, with downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis genes, indicating altered immune metabolism. Pathway analysis revealed enhanced type-I interferon (IFN) and JAK-STAT signalling in survivors’ macrophages, reflective of potentially tolerance-prone reprogramming. Finally, exposing healthy donor HSPCs to IFNβ during macrophage differentiation reduced HSPC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and induced a metabolic shift towards glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings suggest that sepsis induces lasting reprogramming in HSPCs leading to myeloid progeny with altered immune memory that might drive immune dysregulation in survivors. These data open avenues to explore potential targets to better manage long-term immune alterations in sepsis survivors. KEY POINTS Sepsis induces long-term alterations in HSPCs, leading to the expansion of immature progenitors and metabolic dysregulation of their progeny. Type-I IFN signalling reprograms macrophage differentiation, affecting their metabolic function and reducing cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="Attempts to activate an anti-tumor immune response in glioblastoma (GBM) have been met with many challenges due to its inherently immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The degree and mechanisms by which molecularly and phenotypically diverse tumor-propagating glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to this state are poorly defined. In this study, our multifaceted approach combining bioinformatics analyses of clinical and experimental datasets, single-cell sequencing, and molecular and pharmacologic manipulation of patient-derived cells identified GSCs expressing immunosuppressive effectors mimicking regulatory T cells (Tregs). We show that this Immunosuppressive Treg-Like (ITL) GSC state is specific to the mesenchymal GSC subset and is associated with and driven specifically by TGF-β type II receptor (TGFBR2) in contrast to TGFBR1. Transgenic TGFBR2 expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres promoted a mesenchymal transition and induced a 6-gene ITL signature consisting of CD274 (PD-L1), NT5E (CD73), ENTPD1 (CD39), LGALS1 (galectin-1), PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2), and TGFB1. This TGFBR2-driven ITL signature was identified in clinical GBM specimens, patient-derived GSCs and systemic mesenchymal malignancies. TGFBR2High GSCs inhibited CD4+ and CD8+ T cell viability and their capacity to kill GBM cells, effects reversed by pharmacologic and shRNA-based TGFBR2 inhibition. Collectively, our data identify an immunosuppressive GSC state that is TGFBR2-dependent and susceptible to TGFBR2-targeted therapeutics.">

This highlights the needs to develop novel therapy for HIV-1 related diseases in PWH. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic effect of CD24-Fc, a fusion protein with anti-inflammatory properties that interacts with danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and siglec-10, in chronic HIV-1 infection model using humanized mice undergoing suppressive cART. Our findings show that CD24-Fc treatment significantly reduced inflammation and immune hyperactivation in vivo when combined with cART. CD24-Fc mediated resolution of inflammation was associated with improved recovery of CD4 T cells, reduced immune activation, restored central memory T cells and reversal of immune cell exhaustion phenotype. Notably, CD24-Fc treatment rescued CXCR5+ CD8 central memory T cell (TCM) which correlated with increased polyfunctionality in HIV-specific T cells in humanized mice and in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PWH. This restoration of CXCR5+ memory CD8 T cells was associated with HIV replication inhibition, delayed viral rebound and reduced HIV-1 pathogenesis upon cART cessation. This study suggests that CD24-Fc treatment could represent a promising new therapeutic strategy for managing chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH. Author summary Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) cannot block viral gene expression from activated HIV proviral DNA in reservoir cells, contributing to chronic immune activation and inflammation associated diseases in people with HIV (PWH). The therapeutic treatment of anti-inflammatory fusion protein CD24-Fc in humanized mice during suppressive cART (i) resolves inflammation and chronic HIV-1 immune pathogenesis during suppressive cART, (ii) rescues CXCR5-expressing CD8 memory T cells and enhances antiviral response in humanized mice and PWH PBMCs, (iii) delays virus rebound and reduces viral pathogenesis after cART cessation. Thus, CD24-Fc could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH.">

        <tr id="Chronic HIV infection drives B-cell dysfunction associated with the accumulation of tissue-like memory (TLMs) and activated memory B cells (MBCs) but decline in resting memory B cells. TLMs express multiple inhibitory receptors and lack response to soluble antigens. However, their origin and the mechanisms driving their expansion in HIV infection remain unclear. By using bulk BCR sequencing of memory B cell subsets from elite HIV controllers and an ART-controlled cohort, we revealed that TLMs (CD21- CD27- B cells) were significantly less mutated but also less diverse than other MBCs, suggesting an enrichment for innate-like B cells or that they belong to a less mature subset. Subsequent detailed multi-omics study of an immune response in an elite controller to a transient HIV viraemia demonstrated a functional increase in Env-reactive IgG and MBCs with non-TLM phenotype. Single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of PMBCs enriched for B cells revealed an orchestrated TNF-alpha response followed by interferon alpha and gamma response across all B cells subsets. We noted an emergence of innate-like extrafollicular PLD4+ plasmablasts and previously undepreciated heterogeneity of a stable TLM population. We identified two distinct TLM subsets: TLM1 (T-betlow) and TLM2 (T-bethi) that differed in their differentiation stage, isotype use and mutational burden. Surprisingly, both subsets (TLM1 more than TLM2) were enriched for IGHV4-34 segment use (associated with self-reactivity) and displayed a persistent activation and BCR signalling signature, indicating (with other BCR indices) a strong presence of innate-like B cells. However, pseudotime analyses revealed that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment. This study provides a new insight into multifaceted functional B-cell response to transient HIV viraemia as likely happens during the early phase of anti-retroviral therapy cessation, highlighting the TLM heterogeneity and the contribution of innate-like B cells which might have important clinical implications for anti-HIV vaccine and therapy design.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 antibodies (aPD1) can be effective in treating advanced cancers. However, many patients do not respond and the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. In this study, we profile a cohort of patients with locally-advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma undergoing aPD-1 therapy using single-cell RNA sequencing, high-definition spatial transcriptomics in tumors and draining lymph nodes, and spatial immunoreceptor profiling, with long-term clinical follow-up. We find that successful responses to PD-1 inhibition are characterized by an induction of B-cell receptor (BCR) clonal diversity after treatment initiation. These induced BCR clones spatially co-localize with T-cell clones, facilitate their activation, and traffic alongside them between tumor and draining lymph nodes to enhance tumor clearance. Furthermore, we validated aPD1-induced BCR diversity as a predictor of clinical response in a larger cohort of glioblastoma, melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, suggesting that this is a generalizable predictor of treatment response across many types of cancers. We discover that pre-treatment tumors harbor a characteristic gene expression signature that portends a higher probability of inducing BCR clonal diversity after aPD-1 therapy, and we develop a machine learning model that predicts PD-1-induced BCR clonal diversity from baseline tumor RNA sequencing. These findings underscore a dynamic role of B cell diversity during immunotherapy, highlighting its importance as a prognostic marker and a potential target for intervention in non-responders.">

        <tr id="Gamma delta (γδ) T cells are innate-like lymphocytes that in humans can be broadly classified into two main subtypes based on their unique TCRδ chain, Vδ1 and Vδ2. Both subsets have potent anti-tumor properties and the presence of Vδ1 cells in the tumor is often associated with positive prognosis. Herein, we investigated the molecular interplay between immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs), IC blockade (ICB) therapy and γδ T cells. We show that ICRs display differential expression and regulation by the JAK-STAT pathway in circulating Vδ1 and Vδ2 cells and identify constitutive (e.g. TIGIT, PD-1) and inducible (e.g. TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4) ICRs. In melanoma, Vδ1 cells, especially in patients who did not respond to ICB or required combination therapy, expressed high levels of ICR, TOX and inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) transcripts, reminiscent of an exhaustion transcriptional signature. At the same time all γδ T cells had a prominent downregulation in AP-1 transcription factors. Patient derived cells were functionally competent, although induction of LAG-3 and CTLA-4 was impaired. In the context of anti-PD-1 monotherapy, Vδ1 cells specifically bound high levels of therapeutic antibody but only in patients who responded to treatment, revealing a potential new prognostic marker for evaluating the efficacy of ICB therapy. Finally, expression of KIR genes in Vδ1 cells was downregulated in response to successful ICB therapy. Collectively, our data indicate an intricate relationship between ICRs, putatively also KIRs, and γδ T cells and reveal novel approaches by which these cells can be harnessed in order to discern or improve cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Repeated antigen exposure leads to T-cell exhaustion, a transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct cellular state marked by loss of effector functions (e.g., cytotoxicity, cytokine production/release), up-regulation of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1), and reduced proliferative capacity. Molecular pathways underlying T-cell exhaustion have been defined for CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but which factors drive exhaustion in CD4+ T cells, that are also required for an effective immune response against a tumor or infection, remains unclear. Here, we utilize quantitative proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic analyses to characterize the molecular basis of the dysfunctional cell state induced by chronic stimulation of CD4+ memory T cells. We identified a dynamic response encompassing both known and novel up-regulated cell surface receptors, as well as dozens of unexpected transcriptional regulators. Integrated causal network analysis of our combined data predicts the histone acetyltransferase p300 as a driver of aspects of this phenotype following chronic stimulation, which we confirmed via targeted small molecule inhibition. While our integrative analysis also revealed large-scale metabolic reprogramming, our independent investigation confirmed a global remodeling away from glycolysis to a dysfunctional fatty acid oxidation-based metabolism coincident with oxidative stress. Overall, these data provide both insights into the mechanistic basis of CD4+ T-cell exhaustion and serve as a valuable resource for future interventional studies aimed at modulating T-cell dysfunction.">

        <tr id="The parasitic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs), but so far little is known about their function in the interaction with the host immune system. Infection with E. histolytica trophozoites can lead to formation of amebic liver abscesses (ALAs), in which pro-inflammatory immune responses of Ly6Chi monocytes contribute to liver damage. Men exhibit a more severe pathology as the result of higher monocyte recruitment and a stronger immune response. To investigate the role of EVs and pathogenicity in the host immune response, we studied the effect of EVs secreted by low pathogenic EhA1 and highly pathogenic EhB2 amebae on monocytes. Size and quantity of isolated EVs from both clones were similar. However, they differed in their proteome and miRNA cargo, providing insight into factors potentially involved in amebic pathogenicity. In addition, EVs were enriched in proteins with signaling peptides compared with the total protein content of trophozoites. Exposure to EVs from both clones induced monocyte activation and a pro-inflammatory immune response as evidenced by increased surface presentation of the activation marker CD38 and upregulated gene expression of key signaling pathways (including NF-κB, IL-17 and TNF signaling). The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was increased in EV-stimulated monocytes and more so in male-than in female-derived cells. While EhA1 EV stimulation caused elevated myeloperoxidase (MPO) release by both monocytes and neutrophils, EhB2 EV stimulation did not, indicating the protective role of MPO during amebiasis. Collectively, our results suggest that parasite-released EVs contribute to the male-biased immunopathology mediated by pro-inflammatory monocytes during ALA formation. Author summary Parasites communicate with their host via small membranous extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can shuttle cargo and thus information between cells. The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica releases EVs but not much is known about their role in the interaction with the host immune system. Infection with E. histolytica can lead to amebic liver abscess (ALA) formation. Innate immune cells, particularly monocytes, contribute to liver damage by releasing microbicidal factors. Men have a more severe ALA pathology as the result of a stronger monocyte immune response. In this study, we analyzed the effect of EVs from differently virulent E. histolytica clones on monocytes to better understand their interaction. EVs of both clones were similar in size and quantity but differed in their cargo, which provides information on factors potentially involved in pathogenicity. Monocytes responded to EVs of both clones in a pro-inflammatory manner that reflected the immune processes occurring during ALA in vivo, including the bias towards the male sex. Only EVs of amebae with low pathogenicity, and not those released by the highly pathogenic clone, elicited secretion of the granular enzyme myeloperoxidase, which plays a protective role during ALA. Overall, our data suggest that EVs may contribute to liver injury.">

        <tr id="Patients with cancer often receive chemotherapy to control tumor progression and reduce disease symptoms. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents not only kill rapidly growing cancer cells but also reduce normal cells including myeloid cells, the main innate immune population involved in fighting infections and repairing tissue damages. Rapid loss of myeloid cells caused by chemotherapy triggers myelopoiesis, a process in which the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow regenerate myeloid cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages, to reconstitute the myeloid cell compartment. We previously reported that chemotherapy with an alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) in mice leads to repopulation of myeloid cells that acquire immunosuppressive activities within the monocyte subset. However, detailed information on the cellular composition and molecular identity of these chemotherapy- induced immunosuppressive monocytes is lacking. Here, we investigated how the various myeloid cell subsets in the bone marrow of mice respond to CTX chemotherapy through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNAseq). We found that myeloid progenitor cells and monocytes were reduced 2 days after chemotherapy but rebounded and surpassed their pretreatment levels by day 7. Further scRNAseq analysis of pre-enriched monocytes revealed that the monocyte population was heterogenous, and that chemotherapy tilted myelopoiesis towards the production of neutrophil-like monocytes (NeuMo). We identified Cxcr4 and Cx3cr1 as suitable markers for isolation of chemotherapy-induced NeuMo and demonstrated that these cells were suppressive to T cells. Together with the evidence that CTX-induced monocytes can promote breast cancer metastasis in mice, our data reveal the heterogeneity of the monocytes reemerging after chemotherapy and identify the NeuMo subset as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer.">

        <tr id="The CD2-CD58 pathway has been highlighted as a major player in anti-tumour T cell immunity. Our study reveals that the strength of CD2 costimulation significantly affects T cell activation, the average number of cell divisions, fold expansion, and IFN-γ production. Notably, proliferation parameters correlate positively with CD25 expression, suggesting a mechanism by which CD2 strength enhances T cell proliferation. We find that human brain cancer tumour-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells exhibit reduced levels of CD2, suggestive of a compromised CD2-signal strength in these cells. Through a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, we identified two epigenetic regulators, SUZ12 and BAP1, as positive modulators of CD2 expression. BAP1 is crucial for the upregulation and sustained high expression of CD2 following T cell activation. Our findings indicate also that CD2 is co-regulated with other co-stimulatory and inhibitory receptors, as well as factors related to T cell stemness, exhaustion, and metabolism, in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, we demonstrate that the loss of CD2 due to BAP1 knockout can be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylases. These insights enhance our understanding of CD2-mediated T cell regulation, identify regulators of this pathway and potential therapeutic targets within it.">

We previously showed, in immunodeficient context, that antimitotic chemotherapy induced cGAS/STING pathway amplifying antitumor response through a paracrine IFN-1 secretome. We herein studied tumor progression and response to treatment using an immunocompetent murine model. scRNAseq analysis revealed that paclitaxel treatment altered tumor cell phenotypes, favoring tumor cells with a gene expression signature indicative of active NF-κB pathway with secretory phenotype. Treatment coincidently reduced IFN-I signature cells during tumor progression. The resulting secretory shift correlated with neutrophil recruitment to the tumor, particularly CXCR2+ neutrophils, thereby contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 receptor by navarixin reactivated antitumor immunity, enhancing NK cell infiltration and tumor cytotoxicity. Navarixin combination with paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor volume and metastasis. Targeting the NF-κB-driven secretory phenotype, in particular through neutrophil modulation, holds promise for improving TNBC treatment outcomes.">

We analyzed the profile of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of control mouse skins and skin tumors at the single-cell level. We identified 15 CD45+ immune cell clusters, which broadly represent the most functionally characterized immune cell types including macrophages, Langerhans cells (LC), conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2), migratory/mature dendritic cells (mDC), dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC), dermal γδ T cells (γδT), T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer cells (NK), type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), neutrophils (Neu), mast cells (Mast), and two proliferating populations (Prolif.1 and Prolif.2). Skin tumor progression reprogramed immune cells and led to a marked increase in the relative percentages of macrophages, cDC2, mDC, Tregs, and Neu. Macrophages, the largest cell cluster of immune cells in skin tumors. In addition, macrophages emerged as the predominant communication ‘hub’ in skin tumors, highlighting the importance of macrophages during skin tumor progression. In contrast, other immune cell clusters decreased during skin tumor progression, including DETC, γδT, ILC2, and LC. In addition, skin tumor progression dramatically upregulated Jak2/Stat3 expression and the interferon response across various immune cell clusters. Further, skin tumor progression activated T cells and NK cells indicated by elevated expression of IFN-γ and Granzyme B in skin tumors. Meanwhile, a pronounced infiltration of M2-macrophages and Tregs in skin tumors created an immunosuppressive microenvironment, consistent with the elevated expression of the Stat3 pathway in skin tumors. In summary, our study elucidates the immune cell landscape of epidermal neoplasms, offering a comprehensive understanding of the immune response during skin tumor progression and providing new insights into cancer immune evasion mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Background Hepatocellular carcinoma represents a significant global health challenge, affecting over a million patients annually, arising mainly from chronic liver diseases, with a majority being related to viral infections. However, despite the groundbreaking clinical results of immune checkpoint blockades and adoptive cell therapies, we still face non-responders accompanied by high rebound rates after resection. Considering that the main concern is to overcome a highly specialized immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of the individual patient, the characterization of the particular tumor microenvironment and the source of the immune cells used in ACT is of immense importance. Approved ACT therapies mainly use modified peripheral blood cells from individuals. At the same time, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are underrepresented even if they have garnered interest due to their potential to target tumor-specific antigens more effectively. Methods In this study, we employed allogenic and autologous immune cell sources for expansion and stimulation, resulting in adoptive T-cell transfer experiments determining the effector cell differentiation and the related anti-tumor effects by the possible implementation of re-stimulation. Results We determined a high success rate in expanding and stimulating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with consistent CD8 T-cell fractions from HCC patients. To showcase the effectiveness of stimulated T-cells from different sources, we generated cell lines derived from the margin and center of an HBV-induced HCC with a highly immune-suppressive TME. We found effective immune responses supported by cell death induction, ferroptosis, proptosis and apoptosis triggered by all sources of T-cells depending on the area of derived tumor cells. Conclusion Effector T-cell fractions derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes present a viable source for cell-based immune therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in HCC patients, especially after resection, to suppress rebound strategies of the parental tumor on an individual level.">

        <tr id="Macrophages hold tremendous promise as effectors of cancer immunotherapy, but the best strategies to provoke these cells to attack tumors remain unknown. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting two distinct macrophage immune checkpoints: CD47 and CD24. We found that antibodies targeting these antigens could elicit maximal levels of phagocytosis when combined together in vitro. However, to our surprise, via unbiased genome-wide CRISPR screens, we found that CD24 primarily acts as a target of opsonization rather than an immune checkpoint. In a series of in vitro and in vivo genetic validation studies, we found that CD24 was neither necessary nor sufficient to protect cancer cells from macrophage phagocytosis in most mouse and human tumor models. Instead, anti-CD24 antibodies exhibit robust Fc-dependent activity, and as a consequence, they cause significant on-target hematologic toxicity in mice. To overcome these challenges and leverage our findings for therapeutic purposes, we engineered a collection of 77 novel bispecific antibodies that bind to a tumor antigen with one arm and engage macrophages with the second arm. We discovered multiple novel bispecifics that maximally activate macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity and reduce binding to healthy blood cells, including bispecifics targeting macrophage immune checkpoint molecules in combination with EGFR, TROP2, and CD71. Overall, our findings indicate that CD47 predominates over CD24 as a macrophage immune checkpoint in cancer, and that the novel bispecifics we created may be optimal immunotherapies to direct myeloid cells to eradicate solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Staphylococcus aureus prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are broadly considered incurable, and clinical diagnostics that guide conservative vs. aggressive surgical treatments don’t exist. Multi-omics studies in a humanized NSG-SGM3 BLT mouse model demonstrate human T cells: 1) are remarkably heterogenous in gene expression and numbers, and 2) exist as a mixed population of activated, progenitor-exhausted, and terminally-exhausted Th1/Th17 cells with increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (LAG3, TIM-3). Importantly, these proteins are upregulated in the serum and the bone marrow of S. aureus PJI patients. A multiparametric nomogram combining high serum immune checkpoint protein levels with low proinflammatory cytokine levels (IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-17) revealed that TIM-3 was highly predictive of adverse disease outcomes (AUC=0.89). Hence, T cell impairment in the form of immune checkpoint expression and exhaustion could be a functional biomarker for S. aureus PJI disease outcome, and blockade of checkpoint proteins could potentially improve outcomes following surgery.">

        <tr id="Immune exclusion inhibits anti-tumor immunity and response to immunotherapy, but its mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that Trophoblast Cell-Surface Antigen 2 (TROP2), a key target of emerging anti-cancer Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), controls barrier-mediated immune exclusion in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) through Claudin 7 association and tight junction regulation. TROP2 expression is inversely correlated with T cell infiltration and strongly associated with outcomes in TNBC. Loss-of-function and reconstitution experiments demonstrate TROP2 is sufficient to drive tumor progression in vivo in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner, while its loss deregulates expression and localization of multiple tight junction proteins, enabling T cell infiltration. Employing a humanized TROP2 syngeneic TNBC model, we show that TROP2 targeting via hRS7, the antibody component of Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), enhances the anti-PD1 response associated with improved T cell accessibility and effector function. Correspondingly, TROP2 expression is highly associated with lack of response to anti-PD1 therapy in human breast cancer. Thus, TROP2 controls an immune exclusion program that can be targeted to enhance immunotherapy response. Synopsis This study defines a new mechanism of barrier-mediated immune exclusion in cancer controlled by TROP2-dependent tight junctions. This mechanism drives tumor progression but can be targeted via TROP2-directed antibody drug conjugates to activate anti-tumor immunity and enhance immunotherapy response.">

In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

In this study, we employed advanced techniques to investigate the functional state of T cells engineered with retroviral vectors to express a TCR specific for the NY-ESO-1 157-165 peptide in the HLA-A*02:01 context. Flow cytometry revealed a predominance of naïve T cells. Gene expression profiling using NanoString technology revealed upregulation of genes encoding chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5, indicating enhanced migration towards tumor sites. In the SK-Mel-37 xenograft model, these transduced T cells achieved complete tumor eradication. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) conducted 14 days post-TCR T cell infusion provided a comprehensive analysis of the in vivo adaptation of these cells, identifying a distinct subset of CD8+ effector T cells with an NK cell-like gene expression profile. Our findings indicate that NY-ESO-1 TCR-transduced T cells have the potential to mediate dual antitumor effects through both antigen-independent NK-like and antigen-specific CTL-like responses.

How cells are assembled at PVNs and the activation signals imparted within remain unclear. Here, we integrate dynamic time-resolved in vivo imaging with a novel spatially-resolved platform for microanatomical interrogation of transcriptome, immune phenotype and inflammatory mediators in skin PVNs. We uncover a complex positive-feedback loop within CXCL10+ PVNs that regulates myeloid and Th1 cell positioning for exchange of critical signals for Th1 activation. Th1 cells spend ∼24h in the PVN, receiving initial peripheral activation signals, before redeploying to the inflamed dermal parenchyma. Niche-enriched, CCR2-dependent myeloid cells were critical for Th1 IFNγ-production. In turn, PVN instructional signals enabled Th1s to orchestrate PVN assembly by CXCR2-dependent intra-tissue myeloid cell aggregation. The results reveal a critical tissue organizing role for Th1s, gained rapidly on tissue entry, that could be exploited to boost regional immunity.

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Keloids, characterized by excessive scar tissue resulting from abnormal wound healing, are primarily driven by hyperproliferative fibroblasts and overproduction of extracellular matrix. Although human natural killer (NK) cells are known for their role in inhibiting uncontrolled cell growth through cytokines like IFN-γ and TNF-α, they also produce amphiregulin (AREG), which paradoxically promotes cell proliferation and survival. The involvement of NK cells in keloid pathogenesis, however, remains largely unexplored. This study uncovers remarkable functional changes in NK cells within both lesional skin and the blood of keloid patients. In the skin, NK cell-produced IFN-γ plays a pivotal role in limiting keloid progression by inducing fibroblast apoptosis and curbing excessive extracellular matrix production, while NK cell-derived AREG actively opposes these protective effects. Notably, TGF-β-driven fibroblasts in keloid lesions further dampen NK cell IFN-γ production, revealing a complex and dynamic cellular interplay. In the bloodstream of keloid patients, a distinct NK cell subset emerges, marked by elevated interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and diminished IFN-γ production, which correlates with increased plasma IFN-β levels. This elevated IFN-β serves as a key initiating factor, driving NK cell exhaustion through impaired mitochondrial function and metabolic disruption. These findings highlight a critical mechanism underlying the functional abnormalities of keloid-associated NK cells and emphasize the influence of both local and systemic factors in shaping NK cell responses in keloid pathogenesis. Graphical abstract Highlights In the skin, NK cell-derived IFN-γ is crucial for suppressing keloid fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix production. AREG from NK cells counteracts the inhibitory effects of IFN-γ on keloid progression. In the blood, elevated IFN-β in keloid patients drives the emergence of ISG+NK cells with reduced IFN-γ production. IFN-β induces mitochondrial dysfunction and functional exhaustion in NK cells.">

During viral infection, their number increases, suggesting an involvement in antiviral responses. These cells do not derive from naive cells and are thought to develop in the thymus. This study identified two subsets of Ly49+ CD8 T cells, based on CD8β expression, in mice and humans. Lineage tracing and reliance on the transcription factor Zeb1 indicate a thymic origin via agonist selection. scRNAseq analysis revealed that a small fraction of CD8αβ-Ly49+ cells acquired an effector profile during vaccinia virus infection. Moreover, the majority of Ly49+ CD8 T cells seems to respond to cytokine-driven bystander signals. In vitro, these signals promoted the expression of effector molecules such as IFNγ and granzyme B, as well as the homing chemokine receptor CXCR5, potentially driving their recruitment to germinal centers. Summary This study shows that Ly49+ CD8 T cells comprises two subsets that develop in the thymus through agonist selection. In viral infection, both subsets respond to bystander stimuli that could drive their regulatory activity. Furthermore, some CD8αβ-expressing Ly49+ cells exert TCR-mediated antiviral response.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Although tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) has been recognized as an attractive next-generation candidate target for cancer immunotherapy, the factors that regulate the gene expression and their mechanistic effects on tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Treg cells) remain poorly understood. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was employed to analyze the phenotypic and functional differences between TNFR2+ Treg cells and TNFR2− Treg cells. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) from humans and mouse was used to investigate the potential mechanisms by which lactate regulates TNFR2 expression. Results Treg cells with high TNFR2 expression exhibited elevated levels of immune checkpoint molecules. Additionally, the high expression of TNFR2 on Treg cells was positively correlated with a poor prognosis in MPE patients. Moreover, we revealed that lactate upregulated TNFR2 expression on Treg cells, thereby enhancing their immunosuppressive function in MPE. Mechanistically, lactate modulated the gene transcription of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB p65 (NF-κB p65) through histone H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la), subsequently upregulating the gene expression of TNFR2 and expediting the progression of MPE. Notably, lactate metabolism blockade combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy effectively enhanced the efficacy of ICB therapy, prolonged the survival time of MPE mice, and improved immunosuppression in the microenvironment of MPE. Conclusions The study explains the mechanism that regulates TNFR2 expression on Treg cells and its function in MPE progression, providing novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of tumor development and metabolic strategies for MPE treatment by targeting lactate metabolism in Treg cells.">

        <tr id="Background T-cell-based therapies achieved milestones in targeting solid tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, by leveraging the cytotoxic potential of effector memory T-cells. However, a key challenge lies in the ex-vivo expansion of functional memory T-cells while simultaneously preventing over-differentiation into senescent TEMRA cells. Methods PBMC derived from 10 HCC patients and two healthy donors were used for expansion in small bioreactors equipped with a permeable membrane for 2 weeks. During expansion, surface marker composition, cytokine and chemokine production were observed. Enriched T-cell subsets from three patients with chronic HBV infection were analysed in detail. We extracted the enriched complement of one chronically infected patient to elucidate the therapeutic potential. Results We successfully expanded the effector T-cell subsets for all investigated samples and consistently enriched the cell amount over time. Subsequently, we showed that the expanded patient-derived T-cells showed functionality against autologous liver cancer-derived cells by inducing receptor and protein-mediated cell death. Conclusion We showed the consistent ex-vivo expansion of T-cell subsets of initial patient-derived PBMCs. The enriched subsets exhibit cytotoxic functionality and shift to cytolytic TEMRA cells in an immune evasion setting in the context of chronic HBV-infected patient-derived liver cancer cells.">

        <tr id="To initiate T cell-mediated immunity, dendritic cells (DCs) present antigens to specific T cells through the establishment of an immune synapse (IS). While the molecular mechanisms behind the formation of the IS on the T cell side are well understood, how IS components are organized at the DC membrane remain ill-defined. Galectins, a family of β-galactoside binding proteins, modulate immune cell function via the establishment of specific glycan-dependent or independent interactions. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms that underlie galectin function are poorly described and very little is known regarding their contribution to DC-mediated T cell activation. Here, we demonstrate that intracellular galectin-9 (gal9) in DCs is required for T cell activation. Murine and human DCs lacking gal9 showed impaired induction of CD4+, but not CD8+, T cell proliferation, suggesting a conserved function for gal9 in modulating DC–T cell interactions. Live-cell imaging revealed that galectin-9-depleted DCs fail to establish stable ISs with T cells, resulting in reduced T cell activation and proliferation. Unbiased co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified HLA-II as a gal9 binding partner in DCs, and we observed a marked reduction of HLA-II recruitment to the immune synapse in DCs lacking gal9. Conditional gal9 knockout in DCs led to enhanced tumor growth in vivo, compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts, underscoring a role for gal9 in T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, this study provides the first detailed account of gal9-mediated HLA-II organization at the synaptic site of DCs, revealing a novel mechanism by which galectins orchestrate immune receptor positioning from within the cytoplasm to enhance CD4+ T cell activation.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer (OC) is the sixth most common malignancy in women and the poor 5-year survival emphasises the need for novel therapies. NK cells play an important role in the control of malignant disease but the nature of tumour-infiltrating and peripheral NK cells in OC remains unclear.Using flow cytometric analysis, we studied the phenotype and function of NK cells in blood, primary tumour and metastatic tissue in 80 women with OC. The cell type contexture of metastatic OC tissue was explored utilising scRNAseq analysis, with a focus on portraying an immunogenic tumour microenvironment and determining the characteristics of a dysfunctional NK cell population.The proportion of peripheral NK cells was markedly elevated with a highly activated profile and increased cytotoxicity. In contrast, NK cell numbers in primary tumour and metastasis were substantially reduced, with downregulation of activatory receptors together with elevated PD-1 expression. scRNA-Seq identified 5 NK cell subpopulations along with increased exhausted and immature NK cells within tumour tissue compared to normal tissue. These features were attenuated following chemotherapy where higher levels of activated and cytotoxic NK cells associated with improved disease-free survival. Correlation of NK cell phenotype with clinical outcomes revealed high levels of DNAM-1 expression on tissue-localised and peripheral NK cells to be associated with reduced survival. Expression of PVR, the DNAM-1 ligand, was significantly increased on tumours and DNAM-1 mediated NK cell lysis of primary tumour tissue was observed in vitro.These findings reveal profound modulation of the tumour tissue and systemic profile of NK cells which likely contributes to the high rates of local progression and metastasis seen with OC. Immunotherapeutic approaches that overcome local immune suppression and enhance DNAM-1-targeted lysis of OC offer the potential to improve disease control.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) are a promising new class of therapeutics for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. A frequently observed, yet incompletely understood effect of this treatment is the transient reduction of circulating T cell counts, also known as T cell margination (TCM). After administration of the GPRC5D-targeting TCB forimtamig (RG6234), TCM occurred in patients and correlated with cytokine release and soluble B cell maturation antigen decrease. We demonstrate that TCM is accurately represented in the humanized NSG mouse model and occurs at a lower threshold of target expression than systemic cytokine release. Application of whole-mouse tissue clearing and 3D imaging revealed that T cells accumulate in the bone marrow after treatment. We hypothesize that low amounts of targets are sufficient to rapidly redirect T cells upon TCB engagement. Therefore, we propose TCM as a beneficial, highly sensitive and early effect of forimtamig that leads T cells to likely sites of bone marrow tumor lesions.">

However, rare naive B cells infrequently participate in immune responses. We investigated how germline-targeting vaccine antigen delivery and adjuvant selection affect priming of exceptionally rare BG18-like HIV broadly neutralizing antibody-precursor B cells (~1 in 50 million) in non-human primates. Only escalating dose (ED) priming immunization using the saponin adjuvant SMNP elicited detectable BG18-like cells in germinal centers (GCs). All groups had strong GC responses, but only ED+SMNP and bolus+SMNP induced BG18-like memory B cells in >50% of animals. One group had vaccine-specific GC responses equivalent to ED+SMNP, but BG18-like memory B cells were rarely detected. Following homologous boosting, BG18-like memory B cells were more frequent in a bolus priming group, but had lower somatic hypermutation and affinities. This outcome was inversely associated with post-prime antibody titers, suggesting antibody feedback can significantly influence rare precursor B cell responses.">

Here we extend these findings to encompass a wide range of monovalent and bivalent SMAC mimetic compounds, demonstrating that live cell phagocytosis is a class effect of these agents. We demonstrate robust phagocytosis of live pancreatic and breast cancer cells by primary human macrophages across a range of healthy donors. Unlike mouse macrophages where combination of SMAC mimetics with lymphotoxin enhanced phagocytosis, human macrophages were more efficiently polarized to phagocytose live cells by the combination of SMAC mimetics and IFNψ.

        <tr id="Pathogens have developed multiple strategies to modulate host immune defense mechanisms. Understanding how this is achieved has potential to inform novel therapeutics for diseases caused by immune dysfunction. Parasitic helminths are masters of immune evasion, via release of secreted products, resulting in chronic infection. Helminths secrete small regulatory microRNA (miRNAs), which can interact with host cells. Here we show that a single parasite miRNA (miR-5352), conserved across gastrointestinal (GI) nematodes, suppresses IL-13-induced GI epithelial cell differentiation and cytokine responses, and promotes stem cell maintenance. Mechanistically, this is achieved through targeted repression of critical host factors, including Klf-4 and the IL-22 receptor, together with modulation of Wnt and Notch signalling pathways. Nematode miR-5352 shows seed sequence conservation with mammalian miR-92a family members, indicating that through convergent evolution, GI nematodes exploit a host miRNA regulatory network to suppress host innate responses, promote tissue regeneration and establish a favourable environment for chronic infection.">

Yet, current clinical intervention strategies do not mitigate inflammation sequalae necessitating the development of innovative approaches to reduce inflammation and minimize deleterious effects of TBI.

In vitro, the paKG(PFK15+PLP) vaccine formulation stimulated proliferation of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and induced generation of T helper-2 cells. When given subcutaneously in the periphery to two weeks prior to mice sustaining a TBI, the active vaccine formulation increased frequency of immunosuppressive macrophages and dendritic cells in the periphery and the brain at day 7 post- TBI and by 28 days post-TBI enhanced PLP-specific immunosuppressive cells infiltrated the brain. While immunohistology measurements of neuroinflammation were not altered 28 days post-TBI, the vaccine formulation improved motor function and enhanced autophagy mediated genes in a spatial manner in the brain. Overall, these data suggest that the TBI vaccine formulation successfully induced an anti-inflammatory profile and decreased TBI-associated inflammation.

In-house generated anti-VSIG4 nanobody constructs that are antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-enabled allowed a selective elimination of the VSIG4+ LPM subset without affecting the overall LPM content of the peritoneal cavity. This strategy uncovered a role for VSIG4+ LPMs in lowering the first peak of parasitemia in a Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection model and in reducing the outgrowth of CRC cells in the peritoneal cavity, a prime metastatic site in CRC patients. Altogether, our data uncover a protective role for VSIG4+ LPMs in infectious and oncological diseases in the peritoneal cavity.">

Furthermore, EV treatment of monocytes induced a novel anti‐inflammatory phenotype characterised by CD14+, CD16−, CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2−) and programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1)+ cells. In addition, Ascaris EVs induced T cell anergy in a monocyte‐dependent mechanism. Targeting professional phagocytes to induce both direct and indirect pathways of immune modulation presents a highly novel and efficient mechanism of EV‐mediated host‐parasite communication. Intra‐peritoneal administration of EVs induced protection against gut inflammation in the dextran sodium sulphate model of colitis in mice. Ascaris EVs were shown to affect circulating immune cells and protect against gut inflammation; this highlights their potential as a subject for further investigation in inflammatory conditions driven by dysregulated immune responses. However, their clinical translation would require further studies and careful consideration of ethical implications.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, referred to as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, particularly in combating viral infections and malignancies. CD8 T cells, derived from bone marrow progenitors and matured in the thymus, play an essential role in immune defense through their cytotoxic activity. These cells are distinguished by their ability to recognize and eliminate cells that present specific antigens via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Upon activation by antigen recognition, they proliferate and differentiate into effector cells capable of eliminating infected or abnormal cells.CD8+ T cells develop in the thymus and express the CD8 co-receptor, which interacts specifically with MHC class I molecules. When a naïve CD8+ T cell encounters an antigen-presenting cell (APC) displaying an antigen bound to MHC class I, it undergoes activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells. The primary function of these cells is to eliminate infected or malignant cells by inducing apoptosis through the release of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes or by engaging death receptors on target cells. Over the past few decades, CD8+ T cells have garnered significant attention for their potential in immunotherapy, particularly in cancer treatment. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of CD8+ T cells in immunotherapy, their mechanisms of action, and the challenges associated with harnessing their full potential.

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of adaptive immunity, guiding T helper (Th) cell differentiation through antigen presentation, co-stimulation, and cytokine production. However, in steady-state conditions, certain DC subsets, such as Langerhans cells (LCs), induce T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and B cell responses without inflammatory stimuli. Using multiple mouse models and in vitro systems, we investigated the mechanisms underlying steady-state LC-induced adaptive immune responses. We found that LCs drive germinal center Tfh and B cell differentiation and antibody production independently of interleukin-6 (IL-6), type-I interferons, and ICOS ligand (ICOS-L) signaling, which are critical in inflammatory settings. Instead, these responses relied on CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation. Our findings challenge the conventional three-signal paradigm by demonstrating that cytokine signaling is dispensable for LC-mediated Tfh and B cell responses in steady-state. These insights provide a framework for understanding homeostatic immunity and the immune system’s role in maintaining tolerance or developing autoimmunity under non-inflammatory conditions. SUMMARY STATEMENT Langerhans cells (LCs) drive germinal center Tfh and B cell responses in steady-state conditions independently of IL-6, type-I interferons, and ICOS ligand, challenging the established cytokine-centric model of T cell differentiation.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Rich cytotoxic T-cell infiltration in cancerous tissues is associated with better clinical prognosis. A major obstacle to tumor T cell infiltration can be the scarcity of adhesion molecules expressed by the growing tumor neo-vasculature that limits the binding and extravasation of effector lymphocytes. In the present study, we aimed at reversing this endothelial cell anergy in vitro by using bispecific antibodies that redirect T cells to endothelial cell growth factor receptors and mediate T cell activation via CD3 and costimulation via CD28 in direct contact with endothelial cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of T cells and endothelial cells resulted in a profound upregulation of adhesion molecules due to the secretion of proinflammatory T cell cytokines. T-cell adhesion to previously quiescent endothelial cells, as well as their capacity to migrate through an endothelial cell monolayer and subsequently kill breast cancer cell spheroids, was greatly augmented.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) is often associated with metastasis and recurrence and is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. In the progression of CRC, recent studies have highlighted the critical role of neutrophils, particularly tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs). TANs have both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing activities, contributing to metastasis, immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Tumor-promoting TANs promote tumor growth by releasing proteases, reactive oxygen species, and cytokines, whereas tumor-suppressing TANs enhance immune responses by activating T cells and natural killer cells. Understanding the mechanisms underlying TAN mobilization, plasticity, and their role in the tumor microenvironment has revealed potential therapeutic targets. This review provides a comprehensive overview of TAN biology in CRC and discusses both the tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing functions of neutrophils. Novel therapeutic approaches targeting TANs, such as chemokine receptor antagonists, aim to modulate neutrophil reprogramming and offer promising avenues for improving treatment outcomes of CRC.">

        <tr id="Glutamine metabolism is essential for T cell activation and functions. The inhibition of glutaminolysis impairs Th17 cell differentiation and alters Th1 cell functions. There is evidence for an active glutaminolysis in the immune cells of lupus patients. Treatment of lupus-prone mice with glutaminolysis inhibitors ameliorated disease in association with a reduced frequency of Th17 cells. This study was performed to determine the role of glutaminolysis in murine Tfh cells, a critical subset of helper CD4+ T cells in lupus that provide help to autoreactive B cells to produce autoantibodies. We showed that lupus Tfh present a high level of glutamine metabolism. The pharmacological inhibition of glutaminolysis with DON had little effect on the Tfh cells of healthy mice, but it reduced the expression of the critical costimulatory molecule ICOS on lupus Tfh cells, in association with a reduction of autoantibody production, germinal center B cell dynamics, as well as a reduction of the frequency of atypical age-related B cells and plasma cells. Accordingly, profound transcriptomic and metabolic changes, including an inhibition of glycolysis, were induced in lupus Tfh cells by DON, while healthy Tfh cells showed little changes. The T cell-specific inhibition of glutaminolysis by deletion of the gene encoding for the glutaminase enzyme GLS1 largely phenocopied the effects of DON on Tfh cells and B cells in an autoimmune genetic background with little effect in a congenic control background. These results were confirmed in an induced model of lupus. Finally, we showed that T cell-specific Gls1 deletion impaired T- dependent humoral responses in autoimmune mice as well as their Tfh response to a viral infection. Overall, these results demonstrated a greater intrinsic requirement of lupus Tfh cells for their helper functions, and they suggest that targeting glutaminolysis may be beneficial to treat lupus.">

        <tr id="Introduction Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a predominant subset of innate-like T cells in humans, characterized by diverse gene expression profiles and functional capabilities. However, the factors influencing the transcriptomes and effector functions of MAIT cells, particularly at mucosal barriers, remain largely unclear. Methods In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and functional assays to investigate the transcriptomic and functional characteristics of intestinal MAIT cells in mouse models during aging. We also extended scRNA-seq analysis to human intestinal MAIT cells to compare their gene expression patterns with those observed in aged mice. Results Our findings demonstrated that the transcriptomes and functional capabilities of intestinal MAIT cells shifted from MAIT17 to MAIT1 profiles with aging in mouse models, with notable changes in the production of cytotoxic molecules. Further scRNA-seq analysis of human intestinal MAIT cells revealed a segregation into MAIT1 and MAIT17 subsets, displaying gene expression patterns that mirrored those seen in aged mouse models. The transcription factor RORγt was expressed in both MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, acting to repress IFNγ production while promoting IL17 expression. Moreover, reduced expression of RORC and Il17A was correlated with poorer survival outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. Discussion These results suggest that aging induces a functional shift between MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, which may be influenced by transcriptional regulators like RORγt. The observed alterations in MAIT cell activity could potentially impact disease prognosis, particularly in colorectal cancer. This study provides new insights into the dynamics of MAIT cell responses at mucosal barriers, highlighting possible therapeutic targets for modulating MAIT cell functions in aging and disease.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are specialized lymphocytes that help protect against viruses and cancer. However, in the context of bacterial infections, NK cells can be harmful, rather than protective. Such immune pathogenesis by NK cells has been linked to the over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In this context, IFN-γ-deficient mice display increased survival rates in response to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which causes life-threatening, invasive systemic infections with high mortality rates in humans. However, little is known about how NK cells respond to S. aureus in humans. In this study, we found that the peripheral blood of patients with bloodstream S. aureus infection was enriched for NKG2A+ NK cells with greater cytokine producing capacity, compared to those hospitalized with Escherichia coli bloodstream infections. As a possible mechanistic cause, superantigens from S. aureus promoted the expansion of CD57− NKG2A+ NK cells which produced IFN-γ through an IL-12-independent mechanism and exhibited reduced levels of CD16 compared to unstimulated NK cells. These data suggest that S. aureus bloodstream infection in humans promotes a phenotypic shift towards NKG2A+ NK cells with greater IFN-γ producing capacity, providing a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis. AUTHOR SUMMARY Natural Killer (NK) cells are specialized immune cells that provide crucial defence against viruses but can also respond to bacterial infections, especially in humans. During bloodstream infection by Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in humans, NK cells may actually be harmful, rather than protective, to the host. However, very little is known about the NK cell response to invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections in humans. Here, we show that human patients with bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli, infections have an increased frequency of NK cells with increased pro-inflammatory capacity. Furthermore, we show that toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which help the bacteria evade the protective effects of T cells the immune system (“superantigens”), promoted the expansion of these pro-inflammatory NK cells, providing a possible mechanistic cause for their increased presence in patients with bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus infections. Collectively, these results suggest that Staphylococcus aureus infection triggers phenotypic and functional changes in NK cells that provide a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis">

While representing interesting targets for immunomodulatory therapies in inflammation-driven intestinal diseases, their detailed functioning is poorly understood. Although two distinct intestinal tuft cell types have been described, we reveal common intermediary transcriptomes among tuft cells in mouse and human. Tuft cell-specific reporter knock-ins in organoids show that the two tuft types are sequentially expressed transcriptomic states that represent different maturation stages. Moreover, cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 only induce lineage specification to Nrep+ tuft-1 cells, while BMP and cholinergic signalling advance differentiation towards immune-related ChAT+ tuft-2 phenotypes. Functionally, both tuft cell states have chemosensory capacity and respond to stimuli like succinate, but reaction probability increases during tuft cell maturation. Our tuft type-specific reporters and optimized differentiation strategy in organoids provide an experimental platform to study the functioning of tuft cells and their unique chemosensory properties.">

Recent advancements, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cells and cytokine-based stimulation, have demonstrated enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects compared to conventional immunotherapies. However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a significant obstacle, imposing challenges like immune checkpoint activation, cytokine suppression, and metabolic constraints that impair NK cell activity.

We made a novel conditional CD206 (Mrc1) knock-in mouse to specifically visualize and/or deplete CD206+ TAMs. Early depletion of CD206+ macrophages and monocytes (Mono/Macs) led to the indirect loss of conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1), CD8 T cells, and NK cells in tumors. CD206+ TAMs robustly expressed CXCL9, contrasting with stress-responsive Spp1-expressing TAMs and immature monocytes, which became prominent with early depletion. CD206+ TAMs differentially attracted activated CD8 T cells, and the NK and CD8 T cells in CD206-depleted tumors were deficient in Cxcr3 and cDC1-supportive Xcl1 and Flt3l expressions. Disrupting this key antitumor axis decreased tumor control by antigen-specific T cells in mice. In human cancers, a CD206Replete, but not a CD206Depleted Mono/Mac gene signature correlated robustly with CD8 T cell, cDC1, and NK signatures and was associated with better survival. These findings negate the unqualified classification of CD206+ "M2-like" macrophages as immunosuppressive.">

Here, we describe an additional layer to this process, essential when pathogen-derived signals alone cannot directly achieve full DC activation.

We unveil a pivotal initiating role for Vψ1+ ψδ T cells, as they directly supply IL-4 to DC and CD8 T cells. IL-4 synergises with a CD4 T cell-derived CD40L signal to induce IL-12 production by cDC1. Both IL-12 and IL-4 then directly signal CD8 T cells, with synergy between these cytokines driving enhanced IL-12 receptor expression and expansion of responding CD8 T cells. This study reveals a key role for Vψl+ ψδ T cells in initiating CD8 T cell immunity to Plasmodium. More broadly, it shows that responses to some pathogens require help from innate-like T cells to pass an initiation threshold and further amplify the response in a process underscored by IL-4 production.">

        <tr id="Introduction CAR-T cell therapy is associated with life-threatening inflammatory toxicities, partly due to the activation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines by bystander myeloid cells (BMCs). However, due to limited clinical data, it is unclear whether CAR-NK cells cause similar toxicities. Methods We characterized the soluble factors (SFs) released by activated human CAR-T and CAR-NK cells and assessed their role in BMC activation (BMCA). Results We found that SFs from both activated, peripheral blood-derived CAR-T (PB-CAR-T) and CAR-NK (PB-CAR-NK) cells induced BMCA; however, PB-CAR-NK cells caused significantly lower BMCA compared to PB-CAR-T cells. Interestingly, SFs from cord-blood-derived (CB) NK cells caused little to no BMCA, consistent with previous clinical studies showing minimal inflammatory toxicity with CB-CAR-NK cells. Comparative analysis of SFs released by PB-NK and PB-CAR-NK cells following CAR-dependent and CAR-independent activation revealed several candidate factors with the potential to cause BMCA. Antibody-mediated neutralization studies identified a combination of four factors that contribute to PB-CAR-NK cell-mediated BMCA. siRNA-mediated knockdown studies confirmed that inactivating these four factors in PB-CAR-NK cells significantly reduces BMCA. Importantly, neutralization or knockdown of these four factors did not affect CAR-NK cell potency. Discussion These data suggest that specific SFs released by PB-CAR-NK cells activate BMCs and have the potential to contribute to inflammatory toxicities. Furthermore, inactivation of these four factors in PB-CAR-NK cells could reduce inflammatory toxicities and improve safety of PB-CAR-NK cell therapy without compromising potency.">

        <tr id="The lack of persistence and short-term efficacy presents a major challenge for CAR-NK cell therapy. Here, we addressed this issue by developing pluripotent stem cell-derived NK lineage-committed progenitor (iNKP) cell therapy. For the first time, we generated abundant iNKP cells via an organoid culture system. The iNKP cells, engineered to express CXCR4 and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), efficiently migrated to the bone marrow and generated CAR-iNK cells persisting in peripheral blood (PB) for over 80 days. Notably, CAR-iNKP cell therapy durably protected animals from tumour occurrence. Furthermore, a single low-dose infusion of CAR-iNKP cells following conventional chemotherapy eradicated minimal residual disease (MRD), leading to long-term complete remission. Our findings present a novel strategy to overcome the limitations of traditional CAR-NK cell therapy and offer dural breakthroughs for the prevention of tumour occurrence and relapse.">

Mounting evidence indicates that T cell senescence constitutes the primary mechanism underlying T cell dysfunction in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and represents one of the potential causes of immunotherapy failure. AML usually progresses rapidly and is highly susceptible to drug resistance, thereby resulting in recurrence and patient mortality. Hence, disrupting the immune interface within the bone marrow microenvironment of AML has emerged as a critical objective for synergistically enhancing tumor immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the general characteristics, distinctive phenotypes, and regulatory signaling networks of senescent T cells and highlight their potential clinical significance in the bone marrow microenvironment of AML. Additionally, we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for alleviating and reversing T cell senescence.">

        <tr id="Tumors can exert a far-reaching influence on the body, triggering systemic responses that contribute to debilitating conditions like cancer cachexia. To characterize the mechanisms underlying tumor-host interactions, we utilized a BioID-based proximity labeling method to identify proteins secreted by Ykiact adult Drosophila gut tumors into the bloodstream/hemolymph. Among the major proteins identified are coagulation and immune-responsive factors that contribute to the systemic wasting phenotypes associated with Ykiact tumors. The effect of innate immunity factors is mediated by NFκB transcription factors Relish, dorsal, and Dif, which in turn upregulate the expression of the cachectic factors Pvf1, Impl2, and Upd3. In addition, Ykiact tumors secrete Eiger, a TNF-alpha homolog, which activates the JNK signaling pathway in neighboring non-tumor cells, leading to cell death. The release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from these dying cells presumably amplifies the inflammatory response, exacerbating systemic wasting. Targeting the inflammatory response, the JNK pathway, or the production of cachectic factors could potentially alleviate the debilitating effects of cancer cachexia.">

        <tr id="Antigen presentation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effects of IFN-γ and a cytokine mix (5MIX: IL-1α, IL-17A, IL-22, OsM, and TNF-α) on the antigen-presenting capabilities of keratinocytes, with a specific focus on immune-mediated dermatological conditions such as psoriasis (Ps). To achieve this, keratinocytes were treated with IFN-γ and 5MIX, and their impact on the expression of key antigen-presentation molecules, HLA-DRα and CD74, was assessed. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that IFN-γ alone altered the expression of 254 genes, highlighting its central role in modulating immune responses, including the recruitment of immune cells and regulation of inflammation. Temporal experiments further demonstrated that IFN-γ and 5MIX enhanced early endocytic activity and lysosomal degradation pathways, both essential for effective antigen presentation and T-cell activation. To extend these findings to a clinical context, a co-culture model using keratinocytes derived from psoriatic patients was established. This model revealed increased cytokine production following antigen stimulation, indicating robust and consistent CD4+ and naïve T-cell responses. These results elucidate the complex dynamics of cytokine signaling and antigen presentation in keratinocytes, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated skin disorders like Ps.">

        <tr id="The dialogue between T and B cells can be regulated by different mechanisms, such as co-inhibitory receptors, which therefore play a crucial role in preventing autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed on many myeloid and lymphoid cells. Although peripheral B cells express a very high amount of BTLA, previous works in the context of autoimmunity mainly focused on T cells, and whether BTLA expression on B cells plays a role in the lupus pathogenesis is still unclear. In the present study, we examine the expression of BTLA, as well as its ligand HVEM (Herpesvirus Entry Mediator), on various B cell subsets in lupus patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). We evidenced the existence of double-negative (DN; IgD−CD27−) memory B cells expressing very low levels of BTLA, which are enhanced in active lupus patients. An in-depth analysis revealed that these BTLAlow DN cells mainly correspond to the newly reported DN3 B cell subset, originally described in the context of SARS-CoV2 infection. These cells display an activated and antibody-secreting cell phenotype, and we propose that their low BTLA expression may favor their expansion and rapid differentiation into plasmablasts in lupus patients.">

However, their role in periodontal disease (PD), a microbially induced inflammatory oral disease, remains understudied. Here we show that gingiva (gums) from PD patients exhibit significantly higher levels of MDSC markers including Granulocytic (G)-MDSC and Monocytic (M)-MDSC subsets as well as CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells. Gingival MDSC subsets exhibit potent immunoregulatory activity as marked by attenuated autologous CD4+ T cells proliferation and IFNγ production. In a murine model of ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP), we noticed time-dependent gingival MDSC infiltration, which correlates with CD4+ T cell and CD19+ B cell infiltration. To test whether MDSC confer immunoregulatory function in vivo, we adoptively transferred G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs in mice. Interestingly, we observed significant reduction in inflammatory marker expression (IL6, TNF-α, and IL-1β), infiltration of CD4+ T cells, and concomitant increase in MDSC-derived immune suppressive molecules, ARG1 and IL-10, and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs compared to mock. Conversely, depletion of MDSC using anti-Gr1 antibody resulted in marked induction of periodontal inflammation, reduced Treg population, and significantly higher alveolar bone loss. These findings, for the first time, suggest an anti-inflammatory and osteoprotective function of MDSCs in PD and offer a promising target to treat unresolved periodontal inflammation.">

        <tr id="Humanized (h)DRAGA mice are a promising in vivo model for investigating immunotherapies for treating HIV infections. These mice are not only susceptible to HIV infection, but they also develop functional human immune cells, including T cells and B cells as well as follicular-like structures that mimic lymphoid B cell follicles, where HIV-producing cells concentrate during infection in a manner similar to that found in humans. This study evaluated the safety, tissue targeting, and efficacy of follicular-targeting HIV-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells (CAR/CXCR5-T cells) in HIV-infected hDRAGA mice. Intravenously-infused CAR/CXCR5-T cells persisted in hDRAGA mice for the duration of the study, peaking six days post-infusion. This study indicated that CAR/CXCR5-T cell treatment is safe, with 100% survival rate of treated mice and no noticeable changes in pathology. Six days after infusion, CAR/CXCR5-T cells had accumulated in the follicle-like structures, with many appearing in direct contact with HIV-producing cells. However, CAR/CXCR5-T cell treatment did not appear to reduce viral loads compared to controls, perhaps because many of the engineered CAR/CXCR5-T cells were themselves infected with HIV, with some CAR/CXCR5-T cells showing evidence of HIV virion release. Future studies will investigate whether CAR/CXCR5-T cells engineered for resistance against HIV infection are effective in reducing viral loads. This study supports the approach of using the HIV-infected hDRAGA mouse model to test cellular immunotherapies for HIV, as the model recapitulates many aspects of HIV infection in human lymphoid follicles.">

        <tr id="Tumor cell-intrinsic signaling pathways can drastically affect the tumor immune microenvironment, promoting tumor progression and resistance to immunotherapy by excluding immune-cell populations from the tumor. Several tumor cell-intrinsic pathways have been reported to modulate myeloid-cell and T-cell infiltration creating "cold" tumors. However, clinical evidence suggests that excluding cytotoxic T cells from the tumor core also mediates immune evasion. Here, we find that tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 signaling in non-small cell lung cancer induces the exclusion of cytotoxic T cells from the tumor core and promotes resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy. Mechanistically, tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 expression upregulates CCL2 in tumor cells, resulting in increased recruitment of regulatory T cells. CD8+ T-cell exclusion depended on regulatory T cell-mediated suppression of tumor vasculature. Depleting tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells via Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related protein (GITR) restored CD8+ T-cell infiltration and, when combined with checkpoint blockade therapy, reduced tumor growth. These results show that tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 expression in lung cancer serves as a mechanism of immunotherapy resistance and provide evidence to support future studies investigating whether NSCLC patients with SOX2-dependent CD8+ T-cell exclusion would benefit from the depletion of GITR+ Tregs.">

        <tr id="Primary and secondary resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) reduces its efficacy. The mechanisms underlying immunotherapy resistance are highly complex. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), these mechanisms are primarily associated with the loss of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, genetic mutations, circular RNA axis and transcription factor regulation, antigen presentation disorders, and dysregulation of signaling pathways. Additionally, alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) play a pivotal role in driving immunotherapy resistance. Primary resistance is mainly attributed to TME alterations, including mutations and co-mutations, modulation of T cell infiltration, enrichment of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and pulmonary fibrosis. Acquired resistance mainly stems from changes in cellular infiltration patterns leading to “cold” or “hot” tumors, altered interferon (IFN) signaling pathway expression, involvement of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and oxidative stress responses, as well as post-treatment gene mutations and circadian rhythm disruption (CRD). This review presents an overview of various mechanisms underlying resistance to ICB, elucidates the alterations in the TME during primary, adaptive, and acquired resistance, and discusses existing strategies for overcoming ICB resistance.">

Progression and therapy response are influenced by this immune environment, highlighting the need for a detailed understanding of endogenous immune responses to malignant plasma cells. Here we used the 5TGM1 murine transfer model of multiple myeloma to dissect early immune responses to myeloma cells. We modeled stable and progressive disease by transferring 5TGM1 murine myeloma cells into C57Bl/6 mice and KaLwRij mice, respectively. We used flow cytometry and single‐cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses to characterize differential immune responses in stable and progressive disease. Transfer of 5TGM1 cells in C57Bl/6 mice led to stable disease with low tumor burden in a subset of animals. Stable disease was associated with sustained activation and expansion of NK cells, ILC1, and CD8+ T cells, a response that was lost upon disease progression. Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing of immune cells and bulk RNA sequencing of immune and mesenchymal stromal cells implicated the activation of interferon responses as a central immune pathway during stable disease. Experimentally, neutralization of IFNγ significantly increased myeloma development and progression in C57Bl/6 mice, testifying to the importance of this pathway in early disease control. In conclusion, we provide a framework for studying immune responses to multiple myeloma progression in immunocompetent and genetically modifiable mice and highlight the importance of bone marrow immunity in tumor control.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by unlimited accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides. It is often accompanied by disease, and the relationship between ferroptosis of immune cells and immune regulation has been attracting increasing attention. Initially, it was found in cancer research that the inhibition of regulatory T cell (Treg) ferroptosis and the promotion of CD8+ T cell ferroptosis jointly promoted the formation of an immune-tolerant environment in tumors. T-cell ferroptosis has subsequently been found to have immunoregulatory effects in other diseases. As an autoimmune disease characterized by immune imbalance, T-cell ferroptosis has attracted attention for its potential in regulating immune balance in lupus nephritis. This article reviews the metabolic processes within different T-cell subsets in lupus nephritis (LN), including T follicular helper (TFH) cells, T helper (Th)17 cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and Treg cells, and reveals that these cellular metabolisms not only facilitate the formation of a T-cell immune imbalance but are also closely associated with the occurrence of ferroptosis. Consequently, we hypothesize that targeting the metabolic pathways of ferroptosis could become a novel research direction for effectively treating the immune imbalance in lupus nephritis by altering T-cell differentiation and the incidence of ferroptosis.">

        <tr id="Bryostatin-1, a potent agonist of the protein kinase C, has been studied for HIV and cancer therapies. In HIV research, it has shown anti-HIV effects during acute infection and reactivation of latent HIV in chronic infection. As effective CD8+ T cell responses are essential for eliminating reactivated virus and achieving a cure, it is important to investigate how bryostatin-1 affects HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. HIV-specific CD8+ T cells often become exhausted, showing reduced proliferative potential and impaired cytokine production, a dysfunction also observed in cancer. Therefore, we further investigated how bryostatin-1 directly impacts exhausted CD8+ T cells.PBMCs from people with HIV (PWH) were treated with bryostatin-1 and tracked with proliferation dye for cell expansion. One day 6, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected by tetramers staining and examined by flow cytometry. By utilizing an established in vitro murine T cell exhaustion system, changes in inhibitory receptors, transcription factors, cytokine production and killing capacity of bryostatin-1 treated exhausted CD8+ T cells were determined by flow cytometry. RNA-seq analysis was performed to study transcriptional changes in these cells.We found that bryostatin-1 improved the expansion and decreased PD-1 expression of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Bryostatin-1 enhanced the functionality and proliferation while decreasing inhibitory receptor expression of in vitro generated exhausted CD8+ T cells. Bryostatin-1 upregulated TCF-1 and decreased TOX expression. These changes were confirmed through RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) 11 was significantly downregulated in exhausted CD8+ T cells, however, it greatly upregulated after bryostatin-1 treatment. Inhibition of MAPK11 in bryostatin-1-treated cells blocked the increased proliferation and IFN-γ production induced by bryostatin-1, but did not affect other bryostatin-1 induced effects, such as the reduction of inhibitory receptors.Our data demonstrate that bryostatin-1 induces a MAPK 11-dependent improvement in the proliferative and functional capacity of exhausted T cells. This study provides a rationale for bryostatin-1's potential to help eradicate the HIV reservoir during treatment, and it may also contribute to cancer immunotherapy by functionally improving exhausted CD8+ T cells.">

It is a highly plastic process that secures the response to external and internal stimuli to face acute and changing needs. Infections and chronic diseases including cancer can modulate it by producing several factors, impacting proliferation and differentiation programs. While the lymphocytic compartment has attracted major attention due to the role of adaptive immunity in anticancer immune response, in recent years, research has found convincing evidence that confirms the importance of innate immunity and the key function played by emergency myelopoiesis. Due to cancer’s ability to manipulate myelopoiesis to its own advantage, the purpose of this review is to outline myelopoiesis processes within the tumor microenvironment and suggest possible therapeutic lines of research to restore the physiological functioning of the host’s immune system, with a special outlook on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).">

        <tr id="During chronic infection or tumorigenesis, persistent antigen stimulation contributes to the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Nevertheless, exhausted CD8+ T (TEX) cells still preserve certain effector function, and maintaining a reservoir of exhausted cells is of vital importance for virus elimination and tumor eradiation. Despite considerable work interrogating the rejuvenation of TEX cells, mechanisms underpinning the clonal deletion of TEX cells remain largely unexplored over the past decade. In this study, we employed mouse models of LCMV infection to demonstrate that excessive accumulation of lipid peroxidation rendered virus-specific TEX cells to ferroptosis, which may correlate with enhanced mitochondria-derived oxidative stress and compromised activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). In addition, either incomplete or complete ablation of GPX4 resulted in exacerbated ferroptosis and aggravated shrunken population of virus-specific TEX cells. On the other hand, inhibiting ferroptosis via administration of a ferroptosis inhibitor or overexpression of GPX4 greatly rectified the cell loss of virus-specific TEX cells. Collectively, we disclosed ferroptosis as a crucial player in the clonal deletion of virus-specific TEX cells and stressed the intervention of ferroptosis as a promising approach to optimize the longevity of virus-specific TEX cells.">

        <tr id="Chemokine receptors control cell migration within the body. Here we reveal a novel interaction between eosinophils and monocytes in the bone marrow, indirectly controlled by the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2. We demonstrate that ACKR2 maintains eosinophil levels within the bone marrow by scavenging CCL11. In the absence of ACKR2, elevated CCL11 leads to increased egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. As a result, eosinophil and monocyte interactions are reduced within the bone marrow niche, leading to changes in monocyte gene expression. Monocytes from ACKR2-/- mice are recruited to the tissues but are fundamentally altered in their ability to differentiate into macrophages, in the lung, peritoneal cavity and cavity wall. Bacterial elimination is impaired in ACKR2-/- mice during peritoneal infection. ACKR2 is therefore a key regulator of eosinophil-driven monocyte education in the bone marrow, required for full monocyte differentiation and macrophage function within the tissues.">

        <tr id="Background Although MDSCs are widely recognized for their immunoinhibitory effects in pathological conditions, their function during HIV infection particularly within the mechanisms underlying incomplete immune recovery remains elusive. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 30 healthy controls and 62 HIV-1-infected subjects [31 immunological non-responders (INRs) and 31 immunological responders (IRs)] were selected. The proportion of MDSCs was determined in each category of participants. Using flow cytometry and real-time PCR, immune regulatory molecules (including PD-L1, ARG1, iNOS, IL-10, TGF-β, and IDO) that are relevant for MDSCs activity were quantified. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the blockade of PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways on MDSCs and their effects on CD4+ T-cells using in vitro functional experiments. Results PMN-MDSCs are more abundant and are negatively correlated to CD4 counts in HIV-infected individuals. In addition, PMN-MDSCs suppress CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ production in INRs. Furthermore, correlations were found between PD-L1 expression on PMN-MDSCs and PD-1+ CD4+ T-cells. TGF-β expression on PMN-MDSCs was likewise enhanced in INRs. Importantly, inhibiting both PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways had a synergistic impact on restoring CD4+ T-cell activity in vitro. Conclusions PMN-MDSCs expansion inhibits CD4+ T-cell responses. We suggest that targeting PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways together may significantly improve immune recovery in INRs.">

However, a significant challenge is the severe side effects associated with T-cell overactivation, leading to cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity in MM patients undergoing such therapies. Bispecific NK cell engagers (NKCEs) may offer a promising alternative by redirecting NK cell cytotoxic activity towards tumor cells without triggering cytokine release syndrome. Methods: In this study, we designed a series of BCMA × CD16 NKCEs that simultaneously engage BCMA and CD16 on MM and NK cells, respectively. We evaluated the functionality of these NKCEs in vitro with respect to their molecular design. Results: Our results indicate that the format design of NKCEs influences their functionalities, underscoring the importance of format selection in optimizing NKCE-based therapies for MM. This study provides valuable insights for developing next-generation NKCEs and advancing therapeutic strategies for MM and potentially other malignancies.">

To decipher the combinatory mode of action of TLR8 agonism and PD-1 blockade, we employed a unique, open-label, phase 1b pre-operative window of opportunity clinical trial (NCT03906526) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Matched pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from the same lesion were obtained. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and custom multiplex staining to leverage the unique advantage of same-lesion longitudinal sampling. Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased CLEC9A+ dendritic cell and CLEC7A/SYK expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8+ T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13+CD8+ T-cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients. This study provides key insights into the mode of action of TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade immune targeting in HNSCC patients.">

        <tr id="The increasing use of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint blockade has led to the emergence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including dysfunction of the submandibular gland (SMG). In this study, we investigated the immunoregulatory mechanism contributing to the susceptibility of the SMG to irAEs. We found that the SMGs of PD-1-deficient mice and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-treated mice harbor an expanded population of CD8+ T cells. We demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells expressing PD-L1 tightly regulate CD8+ T cells in the SMG. When this immunoregulation is disrupted, CD8+ T cells clonally expand and acquire a unique transcriptional profile consistent with T cell receptor (TCR) activation. These clonally expanded cells phenotypically overlapped with cytotoxic GzmK+ CD8+ T autoimmune cells identified in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome. Understanding how NK cells modulate CD8+ T cell activity in the SMG opens new avenues for preventing irAEs in patients undergoing checkpoint blockade therapies.">

Not only does tolerance mitigate collateral damage from host immune responses, but in doing so permits a robust response sufficient to clear infection as necessary. Yet, despite occupying such a cornerstone, research aiming to unravel the intricacies of tolerance induction is mired by interchangeable and often misused terminologies, with markers and mechanistic pathways that beg the question of redundancy. In this review we aim to define these boarders by providing new perspectives to long-standing theories of tolerance. Given the central role of T cells in enforcing immune cascades, in this review we choose to explore immunological tolerance through the perspective of T cell ‘resistance to activation,’ to delineate the contexts in which one tolerance mechanism has evolved over the other. By clarifying the important biological markers and cellular players underpinning T cell resistance to activation, we aim to encourage more purposeful and directed research into tolerance and, more-over, potential therapeutic strategies in autoimmune diseases and cancer.

        <tr id="Sepsis is characterized by a concomitant early pro-inflammatory response by immune cells to an infection, and an opposing anti-inflammatory response that results in protracted immunosuppression. The primary pathological event in sepsis is widespread programmed cell death, or cellular self-sacrifice, of innate and adaptive immune cells, leading to profound immunological suppression. This severe immune dysfunction hampers effective primary pathogen clearance, thereby increasing the risk of secondary opportunistic infections, latent viral reactivation, multiple organ dysfunction, and elevated mortality. The types of cell death include apoptosis (type I programmed cell death), autophagy (type II programmed cell death), NETosis (a program for formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)) and other programmed cell deaths like pyroptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, each contributing to immunosuppression in distinct ways during the later phases of sepsis. Extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes, such as CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and B cells, is strongly associated with immunosuppression. Apoptosis of dendritic cells further compromises T and B cell survival and can induce T cell anergy or promote regulatory Treg cell proliferation. Moreover, delayed apoptosis and impaired neutrophil function contribute to nosocomial infections and immune dysfunction in sepsis. Interestingly, aberrant NETosis and the subsequent depletion of mature neutrophils also trigger immunosuppression, and neutrophil pyroptosis can positively regulate NETosis. The interaction between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) plays a key role in T cell modulation and neutrophil apoptosis in sepsis. The dendritic cell growth factor, Fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLTEL), increases DC numbers, enhances CD 28 expression, attenuates PD-L1, and improves survival in sepsis. Recently, immunoadjuvant therapies have attracted attention for their potential to restore host physiological immunity and homeostasis in patients with sepsis. This review focuses on several potential immunotherapeutic agents designed to bolster suppressed innate and adaptive immune responses in the management of sepsis.">

        <tr id="Cellular mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET), also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), is a crucial receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in various solid tumors, including lung, breast, and liver cancers. The concomitant expression of c-MET and PD-L1 in tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, highlights their prognostic significance and connection to therapeutic resistance. Cancer-associated fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), activating c-MET signaling in tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). This activation leads to metabolic reprogramming and increased activity of enzymes like glutaminase (GLS), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and arginase 1 (ARG1), depleting essential amino acids in the tumor microenvironment that are vital for effector immune cell function. This review highlights the interplay between tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that create an immunosuppressive environment while providing targets for c-MET-focused immunotherapy. It emphasizes the clinical implications of c-MET inhibition on the behavior of immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, and NK cells. It explores the potential of c-MET antagonism combined with immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance cancer treatment paradigms. This review also discusses the innovative cancer immunotherapies targeting c-MET, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies, monoclonal antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates, while encouraging the development of a comprehensive strategy that simultaneously tackles immune evasion and enhances anti-tumor efficacy further to improve the clinical prognoses for patients with c-MET-positive malignancies. Despite the challenges and variability in efficacy across different cancer subtypes, continued research into the molecular mechanisms and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies will be crucial.">

        <tr id="Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis, eliciting varying severity in infected individuals. This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex. Results Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

        <tr id="Teratomas are a highly differentiated type of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), the most common type of solid cancer in young men. Prominent inflammatory infiltrates are a hallmark of TGCTs, although their compositions and dynamics in teratomas remain elusive. Here, we reached out to characterize the infiltrating immune cells and their activation and polarization state by using high-throughput gene expression analysis of 129.MOLF-Chr19 mice that spontaneously develop testicular teratomas. We showed that inconspicuous testes without any apparent alterations in size or morphology can be clustered into three groups based on their expression of stemness and immune genes, supporting a model in which initial oncogenic transformation elicits a first wave of T-cell infiltration. Moderately and severely enlarged tumorous testes then displayed a progressive infiltration with T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. Importantly, T cells seem to adopt an inactive state caused by an overexpression of immune checkpoint molecules and the polarization of monocytes/macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Our findings are supported by the analysis of metabolic gene expression, which unveiled alterations indicative of tumor growth and immune cell infiltration. Collectively, testicular teratomas, at least in mice, are characterized by a diverse inflammatory infiltrate containing T cells that putatively become inactivated, allowing the tumors to further grow. We believe that these findings may provide a rationale for the development of new immunomodulatory therapies for TGCTs.">

        <tr id="Oncolytic viruses have emerged as a highly promising modality for cancer treatment due to their ability to replicate specifically within tumors, carry therapeutic genes, and modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through various mechanisms. Additionally, they show potential synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. A study report indicates that from 2000 to 2020, 49.5% of oncolytic viruses were administered intratumorally and 35% intravenously during clinical trials. However, both administration methods face significant challenges, particularly with intravenous delivery, which encounters issues such as non-specific tissue uptake, neutralizing antibody responses, and antiviral effects mediated by various immune cells. Despite extensive research into the antiviral roles of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in oncolytic virus therapy, neutrophils—constituting approximately 50% to 70% of human peripheral blood leukocytes—have received relatively little attention. Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte subset in peripheral circulation, known for their phagocytic activity. Beyond their traditional roles in bacterial and fungal infections, emerging literature suggests that neutrophils also play a critical role in the body’s antiviral responses. Given the gaps in understanding the role of neutrophils in oncolytic virus therapy, this article reviews current literature on this topic. It aims to provide a theoretical foundation for developing oncolytic virus-based cancer therapies and enhancing their anti-tumor efficacy in future clinical treatments.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of many malignant tumors. However, ICI-induced hyper-immune activation causes cardiotoxicity. Traditional treatments such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants have limited effectiveness and may even accelerate tumor growth. This study aimed to identify approaches that effectively reduce cardiotoxicity and simultaneously preserve or enhance the antitumor immunity of ICI therapy.


METHODS
ICI injection in melanoma-bearing C57BL/6J female mice was used to simulate cardiotoxicity in patients with tumor undergoing immune therapy. MCC950 was used to block nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activity. Echocardiography, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to assess cardiac function, immune cell populations, and inflammatory factor levels. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing was used to detect the changes in cardiac transcriptome and immunological network.


RESULTS
NLRP3 inhibition reduced inflammatory response and improved cardiac function. Notably, NLRP3 inhibition also resulted in a pronounced suppression of tumor growth. Single-cell RNA sequencing elucidated that MCC950 treatment reduced the cardiac infiltration of pathogenic macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, activated T cells, and their production of inflammatory cytokines, while enhancing the presence of reparative macrophages and naive T cells. In addition, MCC950 attenuated cardiotoxicity induced by dual programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) immunotherapy and promoted tumor regression, and showed efficacy in treating established cardiotoxicity.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings provide a promising clinical approach for preventing and treating cardiotoxicity induced by ICIs, dissociating the antitumor efficacy of ICI-based therapies from their cardiotoxic side effects.">

        <tr id="Abstract The rise in global life expectancy has led to an increase in the older population, presenting significant challenges in managing infectious diseases. Aging affects the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) and immune function decline (immunosenescence). These changes would impair defense mechanisms, increase susceptibility to infections and reduce vaccine efficacy in older adults. Cellular senescence exacerbates these issues by releasing pro-inflammatory factors, further perpetuating chronic inflammation. Moreover, comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which are common in older adults, amplify immune dysfunction, while immunosuppressive medications further complicate responses to infections. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving inflammaging and immunosenescence, focusing on genomic instability, telomere attrition, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, we discussed how aging-associated immune alterations influence responses to bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections and evaluated emerging antiaging strategies, aimed at mitigating these effects to improve health outcomes in the aging population.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Single antigen (Ag)‐targeted immunotherapies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are highly effective; however, up to 50% of patients relapse after these treatments. Most of these relapses lack target Ag expression, suggesting targeting multiple Ags would be advantageous. Materials & Methods The multi‐Ag immune responses to ALL induced by transducing cell lines with xenoAgs green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase was elucidated using flow cytometry, ELISA, and ELISpot assays. Results In our model, leukemia responsiveness correlates with in vivo CD4+ T cell activation and DC maturation, supporting a role for DC licensing. In contrast, tolerance is characterized by in vivo increased expression of negative immune checkpoints (IC) which may suppress rather than license DC. In vitro assays confirm the ability of CD4+ T cells from leukemia‐responsive mice to promote robust maturation of naïve bone marrow DC in the presence of non‐immunogenic leukemia antigens. Conclusion Together these findings support a CD4+ T cell‐mediated mechanism of DC licensing to promote multi‐Ag immune responses that may augment current targeted immunotherapies and avoid relapses in treated children with ALL.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using retrovirally transduced T cells represents a promising strategy for enhancing antitumor responses. When used with TriVax, a peptide vaccination strategy, this approach synergistically expands antigen-specific cell populations. STAT5 plays a vital role as a transcription factor in regulating T cell proliferation and their differentiation into effector and memory T cells. We aimed to explore the combination therapy using CD8 T cells engineered to express constitutively active STAT5 (CA-STAT5) with vaccines. CD8 T cells were transduced with a retrovirus (RV) encoding the mouse gp100 T cell receptor (TCR). In certain treatment groups, cells were also co-transduced with RV encoding CA-STAT5. We assessed transduction efficiency and functional activity through flow cytometry and various functional assays. B16F10 tumor-bearing mice were treated with ACT using RV-transduced CD8 T cells and subsequently vaccinated with TriVax. We demonstrate that TriVax selectively enhanced the expansion of ACT cell populations bearing gp100-specific TCRs. T cells engineered to express CA-STAT5 showed not only increased expansion and polyfunctionality but also reduced PD-1 expression, leading to decreased cellular exhaustion. In a B16F10 melanoma mouse model, our approach yielded a potent antitumor effect, with CA-STAT5 further amplifying this response. We found that CA-STAT5 improved antitumor activities, in part, by attenuating the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway. These findings indicate that TCR-transduced CD8 T cells can undergo antigen-dependent expansion when exposed to TriVax. Additionally, the expression of CA-STAT5 enhances T cell proliferation and persistence, partly by promoting resistance to PD-1/PD-L1-mediated inhibition in antitumor T cells.">

        <tr id="Malaria remains a significant global public health problem. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, a subset of CD4+ T cells, have the capacity to regulate B cells, plasma cells, and antibody production, among other functions. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) possess strong immunosuppressive abilities and can negatively regulate various immune responses. However, the role of MDSCs in inhibiting Tfh-cell responses during Plasmodium infection remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the regulatory effect of MDSCs on Tfh cell-mediated immune responses upon Plasmodium infection. We found that the numbers of MDSCs increased upon Plasmodium infection. Further mechanism study revealed that MDSC-derived Arg-1 and PD-L1 prevented Tfh cell proliferation and activation. Conversely, the addition of nor-NOHA or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies enhanced the proliferation and activation of Tfh cells, indicating that the inhibitory effect of MDSCs on Tfh cells was dependent on Arg-1 and PD-1/PD-L1. In vivo depletion of MDSCs enhanced Tfh-cell responses and antibody production, as well as relieved symptoms of infected mice and improved their survival rates. These findings provide insights into the immunosuppressive role of MDSCs in inhibiting Tfh cell immune responses and further impairing humoral immunity. Our study provides new strategies for malaria prevention and control.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) is the first-choice treatment in patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), when curative options are unavailable. However, reliable biomarkers for patient selection are still lacking.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
In this translational study, clinical annotations, tissue and liquid biopsies were acquired to investigate the association between sustained objective responses and transcriptional profiles, immune cell dynamics in tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples, as well as circulating cytokine levels.


RESULTS
First, we investigated the baseline characteristics of the immune landscape of cSCC biopsies. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed upregulation of interleukin (IL)2/STAT5 pathways and downregulation of Interferon signatures in non-responder patients compared with responders. Next, we studied the early changes induced by cemiplimab in tissue biopsies. Notably, after only three weeks, cemiplimab treatment induced an increase in B cells and CD8+ T cells in responders, whereas their abundance decreased in non-responder patients. Moreover, analyzing differentially expressed genes modulated early during treatment, compared with baseline biopsies, we found that IL1β and IL8 exhibited early downregulation in responder patients' tumor specimens. We assessed whether changes in the local tumor microenvironment were mirrored in peripheral blood. Similar to tissue findings, no changes were observed in the whole T regulatory (Treg) population, although PD1+ Tregs, which were downregulated in responder patients (vs T0), showed a rebound enrichment in non-responders after three cycles of cemiplimab. Finally, IL8 mirrored the tissue results, unlike IL1β, with early (T1) and then sustained (T3) downregulation of its levels in responder patients, while increased in non-responders.


CONCLUSIONS
Taken together, these findings shed light on the significance of early transcriptomic and immune cell modulation in predicting responses to cemiplimab therapy. Additionally, our data suggest that IL8 levels in peripheral blood offer promising avenues for personalized treatment selection and response assessment in patients with cSCC receiving cemiplimab, while PD1+Tregs can be followed longitudinally to monitor response to therapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies have achieved revolutionary success in cancer therapy. However, the impact of anti-PD-1 therapy on host humoral immunity in humans during cancer immunotherapy requires further investigation.


METHODS
We evaluated immunoglobulin titers by ELISA and screened the immune landscape of immune cells from 25 healthy donors and 50 cases including 25 new-onset hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients prior to systemic treatment and 25 HCC patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy by multicolor flow cytometry. Flow or beads sorted cells were cultured ex vivo for proliferation and functional analysis.


RESULTS
Anti-PD-1 therapy significantly increased the levels of IgG and IgA in the periphery of HCC patients. Anti-PD-1 treatment led to an increase in plasmablasts and a notable rise in circulating T follicular regulatory (cTfr) cells, while changes in circulating B cells, T follicular helper cells, or regulatory T cells were not significant. Anti-PD-1 therapy also influenced the proliferation and function of cTfr cells, promoting the differentiation of CD38+ cTfr cells. We observed that the CD38+ Tfr cell subset in the peripheral blood can promote plasmablast differentiation, associated with altered antibody production.


CONCLUSIONS
Together, these data demonstrate the immunomodulatory role of PD-1 in restricting the differentiation and function of human cTfr cells and in regulating humoral immunity.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, a subset of T cells identified by the surface glycoprotein CD8, particularly those expressing the co-stimulatory molecule CD226, play a crucial role in the immune response to malignancies. However, their role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an immunosuppressive disease, has not yet been explored. We studied 64 CLL patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed the proportion of CD226-expressing cells among different CD8+ T cell subsets (including naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effectors) in CLL patients, stratified by Rai stage and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgHV) mutation status. Additionally, we compared the effector functions of CD8+CD226+ cells and their CD226- counterparts. We also quantified cytokine and chemokine levels in the plasma of CLL and HCs. Furthermore, we reanalyzed the publicly available bulk RNA-seq on CD226+ and CD226-CD8+ T cells. Finally, we evaluated the impact of elevated cytokines/chemokines on CD226 expression. Our results showed that CD226-expressing cells were significantly decreased within the effector memory and effector CD8+ T cell subsets in CLL patients with advanced Rai stages and unmutated IgHV, a marker of poor prognosis. These cells displayed robust effector functions, including cytokine production, cytolytic activity, degranulation, proliferation, and migration capacity. In contrast, CD8+CD226- T cells displayed an exhausted phenotype with reduced Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β) were inversely correlated with the frequency of CD8+CD226+ T cells and may contribute to the downregulation of CD226, possibly leading to T cell dysfunction in CLL. Our findings highlight the critical role of CD8+CD226+RUNX2hi T cells in CLL and suggest that their reduction is associated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. This study also underscores the potential of targeting IL-6 and MIP-1β to preserve polyfunctional CD8+CD226+ T cells as a promising immunotherapy strategy.">

        <tr id="During persistent antigen stimulation, exhausted CD8+ T cells are continuously replenished by self-renewing stem-like T cells. However, how CD8+ T cells adapt to chronic stimulation remains unclear. Here, we show that persistent antigen stimulation primes chromatin for regulation by the redox-sensing KEAP1-NRF2 pathway. Loss of KEAP1 in T cells impaired control of chronic viral infection. T cell-intrinsic KEAP1 suppressed NRF2 to promote expansion and persistence of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, drive a stem-like T cell response, down-regulate immune checkpoint molecules, and limit T cell receptor (TCR) hyperactivation and apoptosis. NRF2 epigenetically derepressed BACH2 targets and opposed a stem-like program driven by BACH2. In exhausted T cells induced by tonic GD2 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) signaling, the effects of KEAP1 deficiency were rescued by inhibiting proximal TCR signaling. Enhancing mitochondrial oxidation improved the expansion and survival of KEAP1-deficient CD8+ GD2 CAR T cells and up-regulated markers associated with stem-like cells. Thus, the KEAP1-NRF2 axis regulates stem-like CD8+ T cells and long-term T cell immunity during chronic antigen exposure.">

This review explores the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of immune memory, focusing on memory T cells, memory B cells, and long-lived plasma cells. Following primary infections or vaccinations, a subset of activated lymphocytes transitions into memory cells, which persist long after pathogen clearance. Factors influencing memory cell longevity, such as antigen persistence, cytokine signaling, and homeostatic proliferation, are discussed. Moreover, the review addresses the challenges posed by chronic infections and the potential for immune exhaustion, which can impair memory function. Additionally, the clinical implications of understanding immune memory are highlighted, particularly in vaccine development, cancer immunotherapy, and the management of autoimmune diseases. By synthesizing current knowledge on long-term memory in immune cells, this review aims to provide insights into future research directions and therapeutic strategies to enhance immune responses and improve public health outcomes.

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) develops spontaneously despite functional antigen presentation machinery in the thymus and a perceptible central tolerance process. We found that intrathymic enrichment with IL-4 fine tunes signaling through the IL-4/IL-13 heteroreceptor (HR) in early thymic progenitors (ETPs), augments negative selection of self-reactive T cells, sustains a diverse T cell repertoire devoid of clones expressing disease-associated T cell receptor (TCR) genes, and protects the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse from T1D. Indeed, optimal IL-4 activates STAT transcription factors to program ETP fate decision toward CD11c+CD8α+ dendritic cells (DCs) agile in negative T cell selection and clonal deletion of diabetogenic T cells. However, due to diminished invariant natural killer T (iNKT) 2 cell frequency in the NOD thymus, IL-4 is as suboptimal level, metering STAT activation to program ETP fate decision toward the T cell lineage leading to diminished negative selection, a clonally restricted TCR repertoire, and manifestation of spontaneous T1D. These insights uncover yet another interplay by which IL-4 affects T1D.">

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) represent a promising target for inducing immune tolerance in LT, with the potential to reduce or eliminate the need for life-long immunosuppression. This review summarizes current knowledge on the roles of Tregs in LT, highlighting their mechanisms and the impact of various immunosuppressive agents on Treg stability and function. The liver’s distinct immunological microenvironment, characterized by tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells and high levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor-β, positions this organ as an ideal setting for Treg-mediated tolerance. We discuss Treg dynamics in LT, their association with rejection risk, and their utility as biomarkers of transplant outcomes. Emerging strategies, including the use of low-dose calcineurin inhibitors with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, adoptive Treg therapy, and low-dose IL-2, aim to enhance Treg function while providing sufficient immunosuppression. Thus, the future of LT involves precision medicine approaches that integrate Treg monitoring with tailored immunosuppressive protocols to optimize long-term outcomes for LT recipients.">

        <tr id="Cellular immunotherapy represents a pivotal treatment modality in clinical practice. Regulatory B cells (Bregs), a key subset of B lymphocytes, hold promise in the management of autoimmune diseases, cancer and transplantation immunity. The expansion of Bregs for cell therapy is a promising strategy to alleviate inflammation and promote immune tolerance. Achieving immune tolerance relies on balance between regulatory and effector cells. One primary objective of cellular therapy is to shift this balance towards Bregs, fostering a more tolerant immune microenvironment. The adoptive transfer of Bregs not only increases their quantity but also modulates the number and function of other immune cells. Maximizing in vitro expansion of Bregs and enhancing their regulatory functions are key focuses in transplant immunology. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the in vitro expansion of IL-10-secreting B cells (B10) remain inadequately understood. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the signaling pathways involved in B10 activation and expansion, as well as to highlight the techniques for in vitro amplification and development of adoptive B10 therapy in transplantation, which aims to advance the field of cellular therapy targeting Bregs.">

Recent research has highlighted the important role of immunosuppressive macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in driving this immune evasion.

We found that a high THEMIS2 expression is associated with poor patient outcomes and increased infiltration of immune cells, particularly macrophages. Functional analyses revealed THEMIS2’s critical involvement in immune-related pathways, including immune response activation, mononuclear cell differentiation, and the positive regulation of cytokine production. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrated that macrophages with a high THEMIS2 expression were associated with increased phagocytosis, immune suppression, and enhanced tumor growth. These findings suggest that THEMIS2 could serve as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in GBM.">

 Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with systemic effects and currently has no cure due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. To gain better insights into the immune response associated with psoriasis, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing and parallel single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) profiling on peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 11 psoriasis patients and 8 healthy controls. Additionally, we analysed two pairs of skin samples from the psoriasis cohort and performed spatial transcriptomics on two other pairs of skin samples. Our study identified specific immune signatures in myeloid and lymphocyte subsets both in blood and skin and highlighted characteristics of the immune repertoire in psoriasis. Notably, we found an increased proportion of circulating CD14+ monocytes. Furthermore, circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells in psoriasis patients exhibited heightened expression of genes associated with skin-homing and pro-inflammatory responses. Circulating T cells in these patients showed decreased expression of activation markers. In psoriatic lesions, we observed that resting CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells displayed a gene expression profile similar to that of activated CD8+ TRM cells, though they had lower expression levels of cytotoxicity-related genes. Both resting and activated CD8+ TRM cells in psoriatic lesions showed enhanced interaction strength in terms of signal transmission and reception compared with non-lesions. Activated CD8+ TRM cells were densely infiltrated in the dermis of skin lesions, while resting CD8+ TRM cells were located deeper in the dermis of non-lesion areas. TCR clones that were highly expanded in skin lesions were predominantly CD8+ TRM cells. Distinct TCR clusters showed different gene expression signatures, with one CD8+ TRM cluster expressing IFNγ and another expressing IL-17. These findings provide a valuable resource for further investigation into the pathogenesis of psoriasis by offering insights into the immune cell dynamics within both circulation and local skin environments.">

Bacillary loads in lung and spleen tissues were quantified through colony‐forming unit (CFU) assays. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to assess inflammatory infiltration and tissue damage. Levels of inflammatory mediators in peripheral venous blood were quantified using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Flow cytometry was employed to determine the proportions of conventional DCs (cDCs) and their subsets, cDC1 and cDC2, within lung, spleen, and lymph node tissues. In vitro, mouse bone marrow‐derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) pretreated with D609. The expression levels of chemokines and pro‐inflammatory cytokines were assessed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and ELISA. BMDCs were loaded with H37Rv expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP‐H37Rv) or DQ‐OVA, and flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the impact of D609 on antigen phagocytosis and processing. Furthermore, flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the effect of D609 pretreatment on the expression levels of costimulatory molecules on BMDCs. The capacity of D609‐treated BMDCs to activate and proliferate T cells, as well as to induce interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) secretion, was assessed through a DC‐T cell coculture system. Results In vivo analysis revealed that mice pretreated with D609 exhibited a marked increase in tissue bacterial load, enhanced inflammatory infiltration, and a reduction in pro‐inflammatory mediator expression in peripheral venous blood. There was a notable decrease in the number of cDCs in lung and lymph node tissues, with a pronounced reduction in cDC1 in the lungs and cDC2 in the lymph nodes. In vitro studies demonstrated that D609 pretreated BMDCs displayed a significant decline in inflammatory mediator production, antigen phagocytosis, and antigen processing capabilities, potentially due to altered expression of costimulatory molecules. Coculture experiments indicated that D609 pretreated BMDCs showed a substantial reduction in their ability to stimulate T cell activation, proliferation, and IFN‐γ secretion. Conclusion Our findings suggest that PC‐PLC plays a critical role in the functionality of DCs, including the production of chemokines and pro‐inflammatory cytokines, migration to lymph nodes, and antigen presentation to T cells, which collectively contribute to T cell activation and effective clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms of PC‐PLC in DCs may uncover novel therapeutic targets for the development of advanced anti‐TB treatments.">

        <tr id="Background: The activities and functions of natural killer (NK) cells are controlled by a limited repertoire of activating and inhibitory NK receptors. Therefore, blocking inhibitory receptors such as NKG2A using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) enhances tumor immunity. Method: In this study, we investigated the safety of anti-NKG2A-pretreated NK cells in improving ADCC function to manage hepatocyte carcinoma (HCC). After a conditioning regimen, we initiated a pilot study of expanded donor haploidentical NK cell infusion. The goals were to determine the safety and feasibility. Patients received a fludarabine/cyclophosphamide conditioning followed by adoptive immunotherapy with IL2–activated haploidentical NK cells. Anti-NKG2A pretreated NK cells were infused on days 0, +5, and +10 post-conditioning regimens at a dose of 7 × 108 cells (n=3). The median follow-up was 4 months for all patients. Results: Although all patients were alive at the last follow-up, two of them showed progressive disease and an increase in tumor size. In addition, all patients had a relative decrease in the expression level of an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) after one month. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of infusing high doses of ex vivo expanded NK cells after conditioning with transient side effects.">

        <tr id="Abstract Malignant glioma, the most lethal form of brain cancer, presents with an immunosuppressive microenvironment that obstructs tumor cell clearance and hampers immunotherapeutic interventions. Despite advancements in characterizing cellular and extracellular profiles in cancer, the immunosuppressive mechanisms specific to glioma remain poorly understood. We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing of glioma samples, which revealed a select subset of human and mouse glioma cells that express CD83, a marker associated with mature antigen-presenting cells. To investigate the impact of tumor cell CD83 expression on glioma outcomes, we used an immunocompetent mouse model of glioma, bioinformatic analyses of human samples, and in vitro assays. Our findings revealed that CD83+ tumor cells contribute to tumor growth suppression and are associated with enhanced cytotoxic T-cell profiles and activated CD8+ T cells. Increased proinflammatory cytokines were identified in CD83-overexpressing tumor conditions, which were also correlated with long-term CD8+ antitumor responses. Importantly, tumor-derived CD83 could mediate communication with T cells, altering the immune microenvironment to potentially enhance immune-related tumor clearance. Collectively, our data suggest that tumor cell expression of CD83 supports the endogenous antitumor T-cell constituency in malignant glioma. Future research endeavors may aim to further investigate whether CD83 expression can enhance immunotherapeutic approaches and improve patient outcomes. Significance: Immunosuppression in malignant glioma remains a barrier to therapeutic development. CD83 overexpression in human and mouse glioma increases survival. CD83+ tumor cells promote signatures related to cytotoxic T cells, enhanced activation of CD8+ T cells, and increased proinflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that tumor-expressed CD83 could mediate tumor–immune communications.">

        <tr id="The limited infiltration of CD8+ T cells in tumors hampers the effectiveness of T cell-based immunotherapy, yet the mechanisms that limit tumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells remain unclear. Through bulk RNA sequencing of human tumors, we identified a strong correlation between WNT7A expression and reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration. Further investigation demonstrated that inhibiting WNT7A substantially enhanced MHC-I expression on tumor cells. Mechanistically, WNT7A inhibition inactivated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and thus resulted in reduced physical interaction between β-catenin and p65 in the cytoplasm, which increased the nuclear translocation of p65 and activated the NF-κB pathway, ultimately promoting the transcription of genes encoding MHC-I molecules. We found that our lead compound, 1365-0109, disrupted the protein-protein interaction between WNT7A and its receptor FZD5, resulting in the upregulation of MHC-I expression. In murine tumor models, both genetic and pharmaceutical suppression of WNT7A led to increased MHC-I levels on tumor cells, and consequently enhanced the infiltration and functionality of CD8+ T cells, which bolstered antitumor immunity and improved the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapy. These findings have elucidated the intrinsic mechanisms of WNT7A-induced immune suppression, suggesting that therapeutic interventions targeting WNT7A hold promise for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract The elderly and those with chronic diseases have a 2 to 10-fold increased risk of hospitalization and mortality following infection as compared with healthy adults. A significant contributor to disease severity is the aging of the immune system, including an expansion of exhausted T cells. These cells simultaneously promote excessive levels of inflammation and display impaired T cell activation and function. How exhausted T cells from aged individuals respond to infection and whether acute restoration of T cell activation further exacerbates the inflammatory environment or generates functional T cells is unclear. Previously, we used a mouse model of normal microbial experience (NME), where old specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice show 100% mortality following exposure to multiple microbes ordinarily found in pet store mice. In the present study, we show that when exposed to NME, old SPF mice have increased expression of multiple inflammatory pathways and exhibit elevated frequencies of a heterogenous exhausted CD8+ T cell pool that expresses differing combinations of the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), TOX, and CXCR5. Pre-treatment or intervention with an anti-PD1 monoclonal blocking antibody during the exposure of old SPF mice to NME significantly improves both antibody production and survival, without altering the acute inflammatory response. Anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade-mediated survival is dependent on CD8+, but not CD4+ T cells. Correspondingly, CD8+ PD1+ T cells from old mice given anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody have increased granzyme B production. These data reveal a new approach for reducing vulnerability to infections in the elderly by targeting CD8+ T cell exhaustion through PD1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are one of the key immunosuppressive components in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and contribute to tumor development, progression, and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. Several reagents targeting TAMs have been tested in preclinical and clinical studies, but they have had limited success. Here, we show that a unique reagent, FF-10101, exhibited a sustained inhibitory effect against colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor by forming a covalent bond and reduced immunosuppressive TAMs in the TME, which led to strong antitumor immunity. In preclinical animal models, FF-10101 treatment significantly reduced immunosuppressive TAMs and increased antitumor TAMs in the TME. In addition, tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were increased; consequently, tumor growth was significantly inhibited. Moreover, combination treatment with an anti–programmed cell death 1 (anti–PD-1) antibody and FF-10101 exhibited a far stronger antitumor effect than either treatment alone. In human cancer specimens, FF-10101 treatment reduced programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on TAMs, as observed in animal models. Thus, FF-10101 acts as an immunomodulatory agent that can reduce immunosuppressive TAMs and augment tumor antigen-specific T cell responses, thereby generating an immunostimulatory TME. We propose that FF-10101 is a potential candidate for successful combination cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Many human autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are hallmarked by the presence and persistence of autoreactive B‐cells. While autoreactive B‐cells may frequently encounter antigens, the signals required to balance and maintain their activation and survival are mostly unknown. Understanding such signals may be important for strategies aimed at eliminating human B‐cell autoreactivity. Here, we assessed intracellular signaling pathways in B cells targeting citrullinated protein antigens isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a common and well‐characterized AID. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 15 RA patients positive for anti‐citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) were analyzed directly ex vivo using spectral flow cytometry and B‐cell differentiation markers, citrullinated antigen‐biotin‐streptavidin tetramers, and intracellular (phosphoflow) markers. Tetanus toxoid (TT)‐specific B cells served as antigen‐specific comparators. In absence of any in vitro BCR stimulation, ACPA‐expressing memory B cells (MBCs) displayed enhanced expression of Ki‐67 and increased SYK‐, BTK‐, AKT‐, and S6‐phosphorylation compared with TT‐specific MBCs. We demonstrate the simultaneous detection of B cell antigen‐specificity and intracellular protein phosphorylation on the single‐cell level. The data reveal that autoreactive B‐cells in RA, in contrast to B cells against recall antigens, display enhanced phosphorylation of signaling molecules that point toward continuous, presumably antigen‐mediated activation of the autoreactive B‐cell compartment.">

        <tr id="Background: The innate immune response aims to prevent pathogens from entering the organism and/or to facilitate pathogen clearance. Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, mast cells (MCs), natural killer cells and neutrophils, bear pattern recognition receptors and are thus able to recognize common molecular patterns, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the later occurring in the context of neuroinflammation. An inflammatory component in the pathology of otherwise “primary cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative” disease has recently been recognized and targeted as a means of therapeutic intervention. Activated MCs are multifunctional effector cells generated from hematopoietic stem cells that, together with dendritic cells, represent first-line immune defense mechanisms against pathogens and/or tissue destruction. Methods: This review aims to summarize evidence of MC implication in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. Results: In view of recent evidence that the gut–brain axis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and the characterization of the neuroinflammatory component in the pathology of these diseases, this review also focuses on MCs as potential mediators in the gut–brain axis bi-directional communication and the possible role of Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen known to alter the gut–brain axis homeostasis towards local and systemic pro-inflammatory responses. Conclusion: As MCs and Helicobacter pylori infection may offer targets of intervention with potential therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disease, more clinical and translational evidence is needed to elucidate this field.">

Co-culture of ieILC1-like NK cells with the tumor cells resulted in elevated CXCL10 in the supernatant. Flow cytometry demonstrated that ieILC1-like NK cells produce robust amounts of IFNy, a known CXCL10 inducer, while CXCL10 was produced by tumor cells. These results indicate ieILC1-like NK cells induce tumor production of CXCL10, a proinflammatory chemokine that promotes T cell infiltration into the TME.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Accumulating evidence suggests that phenotype switching of cancer cells is essential for therapeutic resistance. However, the immunological characteristics of drug-induced phenotype-switching melanoma cells (PSMCs) are unknown. We investigated PSMC elimination by host immunity using hyperdifferentiated melanoma model cells derived from murine B16F10 melanoma cells. Exposure of B16F10 cells to staurosporine induced a hyperdifferentiated phenotype associated with transient drug tolerance. Staurosporine-induced hyperdifferentiated B16F10 (sB16F10) cells expressed calreticulin on their surface and were phagocytosed efficiently. Furthermore, the inoculation of mice with sB16F10 cells induced immune responses against tumor-derived antigens. Despite the immunogenicity of sB16F10 cells, they activated the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint system and strongly resisted T cell-mediated tumor destruction. However, in vivo treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors successfully eliminated the tumor. Thus, hyperdifferentiated melanoma cells have conflicting immunological properties – enhanced immunogenicity and immune evasion. Inhibiting the ability of PSMCs to evade T cell-mediated elimination might lead to complete melanoma eradication.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immunotherapy that targets immune checkpoints has achieved revolutionary success, but its application in solid tumors remains limited, highlighting the need for reliable enhancement of the efficacy of immunotherapy. Golgi protein 73 (GP73), a Golgi membrane protein, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including immune regulation. Recent studies suggested that GP73 may play a role in modulating the immune response in patients with cancer. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which GP73 regulates T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment.


METHODS
We used T-cell specific GP73 knockout mice to establish MC38 and B16 tumor models to investigate the impact of GP73-deficient T cells on tumor growth. Single-cell sequencing was subsequently employed to classify tumor-infiltrating immune cells and assess changes in cytokines and metabolic genes. Through RNA sequencing, real-time quantitative PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, seahorse analysis, glucose uptake, and L-lactic acid secretion assays, we explored how GP73 regulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) to influence T-cell antitumor functionality. Furthermore, we established adoptive transfer experiments to study the ability of GP73-overexpressing T cells to combat tumors. Blood samples of patient with clinical tumor were collected to assess the relationship between immunotherapy efficacy and T-cell GP73 levels.


RESULTS
In this study, the absence of GP73 in mouse T cells promoted tumor growth and metastasis, accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+T cell subsets infiltrating the tumor and an increase in exhausted CD8+ T-cell subsets. Further analysis revealed that the effector function of CD8+T cells in tumors relies on glycolysis regulated by HIF-1α rather than immune checkpoints. GP73-deficient T cells exhibit severely impaired glycolysis in hypoxic environments, whereas ectopic GP73 expression restores HIF-1α levels. In adoptive immunotherapy, overexpression of GP73 in T cells inhibits tumor growth. In cytotoxicity assays, knockdown of GP73 affected the ability of CD8+T cells to kill target cells. Clinically, tumor immunotherapy partial response patients present significantly elevated levels of GP73 expression in T cells.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings reveal the role of GP73 in regulating T-cell glycolysis and may lead to new therapeutic strategies for the prognosis and treatment of clinical tumor immunotherapy.">

The enrichment of exhausted CD8+ T cell (CD8+ Tex) in the tumor microenvironment is one of the important reasons leading to the poor efficacy of immunotherapy. Recent studies have reported many reasons leading to the CD8+ T cell exhaustion. In addition to cancer cells, myeloid cells can also contribute to T cell exhaustion via many ways. In this review, we discuss the history of the concept of exhaustion, CD8+ T cell dysfunction states, the heterogeneity, origin, and characteristics of CD8+ Tex. We then focus on the effects of myeloid cells on CD8+ Tex, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils.

This study explores SFN glycoconjugates’ effects on LPS-induced inflammation in human dendritic cells (DCs), aiming to enhance therapeutic potential against inflammatory diseases. Monovalent SFN-glycoconjugates with mannose (SFNMan) and fucose (SFNFuc) were developed and tested for their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties in DCs from healthy donors under chronic LPS exposure. Our results revealed that carbohydrate-functionalized SFN improves solubility and effectiveness in suppressing inflammation by targeting the p65 NF-κB pathway, without affecting MAPK signaling. SFN-glycoconjugates induce a tolerogenic immune response, characterized by increased IL-10 production and enhanced regulatory T- and B-cell proliferation. Notably, these effects surpass those of p65 NF-κB inhibition alone, highlighting a distinct and potent regulatory mechanism independent of MAPK pathways. These findings demonstrate the promise of SFN-glycoconjugates as innovative therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases, offering enhanced anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects through improved delivery and targeted molecular pathways.">

        <tr id="Mast cell (MCs) activation is the driving force of immune responses in several inflammatory diseases, including asthma and allergies. MCs are immune cells found throughout the body and are equipped with numerous surface receptors that allow them to respond to external signals from parasites and bacteria as well as to intrinsic signals such as cytokines. Upon activation, MCs release various mediators and proteases that contribute to inflammation. This study aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate MC response to interleukin-33 and their target genes using a model of human cord blood-derived mast cells (hCBMCs). hCBMCs were induced with 10 and 20 ng of recombinant human interleukin-33 (rhIL-33) for 6 and 24 h, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from these cells and miRNA profiling was performed using high-throughput microarrays. Differential expression of miRNAs and target analysis were performed using Transcriptome Analysis Console and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The most significant miRNAs in each condition were miR-6836-5p (fold change = 1.76, p = 3E-03), miR-6883-5p (fold change = -2.13, p = 7E-05), miR-1229-5p (fold change = 2.46, p = 8E-04), and miR-3613-5p (fold change = 66.7, p = 1E-06). Target analysis revealed that these miRNAs regulate mast cell responsiveness and degranulation by modulating the expression of surface receptors, adaptors, and signaling molecules in response to rhIL-33 stimulation. This study is the first miRNA profiling and target analysis of hCBMCs that will further enhance our understanding of the role of miRNAs in the immune response in a timely manner and their relevance for the development of a new therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), recognized for their self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capabilities, have garnered considerable wide attention since their discovery in bone marrow. Recent studies have underscored the potential of MSCs in immune regulation, particularly in the context of autoimmune diseases, which arise from immune system imbalances and necessitate long-term treatment. Traditional immunosuppressive drugs, while effective, can lead to drug tolerance and adverse effects, including a heightened risk of infections and malignancies. Consequently, adjuvant therapy incorporating MSCs has emerged as a promising new treatment strategy, leveraging their immunomodulatory properties. This paper reviews the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs and their application in autoimmune diseases, highlighting their potential to regulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. The immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs are primarily mediated through direct cell contact and paracrine activity with immune cells. This review lays the groundwork for the broader clinical application of MSCs in the future and underscores their significant scientific value and application prospects. Further research is expected to enhance the efficacy and safety of MSCs-based treatments for autoimmune diseases.">

Conversely, the TME itself can modulate the behaviour of these therapies within the host by either supporting or inhibiting their activity. In this review we provide an overview of clinical and preclinical data on the bidirectional influences between T cell therapies and the TME.

        <tr id="Familial platelet disorder (FPD) is associated with germline RUNX1 mutations, establishing a preleukemic state and increasing the risk of developing leukemia. Currently, there are no intervention strategies to prevent leukemia progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 10) combined with functional analysis of samples from patients with RUNX1-FPD (n > 75) revealed that FPD hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) displayed increased myeloid differentiation and suppressed megakaryopoiesis because of increased activation of prosurvival and inflammatory pathways. Bone marrow from patients with RUNX1-FPD contained an elevated cytokine milieu, exerting chronic inflammatory stress on HSPCs. RUNX1-FPD HSPCs were myeloid biased, had increased self-renewal, and were resistant to inflammation-mediated exhaustion. The bone marrow from patients with RUNX1-FPD showed high transcript and protein expression of CD74 at the preleukemic stage compared with that of healthy controls, which remained high upon patient transformation into leukemia. Further, CD74-mediated signaling was exaggerated in RUNX1-FPD HSPCs compared with healthy controls, leading to the activation of mTOR and JAK/STAT pathways with increased cytokine production. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of CD74 with ISO-1 and its downstream targets JAK1/2 and mTOR reversed RUNX1-FPD differentiation defects in vitro and in vivo and reduced inflammation. Our results highlight that inflammation is an early event in RUNX1-FPD pathogenesis, and CD74 signaling is one of the drivers of this inflammation. The repurposing of JAK1/2i (ruxolitinib) and mTORi (sirolimus) and promoting the advancement of CD74 inhibitors in clinical settings as an early intervention strategy would be beneficial to improve the phenotype of patients with RUNX1-FPD and prevent myeloid progression.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) bring unprecedented clinical success, yet many patients endure immune mediated adverse effects and/or fail to respond. Predictive signatures of response to ICB and mechanisms of clinical efficacy or failure remain understudied. DC subsets, in network with conventional αβ T (Tconv), NK, γδ T and iNKT cells, harbor pivotal roles in tumor control, yet their involvement in response to ICB remained underexplored. Methods We performed an extensive longitudinal monitoring of circulating immune cells from melanoma patients treated with first-line anti-PD1, before (T0) and during treatment. We assessed the phenotypic and functional features of DC and effector cells’ subsets by multi-parametric flow cytometry and ProcartaPlex® dosages. Results We revealed differences according to response to treatment and modulations of patterns during treatment, highlighting a strong link between the immune landscape and the outcome of anti-PD1 therapy. Responders exhibited higher frequencies of circulating cDC1s, CD8+ T cells, and γδ2+ T cells in central memory (CM) stage. Notably, we observed a distinct remodeling of ICP expression profile, activation status and natural cytotoxicity receptor patterns of immune subsets during treatment. Anti-PD1 modulated DCs’ functionality and triggered deep changes in the functional orientation of Tconv and γδT cells. Discussion Overall, our work provides new insights into the immunological landscape sustaining favorable clinical responses or resistance to first-line anti-PD1 therapy in melanoma patients. Such exploration participates in uncovering the mechanism of action of anti-PD1, discovering innovative predictive signatures of response, and paves the way to design pertinent combination strategies to improve patient clinical benefits in the future.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a distinct type of stress-induced regulated cell death that can lead to adaptive immune responses and the establishment of immunological memory. ICD exhibits both similarities and differences when compared to apoptosis and other non-apoptotic forms of regulated cell death (RCD). The interplay between ICD-mediated immunosurveillance against cancer and the ability of cancer cells to evade ICD influences the host-tumor immunological interaction. Consequently, the restoration of ICD and the development of effective strategies to induce ICD have emerged as crucial considerations in the treatment of cancer within the context of immunotherapy. To enhance comprehension of ICD in the setting of cancer, this paper examines the interconnected responsive pathways associated with ICD, the corresponding biomarkers indicative of ICD, and the mechanisms through which tumors subvert ICD. Additionally, this review explores strategies for reinstating ICD and the therapeutic potential of harnessing ICD in cancer immunotherapy.">

The interaction between MSCs and MM cells within the bone marrow microenvironment supports MM cell survival, proliferation, and drug resistance. MSCs contribute to the development and maintenance of MM through the secretion of various factors, including cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Moreover, RPs, young and highly reactive platelets, have been implicated in promoting angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis in MM. Several studies show that cells such as MSCs and platelets participate actively in the biology of the disease. Still, in clinical practice, they are not considered part of evaluating affected patients. In this review, we explore the possibility of including the evaluation of MSCs and PRs in the clinical practice for patients with MM as part of the strategies to improve the outcomes of this disease.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Natural killer (NK) cells are integral components of the innate immune system, serving a vital function in eliminating virally infected cells. This review highlights the significance of CXCR5+ NK cells in the context of chronic HIV/SIV infection and viral control.


RECENT FINDINGS
Controlled HIV/SHIV infection results in a substantial increase in the population of CXCR5+ NK cells within the B-cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). These CXCR5+ NK cells display enhanced functional characteristics, including elevated expression of activation markers and increased cytokine production, which are essential for effective viral control. These follicular NK cells are shown to be enriched in IL-15 signaling, and CXCR5 NK cells are negatively associated with viral burden during chronic HIV and SHIV infection.


SUMMARY
The distinct phenotypic and functional attributes of CXCR5+ NK cells, particularly in the lymphoid tissues of individuals living with HIV, emphasize their critical contribution to the anti-HIV-1 immune response. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and roles of CXCR5+ NK cells may present novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing NK-mediated viral control.">

        <tr id="Given the limited comprehensive data on the bone marrow (BM) immune environment in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we analyzed the distribution and phenotype of T cell subsets, including γδ T cells, and their immune checkpoint (IC) ligands on blasts. We performed multiparametric flow cytometry with BM samples taken from 89 AML patients at the time of diagnosis, remission, and relapse/refractory status after chemotherapy and 13 healthy controls (HCs) to identify immune-related risk factors. Compared to the HCs, the T cells of the AML patients exhibited exhausted features including higher TIGIT levels and similar levels of PD-1 and TIM-3. The γδ T cells were exhausted by the upregulation of TIGIT and/or TIM-3 and downregulation of NKG2D and NKp30, with different patterns in the Vδ1 and Vδ2 subtypes. A successful chemotherapeutic response partially restored the exhausted phenotypes of the T cell subsets. The simultaneous analysis of IC receptors on the T cell subsets and their ligands on blasts showed the prognostic value of a specific IC receptor–ligand pair and the feasibility of risk stratification based on their diverse patterns. Our findings clarified the BM T cell landscape in AML, unveiling the prognostic value of γδ T cells in both diagnosis and remission predictions.">

        <tr id="The precise mechanisms by which the complement system contributes to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and promotes tumor progression remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of complement C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) in human and mouse cancer-associated dendritic cells (DCs). First, we observed an overexpression of C5aR1 in tumor-infiltrating DCs, compared to DCs from blood or spleen. C5aR1 expression was restricted to type 2 conventional DCs (cDC2) and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), which displayed a tolerogenic phenotype capable of inhibiting T-cell activation and promoting tumor growth. C5aR1 engagement in DCs drove their migration from tumors to tumor-draining lymph nodes, where C5a levels were higher. We used this knowledge to optimize an anticancer therapy aimed at enhancing DC activity. In three syngeneic tumor models, C5aR1 inhibition significantly enhanced the efficacy of poly I:C, a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist, in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. The contribution of C5aR1 inhibition to the antitumor activity of the combination treatment relied on type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s) and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, required lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs, and was associated with an increase in interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of the C5a/C5aR1 axis in the biology of cancer-associated DCs and provides compelling evidence for the therapeutic potential of modulating the complement system to enhance DC-mediated immune responses against tumors.">

        <tr id="Secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) provide the confined microenvironment required for stromal cells to interact with immune cells to initiate adaptive immune responses resulting in B cell differentiation. Here, we studied three patients from two families with functional hyposplenism, absence of tonsils, and complete lymph node aplasia, leading to recurrent bacterial and viral infections. We identified biallelic loss-of-function mutations in LTBR, encoding the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR), primarily expressed on stromal cells. Patients with LTβR deficiency had hypogammaglobulinemia, diminished memory B cells, regulatory and follicular T helper cells, and dysregulated expression of several tumor necrosis factor family members. B cell differentiation in an ex vivo coculture system was intact, implying that the observed B cell defects were not intrinsic in nature and instead resulted from LTβR-dependent stromal cell interaction signaling critical for SLO formation. Collectively, we define a human inborn error of immunity caused primarily by a stromal defect affecting the development and function of SLOs.">

        <tr id="The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating anticancer immunity, significantly impacting the effectiveness of various cancer therapies, including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Its impact on the development of cancer is complex; certain bacteria, like Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis, can stimulate the growth of tumors by causing immunological evasion and inflammation, while advantageous strains, like Faecalibaculum rodentium, have the ability to suppress tumors by modifying immune responses. Cytokine activity and immune system regulation are intimately related. Cytokines including TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-10 promote tumor development by inhibiting efficient immune surveillance. The gut microbiome exhibits a delicate balance between pro- and anti-tumorigenic factors, as evidenced by the enhancement of anti-tumor immunity by cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-γ. Improved immunotherapy responses are linked to a diverse microbiota, which is correlated with higher tumor infiltration and cytotoxic T-cell activation. Because microbial metabolites, especially short-chain fatty acids, affect cytokine expression and immune cell activation inside the tumor microenvironment, this link highlights the need to maintain microbial balance for optimal treatment effects. Additionally, through stimulating T-cell activation, bacteria like Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidum increase cytokine production and improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). An option for overcoming ICI resistance is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), since research suggests that it improves melanoma outcomes by increasing CD8+ T-cell activation. This complex interaction provides an opportunity for novel cancer therapies by highlighting the possibility of microbiome modification as a therapeutic approach in personalized oncology approaches.">

        <tr id="Polyfunctional T cells programmed to perform activities such as degranulation of lytic enzymes and simultaneous production of multiple cytokines are associated with more effective control of viral infections. Immune responses to recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector delivery systems can critically influence therapeutic efficacy and safety of gene therapy. However, knowledge of polyfunctional T cells in anti-AAV immune responses is scarce. To bridge this knowledge gap, we have investigated the polyfunctionality of primary human CD4 T cells from healthy donors after in-vitro exposure to rAAV2 or rAAV9 vectors. By performing proliferation assays of co-cultured T cells and rAAV pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells from healthy donors we demonstrate T cell reactivity of 43% and 50% to rAAV2 and rAAV9 vectors, respectively. We validated this frequency in a second screen using another set of healthy donors measuring CD25 and CD71 T cell activation. Single T cell secretome analysis of reactive donors uncovered a Th1 pro-inflammatory, cytolytic and chemoattractive cytokine release profile after stimulation with rAAV2 or rAAV9 vectors. 12.4% and 9.6% of the stimulated T cells displayed a polyfunctional cytokine response, respectively, including elevated polyfunctional inflammatory indices. These responses were characterized by cytokine clusters such as Granzyme B, MIP1-α and TNF-α released in combination by single T cells. Overall, our results provide insights into adaptive immunity with rAAV vector serotypes which will be important in advancing gene therapy safety, vector selection, immunogenicity assessment and better patient selection for AAV gene therapy.">

However, the contribution of circulating EVs to modifying endothelial function during dengue virus infection remains unclear. In this study, we showed that severe dengue patients' plasma-derived EV (SD-EV) were found to carry elevated levels of different protein cargos, e.g., immunoregulatory proteins (PD-L1, CD44). Further, we demonstrated that SD-EV induces PD-1 and CD44 expression on CD4+ T cells. SD-EV-modulated CD4+ T (SD-EV-CD4) cells released secretome delayed endothelial cell (EC) migration, arrested them in the G1 phase, and augmented the expression of PD-L1 and ICAM-1 expression on EC through the Notch signaling pathway. Blocking SD-EV and CD4+ T-cell interaction through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway partially rescued the CD4+ T cell's effect on EC but did not alter ICAM-1 expression on EC. We observed that the ICAM-1 expression on EC and hyaluronic acid (HA) release from EC was mediated by CD44, which was elevated on SD-EV-modulated CD4+ T cells (SD-EV-CD4), indicating a permeability defect. Blocking of CD44 on SD-EV-CD4 significantly reduced ICAM-1 expression on EC. Further, depletion of specific cytokines, e.g., TNF-α and not IFN-γ from the SD-EV-CD4 secretome, reduced ICAM-1 expression, decreased transendothelial electrical resistance, and induced apoptosis on EC significantly. Treatment with NF-kB inhibitor before secretome addition to EC reduced ICAM-1 expression on EC. In conclusion, we provided evidence that SD-EV-CD4 carrying PD-1 and CD44, when interacting with EC, significantly affected endothelial cell properties and may be significant in dengue-mediated endothelial dysfunction.IMPORTANCEExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane vesicles secreted into biological fluids, including plasma from living cells, holding insights into pathological processes. Studying EVs under pathological conditions is extremely important as they play a selective role in intercellular communication and modulation of immune response under diverse pathological conditions. However, there is less clarity on how circulatory extracellular vesicles influence immune cells during dengue virus (DV) infection and impact pathogenesis. Our present study highlights the impact of severe dengue patients' plasma-derived EV (SD-EV) on CD4+ T cells and together induce endothelial barrier dysfunction. We provided evidence that SD-EV induces PD-1 and CD44 on CD4+ T cells and, when interacting with endothelial cells (EC), drives endothelial damage through direct interaction or secretome and may be significant in dengue-mediated endothelial dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) has become a dominant regimen in modern cancer therapy, however immune resistance induced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with immune suppressive and evasion properties limits responses. Therefore, the rational design of immune modulators that can control the immune suppressive properties of TAMs and polarize them, as well as dendritic cells (DCs), toward a more proinflammatory phenotype is a principal objective in cancer immunotherapy. Methods Here, using a protein engineering approach to enhance cytokine residence in the tumor microenvironment, we examined combined stimulation of the myeloid compartment via tumor stroma-binding granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to enhance responses in both DCs and T cells via stroma-binding interleukin-12 (IL-12). We evaluated tumor responses at the levels of outcome, cellular responses, and cytokine responses in both the tumors and the tumor-draining lymph nodes. We further investigated the potentiation of DC response to IL-12 by GM-CSF stimulation ex vivo. Results Engineered GM-CSF restored an antitumorigenic tumor myeloid microenvironment otherwise suppressed by TAMs, while engineered IL-12 provided effector signals to T cells, thereby boosting both tumor-resident antitumor macrophage and CD8+ T cell populations. Furthermore, engineered GM-CSF potentiated DC response to IL-12, upregulating DC expression of IL-12 receptor and enhancing their expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines on IL-12 exposure. This resulted in remarkable synergistic efficacy in multiple solid tumor models treated with the dual cytokine combination. The combination therapy also improved the efficacy of CPI in a CPI-resistant genetically-engineered melanoma model and exhibited synergistic antitumor efficacy in a pulmonary metastasis model. Conclusion Our strategy provides a rational design for combination immunotherapy targeting both myeloid and lymphoid compartments through complementary mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Numerous human cancers have exhibited the ability to elude immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This type of resistance can be mediated by immune-suppressive macrophages that limit antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we elucidate a strategy to shift macrophages into a proinflammatory state that down-regulates V domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) via inhibiting AhR and IRAK1. We used a high-throughput microfluidic platform combined with a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify regulators of VISTA levels. Functional characterization showed that the knockdown of these hits diminished VISTA surface levels on macrophages and sustained an antitumor phenotype. Furthermore, targeting of both AhR and IRAK1 in mouse models overcame resistance to ICB treatment. Tumor immunophenotyping indicated that infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ cells, natural killer cells, and antitumor macrophages was substantially increased in treated mice.

        <tr id="Tumor immune escape has become a research hotspot in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the key component of tumor microenvironment, which play a pivotal role in tumor immune escape by regulating the immunity checkpoints, inhibiting the activity of T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and modulating proportion of different T cells. Stanniocalcin-1(STC1)is ubiquitously expressed in human body, which is proven to involve with tumor progression and clinical prognosis. Recently, STC1 is implicated in tumor microenvironment as a phagocytosis checkpoint, as well as regulates the immunity via macrophages. In the review, we discussed the role of STC1 and TAMs in tumor immunity and their crosstalk, hoping to provide references for the research of STC1 in tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute significantly to the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment which is a main barrier for immunotherapies of solid cancers. Reducing Treg numbers enhances anti-tumor immune responses but current depletion strategies also impair effector T cells (Teffs), potentially leading to reduced anti-tumor immunity and/or autoimmune diseases. CD137 has been identified as the most differentially expressed gene between peripheral Tregs and intratumoral Tregs in virtually all solid cancers. Further, CD137 is expressed by malignant cells of certain cancers, making it a potential target for tumor immunotherapy. Here, we report the development of a fully human anti-human CD137 antibody of the IgG1 isotype, clone P1A1, that induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in CD137+ Tregs and cancer cells. P1A1 cross-reacts with murine CD137 which allowed testing murine chimeric P1A1 in syngeneic murine tumor models where P1A1 significantly reduced the number of CD137+ Tregs and inhibited tumor growth in a murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a melanoma lung metastasis model. P1A1 can also be internalized thus enabling it as a carrier for drugs to target CD137+ Tregs and cancer cells. These anti-cancer properties suggest a translation of P1A1 to human immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells contribute to antitumor immunity and are implicated in the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. In particular, CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells were recently found to block spontaneous breast carcinogenesis. However, the antitumor potential of Th2 cells in targeting established breast cancer remains uncertain. Herein, we demonstrate that Th2 cells induced by the topical calcipotriol/thymic stromal lymphopoietin cytokine axis suppressed the growth of established mammary tumors in mice. Interleukin-24 (IL-24), an anticancer cytokine, was highly upregulated in macrophages infiltrating calcipotriol-treated mammary tumors. Macrophages expressed IL-24 in response to IL-4 signaling in combination with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonists (e.g., HMGB1) in vitro. Calcipotriol treatment significantly increased HMGB1 release by tumor cells in vivo. CD4+ T cell depletion reduced HMGB1 and IL-24 expression, reversing calcipotriol’s therapeutic efficacy. Macrophage depletion and TLR4 inhibition also reduced the therapeutic efficacy of calcipotriol. Importantly, calcipotriol treatment failed to control mammary tumors lacking the IL-24 receptor on tumor cells. Collectively, our findings reveal that Th2 cell–macrophage crosstalk leads to IL-24–mediated tumor cell death, highlighting a promising therapeutic strategy to tackle breast cancer.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (SIGLECs) are widely expressed on immune cell surfaces, play an important role in maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses, and are increasingly emerging as potential targets for tumor immunotherapy. However, the expression profile and crucial role of SIGLEC11 in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the prognostic relevance of SIGLEC11 expression and its role in the immune microenvironment in patients with GC.


METHODS
SIGLEC11 expression profile was analyzed using bioinformatics, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining. Flow cytometry, mouse tumor models, patient-derived tumor organoid models, and RNA sequencing were used to explore the potential functions with the underlying mechanisms of SIGLEC11 in a coculture system of macrophages and GC cells.


RESULTS
We demonstrated that SIGLEC11 was predominantly expressed in normal tissues. However, tumor-infiltrating SIGLEC11+ cells in the high SIGLEC11 expression subgroups showed poor overall survival, which was associated with the expression of an immunosuppressive regulator. Our results showed that SIGLEC11 was predominantly expressed in monocytes and macrophages and selectively upregulated in tumor-associated macrophages. Furthermore, SIGLEC11 promoted macrophage M2 polarization via AKT-mTOR signaling. In addition, SIGLEC11+ macrophages accelerate GC progression.


CONCLUSIONS
The abundance of SIGLEC11+ M2-like macrophage-infiltrating tumors may serve as a biomarker for identifying immunosuppressive subtypes of GC. Thus, the potential role of SIGLEC11+ M2 macrophages as therapeutic targets warrants further investigation.">

        <tr id="Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease characterized by reversible airflow limitation and airway hyperresponsiveness, which requires long‐term drug treatment and management. It is very important to study the etiology and pathogenesis of asthma for clinical asthma prevention and treatment. In this study, to understand the correlation between C‐X‐C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) in bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) and antigen presentation of asthma dendritic cells (DCs), an in vitro model of BMDCs was constructed for RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq). The changes of CXCL14 in BMDCs after house dust mites (HDM) stimulation were evaluated. Finally, evaluated the inflammation of the lung tissue in mice, and the expression of costimulatory molecules on the DCs surface in the lung tissue was analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed that CXCL14 was upregulated in BMDCs after HDM stimulation, and its function was related to signal molecule interaction and the immune system. The expression of CXCL14 was increased in the HDM‐induced allergic asthma model. Knockdown of CXCL14 reduced the expression of costimulatory molecules CD86, CD80, and major histocompatibility complex II on the surface of DCs in the lung tissue of mice, induced immune tolerance, and reduced lung inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory factor levels, providing new ideas and theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of bronchial asthma.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are innate immune cells that exert far reaching influence over the tumor microenvironment (TME). Depending on cues within the local environment, TAMs may promote tumor angiogenesis, cancer cell invasion and immunosuppression, or, alternatively, inhibit tumor progression via neoantigen presentation, tumoricidal reactive oxygen species generation and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Therefore, TAMs have a pivotal role in determining tumor progression and response to therapy. TAM phenotypes are driven by cytokines and physical cues produced by tumor cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, immune cells, and other cells within the TME. Research has shown that TAMs can be primed by environmental stimuli, adding another layer of complexity to the environmental context that determines TAM phenotype. Innate priming is a functional consequence of metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming of innate cells by a primary stimulant, resulting in altered cellular response to future secondary stimulation. Innate priming offers a novel target for development of cancer immunotherapy and improved prognosis of disease, but also raises the risk of exacerbating existing inflammatory pathologies. This review will discuss the mechanisms underlying innate priming including metabolic and epigenetic modification, its relevance to TAMs and tumor progression, and possible clinical implications for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Severe lower respiratory tract disease following influenza A virus (IAV) infection is characterized by excessive inflammation and lung tissue damage, and this can impair lung function. The effect of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), which detects viral RNA to initiate antiviral and proinflammatory responses to IAV, on lung function during peak infection and in the resolution phase is not fully understood. Using wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 and TLR7 knockout (TLR7 KO) mice, we found that IAV infection induced airway dysfunction in both genotypes, although in TLR7 KO mice, this dysfunction manifested later, did not affect lung tissue elastance and damping, and was associated with a different immune phenotype. A positive correlation was found between lung dysfunction and the infiltration of neutrophils and Ly6Clo patrolling monocytes at day 7 post-infection. Conversely, in TLR7 KO mice, eosinophil and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were associated with airway hyperactivity at day 14. IL-5 expression was higher in the airways of IAV-infected TLR7 KO mice, suggesting an enhanced Th2 response due to TLR7 deficiency. This study highlights an underappreciated duality of TLR7 in IAV disease: promoting inflammation-driven lung dysfunction during the acute infection but suppressing eosinophilic and CD8+ T cell-dependent hyperresponsiveness during disease resolution.">

        <tr id="Background. Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of malignant blood diseases with a high risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. One treatment approach is to target immune checkpoints (ICs) that are overexpressed on tumor cells. To develop these drugs, relevant models are needed for highthroughput screening and study of these biologically active substances, since traditionally used models (mouse and patient biomaterials) are difficult to access, financially and laborintensive, and are characterized by poorly reproducible results.Aim. To develop a model based on a human myeloid cell line with increased expression of L1 and TIM3 to study the activity of ICs inhibitors, the presence of which in the tumor microenvironment in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia was associated with a high risk and worse prognosis.Materials and methods. Initial testing of the L1 and TIM3 basal expression level was carried out on cell lines: TH1, HL60, OCIAML2, OCIAML5, KG1, MonoMac1. Induction of IC expression was carried out using interferon γ. Analysis of marker expression was carried out 24 hours after induction of ICs expression and addition of MK2206 using flow cytometry.Results. Basal expression of the studied ICs receptors was absent in all of them, except for KG1; TIM3 was present in 88.4 ± 7.1 % of cells, and L1 – in 88 ± 8.5 %. The addition of interferon γ at a concentration of 50 ng/mL to the MonoMac1 culture led to a significant increase in the proportion of TIM3 and L1 expressing cells (53.3 ± 12.2 and 97.3 ± 1.1 % respectively, compared to 0.1 ± 0.1 and 0.1 ± 0.1 % without interferon γ), and for TH1 only L1 expression (87.5 ± 20 %, control 0.1 ± 0.1 %) was observed at the concentration of interferon γ in a medium of 50 ng/mL, while the proportion of cells expressing TIM3 was 6.9 ± 10 % (control 0.1 ± 0.1 %).Conclusion. The KG1 line, which constantly expresses significant levels of target ICs, as well as TH1 and MonoMac1, which are induced by 50 ng/mL interferon γ, were selected as a model with increased L1 and TIM3 expression based on a human myeloid cell line. The model efficiency was confirmed by the rational response to the IC pathway inhibitor.">

Iron is an essential nutrient for immune cells, but it can also pose biochemical risks such as the production of reactive oxygen species. The importance of iron for the NK cell function has gained increasing recognition. We have previously shown that NK cells require iron to efficiently eliminate virus-infected target cells; however, the impact of nutritional iron deficiency on NK cell function and the therapeutic benefits of iron supplementation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that diet-related low iron levels lead to increased retroviral loads due to functional NK cell impairment, while iron supplementation enhances NK cell proliferation, as well as their cytotoxic efficacy. Notably, iron-treated NK cells exhibited significant metabolic changes, including mitochondrial reorganization. Interestingly, although iron supplementation decreased the NK cell’s cytokine production, it significantly improved NK cell degranulation and the expression of cytotoxicity-associated proteins. These findings highlight the critical role of iron in maintaining NK cell immunity and suggest that iron supplementation may hold therapeutic potential for supporting the treatment of viral infections and immunodeficiency disorders.">

These TAMs resemble M2 macrophages, which promote tumor growth and suppress immune responses. GBM cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing microRNA-25, which inhibits the cGAS-STING pathway and prevents TAMs from adopting a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. This study characterizes antimiR-25/cGAMP nanocomplexes (NCs) for potential therapeutic applications. A particle size analysis revealed a significant reduction upon complexation with antimiR-25, resulting in smaller, more stable nanoparticles. Stability tests across pH levels (4–6) and temperatures (25–37 °C) demonstrated their resilience in various biological environments. Biological assays showed that antimiR-25 NCs interacted strongly with transferrin (Tf), suggesting potential for blood–brain barrier passage. The use of cGAMP NCs activated the cGAS-STING pathway in macrophages, leading to increased type I IFN (IFN-β) production and promoting a shift from the M2 to M1 phenotype. The combined use of cGAMP and antimiR-25 NCs also increased the expression of markers involved in M1 polarization. These findings offer insights into optimizing antimiR-25/cGAMP NCs for enhancing immune responses in GBM.">

        <tr id="This article represents not only a significant scientific value, but also a great teaching and instruction value for researchers and motivated students to improve the skill spectrum in flow cytometry. This article provides step-by- step procedure description and results based on in vivo studies on murine lung tissue, cell of interest isolation with dual protocols for flow cytometry method as well as IL-33 impact in dynamics. The newly described innate lymphoid cells of group 2 (ILC2) play an important role in type 2 immune reactions, epithelial repair in mucosal tissue and metabolic homeostasis. ILC2 releases large amounts of type 2 cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13, which stimulate type 2 immunity, such as protection against worms. However, without strict regulation, the level of ILC2 can cause undesirable type 2 immune pathologies, including allergic inflammation of the respiratory tract, hypersensitivity of the respiratory tract and atopic dermatitis. Viral infections of the respiratory tract, which are typical triggers of type 1 immune reactions, often lead to type 2 pulmonary immune pathologies, such as asthma and its exacerbations. Interestingly, pulmonary virus infections induce the release of IL-33 with subsequent induction of ILC2-mediated type 2 pulmonary immunopathology, which is independent of the adaptive immune system.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Adaptive cellular therapy (ACT), particularly chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, has been successful in the treatment of hemopoietic malignancies. However, poor trafficking of administered effector T cells to the tumor poses a great hurdle for this otherwise powerful therapeutic approach in solid cancers. Our previous study revealed that targeting CD93 normalizes tumor vascular functions to improve immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether CD93 blockade improves ACT in solid cancers.


METHODS
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD93 or IGFBP7 were administered in implanted mouse melanoma models to assess the effect of CD93 blockade on ACT. Different sources of effector T cells were used, including pre-activated CD8+OT-1, pmel-1 transgenic T cells, and CAR-T cells. Rip-OVA and Rip-TAG-OVA transgenic mice were used to evaluate the selective impact of CD93 blockade on effector T-cell infiltration in tumors. For mechanistic studies, vascular maturation was determined by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry was performed to examine tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes. Neutralizing mAbs against adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1 were infused to assess their involvement.


RESULTS
Blockade of the CD93 pathway increases the expression of adhesion molecules on tumor vasculature to improve effector T-cell infiltration and function. T-cell transfer and CD93 blockade synergistically improve tumor vascular maturation, as well as inhibit tumor progression. Anti-CD93 selectively promotes effector T-cell infiltration in a tumorous setting where the CD93 pathway is upregulated. In a solid mouse tumor model, blockade of the CD93 pathway improves CAR-T therapy.


CONCLUSIONS
CD93 blockade normalizes tumor vasculature leading to improved effector T-cell infiltration and function in solid cancers. Our study advocates the application of CD93 blockade for ACT in solid cancers.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tissue‐resident memory T (TRM) cells are crucial components of the immune system that provide rapid, localized responses to recurrent pathogens at mucosal and epithelial barriers. Unlike circulating memory T cells, TRM cells are located within peripheral tissues, and they play vital roles in antiviral, antibacterial, and antitumor immunity. Their unique retention and activation mechanisms, including interactions with local epithelial cells and the expression of adhesion molecules, enable their persistence and immediate functionality in diverse tissues. Recent advances have revealed their important roles in chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer, illuminating both their protective and their pathogenic potential. This review synthesizes current knowledge on TRM cells’ molecular signatures, maintenance pathways, and functional dynamics across different tissues. We also explore the interactions of TRM cells with other immune cells, such as B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, highlighting the complex network that underpins the efficacy of TRM cells in immune surveillance and response. Understanding the nuanced regulation of TRM cells is essential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies, including vaccines and immunotherapies, to enhance their protective roles while mitigating adverse effects. Insights into TRM cells’ biology hold promise for innovative treatments for infectious diseases, cancer, and autoimmune conditions.">

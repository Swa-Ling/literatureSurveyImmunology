        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The immune tumor microenvironment (TME) is increasingly recognized as a dynamic ecosystem where B cells play pivotal roles in modulating therapeutic responses, particularly in the context of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. While B cells have traditionally been viewed as bystanders in tumor immunity, recent evidence suggests they may actively influence anti-tumor immunity, albeit with conflicting reports regarding their pro-tumor or anti-tumor roles. This study explores the crucial roles played by B cells and their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) in shaping melanoma responses to ICB therapy. We show a significant enrichment of B cells in ICB therapy responders compared to non-responders, pre-treatment, through retrospective analyses of melanoma patient tumors. Functional assays demonstrate that B cell depletion impairs T cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, underscoring the importance of B cells in anti-tumor responses. To investigate the clinical relevance, EVs were isolated from melanoma patient tumors, and fractioned into tumor and immune subpopulations. MiRNA profiling of CD19+ EVs identifies miR-99a-5p as a top candidate, among several others, upregulated in responders. Functional assays show that miR-99a-5p silencing in B cells diminishes T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity, suggesting its role in promoting B cell-mediated immune responses. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p influences B cell maturation within the TME by mediating class-switch recombination. Our findings highlight the important role of B cells and their derived EVs in shaping the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting B cell-related pathways.

        <tr id="Computerized chest tomography (CT)-guided screening in populations at risk for lung cancer has increased the detection of preinvasive subsolid nodules, which progress to solid invasive adenocarcinoma. Despite the clinical significance, there is a lack of effective therapies for intercepting the progression of preinvasive to invasive adenocarcinoma. To uncover determinants of early disease emergence and progression, we used integrated single-cell approaches, including scRNA-seq, multiplexed imaging mass cytometry and spatial transcriptomics, to construct the first high-resolution map of the composition, lineage/functional states, developmental trajectories and multicellular crosstalk networks from microdissected non-solid (preinvasive) and solid compartments (invasive) of individual part-solid nodules. We found that early disease initiation and subsequent progression are associated with the evolution of immune-suppressive cellular phenotypes characterized by decreased cytotoxic CD8 T and NK cells, increased T cell exhaustion and accumulation of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages expressing TREM2. Within Tregs, we identified a unique population of 4-1BB+ Treg subset enriched for the IL2-STAT5 suppressive pathway with transcription profiles supporting discrete metabolic alterations. Spatial analysis showed increased density of suppressive immune cells around tumor cells, increased exhaustion phenotype of both CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing chemokine CXCL13, and spatial micro-complex of endothelial and lymphocyte interactions within tertiary lymphoid structures. The single-cell architecture identifies determinants of early disease emergence and progression, which may be developed not only as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers but also as targets for disease interception. Additionally, our dataset constitutes a valuable resource for the preinvasive lung cancer research community.">

        <tr id="Self-antigens that are obscure to immune cells under homeostasis, are exposed following tissue damage and can trigger autoimmunity. Our previous work showed that conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) mediate immunoregulation after traumatic skeletal muscle injury. Here, we found that, immune responses to injury in cDC1-depleted mice (Batf3-/-) mirror those of autoimmune mice (Aire-/-). Mechanistically, we determined that cDC1s prime killer regulatory T cells (CD8+/-Ly49+Tregs) which express Ly49 inhibitory receptors and HELIOS. These killer-like Tregs are clonally diverse and carry T cell receptors associated with self-reactivity and response to hydrophobicity. cDC1 or CD8 deletion promoted CD62L+CCR7+ naïve T cell retention and B cell recruitment to injured muscle. These naïve T cells, which are implicated in autoimmunity, strongly correlate with B cell abundance in the muscle and are selectively pruned by CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs. Furthermore, clinically used materials that promote wound healing enrich CD8+/-Ly49+ Treg function whereas those that are associated with pathology promote naïve T cell and B cell accumulation. We hypothesize that CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs maintain self-tolerance after tissue damage and avert autoimmunity by eliminating naive T cells and preventing pathogenic B cell activation.">

        <tr id="Signal transduction downstream of activating stimuli controls CD8+ T cell biology, however these external inputs can become uncoupled from transcriptional regulation in Primary Immune Regulatory Disorders (PIRD). Gain-of-function (GOF) variants in STAT3 amplify cytokine signaling and cause a severe PIRD characterized by early onset autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, recurrent infections, and immune dysregulation. In both primary human and mouse models of STAT3 GOF, CD8+ T cells have been implicated as pathogenic drivers of autoimmunity. The molecular mechanisms by which STAT3 GOF variants drive this pathology remain unclear. We found that naïve CD8+ T cells have an increased capacity for IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion. Given this dysregulation of CD8+ T cell function, we evaluated changes in immunoregulatory pathways and found evidence of dysregulated purinergic signaling via high dimensional immune profiling, single-cell RNA sequencing, and functional assessment. Specifically, while expression of CD39, which transforms ATP to AMP, was increased on CD8+ T cells from patients with STAT3 GOF, downstream purinergic family members, CD73 and the adenosine receptor, A2AR, were downregulated, impairing the potential to produce or sense inhibitory adenosine. Patients with STAT3 GOF can be clinically treated with JAK inhibitors and this partially normalized naïve CD8+ T cell dysregulation, including aberrant cytokine production. The extent of normalization of cytokine secretion scaled with normalization of CD73 and A2AR. This suggests that a dysregulated purinergic signaling axis plays an important role in CD8+ T cell dysregulation in STAT3 GOF, which may have implications for other inflammatory disorders with amplified STAT signaling. One Sentence Summary Amplified STAT3 signaling in CD8+ T cells from STAT3 GOF patients alters purinergic signaling and dysregulates CD8+ T cell function.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. HPV-negative HNSCC, which arises in the upper airway mucosa, is particularly aggressive, with nearly half of patients succumbing to the disease within five years and limited response to immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to other cancers. There is a need to further explore the complex immune landscape in HPV-negative HNSCC to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here, we integrated two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from 29 samples and nearly 300,000 immune cells to investigate immune cell dynamics across tumor progression and lymph node metastasis. Notable shifts toward adaptative immune cell populations were observed in the 14 distinct HNSCC-associated peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) and 21 tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) considering disease stages. All PBMCs and TICs revealed unique molecular signatures correlating with lymph node involvement; however, broadly, TICs increased ligand expression among effector cytokines, growth factors, and interferon-related genes. Pathway analysis comparing PBMCs and TICs further confirmed active cell signaling among Monocyte-Macrophage, Dendritic cell, Natural Killer (NK), and T cell populations. Receptor-ligand analysis revealed significant communication patterns shifts among TICs, between CD8+ T cells and NK cells, showing heightened immunosuppressive signaling that correlated with disease progression. In locally invasive HPV-negative HNSCC samples, highly multiplexed immunofluorescence assays highlighted peri-tumoral clustering of exhausted CD8+ T and NK cells, alongside their exclusion from intra-tumoral niches. These findings emphasize cytotoxic immune cells as valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets, shedding light on the mechanisms by which the HNSCC sustainably evades immune responses.">

        <tr id="The significance of endogenous immune surveillance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains controversial. Using clinical B-ALL samples and a novel mouse model, we show that neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells are induced to adopt type-1 regulatory (Tr1) function in the leukemia microenvironment. Tr1s then inhibit cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, preventing effective leukemia clearance. Leukemic cells induce Tr1s by phenocopying hematopoietic stem cells, which normally are subject to effective surveillance by this CD4+ subset. This mechanism effectively redirects Tr1 cells from a role in preventing cancer to maladaptively promoting clinical relapse. In mouse models, inhibition of Tr1 expansion with IL10 receptor (IL10R) blockade is insufficient to improve leukemia control. In contrast, combined therapy with a cytotoxic agent and anti-PDL1 blockade eradicated measurable residual disease. This correlates with polarization of the neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cell population from Tr1 towards Th1 states. Our findings uncover a mechanism that enables leukemic relapse and resolves existing controversies on the role of immune surveillance towards this cancer type. Therapeutic polarization of neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells towards Th1 states may improve contemporary immune therapies by reshaping the immune microenvironment towards states permissive for cytotoxic attack of residual leukemia. Key Points B-ALL induces neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells to adopt Type-1 regulatory states, which protect leukemic cells from immune pressure. Repolarizing neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cells towards Th1 states eradicates measurable residual disease.">

        <tr id="Introduction Our aim was to investigate the insufficiently understood differences in the immune system between anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)-positive (ACPA+) and ACPA-negative (ACPA-) early rheumatoid arthritis (eRA) patients. Methods We performed multiple cytokine assays using sera from drug-naïve ACPA+ and ACPA- eRA patients. Additionally, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing of CD45+ cells from peripheral blood samples to analyze and compare the distribution and functional characteristics of the cell subsets based on the ACPA status. Results Serum concentrations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-12 were higher in ACPA+ eRA than in ACPA- eRA. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of 37,318 cells identified 17 distinct cell types and revealed the expansion of IL1B+ proinflammatory monocytes, IL7R+ T cells, and CD8+ CCL4+ T cells in ACPA+ eRA. Furthermore, we observed an enrichment of IFN-γ response genes in nearly all monocytes and T cells of ACPA+ eRA subsets. Heightened interactions between IFN-γ and IFN-γ receptors were observed in ACPA+ eRA, particularly between monocytes and T cells. We examined IFITM2 and IFITM3 as potential key markers in ACPA+ eRA given their pronounced upregulation and association with the IFN response. Specifically, the expression of these genes was elevated in IL1B+ proinflammatory monocytes (likely M1 monocytes), correlating with serum IFN-γ levels. Discussion Compared to ACPA- eRA, ACPA+ eRA showed higher serum IFN-γ and IL-12 levels, upregulated IFN-γ response genes, and enhanced IFN-γ-driven monocyte-T cell interactions. These distinct immune features of the peripheral circulation in ACPA+ eRA suggest a role for type 1 helper T cell-related immunity in its pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by unremitting immune attack on pancreas insulin-producing beta cells. Persistence of the autoimmune response is mediated by TCF1+ Ly108+ progenitor CD8+ T (Tprog) cells, a stem-like population that gives rise to exhausted effectors with limited cytolytic function in chronic virus infection and cancer. What paradoxically drives Tprog conversion to highly cytolytic effectors in T1D, however, remains unclear. Here, we show that the epigenetic regulator UTX controls diabetogenic CD8+ Tprog differentiation by poising chromatin for transition to a cytolytic effector state. Indeed, deletion of UTX function in T cells impairs conversion of Tprog to autoimmune effectors and protects mice from spontaneous diabetes, as well as an aggressive form of autoimmune diabetes induced by anti-PD1 cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, short-term treatment with UTX inhibitor GSKJ4 similarly protects from T1D, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting UTX-mediated mechanisms to break unremitting autoimmune responses.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 induce durable responses in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the therapeutic response after CAR-T cell treatment remains incompletely understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry-based analyses of bone marrow-resident immune cells from B-ALL patients before and after CAR T-cell treatment. We observed profound changes in the microenvironment in response to CAR T cell-mediated inflammation, including an increase in myeloid cells. Significant induction of the IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling was associated with expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and endogenous exhausted CD8+ T cells. PD1 expression in endogenous T cells post-treatment was associated with a lack of durable response in the cohort of patients analyzed. Further, we revealed that HIF1α, VEGF, and TGFBR2 are key players in the intercellular communication between CAR T cells and the immune niche, driving widespread T-cell dysfunction. Infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells led to increased accumulation of human MDSCs, exacerbation of a hypoxic environment and T-cell exhaustion in HSPC-humanized mice bearing a human tumor. In conclusion, CAR T-cell-mediated myeloid activation is associated with pathways of immune dysregulation that may antagonize the effects of therapy. Key points The tumor immune context post-treatment affects CAR T-cell fate and endogenous immunity in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling result in endogenous T-cell exhaustion and compromise CAR T-cell efficacy.">

To investigate the cellular and molecular aspects of inter-tissue communication during infection we established a percutaneous infection model with the tissue-migrating nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. High-dimension profiling of the initial cutaneous immune response revealed that dermal γδ T cells become activated, engage cell motility-associated transcriptional pathways and leave the skin after parasite invasion. Chemical and genetic inhibition of leukocyte migration prevents the accumulation of IL-17-producing γδ T cells in the lungs. Notably, bypassing the skin phase of infection, and therefore preventing dermal γδ T cell migration, dampens the increase in early IL-17 production in the lungs, and, instead, leads to enhanced IFN-γ responses together with increased lung damage. Collectively, our data highlights a critical skin–lung axis regulating host-parasite interactions and safeguarding lung health.">

Intratumoral delivery of synthetic STING agonists induces IFN-I dependent tumor regression in preclinical cancer models and is being tested clinically. In this study, we investigate the role of monocytic lineage (MCs) cells in response to STING agonist induced IFN-I signaling. We show that CCR2-deficient mice, lacking inflammatory MCs in the periphery, or Lyz2-Cre-IFNAR1fl/fl mice in which IFN-I signaling in monocytes is reduced, exhibit impaired responses to STING agonist therapy of MC38 and/or B16F10 tumors. STING agonist treatment induced CCR5-dependent migration of MCs carrying tumor antigen from the tumor to the lymph nodes. Single-cell RNA sequencing of CD45+ cells from lymph nodes and tumors of mice in which half the hematopoietic cells lack the interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (IFNAR1) revealed that STING agonist therapy induces intrinsic IFNAR1-dependent acquisition of an inflammatory monocytic cell phenotype distinct from inflammatory cDC and a reduction in macrophages with a pro-tumor TGFβ/angiogenesis transcriptome. IL-18 - IL-18R1 interaction was the top predicted interaction between monocytic lineage cells and CD8+T cells or NK cells. Blocking IL-18 reduced the therapeutic efficacy of STING agonist treatment in CCR2+/+ but not CCR2-/- mice, implicating IL-18 production by the monocytes in STING agonist therapy of melanoma. These findings support a pivotal role for IL-18 producing inflammatory monocytic lineage cells in tumor control following STING agonist treatment.">

Metabolic and immunologic dysfunction are archetypal findings in critically ill patients with sepsis, but whether these factors are mechanistically linked remains incompletely defined. We characterized functional metabolic properties of human CD4 T cells from critically ill patients with and without sepsis and healthy adults. CD4 T cells in critical illness showed increased subset-specific metabolic plasticity, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) acquiring glycolytic capacity that stabilized suppressive markers FOXP3 and TIGIT and correlated with clinical illness severity. Single-cell transcriptomics identified differential kynurenine metabolism in Tregs, which was validated ex vivo as a mechanism of Treg glycolytic adaptation and suppressive rewiring. These findings underscore immunometabolic dysfunction as a driver of CD4 T cell remodeling in sepsis and suggest therapeutic avenues to restore an effective immune response.">

Single-cell RNA sequencing, immune-phenotyping, and metabolic modeling identified altered expression of chemokine and metabolite receptors and altered metabolic flux in PWH monocytes that decreased monocyte migration. The plasma secretome revealed a nonclassical inflammatory microenvironment in PWH. Integrative multi-omics and single-cell proteomics of differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) detected metabolic reprogramming orchestrated by α-ketoglutarate (AKG) that affected macrophage function and HIV infection. Increased levels of AKG in plasma were shown to occur in PWH under ART. Therefore, when differentiating MDM with serum from PWH or AKG, macrophage function was found polarized towards an M2-like state. AKG alone was shown to increase CCR5 levels and increase HIV-1 infection in MDM. Here, we utilize systems biology-driven identification and ex vivo assays to show impaired macrophage polarization, due to metabolic training, can leads to a low-grade nonclassical inflammatory environment in well-treated PWH.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are a key cell type of the innate immune system and are involved at all steps of inflammation: (i) they present antigens to initiate inflammation, (ii) they clear up foreign bodies through phagocytosis, and (iii) they resolve inflammation by removing or deactivating mediator cells. Many subtypes of macrophages have been identified, classified by their niche and/or embryonic origin. In order to better develop therapies for conditions with macrophage dysfunction, it is crucial to decipher potential sex-differences in key physiological mediators of inflammation so that treatment efficacy can be ensured regardless of biological sex. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis approach of transcriptomics datasets for male vs. female mouse macrophages across 8 niches to characterize conserved sex-dimorphic pathways in macrophages across origins and niches. For this purpose, we leveraged new and publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets from murine macrophages, preprocessed these datasets and filtered them based on objective QC criteria, and performed differential gene expression analysis using sex as the covariate of interest. Differentially expressed (DE) genes were compared across datasets and macrophage subsets, and functional enrichment analysis was performed to identify sex-specific functional differences. Consistent with their presence on the sex chromosomes, three genes were found to be differentially expressed across all datasets (i.e. Xist, Eif2s3y, and Ddx3y). More broadly, we found that female-biased pathways across macrophage niches are more consistent than male-biased pathways, specifically relating to components of the extracellular matrix. Our findings increase our understanding of transcriptional similarities across macrophage niches and underscore the importance of including sex as a biological variable in immune-related studies. Highlights Across 17 independently transcriptomic macrophage datasets, three genes are always differentially expressed between males and females: Ddx3y, Eif2s3y, and Xist. Jaccard analysis reveals female macrophages have more stereotypical transcriptional profile than male macrophages across niches. Functional enrichment analyses show that female-biased pathways across macrophage subtypes are enriched for extracellular matrix-related genes.">

        <tr id="Resistance to immunotherapy is a cardinal feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Inhibition of Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO), a post-translational modification with important immune regulatory functions, augments responsiveness to immunotherapy in non-PDAC models via pro-immunogenic effects on myeloid cells, cancer cells, and T-cells. Recently, it has been reported that SUMO inhibition has direct immunogenic effects on PDAC. Here, we report that the novel combination of SUMO inhibition with a small molecule, TAK-981, plus antibody-mediated CD40 agonism improves survival in an aggressive orthotopic mouse model of PDAC by enhancing anti-tumoral immunogenicity. This combination amplifies CD8+ T-cell tumor infiltration and induces significant changes among macrophages. TAK-981 also leads to enhanced cancer specific MHC-I expression both in vitro and in vivo by augmenting interferon signaling. We show that the improvement in survival is mediated by macrophages. Our findings show that SUMO inhibition complements CD40 agonism to enhance immune activity in PDAC via interferon signaling, improving survival in an aggressive pre-clinical model of PDAC and translating previous findings to a characteristically immunosuppressive and highly aggressive solid malignancy.">

        <tr id="Long-standing goals of cancer immunotherapy are to activate cytotoxic antitumor T cells across a broad range of affinities while dampening suppressive regulatory T (Treg) cell responses, but current approaches achieve these goals with limited success. Here, we report a de novo IL-21 mimic, 21h10, designed to have augmented stability and high signaling potency in both humans and mice. In multiple animal models and in ex vivo human melanoma patient derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS), 21h10 showed robust antitumor activity. 21h10 generates significantly prolonged STAT signaling in vivo compared with native IL-21, and has considerably stronger anti-tumor activity. Toxicities associated with systemic administration of 21h10 could be mitigated by TNFα blockade without compromising antitumor efficacy. In the tumor microenvironment, 21h10 induced highly cytotoxic antitumor T cells from clonotypes with a range of affinities for endogenous tumor antigens, robustly expanding low-affinity cytotoxic T cells and driving high expression of interferon-𝛾 (IFN-𝛾) and granzyme B compared to native IL-21, while increasing the frequency of IFN-𝛾+ Th1 cells and reducing that of Foxp3+ Tregs. As 21h10 has full human/mouse cross-reactivity, high stability and potency, and potentiates low-affinity antitumor responses, it has considerable translational potential.">

        <tr id="While CD20 was initially characterized as a B cell-specific marker, its expression on memory T cells has expanded our understanding of this molecule’s distribution and function. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized CD20-expressing NK cell population and demonstrate its functional significance. CD56+CD20+ NK cells exhibit hallmarks of cellular activation, including elevated NKp46, CD69, and CD137 expression, enhanced proliferative capacity, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-10). Functional analyses revealed enhanced cytotoxicity against K562 targets, correlating with increased expression of cytolytic mediators including granzymes A, B, and K, perforin, FASL, and TRAIL. Single-cell transcriptional profiling demonstrated that MS4A1-expressing NK cells possess a distinct molecular signature characterized by elevated granzyme K expression and memory-like features. These cells preferentially localize to secondary lymphoid organs and accumulate in inflammatory tissues. Notably, CD56+CD20+ NK cells are enriched in multiple inflammatory conditions, including multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B infection, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung cancer. Treatment with rituximab depletes this population, suggesting potential therapeutic implications. Our findings establish CD20+ NK cells as a functionally distinct lymphocyte subset with enhanced effector capabilities and tissue-homing properties, providing new insights into immune regulation in inflammatory diseases.

        <tr id="Although IgA+ long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) generated following mucosal viral infection provide durable protection against reinfection, little is known about their generation. Here, we show that oral RV infection induces gut-resident LLPCs that produce highly mutated protective IgA. Unlike RV-specific IgG+ LLPCs, IgA+ LLPCs were generated independently of MHCII expression by dendritic cells – rather MHCII expression by B cells was both necessary and sufficient. B cell MHCII was also sufficient to induce a unique population of T-bet+ follicular helper T (TFH1) cells which were crucial for RV-specific IgA+ LLPC accumulation in the gut via IFNγ- and CXCR3-dependent mechanisms. Similar to RV infection, TFH1 cells were required for influenza-specific IgA response. However, unlike RV infection, B cell MHCII was not sufficient to induce influenza-specific IgA+ LLPCs, suggesting the operation of mucosal site-specific priming mechanisms. Collectively, our data reveal that unconventionally primed TFH1 cells support IgA responses to mucosal viral infections.">

        <tr id="Introduction Bryostatin-1, a potent agonist of the protein kinase C, has been studied for HIV and cancer therapies. In HIV research, it has shown anti-HIV effects during acute infection and reactivation of latent HIV in chronic infection. As effective CD8+ T cell responses are essential for eliminating reactivated virus and achieving a cure, it is important to investigate how bryostatin-1 affects HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. HIV-specific CD8+ T cells often become exhausted, showing reduced proliferative potential and impaired cytokine production, a dysfunction also observed in cancer. Therefore, we further investigated how bryostatin-1 directly impacts exhausted CD8+ T cells. Methods PBMCs from people with HIV (PWH) were treated with bryostatin-1 and tracked with proliferation dye for cell expansion. One day 6, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected by tetramers staining and examined by flow cytometry. By utilizing an established in vitro murine T cell exhaustion system, changes in inhibitory receptors, transcription factors, cytokine production and killing capacity of bryostatin-1 treated exhausted CD8+ T cells were determined by flow cytometry. RNA-seq analysis was performed to study transcriptional changes in these cells. Results We found that bryostatin-1 improved the expansion and decreased PD-1 expression of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Bryostatin-1 enhanced the functionality and proliferation while decreasing inhibitory receptor expression of in vitro generated exhausted CD8+ T cells. Bryostatin-1 upregulated TCF-1 and decreased TOX expression. These changes were confirmed through RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) 11 was significantly downregulated in exhausted CD8+ T cells, however, it greatly upregulated after bryostatin-1 treatment. Inhibition of MAPK11 in bryostatin-1-treated cells blocked the increased proliferation and IFN-γ production induced by bryostatin-1, but did not affect other bryostatin-1 induced effects, such as the reduction of inhibitory receptors. Discussion Our data demonstrate that bryostatin-1 induces a MAPK 11-dependent improvement in the proliferative and functional capacity of exhausted T cells. This study provides a rationale for bryostatin-1's potential to help eradicate the HIV reservoir during treatment, and it may also contribute to cancer immunotherapy by functionally improving exhausted CD8+ T cells.">

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells are critical for immunosurveillance yet become dysfunctional in contexts such as chronic stimulation by viral infections or cancer. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less well characterized, which limits therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, which have remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Tumor clearance by T cells is impaired by insufficient tumor antigen recognition, insufficient tumor infiltration, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although targeted T cell therapy circumvents failures in tumor antigen recognition, suppression by the TME and failure to infiltrate the tumor can hinder tumor clearance by these T cells. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) promises to reverse T cell suppression in the TME and can be combined with bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapy to improve clinical outcomes. CPIs require the target pathway of inhibition to be active in the TME to elicit a therapeutic response. We hypothesize that adoptively transferred T cell function may be improved by the addition of CPI if the inhibitory pathway is functionally active. This study develops a kinetic-dynamic model of serial killing of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer cells mediated by BATs using single-cell transcriptomic and temporal protein data to identify T cell phenotypes and quantify inhibitory receptor expression. LAG3, PD-1, and TIGIT were identified as inhibitory receptors expressed by cytotoxic effector CD8 BATs upon exposure to HR+ breast cancer cell lines. These data were combined with real-time tumor cytotoxicity data in a multivariate statistical analysis framework to predict the relevant contributions of T cells expressing each receptor to tumor reduction. A mechanistic kinetic-dynamic mathematical model was developed and parametrized using protein expression and cytotoxicity data for in silico validation of the findings of the multivariate statistical analysis. The model corroborated the predictions of the multivariate statistical analysis which identified LAG3+ BATs as the primary effectors, while TIGIT expression dampened cytotoxic function. These results inform CPI selection for BATs combination therapy and provide a framework to maximize BATs anti-tumor function against HR+ cancers. Our model provides a means to optimize targets for CPIs used in combination with BATs in clinical strategies. What is already known on this topic Bispecific antibody armed T cell (BATs) therapies are adoptive T cell therapies that can effectively reroute T cell cytotoxicity toward cancerous cells, but lack consistent and durable anti-tumor responses. Checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of activated T cells dampen immune responses and can be overstimulated in solid tumors to hamper tumor clearance by T cells. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs can improve T cell anti-tumor response by blocking checkpoint protein signaling but are only effective if the targeted checkpoint protein is expressed on the T cell and activated in the tumor microenvironment, highlighting an opportunity to enhance BAT efficacy by combining treatment with synergistic CPI. What this study adds This study characterizes dynamic, time-resolved patterns in checkpoint protein expression by breast cancer-targeting adoptive T cells and predicts the significance of high-prevalence checkpoint proteins on T cell function. It also demonstrates the use of multivariate statistic and mathematical modeling toward rational design of targets and timing strategies for synergistic combination therapies. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy The output of this study provides justification for therapeutic strategies combining adoptive T cell therapies with checkpoint inhibitor drugs targeting TIGIT and LAG3 as a means of improving patient responses in HER2-/HR+ breast cancers.">

        <tr id="Background Bispecific T cell-engagers (BTEs) are engineered antibodies that redirect T cells to target antigen-expressing tumors. BTEs targeting various tumor-specific antigens, like interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2) and EGFRvIII, have been developed for glioblastoma (GBM). However, limited knowledge of BTE actions derived from studies conducted in immunocompromised animal models impedes progress in the field. To close this gap, we investigated how BTE functions, engaging hosts’ immune systems in the context of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of the orthotopic and genetically engineered pre-clinical models of GBM. Methods We developed a BTE protein that bridges CD3 epsilon on murine T cells to IL13RA2-positive GBM cells. We then investigated the BTE therapeutic mechanism to promote anti-glioma activity in immunocompetent mouse models of GBM. To do so, we paired survival studies with multi-color flow cytometry, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in several orthotopic and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of GBM. Results BTE-mediated interaction of murine T cells and GBM cells potently activated T cells, resulting in antigen-dependent killing of GBM cells. BTE treatment significantly extended the survival of mice bearing IL13RA2-expressing orthotopic glioma and de novo formed GBM in the GEM model. The quantification parametric MR imaging validated the survival data, showing a reduction in tumor volume and decreased tumor viability. Flow cytometric and scRNA-seq analyses of the tumor microenvironment (TME) revealed robust increases in activated and memory T cells and decreases in immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the brains of mice following BTE treatment. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that BTE’s survival benefits in GBM are due to its ability to engage the host immune system in direct killing, boost immunological memory, and modulate the TME. These findings provide a deeper insight into the mechanism of BTE actions in GBM.">

Although the etiology of T1D is not fully understood, it is linked to dysregulation of the T-cell compartment. To identify T-cell signatures associated with T1D, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood T-cells from newly diagnosed children, the same children after one year, and healthy donors. We observed reduced expression of genes related to effector and cytotoxic T-cell functions across conventional, unconventional, and regulatory T-cell subsets in diabetic children, particularly at the time of diagnosis. These findings were supported by flow cytometry analysis of the same cohort and by reanalysis of publicly available data. Overall, our results suggest that T1D is associated with impaired T-cell effector differentiation, which may contribute to immune dysregulation and loss of self-tolerance.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterised by an overwhelming immune response and high fatality. While most research has focused on its acute phase, many sepsis survivors remain immunologically weakened leaving them susceptible to serious complications from even mild infections. The mechanisms underlying this prolonged immune dysregulation remain unclear, limiting effective interventions. Here, we analysed whether sepsis induced long-term “training” in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), imprinting changes that persist in their myeloid progeny. Peripheral blood analysis of 8 sepsis survivors, 12 patients with septic shock, and 10 healthy donors revealed a significant expansion of CD38+ progenitors in survivors, with increases in megakaryocyte-erythroid and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and reduced mature neutrophil counts. This shift suggests impaired granulopoiesis, favouring immature, immunosuppressive granulocytes. Differentiated macrophages from survivors’ HSPCs exhibited impaired metabolic pathways after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, with downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis genes, indicating altered immune metabolism. Pathway analysis revealed enhanced type-I interferon (IFN) and JAK-STAT signalling in survivors’ macrophages, reflective of potentially tolerance-prone reprogramming. Finally, exposing healthy donor HSPCs to IFNβ during macrophage differentiation reduced HSPC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and induced a metabolic shift towards glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings suggest that sepsis induces lasting reprogramming in HSPCs leading to myeloid progeny with altered immune memory that might drive immune dysregulation in survivors. These data open avenues to explore potential targets to better manage long-term immune alterations in sepsis survivors. KEY POINTS Sepsis induces long-term alterations in HSPCs, leading to the expansion of immature progenitors and metabolic dysregulation of their progeny. Type-I IFN signalling reprograms macrophage differentiation, affecting their metabolic function and reducing cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major global cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for over a million deaths annually. Despite this burden, natural immunity prevents disease in more than 90% of exposed individuals. Previous studies have identified interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as a key regulator of innate immune defense against MTB. Here, we investigate the impact of IFN-γ timing on macrophage-mediated control of MTB infection. We demonstrate that IFN-γ exposure before infection enhances macrophage antibacterial activity, whereas post-infection exposure does not. Further investigation into this phenotype revealed a strong association between c-Myc signaling and macrophage function in MTB control, as identified using unbiased in vitro systems approaches. Given the challenge of perturbing c-Myc in primary cells, we developed a lentiviral system for c-Myc inhibition and overexpression. Using a tetracycline-inducible Omomyc system - a small peptide inhibitor of c-Myc - we show that c-Myc inhibition promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype with enhanced anti-mycobacterial activity. Mechanistically, c-Myc inhibition induces metabolic reprogramming via increased mTORC1 activity, leading to upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase and improved bacterial clearance. In vivo analyses, including murine models and human clinical histopathology, reveal a strong correlation between c-Myc expression and MTB persistence, as well as active tuberculosis (TB), suggesting a role for c-Myc in immune evasion. These findings reveal c-Myc as a potential mediator of immune privilege in MTB infection and highlight its role as a promising target for novel TB therapies aimed at enhancing macrophage function. Author Summary Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), remains a major global health threat. While most people exposed to MTB successfully fight off the infection, some individuals develop active disease. Understanding how the bacteria evade immune defenses is key to developing better treatments. In this study, we identify a new role for c-Myc, a protein well-known in cancer research, in suppressing the ability of immune cells called macrophages to fight MTB. Macrophages are responsible for engulfing and killing bacteria, but we found that c-Myc interferes with this process, allowing MTB to survive. Using a small peptide inhibitor called Omomyc, we were able to block c-Myc activity, which restored macrophages’ ability to kill MTB. This effect is linked to changes in cellular metabolism, leading to the increased production of molecules essential for bacterial destruction. We also discovered that high c-Myc levels are associated with persistent MTB infection in both mouse models and human tissues. This suggests that c-Myc helps the bacteria evade immune attack, contributing to long-term infection. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism exploited by MTB to survive in the body and suggest that targeting c-Myc could be a promising approach to enhancing immune defenses against TB. By bridging insights from cancer biology and infectious disease research, our work provides a new perspective on tackling TB and highlights c-Myc as a potential therapeutic target for boosting immunity against this deadly infection.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are critical regulators of HIV immunity, but the mechanisms behind their expansion and value as a therapeutic target remain unclear. We investigated MDSC function in HIV using a humanized mouse model. Acute HIV-1 infection triggered the systemic expansion of polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), with their frequency correlating positively with plasma viral load. Notably, PMN-MDSC expansion increased further when natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were depleted, suggesting these immune cells restrain MDSC proliferation. We identified Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis as a regulatory mechanism, as MDSCs expressed high levels of TRAIL receptor 2 (R2), while NK cells and CTLs upregulated TRAIL expression during HIV infection. Treating HIV-1-infected mice with a TRAIL-R2 agonist significantly reduced MDSC levels to those of uninfected mice and significantly improved NK cell and CTL immune function. Crucially, in viremic humanized mice, the treatment prevented CD4+ T cell loss, a hallmark of HIV-1 pathogenesis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting MDSC apoptosis to mitigate CD4+ T cell depletion and enhance HIV-specific immunity, offering a new clinical target to prevent AIDS and insights into MDSC– NK/CTL cross-regulation during HIV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Crosstalk between autophagy, host cell death, and inflammatory host responses to bacterial pathogens enables effective innate immune responses that limit bacterial growth while minimizing coincidental host damage. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) thwarts innate immune defense mechanisms in alveolar macrophages (AMs) during the initial stages of infection and in recruited bone marrow-derived cells during later stages of infection. However, how protective inflammatory responses are achieved during Mtb infection and the variation of the response in different macrophage subtypes remain obscure. Here, we show that the autophagy receptor Tax1bp1 plays a critical role in enhancing inflammatory cytokine production and increasing the susceptibility of mice to Mtb infection. Surprisingly, although Tax1bp1 restricts Mtb growth during infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Budzik et al. 2020) and terminates cytokine production in response to cytokine stimulation or viral infection, Tax1bp1 instead promotes Mtb growth in AMs, neutrophils, and a subset of recruited monocyte-derived cells from the bone marrow. Tax1bp1 also leads to increases in bacterial growth and inflammatory responses during infection of mice with Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular pathogen that is not effectively targeted to canonical autophagy. In Mtb-infected AMs but not BMDMs, Tax1bp1 enhances necrotic-like cell death early after infection, reprogramming the mode of host cell death to favor Mtb replication in AMs. Tax1bp1’s impact on host cell death is a mechanism that explains Tax1bp1’s cell type-specific role in the control of Mtb growth. Similar to Tax1bp1-deficiency in AMs, the expression of phosphosite-deficient Tax1bp1 restricts Mtb growth. Together, these results show that Tax1bp1 plays a crucial role in linking the regulation of autophagy, cell death, and pro-inflammatory host responses and enhancing susceptibility to bacterial infection. Author Summary Although macrophages are the first innate immune cells to encounter Mycobacterium tuberculosis during infection, M. tuberculosis has evolved the ability to persist in them. Recent studies highlight that some types of macrophages are more permissive to M. tuberculosis replication and survival than others, but the mechanisms for cell type-specific differences in M. tuberculosis growth are only beginning to be understood. We found that the host factor, Tax1bp1 (Tax-1 binding protein 1), supports M. tuberculosis growth during animal infection and in specific subsets of innate immune cells, including alveolar macrophages while restricting M. tuberculosis in bone marrow-derived macrophages. We also found that Tax1bp1 has a similar phenotype in enhancing the pathogenesis of another intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes. Compared to bone marrow-derived macrophages, in alveolar macrophages, Tax1bp1 enhances the release of inflammatory mediators and leads to necrotic-like host cell death, which is known to enhance M. tuberculosis growth. Phosphorylation of Tax1bp1 in alveolar macrophages promotes M. tuberculosis growth. Our research highlights that Tax1bp1 is a host target for host-directed therapy against M. tuberculosis and controls host responses to M. tuberculosis in a cell type-specific manner.">

This highlights the needs to develop novel therapy for HIV-1 related diseases in PWH. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic effect of CD24-Fc, a fusion protein with anti-inflammatory properties that interacts with danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and siglec-10, in chronic HIV-1 infection model using humanized mice undergoing suppressive cART. Our findings show that CD24-Fc treatment significantly reduced inflammation and immune hyperactivation in vivo when combined with cART. CD24-Fc mediated resolution of inflammation was associated with improved recovery of CD4 T cells, reduced immune activation, restored central memory T cells and reversal of immune cell exhaustion phenotype. Notably, CD24-Fc treatment rescued CXCR5+ CD8 central memory T cell (TCM) which correlated with increased polyfunctionality in HIV-specific T cells in humanized mice and in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PWH. This restoration of CXCR5+ memory CD8 T cells was associated with HIV replication inhibition, delayed viral rebound and reduced HIV-1 pathogenesis upon cART cessation. This study suggests that CD24-Fc treatment could represent a promising new therapeutic strategy for managing chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH. Author summary Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) cannot block viral gene expression from activated HIV proviral DNA in reservoir cells, contributing to chronic immune activation and inflammation associated diseases in people with HIV (PWH). The therapeutic treatment of anti-inflammatory fusion protein CD24-Fc in humanized mice during suppressive cART (i) resolves inflammation and chronic HIV-1 immune pathogenesis during suppressive cART, (ii) rescues CXCR5-expressing CD8 memory T cells and enhances antiviral response in humanized mice and PWH PBMCs, (iii) delays virus rebound and reduces viral pathogenesis after cART cessation. Thus, CD24-Fc could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH.">

        <tr id="Chronic HIV infection drives B-cell dysfunction associated with the accumulation of tissue-like memory (TLMs) and activated memory B cells (MBCs) but decline in resting memory B cells. TLMs express multiple inhibitory receptors and lack response to soluble antigens. However, their origin and the mechanisms driving their expansion in HIV infection remain unclear. By using bulk BCR sequencing of memory B cell subsets from elite HIV controllers and an ART-controlled cohort, we revealed that TLMs (CD21- CD27- B cells) were significantly less mutated but also less diverse than other MBCs, suggesting an enrichment for innate-like B cells or that they belong to a less mature subset. Subsequent detailed multi-omics study of an immune response in an elite controller to a transient HIV viraemia demonstrated a functional increase in Env-reactive IgG and MBCs with non-TLM phenotype. Single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of PMBCs enriched for B cells revealed an orchestrated TNF-alpha response followed by interferon alpha and gamma response across all B cells subsets. We noted an emergence of innate-like extrafollicular PLD4+ plasmablasts and previously undepreciated heterogeneity of a stable TLM population. We identified two distinct TLM subsets: TLM1 (T-betlow) and TLM2 (T-bethi) that differed in their differentiation stage, isotype use and mutational burden. Surprisingly, both subsets (TLM1 more than TLM2) were enriched for IGHV4-34 segment use (associated with self-reactivity) and displayed a persistent activation and BCR signalling signature, indicating (with other BCR indices) a strong presence of innate-like B cells. However, pseudotime analyses revealed that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment. This study provides a new insight into multifaceted functional B-cell response to transient HIV viraemia as likely happens during the early phase of anti-retroviral therapy cessation, highlighting the TLM heterogeneity and the contribution of innate-like B cells which might have important clinical implications for anti-HIV vaccine and therapy design.">

Alveolar macrophages (AM) from resisters displayed a baseline M1 macrophage phenotype while AM from LTBI did not. Resisters displayed alveolar lymphocytosis, with enrichment of all T cell subpopulations including IFNG-expressing cells. In both groups, mycobactericidal granulysin was expressed almost exclusively by a T cell subtype that co-expressed granzyme B, perforin and NK cell receptors. These poly-cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) over-expressed activating NK cell receptors and were increased in resister BAL. Following challenge with Mtb, only Intraepithelial Lymphocytes-like cells from LTBI participants responded with increased transcription of IFNG. AM from resisters responded with a stronger TNF signature at 6h post-infection while at 24h post-infection AM from LTBI displayed a stronger IFN-γ signature. Conversely, at 24h post-infection only AM from resisters displayed a significant upregulation of MICA transcripts which encode an activating ligand for poly-CTL.

        <tr id="Gamma delta (γδ) T cells are innate-like lymphocytes that in humans can be broadly classified into two main subtypes based on their unique TCRδ chain, Vδ1 and Vδ2. Both subsets have potent anti-tumor properties and the presence of Vδ1 cells in the tumor is often associated with positive prognosis. Herein, we investigated the molecular interplay between immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs), IC blockade (ICB) therapy and γδ T cells. We show that ICRs display differential expression and regulation by the JAK-STAT pathway in circulating Vδ1 and Vδ2 cells and identify constitutive (e.g. TIGIT, PD-1) and inducible (e.g. TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4) ICRs. In melanoma, Vδ1 cells, especially in patients who did not respond to ICB or required combination therapy, expressed high levels of ICR, TOX and inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) transcripts, reminiscent of an exhaustion transcriptional signature. At the same time all γδ T cells had a prominent downregulation in AP-1 transcription factors. Patient derived cells were functionally competent, although induction of LAG-3 and CTLA-4 was impaired. In the context of anti-PD-1 monotherapy, Vδ1 cells specifically bound high levels of therapeutic antibody but only in patients who responded to treatment, revealing a potential new prognostic marker for evaluating the efficacy of ICB therapy. Finally, expression of KIR genes in Vδ1 cells was downregulated in response to successful ICB therapy. Collectively, our data indicate an intricate relationship between ICRs, putatively also KIRs, and γδ T cells and reveal novel approaches by which these cells can be harnessed in order to discern or improve cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="It is established that BCG vaccination results in the development of both a specific immune response to mycobacterial infections and a nonspecific (heterologous) immune response, designated as trained immunity (TRIM), to other pathogens. We hypothesized that local BCG immunization may induce an early immune response in bone marrow and spleen innate immunity cells. The early transcriptomic response of various populations of innate immune cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells, to BCG vaccination was examined. To this end, C57Bl/6J mice were subcutaneously immunized with 106 CFU of BCG. Three days following BCG administration, the three cell populations were collected from the control and BCG-vaccinated groups using FACS. All cell populations obtained were utilized for the preparation and sequencing of RNA-seq libraries. The analysis of FACS data revealed an increase in the proportion of splenic NK cells and monocytes 3 days post-vaccination. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the deregulation of genes associated with the regulation of immune response (according to Gene Ontology terms) in NK cells, monocytes, and unsorted bone marrow cells. Two NK cell-specific immune ligands (Tnfsf14 and S100a8) and two bone marrow-specific immune receptors (C5ar1 and Csf2rb) were identified among differentially expressed genes. No alterations were identified in neutrophils in either their percentage or at the transcriptomic level. Thus, in this study, we demonstrated that BCG vaccination provides an early increase in the proportion of murine bone marrow and spleen immune cell populations, as well as transcriptomic alterations in monocytes, NK cells, and non-sorted bone marrow cells. This early innate immune response may be beneficial for enhancing TRIM.">

        <tr id="Patients with cancer often receive chemotherapy to control tumor progression and reduce disease symptoms. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents not only kill rapidly growing cancer cells but also reduce normal cells including myeloid cells, the main innate immune population involved in fighting infections and repairing tissue damages. Rapid loss of myeloid cells caused by chemotherapy triggers myelopoiesis, a process in which the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow regenerate myeloid cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages, to reconstitute the myeloid cell compartment. We previously reported that chemotherapy with an alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) in mice leads to repopulation of myeloid cells that acquire immunosuppressive activities within the monocyte subset. However, detailed information on the cellular composition and molecular identity of these chemotherapy- induced immunosuppressive monocytes is lacking. Here, we investigated how the various myeloid cell subsets in the bone marrow of mice respond to CTX chemotherapy through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNAseq). We found that myeloid progenitor cells and monocytes were reduced 2 days after chemotherapy but rebounded and surpassed their pretreatment levels by day 7. Further scRNAseq analysis of pre-enriched monocytes revealed that the monocyte population was heterogenous, and that chemotherapy tilted myelopoiesis towards the production of neutrophil-like monocytes (NeuMo). We identified Cxcr4 and Cx3cr1 as suitable markers for isolation of chemotherapy-induced NeuMo and demonstrated that these cells were suppressive to T cells. Together with the evidence that CTX-induced monocytes can promote breast cancer metastasis in mice, our data reveal the heterogeneity of the monocytes reemerging after chemotherapy and identify the NeuMo subset as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer.">

        <tr id="Integrated approaches that help understand how tumors, as immune-surveilled ecosystems, respond to chemotherapy are crucial for developing effective antitumor treatments. We previously showed, in immunodeficient context, that antimitotic chemotherapy induced cGAS/STING pathway amplifying antitumor response through a paracrine IFN-1 secretome. We herein studied tumor progression and response to treatment using an immunocompetent murine model. scRNAseq analysis revealed that paclitaxel treatment altered tumor cell phenotypes, favoring tumor cells with a gene expression signature indicative of active NF-κB pathway with secretory phenotype. Treatment coincidently reduced IFN-I signature cells during tumor progression. The resulting secretory shift correlated with neutrophil recruitment to the tumor, particularly CXCR2+ neutrophils, thereby contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 receptor by navarixin reactivated antitumor immunity, enhancing NK cell infiltration and tumor cytotoxicity. Navarixin combination with paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor volume and metastasis. Targeting the NF-κB-driven secretory phenotype, in particular through neutrophil modulation, holds promise for improving TNBC treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immune cells determine the role of the tumor microenvironment during tumor progression, either suppressing tumor formation or promoting tumorigenesis. We analyzed the profile of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of control mouse skins and skin tumors at the single-cell level. We identified 15 CD45+ immune cell clusters, which broadly represent the most functionally characterized immune cell types including macrophages, Langerhans cells (LC), conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2), migratory/mature dendritic cells (mDC), dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC), dermal γδ T cells (γδT), T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer cells (NK), type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), neutrophils (Neu), mast cells (Mast), and two proliferating populations (Prolif.1 and Prolif.2). Skin tumor progression reprogramed immune cells and led to a marked increase in the relative percentages of macrophages, cDC2, mDC, Tregs, and Neu. Macrophages, the largest cell cluster of immune cells in skin tumors. In addition, macrophages emerged as the predominant communication ‘hub’ in skin tumors, highlighting the importance of macrophages during skin tumor progression. In contrast, other immune cell clusters decreased during skin tumor progression, including DETC, γδT, ILC2, and LC. In addition, skin tumor progression dramatically upregulated Jak2/Stat3 expression and the interferon response across various immune cell clusters. Further, skin tumor progression activated T cells and NK cells indicated by elevated expression of IFN-γ and Granzyme B in skin tumors. Meanwhile, a pronounced infiltration of M2-macrophages and Tregs in skin tumors created an immunosuppressive microenvironment, consistent with the elevated expression of the Stat3 pathway in skin tumors. In summary, our study elucidates the immune cell landscape of epidermal neoplasms, offering a comprehensive understanding of the immune response during skin tumor progression and providing new insights into cancer immune evasion mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Background Hepatocellular carcinoma represents a significant global health challenge, affecting over a million patients annually, arising mainly from chronic liver diseases, with a majority being related to viral infections. However, despite the groundbreaking clinical results of immune checkpoint blockades and adoptive cell therapies, we still face non-responders accompanied by high rebound rates after resection. Considering that the main concern is to overcome a highly specialized immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of the individual patient, the characterization of the particular tumor microenvironment and the source of the immune cells used in ACT is of immense importance. Approved ACT therapies mainly use modified peripheral blood cells from individuals. At the same time, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are underrepresented even if they have garnered interest due to their potential to target tumor-specific antigens more effectively. Methods In this study, we employed allogenic and autologous immune cell sources for expansion and stimulation, resulting in adoptive T-cell transfer experiments determining the effector cell differentiation and the related anti-tumor effects by the possible implementation of re-stimulation. Results We determined a high success rate in expanding and stimulating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with consistent CD8 T-cell fractions from HCC patients. To showcase the effectiveness of stimulated T-cells from different sources, we generated cell lines derived from the margin and center of an HBV-induced HCC with a highly immune-suppressive TME. We found effective immune responses supported by cell death induction, ferroptosis, proptosis and apoptosis triggered by all sources of T-cells depending on the area of derived tumor cells. Conclusion Effector T-cell fractions derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes present a viable source for cell-based immune therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in HCC patients, especially after resection, to suppress rebound strategies of the parental tumor on an individual level.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, patients with multiple myeloma (MM) rarely respond to ICB. Accumulating evidence indicates that the complicated tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly impacts the efficacy of ICB therapy. Therefore, investigating how TME components in MM influence ICB treatment is urgent. Methods We employed two well-established murine myeloma models, 5TGM1 and Vk*MYC, by intravenously injecting 5TGM1 or Vk*MYC cells into mice, respectively, to determine ICB therapeutic efficacy in MM. Total mouse IgG or Ig2b ELISA or QuickGel split beta SPE kits and in vivo bioluminescent imaging were used to monitor MM tumor burden. Cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) was used to quantify MM TME components. T cell proliferation and function were detected using flow cytometry. Peptide-Fc fusion proteins were used to deplete myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MMDTR, Foxp3DTR, CD4 KO and CD8 KO mice were used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Gene expression levels in human MM were analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus public datasets. Results We found that programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody treatment had a therapeutic effect in 5TGM1 mice; it was ineffective in Vk*MYC mice. CyTOF indicated that the bone marrow (BM) of both models was inflamed, suggesting that immune suppressive cells might be inhibiting the reactivation of T cells in the BM. We observed higher numbers of MDSCs, regulatory T (Treg) cells, and tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs) in myeloma BM compared with that of tumor-free mice. Specifically, depleting MDSCs, but not Treg cells or TAMs, sensitized Vk*MYC mice and enhanced the response of 5TGM1 mice to PD-1 ICB, which was dependent on CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells. MDSCs, especially M-MDSCs and CD84+ MDSCs, significantly inhibited the activation and cytotoxic cytokine production of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Moreover, database profiling of patient BM revealed a negative correlation between MDSCs signature genes and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell signature genes, with post-maintenance patients with myeloma displaying a higher ratio of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell to MDSCs signature genes compared with pretreated patients. Conclusion Our study highlights the potential of MDSCs depletion in enhancing the sensitivity of patients with myeloma to PD-1 ICB therapy.">

        <tr id="While most people contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, some individuals develop active disease, usually within two years of infection. Why immunity fails after initially controlling infection is unknown. C57BL/6 mice control Mycobacterium tuberculosis for up to a year but ultimately succumb to disease. We hypothesize that the development of CD4 T cell dysfunction permits bacterial recrudescence. We developed a reductionist model to assess antigen-specific T cells during chronic infection and found evidence of CD4 T cell senescence and exhaustion. In C57BL/6 mice, CD4 T cells upregulate coinhibitory receptors and lose effector cytokine production. Single cell RNAseq shows that only a small number of CD4 T cells in the lungs of chronically infected mice are polyfunctional. While the origin and causal relationship between T- cell dysfunction and recrudescence remains uncertain, we propose T cell dysfunction leads to a feed-forward loop that causes increased bacillary numbers, greater T cell dysfunction, and progressive disease.">

The nutrient-limited conditions of the TME, particularly the scarcity of glucose, amino acids, and lipids, challenge cancer cell survival1–4. However, the metabolic constraints faced by immune and stromal cells in comparison to cancer cells, and how these limitations affect therapeutic outcomes, remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce Dual Ribosome Profiling (DualRP), a method that allows for simultaneous analysis of translation and identification of ribosome stalling, revealing amino acid shortages in different cell types within tumors. Using DualRP, we uncover that interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts trigger an inflammatory response, mitigating amino acid limitations during glucose starvation. In immunocompetent mouse models, we observe that immune checkpoint blockade therapy induces serine and glycine restrictions specifically in T cells, but not in cancer cells. We further demonstrate that these amino acids are essential for optimal T cell function both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting their critical role in effective immunotherapy. Our findings show that therapeutic interventions create distinct metabolic demands across different tumor cell types, with nutrient availability significantly influencing the success of immunotherapy. DualRP’s ability to explore cell type-specific metabolic vulnerabilities offers a promising tool for advancing our understanding of tumor biology and improving therapeutic strategies.">

Here, we demonstrate that increased Treg differentiation by naive CD4+ T cells from human cord blood versus adult blood is integrally linked to their unique metabolic profile and their elevated expression of the NADase, CD38. Early life naïve CD4+ T cells demonstrate a metabolic preference for glycolysis, which directly facilitates their Treg generation. We reveal an age-dependent gradient in CD38 levels on naïve CD4+ T cells and show that high CD38 expression contributes to both the glycolytic state and high Treg potential of neonatal CD4+ T cells, effects that are mediated at least in part via the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. Thus, the early life window for peripheral tolerance in humans is critically enabled by the immunometabolic state of the naïve CD4+ compartment.">

During viral infection, their number increases, suggesting an involvement in antiviral responses. These cells do not derive from naive cells and are thought to develop in the thymus. This study identified two subsets of Ly49+ CD8 T cells, based on CD8β expression, in mice and humans. Lineage tracing and reliance on the transcription factor Zeb1 indicate a thymic origin via agonist selection. scRNAseq analysis revealed that a small fraction of CD8αβ-Ly49+ cells acquired an effector profile during vaccinia virus infection. Moreover, the majority of Ly49+ CD8 T cells seems to respond to cytokine-driven bystander signals. In vitro, these signals promoted the expression of effector molecules such as IFNγ and granzyme B, as well as the homing chemokine receptor CXCR5, potentially driving their recruitment to germinal centers. Summary This study shows that Ly49+ CD8 T cells comprises two subsets that develop in the thymus through agonist selection. In viral infection, both subsets respond to bystander stimuli that could drive their regulatory activity. Furthermore, some CD8αβ-expressing Ly49+ cells exert TCR-mediated antiviral response.">

Cytotoxic CD4+ T-cells were prominently overrepresented amongst survivors, as were cells with quiescent metabolic profiles and low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The induction of ROS production by treatment with deferoxamine sensitized these cells to CTL-mediated elimination. Reservoir-harboring cells from clinical samples share the above transcriptional features, being enriched for quiescent states.

        <tr id="How changes in the quality of anti-viral antibody (Ab) responses due to pre-existing or acquired CD4 T cell insufficiency affect virus evolution during persistent infection are unknown. Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we found that CD4 T cell depletion before infection results in short-lived plasma cells secreting low-avidity antiviral IgG with limited BCR diversity and weak virus-neutralizing ability. CD4 T cell deficiency during persistent infection incurs a shift from a T-dependent (TD) to T-independent (TI) Ab response, resembling the pre-existing TI Ab response. CD4 T cell loss before infection or during persistent infection is conducive for emergence of Ab-escape variants. Cryo-EM reconstruction of complexes of MuPyV virions with polyclonal IgG directly from infected mice with pre-existing or acquired CD4 T cell deficiency enabled visualization of shortfalls in TI IgG binding. By debilitating the antiviral IgG response, CD4 T cell deficiency sets the stage for outgrowth of variant viruses resistant to neutralization. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY Pre-existing and acquired CD4 T cell deficiency facilitates outgrowth of Ab-escape viral variants during persistent infection.">

        <tr id="Effective cancer therapies must address the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex network of tumor cells and stromal components, including endothelial, immune, and mesenchymal cells. Durable outcomes require targeting both tumor cells and the TME while minimizing systemic toxicity. Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based therapies have shown efficacy in cancers such as metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma but are limited by severe side effects. Innovative IL-2-based immunotherapeutic approaches include immunotoxins, such as antibody–drug conjugates, immunocytokines, and antibody–cytokine fusion proteins that enhance tumor-specific delivery. These strategies activate cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, eliciting a potent Th1-mediated anti-tumor response. Modified IL-2 variants with reduced Treg cell activity further improve specificity and reduce immunosuppression. Additionally, IL-2 conjugates with peptides or anti-angiogenic agents offer improved therapeutic profiles. Combining IL-2-based therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), anti-angiogenic agents, or radiotherapy has demonstrated synergistic potential. Preclinical and clinical studies highlight reduced toxicity and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, overcoming TME-driven immune suppression. These approaches mitigate the limitations of high-dose soluble IL-2 therapy, promoting immune activation and minimizing adverse effects. This review critically explores advances in IL-2-based therapies, focusing on immunotoxins, immunocytokines, and IL-2 derivatives. Emphasis is placed on their role in combination strategies, showcasing their potential to target the TME and improve clinical outcomes effectively. Also, the use of IL-2 immunocytokines in “in situ” vaccination to relieve the immunosuppression of the TME is discussed.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) play a critical role in suppressing anti-tumor immunity, often resulting in unfavorable clinical outcomes across numerous cancers. However, systemic Treg depletion, while augmenting anti-tumor responses, also triggers detrimental autoimmune disorders. Thus, dissecting the mechanisms by which Treg cells navigate and exert their functions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is pivotal for devising innovative Treg-centric cancer therapies. Our study highlights the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPARδ), a nuclear hormone receptor involved in fatty acid metabolism. Remarkably, PPARδ ablation in Treg escalated tumor growth and augmented the immunosuppressive characteristics of the TME. This absence of PPARδ spurred an increased expression of genes central to antigen presentation, notably CIITA and MHC II. Our results showcase a novel association where the absence of CIITA in PPARδ-deficient Treg bolsters anti-tumor responses, casting CIITA as a pivotal downstream regulator of PPARδ within Treg. In vitro assays demonstrated that elevated CIITA levels enhance the suppressive capacity of Treg, facilitated by an antigen-independent interaction between Treg-MHC II and Tconv-TCR/CD4/Lag3. A significant revelation was the role of type 1 interferon as a TME signal that promotes the genesis of MHC II+ Treg; PPARδ deficiency intensifies this phenomenon by amplifying type 1 interferon signaling, mediated by a notable upsurge in JAK3 transcription and an increase of pSTAT1-Y701. In conclusion, the co-regulation between TME cues and PPARδ signaling shapes the adaptive and suppressive roles of Treg cells through the CIITA-MHC II pathway. Strategically targeting the potent MHC II+ Treg population could open a new avenue for cancer therapies by boosting anti-tumor defenses while curbing autoimmune threats. Highlights PPARδ Treg conditional knockout mice show accelerated tumor growth due to increased expression of CIITA-MHC II. Type I interferon signal regulates Treg CIITA-MHC II axis in vitro and in vivo. PPARδ attenuates Type I interferon response and restrains CIITA-MHC II expression in Treg cells. Treg suppressive function is enhanced by Treg MHC II’s direct interaction with TCR/CD4/Lag3 on Teff cells.">

        <tr id="Oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLCs) are critical for neuronal support functions, including myelination and remyelination. Emerging evidence reveals their active roles in neuroinflammation, particularly in conditions like Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This study explores the inflammatory translatome of OLCs during the early onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an established MS model. Using RiboTag-based RNA sequencing in genetically modified Olig2-Cre RiboTag mice, we identified 1,556 upregulated and 683 downregulated genes in EAE OLCs. Enrichment analysis indicated heightened immune-related pathways, such as cytokine signaling, interferon responses, and antigen presentation, while downregulated genes were linked to neuronal development and myelination. Notably, OLCs expressed cytokines/chemokines, and their receptor, highlighting their active involvement in neuroinflammatory signaling. Functional studies demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling in OLCs exacerbates EAE pathology by enhancing antigen presentation and chemokine production, whereas interferon-beta (IFN-β) signaling showed minimal impact. These findings provide novel insights into the inflammatory role of OLCs in EAE and suggest therapeutic potential in targeting OLC-mediated neuroinflammation for MS and related disorders.">

        <tr id="Persistent alloantigens derived from allograft tissues can be recognized by the host’s alloreactive immune system. This process enables cognate B cells to differentiate into plasma cells, which secrete donor-specific antibodies that are key drivers of antibody-mediated allograft rejection. A subset of these plasma cells can survive for extended periods in a suitable survival niche and mature into long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), which are a cellular component of humoral memory. The current understanding of LLPCs is limited due to their scarcity, heterogeneity, and absence of unique markers. However, accumulating evidence indicates that LLPCs, unlike conventional short-lived plasma cells, can respond to extrinsic signals from their survival niches and can resist cell death associated with intracellular stress through cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Notably, they are refractory to traditional immunosuppressants and B cell depletion therapies. This resistance, coupled with their longevity, may explain why current treatments targeting antibody-mediated rejection are often ineffective. This review offers insights into the biology of LLPCs and discusses ongoing therapeutic trials that target LLPCs in the context of antibody-mediated allograft rejection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immunotherapy that targets immune checkpoints has achieved revolutionary success, but its application in solid tumors remains limited, highlighting the need for reliable enhancement of the efficacy of immunotherapy. Golgi protein 73 (GP73), a Golgi membrane protein, has been implicated in various cellular processes, including immune regulation. Recent studies suggested that GP73 may play a role in modulating the immune response in patients with cancer. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which GP73 regulates T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity within the tumor microenvironment. Methods We used T-cell specific GP73 knockout mice to establish MC38 and B16 tumor models to investigate the impact of GP73-deficient T cells on tumor growth. Single-cell sequencing was subsequently employed to classify tumor-infiltrating immune cells and assess changes in cytokines and metabolic genes. Through RNA sequencing, real-time quantitative PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, seahorse analysis, glucose uptake, and L-lactic acid secretion assays, we explored how GP73 regulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) to influence T-cell antitumor functionality. Furthermore, we established adoptive transfer experiments to study the ability of GP73-overexpressing T cells to combat tumors. Blood samples of patient with clinical tumor were collected to assess the relationship between immunotherapy efficacy and T-cell GP73 levels. Results In this study, the absence of GP73 in mouse T cells promoted tumor growth and metastasis, accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of cytotoxic CD8+T cell subsets infiltrating the tumor and an increase in exhausted CD8+ T-cell subsets. Further analysis revealed that the effector function of CD8+T cells in tumors relies on glycolysis regulated by HIF-1α rather than immune checkpoints. GP73-deficient T cells exhibit severely impaired glycolysis in hypoxic environments, whereas ectopic GP73 expression restores HIF-1α levels. In adoptive immunotherapy, overexpression of GP73 in T cells inhibits tumor growth. In cytotoxicity assays, knockdown of GP73 affected the ability of CD8+T cells to kill target cells. Clinically, tumor immunotherapy partial response patients present significantly elevated levels of GP73 expression in T cells. Conclusions These findings reveal the role of GP73 in regulating T-cell glycolysis and may lead to new therapeutic strategies for the prognosis and treatment of clinical tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Ovarian cancer (OC) is the sixth most common malignancy in women and the poor 5-year survival emphasises the need for novel therapies. NK cells play an important role in the control of malignant disease but the nature of tumour-infiltrating and peripheral NK cells in OC remains unclear. Methods Using flow cytometric analysis, we studied the phenotype and function of NK cells in blood, primary tumour and metastatic tissue in 80 women with OC. The cell type contexture of metastatic OC tissue was explored utilising scRNAseq analysis, with a focus on portraying an immunogenic tumour microenvironment and determining the characteristics of a dysfunctional NK cell population. Results The proportion of peripheral NK cells was markedly elevated with a highly activated profile and increased cytotoxicity. In contrast, NK cell numbers in primary tumour and metastasis were substantially reduced, with downregulation of activatory receptors together with elevated PD-1 expression. scRNA-Seq identified 5 NK cell subpopulations along with increased exhausted and immature NK cells within tumour tissue compared to normal tissue. These features were attenuated following chemotherapy where higher levels of activated and cytotoxic NK cells associated with improved disease-free survival. Correlation of NK cell phenotype with clinical outcomes revealed high levels of DNAM-1 expression on tissue-localised and peripheral NK cells to be associated with reduced survival. Expression of PVR, the DNAM-1 ligand, was significantly increased on tumours and DNAM-1 mediated NK cell lysis of primary tumour tissue was observed in vitro. Discussion These findings reveal profound modulation of the tumour tissue and systemic profile of NK cells which likely contributes to the high rates of local progression and metastasis seen with OC. Immunotherapeutic approaches that overcome local immune suppression and enhance DNAM-1-targeted lysis of OC offer the potential to improve disease control.">

        <tr id="The discovery of immune checkpoints and the rapid growth of immuno-oncology (IO) have sparked tremendous efforts to utilize the immune system to treat a wide range of cancer types/subtypes. While the major focus of IO over the past decades has been to manipulate the adaptive immune system, recent attention has been given to manipulating the innate immune system to treat cancer and/or to enhance adaptive responses. In this work we detail the intracellular protein, Dual Specificity Phosphatase 11 (DUSP11), as an innate immune checkpoint (iIC) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Expression of this atypical phosphatase is correlated with patient survival for multiple cancer types, and we show here that its activity is important for the viability of lung cancer cells in vitro. Specifically, we demonstrate that DUSP11 knockdown in LUAD cells induces apoptosis and an innate immune response capable of activating other cells in vitro, and we provide evidence that these phenotypes are primarily mediated by the pattern recognition receptor, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I). Finally, we show that expression of DUSP11 is important for tumor engraftment and growth of human LUAD in mice. Overall, these data are the first to establish DUSP11 as an immunosuppressive, pro-neoplastic, and potentially targetable protein in LUAD. In addition, our data suggests that the anti-cancer mechanisms induced by diminishing the activity of DUSP11 are likely to be generalizable to other cancer types such as breast cancer, warranting future investigation and therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Once formed, plasma cells and memory B cells (MBCs) are difficult to eradicate, posing a problem in the context of unwanted antibody responses. Characterizing early B cell differentiation stages after antigen encounter is thus crucial to target and prevent unwanted antibody formation. Here, we unravelled in-depth antigen-specific B cell responses longitudinally after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in healthy individuals using multiparameter spectral flow cytometry. The early antigen-specific B cell response was dominated by spike-specific IgG+ CD27+ CD71+ activated B cells (ActBCs), previously assigned as germinal center-derived and DN2 extrafollicular B cells. Within the early IgG+ ActBC compartment, six distinct clusters were identified with specific contraction dynamics, whereby some of these clusters were more closely related to pre-ASCs and others more to long-lived MBCs. Some of the highly contracting ActBC clusters expressed CD11c, a marker previously used to define atypical B cells. The transient presence of different ActBC clusters could also be observed in total B cells when gated in an antigen- independent manner. Our results thus delineate the early stages of the antigen-specific B cell response, with a further dissection of the CD71+ ActBC compartment. Detection of ActBC clusters early after antigen encounter in total B cells opens avenues for future evaluation of their potential to serve as a proxy for antigen-reactive B cells in autoimmunity or other unwanted B cell responses.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant neoplasm globally, with an increased death rate despite recent advancements in research and therapeutic options. Different molecular subtypes of GC have distinct interactions with the immune system, impacting the tumor microenvironment (TME), prognosis, and reaction to immunotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the TME are crucial for preventing tumor growth and metastasis, as evidenced by research showing that patients with GC who have a significant density of TILs have better survival rates. But cancer cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, both sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) playing a pivotal role in the development of an immunosuppressive TME. They prevent T cell activation and proliferation resulting in a decrease in the immune system’s capacity to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. These immune checkpoint molecules function via different but complementary mechanisms, the expression of Siglec-15 being mutually exclusive with PD-L1 and, therefore, providing a different therapeutic approach. The review explores how TILs affect tumor growth and patient outcomes in GC, with particular emphasis on their interactions within the TME and potential targeting of the PD-L1 and Siglec-15 pathways for immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Many inflammatory stimuli can induce progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells as part of the process of emergency myelopoiesis. These events are associated with innate training and can have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27 deficient mice are pre-disposed towards the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.">

        <tr id="Peritoneal tissue-resident macrophages, also referred to as large peritoneal macrophages (LPMs), play an important role as gatekeepers of peritoneal homeostasis by providing a first line of defense against pathogenic threats. About a third of the LPMs express the surface receptor V-set and Immunoglobulin domain containing 4 (VSIG4), but it is unclear to what extent these cells differ from their VSIG4-negative counterparts and perform dedicated functions. Here, we demonstrate that VSIG4+ LPMs, in contrast to VSIG4- LPMs, are in majority derived from embryonal precursors and their occurrence is to a large extent independent from sex and microbiota. Although their transcriptome and surface proteome are indistinguishable from VSIG4- LPMs at steady-state, VSIG4+ LPMs are superior in phagocytosing Gram-positive bacteria and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells. In-house generated anti-VSIG4 nanobody constructs that are antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-enabled allowed a selective elimination of the VSIG4+ LPM subset without affecting the overall LPM content of the peritoneal cavity. This strategy uncovered a role for VSIG4+ LPMs in lowering the first peak of parasitemia in a Trypanosoma brucei brucei infection model and in reducing the outgrowth of CRC cells in the peritoneal cavity, a prime metastatic site in CRC patients. Altogether, our data uncover a protective role for VSIG4+ LPMs in infectious and oncological diseases in the peritoneal cavity.">

        <tr id="Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) is a host-restriction factor that plays multiple roles in the antiviral defense of innate immune responses, including the inhibition of viral particle release from virus-infected cells. BST2 may also be involved in the endothelial adhesion and migration of monocytes, but its importance in the immune system is still unclear. Immune cell adhesion and migration are closely related to the initiation of immune responses. In this study, we found that the expressions of the lymph node homing marker chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and an adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were associated with BST2 expression. Interestingly, Bst2−/− cDCs showed lower chemotactic ability, including velocity and accumulative distance toward chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19) gradient in vitro, compared to wild-type cDCs. Bst2−/− cDCs also showed reduced migration and reduced retention capacity in draining lymph nodes in vivo. As a result, Bst2−/− cDCs as antigen-presenting cells induced lower antigen-specific B cell and T cell responses compared to Bst2+/+ cDCs. Notably, mice administered the influenza vaccine via Bst2−/− cDCs exhibited substantially inefficient virus clearance compared to mice administered the Bst2+/+ cDCs vaccine. Therefore, we propose that BST2, which plays a critical role in the effective migration and retention of cDCs, is involved in the development of optimal immunological effects in draining lymph nodes.">

ME/CFS symptoms can range from mild to severe, and include immune system effects alongside incapacitating fatigue and post-exertional disease exacerbation. In this study, we examined immunological profiles of people living with ME/CFS by flow cytometry, focusing on cytotoxic cells, to determine whether people with mild/moderate (n= 43) or severe ME/CFS (n=53) expressed different immunological markers. We found that people with mild/moderate ME/CFS had increased expression of cytotoxic effector molecules alongside enhanced proportions of early-immunosenescence cells, determined by the CD28-CD57- phenotype. In contrast, people with severe ME/CFS had higher proportions of activated circulating lymphocytes, determined by CD69+ and CD38+ expression, and expressed more pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN{gamma}, TNF and IL-17, following stimulation in vitro. These changes were consistent across different cell types including CD8+ T cells, mucosal associated invariant T cells and Natural Killer cells, indicating generalised altered cytotoxic responses across the innate and adaptive immune system . These immunological differences likely reflect different disease pathogenesis mechanisms occurring in the two clinical groups, and opening up opportunities for the development of prognostic markers and stratified treatments.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Adaptive immune resistance in cancer describes the various mechanisms by which tumors adapt to evade anti-tumor immune responses. IFN-γ induction of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was the first defined and validated adaptive immune resistance mechanism. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is central to adaptive immune resistance as immune modulatory secreted and integral membrane proteins are dependent on ER. Sigma1 is a unique ligand-regulated integral membrane scaffolding protein enriched in the ER of cancer cells. PD-L1 is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is translated into the ER and processed through the cellular secretory pathway. At the cell surface, PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint molecule that binds PD-1 on activated T-cells and blocks anti-tumor immunity. PD-L1 can also be incorporated into cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), and EV-associated PD-L1 can inactivate T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that a selective small molecule inhibitor of Sigma1 can block IFN-γ mediated adaptive immune resistance in part by altering the incorporation of PD-L1 into cancer cell-derived EVs. Sigma1 inhibition blocked post-translational maturation of PD-L1 downstream of IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling. Subsequently, EVs released in response to IFN-γ stimulation were significantly less potent suppressors of T-cell activation. These results suggest that by reducing tumor derived immune suppressive EVs, Sigma1 inhibition may promote antitumor immunity. Sigma1 modulation presents a novel approach to regulating the tumor immune microenvironment by altering the content and production of EVs. Altogether, these data support the notion that Sigma1 may play a role in adaptive immune resistance in the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Background: Identifying biomarkers that predict immunotherapy efficacy and discovering new targets for combination therapies are critical elements for improving the prognosis of bladder cancer (BLCA) patients. Methods: Firstly, we explored the expression patterns of TBX3 in normal and pan-cancer tissues and the correlation between TBX3 and the immune microenvironment using data from multiple public databases. Then, we combined various techniques, including bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, high-throughput cytokine arrays, functional experiments, ProcartaPlex multiplex immunoassays and TissueFAXS panoramic tissue quantification assays, to demonstrate that TBX3 shapes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in BLCA. Results: We identified TBX3 as a key factor associated with the immunosuppressive microenvironment in BLCA through a systematic multi-omics analysis. We found that TBX3 is primarily expressed in malignant cells, where TBX3high tumor cells increase the secretion of TGFβ1, which promotes the infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), thereby forming an immunosuppressive microenvironment. We further demonstrated that TBX3 enhances TGFβ1 expression by binding to the TGFβ1 promoter, and blocking TGFβ1 counteracts the immunosuppressive effects of TBX3. Moreover, TBX3 reduced the cancer-killing efficiency of CD8+ T cells by decreasing the proportion of GZMB+ CD8+ T cells, and knocking down TBX3 combined with anti-PD-1 treatment increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and reduced CAFs in vivo. We also validated the inverse relationship between TBX3+ malignant cells and CD8+ T cells and the positive relationship with CAFs in tissue microarrays. Lastly, we found that TBX3 predicted immunotherapy efficacy in our real-world immunotherapy cohort and multiple public cohorts. Conclusion: In summary, TBX3 promotes BLCA progression and immunotherapy resistance by inducing an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and targeting TBX3 could enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy for BLCA.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that develops in the bone marrow (BM) and the second-most-common blood cancer. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are emerging cytolytic immune effectors showing potent antitumor activity. In MM patients, ILC2s from peripheral blood possessed a cytotoxic arsenal, enabling them to kill MM cells via DNAM-1. In contrast, ILC2 resident in BM did not exert anti-myeloma activity, and instead became more susceptible to apoptosis. Specifically, MM cells led to ILC2 cell death by inducing and engaging the inhibitory receptor TIGIT. Collectively, ILC2s from MM patients displayed an imbalance in the DNAM-1/TIGIT axis, resulting in the conversion from a cytolytic to an exhausted profile. These findings support the employment of anti-TIGIT mAb to restore the survival and antitumor effects of ILC2s in MM.">

        <tr id="The mRNA-binding protein KSRP (KH-type splicing regulatory protein) is known to modulate immune cell functions post-transcriptionally, e.g., by reducing the mRNA stability of cytokines. It is known that KSRP binds the AU-rich motifs (ARE) that are often located in the 3′-untranslated part of mRNA species, encoding dynamically regulated proteins as, for example, cytokines. Innate myeloid immune cells, such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and macrophages (MACs), eliminate pathogens by multiple mechanisms, including phagocytosis and the secretion of chemo- and cytokines. Here, we investigated the role of KSRP in the phenotype and functions of both innate immune cell types in the mouse model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Here, KSRP−/− mice showed lower levels of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia (AFC) and an increase in the frequencies of PMNs and MACs in the lungs. Our results showed that PMNs and MACs from KSRP−/− mice exhibited an enhanced phagocytic uptake of AFC, accompanied by increased ROS production in PMNs upon stimulation. A comparison of RNA sequencing data revealed that 64 genes related to inflammatory and immune responses were shared between PMNs and MACs. The majority of genes upregulated in PMNs were involved in metabolic processes, cell cycles, and DNA repair. Similarly, KSRP-deficient PMNs displayed reduced levels of apoptosis. In conclusion, our results indicate that KSRP serves as a critical negative regulator of PMN and MAC anti-pathogen activity.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) remains the major cause of mortality and morbidity, causing approximately 1.3 million deaths annually. As a highly successful pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has evolved numerous strategies to evade host immune responses, making it essential to understand the interactions between Mtb and host cells. G-protein-coupled receptor 84 (GPR84), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, contributes to the regulation of pro-inflammatory reactions and the migration of innate immune cells, such as macrophages. Its role in mycobacterial infection, however, has not yet been explored. We found that GPR84 is induced in whole blood samples from tuberculosis patients and Mycobacterium marinum (Mm)-infected macrophage models. Using a Mm-wasabi infection model in mouse tails, we found that GPR84 is an important determinant of the extent of tissue damage. Furthermore, from our studies in an in vitro macrophage Mm infection model, it appears that GPR84 inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and increases intracellular lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, thereby promoting intracellular bacterial survival. Our findings suggest that GPR84 could be a potential therapeutic target for host-directed anti-TB therapeutics.">

We herein report an unprecedented nanosonosensitizer of one-dimensional bamboo-like multisegmented manganese dioxide@manganese–bismuth vanadate (BMMBV) to boost multiple branches of immune responses targeting MHC-I–deficient tumors. BMMBV markedly augments sonodynamic activity contributed by manganese heteroatoms in the lattice of bismuth vanadate with narrowing bandgaps. Under sonoirradiation, BMMBV enhances tumor antigen spreading and emission of adjuvant signals, which potentiate dendritic cell maturation, thereby eliciting high aptitude of CTLs. This therapy substantially up-regulates MHC expression on tumor cells, which are reversely sensitive to CTLs. Alongside, extensive innate immune cells complement the cytolytic activity of CTLs for eliminating mouse urologic tumors.

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived nanoparticles that have attracted significant attention in the investigation of human health and disease, including cancer biology and its clinical management. Concerning cancer, EVs have been shown to influence numerous aspects of oncogenesis, including tumor proliferation and metastasis. EVs can augment the immune system and have been implicated in virtually all aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. With immunotherapy changing the landscape of cancer treatment across multiple disease sites, it is paramount to understand their mechanisms of action and to further improve upon their efficacy. Despite a rapidly growing body of evidence supporting of the utility of EVs in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, their application in clinical trials involving solid tumors and immunotherapy remains limited. To date, relatively few trials are known to incorporate EVs in this context, mainly employing them as biomarkers. To help address this gap, this review summarizes known applications of EVs in clinical trials and provides a brief overview of the roles that EVs play in cancer biology, immunology, and their proposed implications in immunotherapy. The impetus to leverage EVs in future clinical trials and correlative studies is crucial, as they are ideally positioned to synergize with advancements in multi-omics research to further therapeutic discovery and our understanding of cancer biology.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells, as critical components of the innate immune system, have emerged as promising candidates in cancer therapy due to their ability to recognize and destroy tumor cells without prior sensitization. Their mechanisms of action, including perforin-granzyme release and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), position them as versatile agents in cancer immunotherapy. Recent advancements, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cells and cytokine-based stimulation, have demonstrated enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects compared to conventional immunotherapies. However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a significant obstacle, imposing challenges like immune checkpoint activation, cytokine suppression, and metabolic constraints that impair NK cell activity. This paper explores the therapeutic potential of NK cells, the challenges of immune resistance in the TME, and emerging strategies to enhance NK cell efficacy. Addressing these challenges is crucial for optimizing NK cell-based treatments and achieving durable responses in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Red blood cells (RBCs), traditionally recognized for their role in transporting oxygen, play a pivotal role in the body's immune response by expressing TLR9 and scavenging excess host cell-free DNA. DNA capture by RBCs leads to accelerated RBC clearance and triggers inflammation. Whether RBCs can also acquire microbial DNA during infections is unknown. Murine RBCs acquire microbial DNA in vitro and bacterial-DNA-induced macrophage activation was augmented by WT but not Tlr9-deleted RBCs. In a mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis, RBC-bound bacterial DNA was elevated in WT but not in erythroid Tlr9-deleted mice. Plasma cytokine analysis in these mice revealed distinct sepsis clusters characterized by persistent hypothermia and hyperinflammation in the most severely affected subjects. RBC-Tlr9 deletion attenuated plasma and tissue IL-6 production in the most severe group. Parallel findings in human subjects confirmed that RBCs from septic patients harbored more bacterial DNA compared to healthy individuals. Further analysis through 16S sequencing of RBC-bound DNA illustrated distinct microbial communities, with RBC-bound DNA composition correlating with plasma IL-6 in patients with sepsis. Collectively, these findings unveil RBCs as overlooked reservoirs and couriers of microbial DNA, capable of influencing host inflammatory responses in sepsis.">

        <tr id="Background Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are characterized by impaired immune response that fails to eliminate HBV. Immune checkpoint molecules (ICMs) control the amplitude of the activation and function of immune cells, which makes them the key regulators of immune response. Methods We performed a multiparametric flow cytometry analysis of ICMs and determined their expression on intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets in untreated and treated patients with HBV in comparison with non-pathological liver tissue. Results The liver of untreated HBV patients exhibited a high accumulation of PD-1+CD8+ T cells, while the frequencies of 4-1BB+ T cells, 4-1BB+ natural killer (NK) cells, and TIM-3+CD8+ T cells were the highest in the chronic hepatitis phase. Our findings showed that the HBeAg status is linked to a distinct immune phenotype of intrahepatic CD8+ T cells and NK cells characterized by high expression of ICMs, particularly 4-1BB. Importantly, antiviral treatment partially restored the normal expression of ICMs. Finally, we described important differences in ICM expression between intrahepatic and circulating NK cells in HBV patients. Conclusions Our study shows clear differences in the intrahepatic expression of ICMs on NK cells and T cells in chronic HBV patients depending on their clinical stage.">

These cells play a role in tumor immune surveillance through a unique mechanism of antigen recognition and synergistic interactions with other immune effector cells. In this review, we will discuss the biological properties of the Vδ1 and Vδ2 T subsets of γδ T cells, their immunomodulatory role within the tumor microenvironment, and the most recent clinical advances in γδ T cell-based related immunotherapies, including cell engaging strategies and adoptive cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DC) are pivotal for initiating adaptive immunity, a process triggered by the activation of DC via pathogen products or damage. Here, we describe an additional layer to this process, essential when pathogen-derived signals alone cannot directly achieve full DC activation. Immunisation with sporozoites from Plasmodium leads to CD8 T cell priming in a complex response that is initiated by a collaboration between conventional type 1 DC (cDC1) and ψδ T cells. We unveil a pivotal initiating role for Vψ1+ ψδ T cells, as they directly supply IL-4 to DC and CD8 T cells. IL-4 synergises with a CD4 T cell-derived CD40L signal to induce IL-12 production by cDC1. Both IL-12 and IL-4 then directly signal CD8 T cells, with synergy between these cytokines driving enhanced IL-12 receptor expression and expansion of responding CD8 T cells. This study reveals a key role for Vψl+ ψδ T cells in initiating CD8 T cell immunity to Plasmodium. More broadly, it shows that responses to some pathogens require help from innate-like T cells to pass an initiation threshold and further amplify the response in a process underscored by IL-4 production.">

Single cell RNA-seq analyses of CD4+ T cells from the small intestinal lamina propria of helminth infected mice revealed high expression of the gene Epas1, encoding the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 2a (HIF2α). In vitro, exposure to hypoxia or genetic HIF2α activation promoted Th2 cell differentiation, even under non-polarizing conditions. In mice, HIF2α activation in CD4+ T cells promoted intestinal Th2 cell accumulation in the absence of infection, and HIF2α-deficiency impaired CD4+ T cell-mediated host immunity to intestinal helminth infection.

        <tr id="Chronic antigenic stimulation is central to marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) development. While the pharmacological inhibition of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is initially effective, secondary resistance frequently develops. We conducted a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen investigating enhancer-associated long non-coding RNAs (elncRNAs) in MZL cells to identify transcripts crucial to shape their dependence on BCR pathway activation. We identified LOC730338, an elncRNA associated with A-to-I RNA editing, which we renamed ADARreg. Silencing ADARreg re-sensitized tumor cells to BCR pathway inhibition by modulating ADAR2 nuclear translocation and altering intronic RNA editing. The process preferentially affected genes that enhance immune responses, such as STING, IRF3, and p65. ADARreg knockdown also increased lymphoma cell sensitivity to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that targeting elncRNAs like ADARreg represents a potential strategy to overcome drug resistance in lymphoma, also opening new therapeutic opportunities for immunotherapy.">

 Failure to respond to the anti-α4β7 integrin therapy, vedolizumab, is observed in a subset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, potentially linked to distinct T cell activation profiles. This study aims to characterize the transcriptional and phenotypic features of circulating memory CD4⁺ T cells in vedolizumab non-responders and their association with treatment resistance.



 We performed multidimensional flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze IBD patients' circulating memory CD4⁺ T cell compartment, comparing pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood samples from vedolizumab responders and non-responders. Proteogenomic analysis and TCR repertoire profiling of CD4⁺ T cells were conducted using matched peripheral blood samples. Flow cytometry characterized T cell subsets based on surface markers, migration receptors, transcription factors, and cytokine expression, focusing on differences in activation and migration profiles.



 Ki67⁺ cells were enriched in the memory CD4⁺ T cell population of vedolizumab non-responders in both UC and CD, confirmed by two independent cohorts. TCR repertoire analysis showed increased diversity in memory CD4⁺ T cells post-treatment. Single-cell sequencing and proteomics revealed these Ki67⁺ cells had a high activation and proliferation profile (HLA-DR, CD40LG, MKI67) with reduced IL7R and SELL expression. They displayed elevated integrins (α4, β1, β7) and gut-homing receptors (CXCR3, CCR6). Upregulated T-bet, EOMES, and RORγt and increased IL-17A, indicated a pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 phenotype in non-responders.



 Ki67⁺ memory CD4⁺ T cells are significantly enriched in the peripheral blood of vedolizumab non-responders, displaying a distinct transcriptional and phenotypic profile characterized by Th1/Th17 polarization, high integrin α4β1 expression, and enhanced gut-homing capacity. These findings indicate that proliferating effector memory CD4⁺ T cells could contribute to therapy resistance in IBD, emphasizing the need for alternative therapeutic strategies targeting these cells in anti-α4β7 integrin therapy non-responders.

        <tr id="Tumors can exert a far-reaching influence on the body, triggering systemic responses that contribute to debilitating conditions like cancer cachexia. To characterize the mechanisms underlying tumor-host interactions, we utilized a BioID-based proximity labeling method to identify proteins secreted by Ykiact adult Drosophila gut tumors into the bloodstream/hemolymph. Among the major proteins identified are coagulation and immune-responsive factors that contribute to the systemic wasting phenotypes associated with Ykiact tumors. The effect of innate immunity factors is mediated by NFκB transcription factors Relish, dorsal, and Dif, which in turn upregulate the expression of the cachectic factors Pvf1, Impl2, and Upd3. In addition, Ykiact tumors secrete Eiger, a TNF-alpha homolog, which activates the JNK signaling pathway in neighboring non-tumor cells, leading to cell death. The release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from these dying cells presumably amplifies the inflammatory response, exacerbating systemic wasting. Targeting the inflammatory response, the JNK pathway, or the production of cachectic factors could potentially alleviate the debilitating effects of cancer cachexia.">

To achieve this, keratinocytes were treated with IFN-γ and 5MIX, and their impact on the expression of key antigen-presentation molecules, HLA-DRα and CD74, was assessed. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that IFN-γ alone altered the expression of 254 genes, highlighting its central role in modulating immune responses, including the recruitment of immune cells and regulation of inflammation. Temporal experiments further demonstrated that IFN-γ and 5MIX enhanced early endocytic activity and lysosomal degradation pathways, both essential for effective antigen presentation and T-cell activation. To extend these findings to a clinical context, a co-culture model using keratinocytes derived from psoriatic patients was established. This model revealed increased cytokine production following antigen stimulation, indicating robust and consistent CD4+ and naïve T-cell responses. These results elucidate the complex dynamics of cytokine signaling and antigen presentation in keratinocytes, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated skin disorders like Ps.">

Here, we show that most tumor lesions contain viable immune cell infiltrates after induction chemotherapy, with high percentages of CD3+ T cells. We therefore expanded the TILs and tested their anti-tumoral activity. With sufficient starting material, TIL expansion was as efficient as for adult solid tumors. However, whereas TIL products from adult tumors almost exclusively contained αβ T cells, in neuroblastoma-derived TILs, γδ T cells expanded with similar efficacy as αβ T cells. Importantly, the anti-tumor responses in response to autologous tumor digest primarily originated from (Vδ1- and Vδ3-expressing) γδ T cells, and not from αβ T cells. In conclusion, this finding creates a window of opportunity for immunotherapy for neuroblastoma patients, with γδ T cells as potential prime responders.">

T cell-replete mice and T-lymphopenic mice were inoculated with palpable or advanced tumors to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy according to the severity of TLP. Additionally, by utilizing established murine models, we analyzed matched blood, tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), and tumor samples by flow cytometry to investigate the mechanisms by which ICB responsiveness is impaired under T-lymphopenic conditions. Finally, to evaluate the combination effect of anti-PD-1 and recombinant IL-7 cytokine therapy (rhIL-7-hyFc) in T-lymphopenic conditions, we administered anti-PD-1, rhIL-7-hyFc, or both to advanced tumor-bearing T-lymphopenic mice and subsequently analyzed tumor growth and survival rates. Results Using mouse models mimicking clinical TLP, we observed that the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy was severely impaired in TLP, depending on the degree of TLP and the immunogenicity of the tumors. TLP mice showed a significant reduction in systemic CD8 T cells but stable intratumoral CD8 T cell numbers, suggesting maintained tumor infiltration despite systemic downregulation. Crucially, TLP led to a shift in the composition of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, with a decrease in PD-1+ tumor-reactive CD8 T cells and an increase in PD-1− bystander cells. This reduction in PD-1+ cells was linked to impaired clonal expansion in tumor-draining lymph nodes. To counteract these effects, we introduced recombinant IL-7 cytokine therapy (rhIL-7-hyFc), which effectively restored systemic T cell counts, enhanced PD-1+ CD8 T cell proliferation within tumors, and increased the population of stem-like progenitor cells. The combination of rhIL-7-hyFc and anti-PD-1 therapy resulted in significant tumor regression and improved mouse survival. Discussion Our findings highlight the critical role of IL-7 in reshaping the CD8 T cell landscape to improve ICB efficacy in TLP conditions, proposing a sequential therapeutic approach: conventional therapy to reduce tumor burden and enhance immunogenicity, followed by IL-7 therapy to restore and rejuvenate CD8 T cells, culminating in effective ICB treatment.">

        <tr id="The dialogue between T and B cells can be regulated by different mechanisms, such as co-inhibitory receptors, which therefore play a crucial role in preventing autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed on many myeloid and lymphoid cells. Although peripheral B cells express a very high amount of BTLA, previous works in the context of autoimmunity mainly focused on T cells, and whether BTLA expression on B cells plays a role in the lupus pathogenesis is still unclear. In the present study, we examine the expression of BTLA, as well as its ligand HVEM (Herpesvirus Entry Mediator), on various B cell subsets in lupus patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). We evidenced the existence of double-negative (DN; IgD−CD27−) memory B cells expressing very low levels of BTLA, which are enhanced in active lupus patients. An in-depth analysis revealed that these BTLAlow DN cells mainly correspond to the newly reported DN3 B cell subset, originally described in the context of SARS-CoV2 infection. These cells display an activated and antibody-secreting cell phenotype, and we propose that their low BTLA expression may favor their expansion and rapid differentiation into plasmablasts in lupus patients.">

However, their role in periodontal disease (PD), a microbially induced inflammatory oral disease, remains understudied. Here we show that gingiva (gums) from PD patients exhibit significantly higher levels of MDSC markers including Granulocytic (G)-MDSC and Monocytic (M)-MDSC subsets as well as CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells. Gingival MDSC subsets exhibit potent immunoregulatory activity as marked by attenuated autologous CD4+ T cells proliferation and IFNγ production. In a murine model of ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP), we noticed time-dependent gingival MDSC infiltration, which correlates with CD4+ T cell and CD19+ B cell infiltration. To test whether MDSC confer immunoregulatory function in vivo, we adoptively transferred G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs in mice. Interestingly, we observed significant reduction in inflammatory marker expression (IL6, TNF-α, and IL-1β), infiltration of CD4+ T cells, and concomitant increase in MDSC-derived immune suppressive molecules, ARG1 and IL-10, and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs compared to mock. Conversely, depletion of MDSC using anti-Gr1 antibody resulted in marked induction of periodontal inflammation, reduced Treg population, and significantly higher alveolar bone loss. These findings, for the first time, suggest an anti-inflammatory and osteoprotective function of MDSCs in PD and offer a promising target to treat unresolved periodontal inflammation.">

Taking that three-dimensional (3D) cultures enhance MSCs’ anti-inflammatory properties compared with two-dimensional (2D) cultures, the differentially expressed miRNAs were examined. Thus, we identified hsa-miR-4662a-5p (miR-4662a) as a key inducer of IDO-1 via its suppression of bridging integrator-1 (BIN-1), a negative regulator of the IDO-1 gene. The IDO-1-inducing potential of miR-4662a was conserved across primary MSCs from various donors and sources but exhibited variability. Notably, iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) demonstrated superior IDO-1 induction and immune-modulatory efficacy compared with their donor-matched primary MSCs. Accordingly, iMSCs expressing miR-4662a (4662a/iMSC) exhibited stronger suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation and more potent suppressive effects on graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), improving survival rates and reducing tissue damage in the liver and gut.

        <tr id="Background The use of programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with resectable stage III NSCLC has revolutionized this field in recent years. However, there is still 40%-60% of patients do not benefit from this approach. The complex interactions between immune cell subtypes and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) may influence prognosis and the response to immunochemotherapy. This study aims to assess the relationship between immune cells subtypes and TLSs to better understand their impact on immunotherapy response. Methods This study initially compared the tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) density among patients who underwent immunochemotherapy, chemotherapy and upfront surgery using 123 tumor samples from stage-matched patients. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) was employed to analyze the spatial distribution of PD-L1+CD11c+ cells and PD1+CD8+ T cells within TLSs. Cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) was used to assess immune cell dynamics in paired biopsy and resection specimens from six patients who underwent immunochemotherapy. Key immune cells were validated in newly collected samples using flow cytometry, mIHC, and in vitro CAR-T cells model. Results Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy or immunochemotherapy exhibited increased TLSs compared to those who opted for upfront surgery. The TLS area-to-tumor area ratio distinguished pCR+MPR and NR patients in the immunochemotherapy group. Spatial analysis revealed variations in the distance between PD-L1+CD11c+ cells and PD1+CD8+ T cells within TLSs in the immunochemotherapy group. CyTOF analysis revealed an increase in the frequency of key immune cells (CCR7+CD127+CD69+CD4+ and CD38+CD8+ cells) following combined therapy. Treatment responders exhibited an increase in CCR7+CD4+ T cells, whereas CD38+CD8+ T cells were associated with compromised treatment effectiveness. Conclusions Immunochemotherapy and chemotherapy increase TLSs and granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells in tumors. The TLS area-to-tumor ratio distinguishes responders from non-responders, with PD-L1+ dendritic cells near CD8+PD-1+ T cells linked to efficacy, suggesting that PD-1 inhibitors disrupt harmful interactions. Post-immunochemotherapy, CD8+ T cells increase, but CD38+CD8+ T cells show reduced functionality. These findings highlight the complex immune dynamics and their implications for NSCLC treatment.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common lethal cancers worldwide. Natural killer cells (NK cells) play a key role in liver immunosurveillance, but in the tumor microenvironment, NK cells are readily depleted, as evidenced by down-regulation of activating receptors, reduced cytokine secretion, and attenuated killing function. The up-regulation of inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3, further exacerbates the depletion of NK cells. Combined blockade strategies targeting these immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as the combination of PD-1 inhibitors with other inhibitory pathways (eg. TIM-3 and LAG-3), have shown potential to reverse NK cell exhaustion in preclinical studies. This article explores the promise of these innovative strategies in HCC immunotherapy, providing new therapeutic directions for optimizing NK cell function and improving drug sensitivity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children, leading to a pathogenesis-associated imbalance in CD4+ T-cell subsets and monocyte subsets. To investigate whether RSV affects the imbalance of CD4+ T-cells through monocytes, we examined the effects of the RSV-infected monocyte subset on CD4+ T-cell subsets, namely, Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) subsets, on proliferation in vitro and identified key monocyte-derived cytokines. We found that RSV efficiently infects CD16+ monocytes, but not CD16- monocytes, via cocultures of CD4+ T-cells with RSV-infected CD16+ monocytes, inhibits Treg cell proliferation and increases Th2 cell frequency, suggesting that RSV causes an imbalance in the CD4+ T-cell subset by primarily infecting CD16+ monocytes. Our data also revealed that IL-1β and IL-10 are key cytokines responsible for the activities of RSV-infected CD16+ monocytes. In a mouse model, we found that high-efficiency RSV infection of mouse Ly6C- monocytes, corresponding to CD16+ monocytes in humans, and adoptive transfer of Ly6C- monocytes during RSV infection decreased the Treg frequency in the lungs and aggravated pneumonia. Our data indicate that RSV can increase its pathogenesis through infection of nonclassic monocytes, leading to a CD4+ T-cell imbalance. IMPORTANCE This study identified a pathogenesis pathway related to the RSV-nonclassic monocyte–IL-1β/IL-10-CD4+ T-cell subset balance, which links the heterogeneity of monocytes to RSV pathogenesis and elucidates a new mechanism by which RSV infection disrupts the balance of CD4+ T cells during RSV infection. These new findings provide potential therapeutic targets for RSV infection.">

Infection of long-lived innate immune cells, such as tissue-resident macrophages and microglia may contribute to persistent viral RNA production and chronic inflammation. We recently reported that de-novo cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 intron-containing RNA (icRNA) in macrophages and microglia leads to MDA5 and MAVS-dependent innate immune sensing and induction of type I IFN responses, demonstrating that HIV icRNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this report, we show that cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 icRNA also induces NLRP1 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages and microglia in a RLR- and endosomal TLR-independent manner. Infection of both macrophages and microglia with either replication-competent or single-cycle HIV-1 induced IL-1β secretion, which was attenuated when cytoplasmic expression of viral icRNA was prevented. While IL-1β secretion was blocked by treatment with caspase-1 inhibitors or knockdown of NLRP1 or caspase-1 expression in HIV- infected macrophages, overexpression of NLRP1 significantly enhanced IL-1β secretion in an HIV-icRNA-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed interaction of HIV-1 icRNA, but not multiply-spliced HIV-1 RNA, with NLRP1, suggesting that HIV-1 icRNA sensing by NLRP1 is sufficient to trigger inflammasome activation. Together, these findings reveal a pathway of NLRP1 inflammasome activation induced by de novo expressed HIV icRNA in HIV- infected myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="Lactate and its derivative, lactylation, play pivotal roles in modulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly in T-cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy. Elevated lactate levels, a hallmark of the Warburg effect, contribute to immune suppression through CD8+ T cell functionality and by promoting regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Lactylation, a post-translational modification (PTM), alters histone and non-histone proteins, influencing gene expression and further reinforcing immune suppression. In the complex TME, lactate and its derivative, lactylation, are not only associated with immune suppression but can also, under certain conditions, exert immunostimulatory effects that enhance cytotoxic responses. This review describes the dual roles of lactate and lactylation in T-cell-mediated tumor immunity, analyzing how these factors contribute to immune evasion, therapeutic resistance, and immune activation. Furthermore, the article highlights emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting lactate production or disrupting lactylation pathways to achieve a balanced regulation of these dual effects. These strategies offer new insights into overcoming tumor-induced immune suppression and hold the potential to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.">

 ACOD1 is the ubiquitous source of the anti-inflammatory metabolite itaconate. We hypothesised monocyte ACOD1 expression is an inhibitory pathway that limits intestinal inflammation.



 We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of colonoscopic biopsies from >120 Crohn’s disease (CD) patients and healthy controls, with complementary analysis of DSS treated C57BL/6J (WT) mice, validated using flow cytometry in independent cohorts. Acod1–/– mice received 2% DSS in acute and recovery models, complemented by competitive bone marrow chimeric mice, anti-IFN / itaconate-derivate treatment and transgenic cell depletion models.



 We profile the monocyte / macrophage compartment in human IBD using single-cell RNA sequencing and identify a discrete population of intestinal CXCL9/10+ cells that accumulate in IBD, which we term inflammation associated monocytes (IAMs).
 These can be identified by the expression of CD319, CD274 and CCRL2, and demonstrate specific expression of IBD susceptibility genes, including NOD2. By performing cross-species analysis in mice, we show an analogous population of IAMs accumulate during chemically induced colitis. Using transgenic fate mapping approaches, we show these cells likely derive from a discrete MDP-precursor in the bone marrow and are locally imprinted to produce heightened IL-1β and TNF in mouse and humans.
 Importantly, we show that co-incident with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype, these same cells uniquely and specifically express aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1) in response to local Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) receptor signalling, to limit unrestricted cytokine production.



 Thus, the intestinal environment after injury instructs both inflammation and recovery specifically within a transitioning population of monocytes that are absent in health. Reduced itaconate production from IAMs in CD may predispose to chronic inflammation and disease progression.

        <tr id="Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare T-cell malignancy characterized by inflamed and painful rash-like skin lesions that may affect large portions of the body’s surface. Patients experience recurrent infections due to a compromised skin barrier and generalized immunodeficiency resulting from a dominant Th2 immune phenotype of CTCL cells. Given the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in normal and malignant T-cell development, we investigated the impact of UPR-inducing drugs on the viability, transcriptional networks, and Th2 phenotype of CTCL. We found that CTCL cells were >5-fold more sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Btz) and exhibited a distinct signaling and transcriptional response compared to normal CD4+ cells. The CTCL response was dominated by the induction of the HSP70 family member HSPA6 (HSP70B’) and, to a lesser extent, HSPA5 (BiP/GRP78). To understand the significance of these two factors, we used a novel isoform selective small-molecule inhibitor of HSPA5/6 (JG-023). JG-023 induced pro-apoptotic UPR signaling and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibitors and other UPR-inducing drugs in CTCL but not normal T cells. Interestingly, JG-023 also selectively suppressed the production of Th2 cytokines in CTCL and normal CD4+ T cells. Conditioned media (CM) from CTCL were immunosuppressive to normal T cells through an IL-10-dependent mechanism. This immunosuppression could be reversed by JG-023, other HSP70 inhibitors, Btz, and combinations of these UPR-targeted drugs. Our study points to the importance of the UPR in the pathology of CTCL and demonstrates the potential of proteasome and targeted HSPA5/6 inhibitors for therapy.">

 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex disease characterized by the dysregulation of multiple factors, including host immunity. The intestinal activation of T cells showing cytotoxic activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production is one of the key factors in its pathology. Therefore, targeting pro-inflammatory leukocytes from the circulation and in the inflammatory site is a reasonable therapeutic goal. CCR9 is the main activator of gut-tropism in the lymphocytes and responsible for the activation of migratory responses in lymphocytes into the lamina propria.
 SBR1 is a humanized IgG1 anti-CCR9 mAb showing high-affinity and specific binding towards CCR9+ cells. Displaying effector functions such as Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP), SRB1 shows specific depletion of infiltrating and circulating CCR9+ cells in vivo and restores the immune homeostasis in patient samples of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.



 Matching blood and 5 mm gut explants were obtained from IBD patients, then they were cultured for 16h with SRB1 and subsequently, CCR9+ cells were characterized by flow cytometry. The culture supernatants from these explants as well as blood samples from the same patients were analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokine production by Multiplex cytokine immune assay. Finally, in non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) CCR9 cell depletion was determined by flow cytometric assays at doses of 8, 15 y 25 mg/kg.



 We showed that CCR9 is highly expressed in intestine samples from IBD patients, especially in T cells, but also in other cell types including dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Treatment with SRB1 was able to effectively deplete CCR9+ cells, specifically T CD4+ CCR9+ and CCR9+ memory T cells from blood and intestinal samples from IBD patients. This depletion also reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the culture media. Finally, SRB1 also showed efficacy depleting CCR9 in non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) at different doses without showing any secondary adverse effects. All these data suggest a potential therapeutic potential of the antibody in the pathogenesis of IBD patients.



 SRB1 delivers potent blood and tissue depletion of CCR9 expressing cells ex vivo and in vivo and restores the immune homeostasis in patients’ samples of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SRB1 (anti-CCR9 mAb) a novel therapeutic approach for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases including CD and UC.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a primary central nervous system malignancy with a median survival of 15–20 months. The presence of both intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity limits understanding of biological mechanisms leading to tumor resistance, including immune escape. An attractive field of research to examine treatment resistance are immune signatures composed of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers and cytokines. CD markers are surface markers expressed on various cells throughout the body, often associated with immune cells. Cytokines are the effector molecules of the immune system. Together, CD markers and cytokines can serve as useful biomarkers to reflect immune status in patients with GBM. However, there are gaps in the understanding of the intricate interactions between GBM and the peripheral immune system and how these interactions change with standard and immune-modulating treatments. The key to understanding the true nature of these interactions is through multi-omic analysis of tumor progression and treatment response. This review aims to identify potential non-invasive blood-based biomarkers that can contribute to an immune signature through multi-omic approaches, leading to a better understanding of immune involvement in GBM.">

However, NK cells fail to restrain the growth of malignancies, such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The molecular genetics of NK cells in the B-ALL bone marrow microenvironment and the mechanisms underlying the inhibited function of NK cells at the single-cell level remain largely elusive.In this study, we studied the frequency and absolute number of NK cells in peripheral blood samples collected from 43 healthy volunteers and 104 pediatric B-ALL patients diagnosed at Hunan Children’s Hospital. We also analyzed published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from B-ALL and normal bone marrow samples using unsupervised clustering. Our findings were further validated using bulk transcriptomic data and clinical data from a cohort of 139 B-ALL bone marrow samples.We found that the frequency and number of NK cells were significantly decreased in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of B-ALL patients. In-depth analysis of scRNAseq data identified 12 NK cell clusters. Among them, the C2 cluster, which is present in healthy bone marrow but reduced in B-ALL bone marrow, displays overexpression of a transcription factor KLF2 and a significant downregulation of the “leukocyte proliferation” pathway. Furthermore, we found that the expression of KLF2 in B-ALL at diagnosis was positively correlated with the percentage of leukemia cells and the positive rate of minimal residual disease (MRD), indicating that KLF2 is a marker of poor prognosis.There are dramatic differences at the single-cell level in the transcriptomics of NK cells between healthy donors and B-ALL patients. A transcription factor, KLF2, which is enriched in the C2 cluster of NK cells, has been suggested to regulate the proliferation of NK cells and is associated with poor prognosis of pediatric B-ALL.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can address an unmet clinical need for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its effect is often modest in the setting of high tumor burden. In this study, we postulated that strategies to lower the AML apoptotic threshold will augment T cell killing of AML cells. BH3 mimetics, such as venetoclax, are a clinically approved class of compounds that predispose cells to intrinsic apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins. We explored the anti-leukemic efficacy of BH3 mimetics combined with WT1-specific CD8 + T cells on AML cell lines and primary samples from patients with a diverse array of disease characteristics to evaluate if lowering the cellular apoptotic threshold via inhibition of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins can increase leukemic cell sensitivity to T cell therapy. We found that the combination approach of BH3 mimetic and CD8 + T cells led to significantly increased killing of established AML lines as well as of adverse-risk primary AML leukemic blast cells. In contrast to the hypothesis that enhanced killing would be due to combined activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, we found that CTL-mediated killing of AML cells was accomplished primarily through activation of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This highly effective combinatorial activity due to convergence on the same apoptotic pathway was conserved across multiple AML cell lines and primary samples, suggesting that mitochondrial priming may represent a novel mechanism of optimizing adoptive cell therapy for AML patients.">

        <tr id="Primary and secondary resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) reduces its efficacy. The mechanisms underlying immunotherapy resistance are highly complex. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), these mechanisms are primarily associated with the loss of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, genetic mutations, circular RNA axis and transcription factor regulation, antigen presentation disorders, and dysregulation of signaling pathways. Additionally, alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) play a pivotal role in driving immunotherapy resistance. Primary resistance is mainly attributed to TME alterations, including mutations and co-mutations, modulation of T cell infiltration, enrichment of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and pulmonary fibrosis. Acquired resistance mainly stems from changes in cellular infiltration patterns leading to “cold” or “hot” tumors, altered interferon (IFN) signaling pathway expression, involvement of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and oxidative stress responses, as well as post-treatment gene mutations and circadian rhythm disruption (CRD). This review presents an overview of various mechanisms underlying resistance to ICB, elucidates the alterations in the TME during primary, adaptive, and acquired resistance, and discusses existing strategies for overcoming ICB resistance.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by unlimited accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides. It is often accompanied by disease, and the relationship between ferroptosis of immune cells and immune regulation has been attracting increasing attention. Initially, it was found in cancer research that the inhibition of regulatory T cell (Treg) ferroptosis and the promotion of CD8+ T cell ferroptosis jointly promoted the formation of an immune-tolerant environment in tumors. T-cell ferroptosis has subsequently been found to have immunoregulatory effects in other diseases. As an autoimmune disease characterized by immune imbalance, T-cell ferroptosis has attracted attention for its potential in regulating immune balance in lupus nephritis. This article reviews the metabolic processes within different T-cell subsets in lupus nephritis (LN), including T follicular helper (TFH) cells, T helper (Th)17 cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and Treg cells, and reveals that these cellular metabolisms not only facilitate the formation of a T-cell immune imbalance but are also closely associated with the occurrence of ferroptosis. Consequently, we hypothesize that targeting the metabolic pathways of ferroptosis could become a novel research direction for effectively treating the immune imbalance in lupus nephritis by altering T-cell differentiation and the incidence of ferroptosis.">

In this study, we investigated potential Treg cell epitopes in human α-tubulin that were selected in silico for their promiscuous binding to class II human leukocyte antigens and full identity with antigens from enteric nematodes present in excretory-secretory products. We identified five Treg cell epitopes in α-tubulin that were capable of stimulating and expanding IL-10 and TGF-β-producing Foxp3+ Treg cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We also proved that a peptide pool containing the identified Treg cell epitopes (αTBL pool) suppressed the T cell responses elicited by different stimuli, including LPS, and class I and class II restricted T cell epitopes, as determined by intracellular cytokine staining assays. Similarly, this same peptide pool was able to suppress T cell responses in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Finally, we found that stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells with autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells in the presence of the αTBL pool promoted the differentiation of functional CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ T cells capable of suppressing the proliferation of CD3/CD28-activated T cells. α-tubulin Treg cell epitopes could be useful for treating autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases by inducing Treg cells and, given the ubiquitous and copious expression of α-tubulin, enable a general mechanism of immune homeostasis.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis, but their dynamics are altered in a subset of people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) known as immunological non-responders (INRs). INRs fail to reconstitute CD4+ T-cell counts despite viral suppression. This study aimed to examine Treg dysregulation in INRs, comparing them to immunological responders (IRs) and healthy controls (HCs).


METHODS
The study included 40 INRs, 42 IRs, and 23 HCs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. Conventional CD4+ T-cells (Tconvs) were identified as CD25-/loFOXP3- cells, while Tregs were identified as CD25+CD127loFOXP3+ CD4+ T-cells. Cells were further divided into naive, central memory, effector memory, and effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) subsets. Activated/cycling cells were identified as CD71+ and quiescent cells were CD71-. Mitochondrial mass and transmembrane potential were measured using MitoTracker Green and MitoTracker Orange dyes, respectively. Statistical comparisons were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc analysis and Mann-Whitney U-test.


RESULTS
INRs exhibited the highest frequencies of activated/cycling CD4+ T-cells. The proportion of activated/cycling cells was higher in Tregs compared to Tconvs in all groups. Cycling rates of Tregs and Tconvs were correlated, suggesting Tregs help control Tconv proliferation. Despite high overall Treg frequencies in INRs, they showed a Treg deficiency in activated/cycling CD4+ T-cells, specifically in naive and central memory subsets, causing an imbalance in the Tconv/Treg ratio. This deficiency was hidden by increased Treg frequencies in quiescent effector memory CD4+ T-cells. Activated/cycling naive and memory Tregs from INRs had normal forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and CD25 expression, but activated/cycling memory Tregs showed decreased ability to regulate mitochondrial transmembrane potential, indicating impaired mitochondrial fitness. These mitochondrial abnormalities were similar to those observed in memory conventional T-cells.


CONCLUSIONS
The complex Treg dysregulation in immunological non-responders involves quantitative and functional alterations, including a Treg deficiency within activated/cycling naive and central memory CD4+ T-cells, impaired mitochondrial fitness of activated/cycling memory Tregs, and functional disorders of the parent conventional T-lymphocytes. These findings underscore the need for a nuanced understanding of Treg dynamics in suboptimal CD4+ T-cell reconstitution during HIV-infection.">

        <tr id="Tissue-specific T cell immune responses play a critical role in maintaining organ health but can also drive immune pathology during both autoimmunity and alloimmunity. The mechanisms controlling intratissue T cell programming remain unclear. Here, we leveraged a nonhuman primate model of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to probe the biological underpinnings of tissue-specific alloimmune disease using a comprehensive systems immunology approach including multiparameter flow cytometry, population-based transcriptional profiling, and multiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed substantial biological differences between T cells infiltrating the lung and liver during aGVHD. These included enrichment for transcriptional pathways controlling extracellular matrix remodeling and chemotaxis in the lung and enrichment for transcriptional pathways linked to nucleic acid metabolism and proliferation in the liver. Single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing substantiated divergent organ-specific transcriptional programing of tissue-infiltrating T cells, which was linked to clonal expansion, with expanded clones progressively enriched for C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1)-expressing CD8 effector T cells in the lung and eomesodermin (EOMES)-expressing CD8 effector-memory T cells in the liver. This divergent evolution of T cells was maintained even for T cells sharing the same TCRs, indicating its independence from antigen specificity. Together, these results provide insights into the role that tissue microenvironment-derived signals play in local T cell transcriptional programming during alloimmune-mediated clonal expansion and suggest potential opportunities to develop tissue-specific therapeutics to curtail pathogenic immunity after transplant.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases pose a significant challenge due to their complex pathogenesis and rising prevalence. Traditional therapies are often limited by systemic side effects, immunosuppression, and lack of long-term efficacy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have demonstrated immunomodulatory properties, primarily through the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are now recognized as potent mediators of immune regulation. MSC-derived EVs carry bioactive molecules such as microRNAs, proteins, and lipids that influence key immune pathways, making them a promising therapeutic avenue for autoimmune diseases. This review critically examines the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSC-derived EVs, focusing on their role in regulating T cells, B cells, and macrophages, which are central to autoimmune pathology. We explore recent preclinical and clinical studies that highlight the ability of MSC-derived EVs to reduce inflammation, promote immune tolerance, and restore tissue homeostasis in autoimmune settings. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages of EV-based therapy over MSC-based therapies, including improved safety profiles, lower immunogenicity, and scalability for clinical application. By evaluating the current landscape of MSC-derived EV research, we identify key gaps and propose innovative strategies to optimize EVbased therapies for autoimmune diseases. These strategies include engineering EVs to enhance their specificity and therapeutic efficacy, as well as integrating them with biomaterials for targeted delivery. Our review aims to provide a forward-looking perspective on the potential of MSC-derived EVs as a novel therapeutic approach, moving beyond traditional cell-based therapies to offer more precise and personalized treatment options for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Although MDSCs are widely recognized for their immunoinhibitory effects in pathological conditions, their function during HIV infection particularly within the mechanisms underlying incomplete immune recovery remains elusive. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 30 healthy controls and 62 HIV-1-infected subjects [31 immunological non-responders (INRs) and 31 immunological responders (IRs)] were selected. The proportion of MDSCs was determined in each category of participants. Using flow cytometry and real-time PCR, immune regulatory molecules (including PD-L1, ARG1, iNOS, IL-10, TGF-β, and IDO) that are relevant for MDSCs activity were quantified. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the blockade of PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways on MDSCs and their effects on CD4+ T-cells using in vitro functional experiments. Results PMN-MDSCs are more abundant and are negatively correlated to CD4 counts in HIV-infected individuals. In addition, PMN-MDSCs suppress CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ production in INRs. Furthermore, correlations were found between PD-L1 expression on PMN-MDSCs and PD-1+ CD4+ T-cells. TGF-β expression on PMN-MDSCs was likewise enhanced in INRs. Importantly, inhibiting both PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways had a synergistic impact on restoring CD4+ T-cell activity in vitro. Conclusions PMN-MDSCs expansion inhibits CD4+ T-cell responses. We suggest that targeting PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways together may significantly improve immune recovery in INRs.">

        <tr id="Lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-mediated probiotics have the capability to modulate intestinal immunity, creating an anti-inflammatory environment. Among the immune-modulatory effects, interleukin (IL)-10-producing CD4+ T cells are often discussed for their anti-inflammatory roles. While regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a well-known subset, type I regulatory T (Tr1) cells, which also produce abundant IL-10, receive less attention in LAB-induced anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we report that Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris C60, a probiotic LAB strain, increases IL-10-producing Tr1 cells in the intestinal environment, contributing to resistance against inflammatory conditions such as dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Intragastric administration of heat-killed (HK)-C60 significantly increased IL-10+CD4+ T cells in intestinal tissues compared to control treatment. These populations predominantly consisted of Forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3)-negative cells, indicating that Tr1 cells were primarily expanded by HK-C60 stimulation. Further analysis revealed that IL-10+ Tr1 cells could be classified into two major subpopulations: IL-10 single-positive (SP) and IFN-γ/IL-10 double-positive (DP) cells. An in vitro co-culture system using CD4+ T cells and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) demonstrated that HK-C60 stimulation modified dendritic cell function, promoting Tr1 cell differentiation. Moreover, pro-inflammatory IFN-γ+CD4+ T (Th1) cells differentiated into IL-10+ Tr1 cells in the presence of HK-C60-stimulated BMDCs, with the effect being particularly pronounced in DP Tr1 cells. HK-C60-administration attenuated inflammation and reduced pro-inflammatory leukocyte infiltration in the colon of DSS-induced colitis mice, accompanied by the expansion of DP Tr1 cells. The suppressive effect of intestinal CD4+ T cells in HK-C60-treated mice was IL-10-dependent, as demonstrated by an in vitro IL-10 neutralizing assay. Thus, C60-based probiotics promote the creation of an anti-inflammatory intestinal environment by increasing IL-10+ Tr1 cells rather than Tregs.">

        <tr id="Immunity to Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is sexually dimorphic in humans and mice, with females having higher morbidity and mortality during immune dysfunction and HIV-AIDS. The mechanisms underlying these sex differences are unclear. We investigated how a lack of CD4+ T cells (CD4 co-receptor KO) impacted T. gondii survival in mice. Female CD4 co-receptor KO mice succumbed to T. gondii much faster than males. To dissect why female CD4 co-receptor KO mice died faster, we tested their NK cell responses to acute T. gondii infection compared to males. Although in wild-type (WT) animals, both sexes had similar increases in total NK cells and IFNγ + NK cells, infected CD4 co-receptor KO female mice had 50% fewer IFNγ+ NK cells than infected WT female mice. Infected male CD4 co-receptor KO had a similar increase in IFNγ+ NK cells as WT male mice. Since CD4 co-receptor deficient mice still have functional helper T cells that are CD4−, we next tested survival and NK cell responses in female and male MHCII deficient (MHCIIKO) animals, which completely lack helper CD4+T cells. Surprisingly, survival, NK cell numbers, and IFNγ+ NK cells were not significantly different between WT or MHCIIKO female and male mice. These results suggest CD4 co-receptor expression is required for survival via optimal NK cell responses during acute T. gondii infection only in female mice and not in male mice. Our findings reveal an unappreciated sexual dimorphic role of CD4 co-receptor expression in regulating NK cell responses to acute T. gondii infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Ovarian cancer (OC) remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, largely due to its late-stage diagnosis and high recurrence rates. Chronic inflammation is a critical driver of OC progression, contributing to immune evasion, tumor growth, and metastasis. Inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8, as well as key signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), are upregulated in OC, promoting a tumor-promoting environment. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is characterized by immune cells like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), which suppress anti-tumor immune responses, facilitating immune evasion. Furthermore, OC cells utilize immune checkpoint pathways, including PD-1/PD-L1, to inhibit cytotoxic T cell activity. Targeting these inflammatory and immune evasion mechanisms offers promising therapeutic strategies. COX-2 inhibitors, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway blockers, and NF-kB inhibitors have shown potential in preclinical studies, while immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 have been explored with mixed results in OC. Additionally, emerging research on the microbiome and inflammation-related biomarkers, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and exosomes, points to new opportunities for early detection and precision medicine. Future approaches to OC treatment must focus on personalized strategies that target the inflammatory TME, integrating anti-inflammatory therapies with immunotherapy to enhance patient outcomes. Continued research into the interplay between inflammation and immune evasion in OC is essential for developing effective, long-lasting treatments.">

        <tr id="Pregnancy involves significant immunological changes to support fetal development while protecting the mother from infections. A growing body of evidence supports the importance of immune checkpoint pathways, especially at the maternal–fetal interface, although limited information is available about the peripheral expression of these molecules by CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets during the trimesters of pregnancy. Understanding the dynamics of these immune cells and their checkpoint pathways is crucial for elucidating their roles in pregnancy maintenance and potential complications. This study aims to investigate the peripheral expression and functional characteristics of CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets throughout pregnancy, providing insights into their contributions to maternal and fetal health. A total of 34 healthy women were enrolled from the first, 30 from the second and 40 from the third trimester of pregnancy. At the same time, 35 healthy age-matched non-pregnant women formed the control group. From peripheral blood, mononuclear cells were separated and stored at −80 °C. CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets were analyzed from freshly thawed samples, and surface and intracellular staining was performed using flow cytometric analyses. The proportions of CD56+ NK cells in peripheral blood were similar across groups. While CD8− NKdim cells increased significantly in all trimesters compared to non-pregnant controls, CD8+ NKdim cells showed no significant changes. CD8− NKbright cells had higher frequencies throughout pregnancy, whereas CD8+ NKbright cells significantly increased only in the first and second trimesters. The expression levels of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1 and PD-L1, and cytotoxic-activity-related molecules were stable, with notable perforin and granzyme B increases in CD8− NKbright cells throughout pregnancy. Our study shows that peripheral NK cell populations, especially CD8− subsets, are predominant during pregnancy. This shift suggests a crucial role for CD8− NK cells in balancing maternal immune tolerance and surveillance. The stable expression of immune checkpoint molecules indicates that other regulatory mechanisms may be at work. These findings enhance our understanding of peripheral immune dynamics in pregnancy and suggest that targeting CD8− NKbright cell functions could help manage pregnancy-related immune complications. This research elucidates the stable distribution and functional characteristics of peripheral NK cells during pregnancy, with CD8− subsets being more prevalent. The increased activity of CD8− NKbright cells suggests their critical role in maintaining immune surveillance. Our findings provide a basis for future studies to uncover the mechanisms regulating NK cell function in pregnancy, potentially leading to new treatments for immune-related pregnancy complications.">

        <tr id="The increasing use of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint blockade has led to the emergence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including dysfunction of the submandibular gland (SMG). In this study, we investigated the immunoregulatory mechanism contributing to the susceptibility of the SMG to irAEs. We found that the SMGs of PD-1-deficient mice and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-treated mice harbor an expanded population of CD8+ T cells. We demonstrate that natural killer (NK) cells expressing PD-L1 tightly regulate CD8+ T cells in the SMG. When this immunoregulation is disrupted, CD8+ T cells clonally expand and acquire a unique transcriptional profile consistent with T cell receptor (TCR) activation. These clonally expanded cells phenotypically overlapped with cytotoxic GzmK+ CD8+ T autoimmune cells identified in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome. Understanding how NK cells modulate CD8+ T cell activity in the SMG opens new avenues for preventing irAEs in patients undergoing checkpoint blockade therapies.">

To investigate the pro-phagocytic phenotype of macrophages in SSc and other rheumatic diseases by examining their activation, signaling pathways, and treatment responses, with the goal of uncovering mechanisms that drive enhanced phagocytosis.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (GSE138669/GSE212109) from skin and lung macrophages of healthy controls and SSc patients were analyzed. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) were differentiated from CD14+ monocytes from healthy controls, SSc, RA, PsA, and axSpA patients. In selected experiments, hMDMs were pretreated with 0.1 μM nintedanib. Phagocytic activity was quantified using pHrodo bioparticles and flow cytometry. Macrophage surface markers were evaluated by flow cytometry, NF-κB signaling by Western blot, and gene expression by RT-qPCR.


RESULTS
Analysis of scRNA-seq datasets revealed a pro-phagocytic signature in SSc-affected organs. SSc macrophages, particularly the FCGR3A  hi cluster in skin, exhibited elevated expression of FCGR genes and enriched FcγR-mediated phagocytosis pathways, accompanied by pro-inflammatory markers. This phenotype extended to FCN1  hi lung macrophages in SSc patients with interstitial lung disease, indicating a systemic pro-inflammatory and phagocytic profile. hMDMs from SSc, RA, and PsA patients demonstrated enhanced phagocytic activity in vitro. Elevated FcγRI and FcγRII levels were identified as key drivers of increased phagocytic activity and subsequent IL-6-driven inflammation. Nintedanib showed reduction in FcγRI expression, suggesting its potential therapeutic benefit in attenuating the phagocytic process.


CONCLUSION
This study highlights FcγR-expressing macrophages as drivers of phagocytosis and inflammatory responses in SSc. Dysregulated activation of these macrophages could lead to persistent inflammation and fibrosis in rheumatic diseases, highlighting new potential therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is characterized by a concomitant early pro-inflammatory response by immune cells to an infection, and an opposing anti-inflammatory response that results in protracted immunosuppression. The primary pathological event in sepsis is widespread programmed cell death, or cellular self-sacrifice, of innate and adaptive immune cells, leading to profound immunological suppression. This severe immune dysfunction hampers effective primary pathogen clearance, thereby increasing the risk of secondary opportunistic infections, latent viral reactivation, multiple organ dysfunction, and elevated mortality. The types of cell death include apoptosis (type I programmed cell death), autophagy (type II programmed cell death), NETosis (a program for formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)) and other programmed cell deaths like pyroptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, each contributing to immunosuppression in distinct ways during the later phases of sepsis. Extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes, such as CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and B cells, is strongly associated with immunosuppression. Apoptosis of dendritic cells further compromises T and B cell survival and can induce T cell anergy or promote regulatory Treg cell proliferation. Moreover, delayed apoptosis and impaired neutrophil function contribute to nosocomial infections and immune dysfunction in sepsis. Interestingly, aberrant NETosis and the subsequent depletion of mature neutrophils also trigger immunosuppression, and neutrophil pyroptosis can positively regulate NETosis. The interaction between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) plays a key role in T cell modulation and neutrophil apoptosis in sepsis. The dendritic cell growth factor, Fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLTEL), increases DC numbers, enhances CD 28 expression, attenuates PD-L1, and improves survival in sepsis. Recently, immunoadjuvant therapies have attracted attention for their potential to restore host physiological immunity and homeostasis in patients with sepsis. This review focuses on several potential immunotherapeutic agents designed to bolster suppressed innate and adaptive immune responses in the management of sepsis.">

IFN-γ-producing γδ T-cells in the resistance to poxviruses may a key role in inducing a protective type 1 memory immunity. We analyzed the kinetics of Vδ2 T-cell response from the acute phase up to three months after Mpox infection. Fourteen MSM subjects (5 PWH, 35.7%) were enrolled in a longitudinal study from May to July 2022. Blood samples were collected in the early phase of infection (T1, T2) and at 3 months (T3M) post-symptom onset. Vδ2 T-cell profiles (CD45RA/CCR7), activation/exhaustion markers (CD38/HLA-DR/CD57/PD-1/TIM-3), cytokine production (IFN-γ/TNF-α) and CD107a expression were assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry. Ten healthy donors (HD) were used as a control group. At T1, Vδ2 T-cell frequency of patients decreased, and effector memory Vδ2 T-cells increased with respect to HD. Activation/exhaustion markers were higher than HD. Vδ2 functionality decreased at T1 related to HD, and it was associated with CD38 and HLA-DR higher expression as well as TIM-3. Vδ2 T-cells restored their profile at T3M. The presence of effector/activated Vδ2 T-cells in the early stages of Mpox infection and their capability to activate quickly, producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, may be useful to enhance the early adaptive response to human Mpox, maintaining a protective memory/effector T-cell response.">

        <tr id="Although significant progress has been made in cancer immunotherapy in recent years, its overall efficacy remains limited in a large number of patients. The interaction between the tumor microenvironment (TME) and CD8+ T cells is one of the core topics in cancer immunotherapy research. CD8+ T cells can play an anti-tumor role by recognizing and killing virus-infected or mutated cells. However, in the TME, as the tumor compresses immune cells, the function of them is impaired, and studies have found that relying on PD-1 alone is not enough to resist tumor cells. Therefore, by blocking the PD-1 and Tim-3 pathways to interfere with CD8+ T cell exhaustion (TEX), the performance of CD8+ T cells can be maximized, their survival period extended, and the efficacy of positive cancer immunotherapy improved. For patients with cancer who have failed to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy, multi-targeted combination therapy may achieve better results.">

This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients. Methods We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex. Results Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the most widely diagnosed cancers worldwide. Despite the advances in medical research, there is still a lot to be explored between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, namely immune cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to mediate communication between cells and can modulate the activity of immune cells. External stimuli such as stress and chemotherapy can influence the activity of the released EVs. Nevertheless, the relationship between chemotherapy, EVs and immune cells has yet to be fully explored. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the immune-related functional mechanisms of EVs isolated from pre- and post- FOLFOX chemotherapy from CRC patients. The EVs were isolated from the serum of matched patients and characterized via dynamic light scattering. The EVs were then co-incubated with primary CD8 T cells isolated from healthy donors and Jurkat cells. The apoptosis, cell cycle profile, gene expression and cytokines were evaluated. Upon treatment with EVs, the T cells underwent apoptosis however no differences were seen in the cell cycle phases. Gene expression related to cytokine release was also differentially expressed namely IRF4. The level of cytokines that were released also differed between the two groups. Our study has shown that there are some minor differences in the activity of the EVs after induction with chemotherapy.">

        <tr id="There is a high medical need to develop new strategies for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) refractory to conventional therapy. In vitro, the combinations of the blast-modulatory response modifiers GM-CSF + Prostaglandin E1, (summarized as Kit M) have been shown to convert myeloid leukemic blasts into antigen-presenting dendritic cells of leukemic origin (DCleu) that were able to (re-)activate the innate and adaptive immune system, direct it specifically against leukemic blasts, and induce memory cells. This study aimed to investigate the immune modulatory capacity and antileukemic efficacy of Kit M in vivo. Brown Norway rats suffering from AML were treated with Kit M (twofold application). Blasts and immune cells were monitored in peripheral blood (PB) and spleen. Upon the observation of promising immune modulatory effects in the treated animals, two patients with AML refractory to multiple lines of therapy were offered treatment with Kit M on an individualized basis. Safety, as well as immunological and clinical effects, were monitored. Samples obtained from a third patient in similar clinical conditions not receiving Kit M were used as controls for immune monitoring tests. Animal experiments: Drugs were well tolerated by the treated animals. After 9 days of treatment, DCleu and memory-like T cells increased in the peripheral blood, whereas regulatory T cells, especially blasts, decreased in treated as compared to untreated control animals. Clinical courses: No severe side effects were observed. In patient 1482, PB blasts remained under the detection threshold during 27 days of treatment, thrombocytes were normalized, and (leukemia specific) immune effector cells of the adaptive and innate immune system increased up to 800-fold compared to the start of treatment. Patient 1601 responded with a 12% reduction in blasts in PB immediately after Kit M treatment. Several subtypes of (leukemia-specific) immune effector cells in PB increased up to four-fold during the 19 days of treatment. In contrast, immune-reactive cells decreased under mild chemotherapy in the PB of control patient 1511 with comparably refractory AML. Within the limitation of low numbers in both animal experiments and clinical applications, our data suggest that Kit M treatment of AML-diseased rats and patients is feasible and may induce leukemia-specific immune reactions and clinical improvement. A larger series and a prospective clinical trial will be required to confirm our observations. Beyond optimized doses and schedules of the applied compounds, the combination with other antileukemic strategies or the application of Kit M in less proliferative stages of the myeloid diseases need to be discussed. If effects are confirmed, the concept may add to the armamentarium of treatments for highly aggressive blood cancer.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Single antigen (Ag)‐targeted immunotherapies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are highly effective; however, up to 50% of patients relapse after these treatments. Most of these relapses lack target Ag expression, suggesting targeting multiple Ags would be advantageous. Materials & Methods The multi‐Ag immune responses to ALL induced by transducing cell lines with xenoAgs green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase was elucidated using flow cytometry, ELISA, and ELISpot assays. Results In our model, leukemia responsiveness correlates with in vivo CD4+ T cell activation and DC maturation, supporting a role for DC licensing. In contrast, tolerance is characterized by in vivo increased expression of negative immune checkpoints (IC) which may suppress rather than license DC. In vitro assays confirm the ability of CD4+ T cells from leukemia‐responsive mice to promote robust maturation of naïve bone marrow DC in the presence of non‐immunogenic leukemia antigens. Conclusion Together these findings support a CD4+ T cell‐mediated mechanism of DC licensing to promote multi‐Ag immune responses that may augment current targeted immunotherapies and avoid relapses in treated children with ALL.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of many malignant tumors. However, ICI-induced hyper-immune activation causes cardiotoxicity. Traditional treatments such as glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants have limited effectiveness and may even accelerate tumor growth. This study aimed to identify approaches that effectively reduce cardiotoxicity and simultaneously preserve or enhance the antitumor immunity of ICI therapy. Methods ICI injection in melanoma-bearing C57BL/6J female mice was used to simulate cardiotoxicity in patients with tumor undergoing immune therapy. MCC950 was used to block nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activity. Echocardiography, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to assess cardiac function, immune cell populations, and inflammatory factor levels. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing was used to detect the changes in cardiac transcriptome and immunological network. Results NLRP3 inhibition reduced inflammatory response and improved cardiac function. Notably, NLRP3 inhibition also resulted in a pronounced suppression of tumor growth. Single-cell RNA sequencing elucidated that MCC950 treatment reduced the cardiac infiltration of pathogenic macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, activated T cells, and their production of inflammatory cytokines, while enhancing the presence of reparative macrophages and naive T cells. In addition, MCC950 attenuated cardiotoxicity induced by dual programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) immunotherapy and promoted tumor regression, and showed efficacy in treating established cardiotoxicity. Conclusions Our findings provide a promising clinical approach for preventing and treating cardiotoxicity induced by ICIs, dissociating the antitumor efficacy of ICI-based therapies from their cardiotoxic side effects.">

This study aim to investigate the impact of MR1 expression on lung cancer cells on the proliferation and cytokine production of MAIT cells in vitro. We transfected A9 with MR1 to overexpress the molecule and knocked out MR1 in TC1 cells to create MR1-deficient models. These cells were then co-cultured with MAIT cells. MAIT cell proliferation was assessed, and cytokine production, including IFN-, Perforin, and IL-10, was quantified. Our findings showed that MAIT cells that co-cultured with MR1-positive cancer cells exhibited significantly increased proliferation and elevated production of IFN-, Perforin, and IL-10 compared to those co-cultured with MR1-negative cells. These results underscore the importance of MR1 in modulating MAIT cell activity and suggest that targeting MR1-MAIT interactions may offer new avenues for lung cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized immune cells that play a crucial role in presenting antigens and activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes to combat tumors. The immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) can bind to its ligand programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. This interaction suppresses T-cell activation and promotes immune tolerance. Radiation therapy can increase the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, which can lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of the treatment, and detailed studies are needed to understand the mechanisms. As many patients develop resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy-either through lack of response or cancer recurrence-there is a critical need to maximize synergistic effects by selecting combination treatments that offer improved therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects. In the present study, immature DCs (iDCs) were introduced directly into irradiated tumor sites (referred as IR/iDCs), and immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) were administered intraperitoneally. We confirmed the antitumor effect of combining IR/iDCs and ICBs by examining tumor growth and mouse survival. The proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes increased in the IR/iDCs-treated groups. Combining IR/iDCs with an anti-PD-L1 antibody led to a significant reduction in distant tumor growth and improved mouse survival rates compared with IR/iDCs alone or IR/iDCs + anti-PD-1 antibody. These findings suggest that integrating radiotherapy, DC-based immunotherapy, and ICB, specifically targeting PD-L1, may be an effective cancer treatment strategy.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, a subset of T cells identified by the surface glycoprotein CD8, particularly those expressing the co-stimulatory molecule CD226, play a crucial role in the immune response to malignancies. However, their role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an immunosuppressive disease, has not yet been explored. We studied 64 CLL patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed the proportion of CD226-expressing cells among different CD8+ T cell subsets (including naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effectors) in CLL patients, stratified by Rai stage and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgHV) mutation status. Additionally, we compared the effector functions of CD8+CD226+ cells and their CD226- counterparts. We also quantified cytokine and chemokine levels in the plasma of CLL and HCs. Furthermore, we reanalyzed the publicly available bulk RNA-seq on CD226+ and CD226-CD8+ T cells. Finally, we evaluated the impact of elevated cytokines/chemokines on CD226 expression. Our results showed that CD226-expressing cells were significantly decreased within the effector memory and effector CD8+ T cell subsets in CLL patients with advanced Rai stages and unmutated IgHV, a marker of poor prognosis. These cells displayed robust effector functions, including cytokine production, cytolytic activity, degranulation, proliferation, and migration capacity. In contrast, CD8+CD226- T cells displayed an exhausted phenotype with reduced Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β) were inversely correlated with the frequency of CD8+CD226+ T cells and may contribute to the downregulation of CD226, possibly leading to T cell dysfunction in CLL. Our findings highlight the critical role of CD8+CD226+RUNX2hi T cells in CLL and suggest that their reduction is associated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. This study also underscores the potential of targeting IL-6 and MIP-1β to preserve polyfunctional CD8+CD226+ T cells as a promising immunotherapy strategy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies have achieved revolutionary success in cancer therapy. However, the impact of anti-PD-1 therapy on host humoral immunity in humans during cancer immunotherapy requires further investigation. Methods We evaluated immunoglobulin titers by ELISA and screened the immune landscape of immune cells from 25 healthy donors and 50 cases including 25 new-onset hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients prior to systemic treatment and 25 HCC patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy by multicolor flow cytometry. Flow or beads sorted cells were cultured ex vivo for proliferation and functional analysis. Results Anti-PD-1 therapy significantly increased the levels of IgG and IgA in the periphery of HCC patients. Anti-PD-1 treatment led to an increase in plasmablasts and a notable rise in circulating T follicular regulatory (cTfr) cells, while changes in circulating B cells, T follicular helper cells, or regulatory T cells were not significant. Anti-PD-1 therapy also influenced the proliferation and function of cTfr cells, promoting the differentiation of CD38+ cTfr cells. We observed that the CD38+ Tfr cell subset in the peripheral blood can promote plasmablast differentiation, associated with altered antibody production. Conclusions Together, these data demonstrate the immunomodulatory role of PD-1 in restricting the differentiation and function of human cTfr cells and in regulating humoral immunity.">

However, the immune microenvironment in cervical cancer remains poorly described. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) were recently described as markers for better immunotherapy response and overall better prognosis in cancer patients. We evaluated the cervical tumor immune microenvironment, specifically focusing on TLS, using combined high-throughput phenotyping, soluble factor concentration dosage in the TME and spatial interaction analyses. We found that TLS presence was associated with a more inflammatory soluble microenvironment, with the presence of B cells as well as more activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, this myeloid cell activation was associated with expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1 and CD40, and proximity of activated conventional type 2 DCs (DC2) to CD8+ T cells, indicating better immune interactions and tumor control. Finally, we associated TLS presence, greater B cell density, and activated DC density with improved progression-free survival, substantiating TLS presence as a potential prognostic marker.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma, associated with poor prognosis and impaired immune function, shows potential interactions between newly identified disulfidptosis mechanisms and T cell exhaustion, yet these remain understudied.Key genes were identified using Lasso regression, followed by multivariate analysis to develop a prognostic model. Single-cell pseudotemporal analysis explored disulfidptosis T-cell exhaustion (Tex) signaling in cell differentiation. Immune infiltration was assessed via ssGSEA, while transwell assays and immunofluorescence examined the effects of disulfidptosis-Tex genes on glioma cell behavior and immune response.Eleven disulfidptosis-Tex genes were found critical for glioblastoma survival outcomes. This gene set underpinned a model predicting patient prognosis. Single-cell analysis showed high disulfidptosis-Tex activity in endothelial cells. Memory T cell populations were linked to these genes. SMC4 inhibition reduced LN299 cell migration and increased chemotherapy sensitivity, decreasing CD4 and CD8 T cell activation.Disulfidptosis-Tex genes are pivotal in glioblastoma progression and immune interactions, offering new avenues for improving anti-glioblastoma therapies through modulation of T cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Several cancer treatments that have been used for quite a few decades include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. These resulted in significant responses and the prolongation of survival for a subset of cancer patients. Another subset was not responsive to such treatments and many of the originally responding patients became unresponsive to subsequent treatments and succumbed to the disease. Fortunately, a new treatment was introduced that takes advantage of the patient’s immune response to fight the cancer and eradicate it, as it does with viral and microbial infections too. The immune response to cancer is called “immunotherapy”. Several immunotherapeutic approaches were developed and approved by the FDA for various cancers, and yield significant clinical responses and the prolongation of survival in many cancer patients. Immunotherapy depends largely on the patient’s immune response being activated and killing the tumor cells. Killing the tumor cells is mediated by immune cells, called CD8 T cells, which need to locate and bind to the cancer cells to kill them. Interestingly, cancer cells strive to survive and escape their death via the CD8 T cells. They manifest this clever approach by inducing various markers on their surface that will prevent them from killing the cancer cells, resulting in the survival and growth of the cancer cells. Therefore, such a failure of immunotherapy required a remedy. Indeed, a remedy was found through which these markers were inhibited therapeutically by agents approved by the FDA, resulting in the cancer cells’ ability to inhibit the CD8 T cells being overridden. Such approved agents were very effective in many cancer patients, but unfortunately not all. Here too we needed to develop other therapies to treat the unresponsive patients. Here, we describe a novel approach that involves using an agent that inhibits the expression of the above inhibitory markers on the CD8 T cells, allowing them to be active and kill the cancer cells in unresponsive patients. It is worthwhile to develop this new approach through research investigation and clinical trials.">

        <tr id="The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is overexpressed in many cancers and contributes to pathogenesis, disease progression, and resistance to therapies. CXCR4 is known to form oligomers, but the potential functional relevance in malignancies remain elusive. Using a newly established nanobody-based BRET method, we demonstrate that oligomerization of endogenous CXCR4 on lymphoid cancer cell lines correlates with enhanced expression levels. Specific disruption of CXCR4 oligomers reduced basal cell migration and pro-survival signaling via changes in the phosphoproteome, indicating the existence of basal CXCR4-oligomer-mediated signaling. Oligomer disruption also inhibited growth of primary CLL 3D spheroids and sensitized primary malignant cells to clinically used Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Given its limited efficacy in some patients and the ability to develop resistance, sensitizing malignant B-cells to venetoclax is of clinical relevance. Taken together, we established a new, non-canonical and critical role for CXCR4 oligomers in lymphoid neoplasms and demonstrated that selective targeting thereof has clinical potential. Significance statement Class A GPCRs, including the chemokine receptor CXCR4, can form oligomers, but their functional relevance remains poorly understood. This study provides evidence for the role of basal CXCR4 oligomers in lymphoid neoplasms, where they drive pro-survival signaling, migration, and tumor growth. We use a novel nanobody-based BRET method to demonstrate that endogenous CXCR4 constitutively oligomerizes in lymphoid cancer cells, correlating with receptor expression levels. Pharmacological disruption of these oligomers reduces tumor- associated signaling, impairs spheroid growth, and sensitizes patient-derived malignant cells to the apoptosis-inducing drug Venetoclax. Since CXCR4 is frequently overexpressed and potentially clustered in various malignancies, this work offers broader implications for enhancing treatment efficacy, overcoming drug resistance, and potentially reducing side effects across multiple cancer types.">

        <tr id="Specialized memory CD4 T cells that reside long-term within tissues are critical components of immunity at portals of pathogen entry. In the lung, such tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells are activated rapidly after infection and promote local inflammation to control pathogen levels before circulating T cells can respond. However, optimal clearance of Influenza A virus can require TRM and responses by other virus-specific T cells that reach the lung only several days after their activation in secondary lymphoid organs. Whether local CD4 TRM sentinel activity can impact the efficiency of T cell activation in secondary lymphoid organs is not clear. Here, we found that recognition of antigen by influenza -primed TRM in the airways promotes more rapid migration of highly activated antigen-bearing dendritic cells to the draining lymph nodes. This in turn accelerated the priming of naive T cells recognizing the same antigen, resulting in newly activated effector T cells reaching the lungs earlier than in mice not harboring TRM. Our findings thus reveal a circuit linking local and regional immunity whereby antigen recognition by TRM improves effector T cell recruitment to the site of infection though enhancing the efficiency of antigen presentation in the draining lymph node.">

        <tr id="Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play pivotal roles in solid tumor initiation, growth, and immune evasion. However, the optimal biomimetic modeling conditions remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the effects of 2D and 3D culturing conditions on human primary CAFs integrated into a modular tumor microenvironment (TME). Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) and Proteomics’ Proximity Extension Assays, we characterized CAF transcriptomic profiles and cytokine levels. Remarkably, when cultured in 2D, CAFs exhibited a myofibroblast (myCAF) subtype, whereas in 3D tumor spheroid cultures, CAFs displayed a more inflammatory (iCAF) pathological state. By integrating single-cell gene expression data with functional interrogations of critical TME-related processes [natural killer (NK)-mediated tumor killing, monocyte migration, and macrophage differentiation], we were able to reconcile form with function. In 3D TME spheroid models, CAFs enhance cancer cell growth and immunologically shield cells from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, in striking contrast with their 2D TME counterparts. Notably, 3D CAF-secreted proteins manifest a more immunosuppressive profile by enhancing monocyte transendothelial migration and differentiation into M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Our findings reveal a more immunosuppressive and clinically relevant desmoplastic TME model that can be employed in industrial drug discovery campaigns to expand the cellular target range of chemotherapeutics.">

        <tr id="Cellular immunotherapy represents a pivotal treatment modality in clinical practice. Regulatory B cells (Bregs), a key subset of B lymphocytes, hold promise in the management of autoimmune diseases, cancer and transplantation immunity. The expansion of Bregs for cell therapy is a promising strategy to alleviate inflammation and promote immune tolerance. Achieving immune tolerance relies on balance between regulatory and effector cells. One primary objective of cellular therapy is to shift this balance towards Bregs, fostering a more tolerant immune microenvironment. The adoptive transfer of Bregs not only increases their quantity but also modulates the number and function of other immune cells. Maximizing in vitro expansion of Bregs and enhancing their regulatory functions are key focuses in transplant immunology. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the in vitro expansion of IL-10-secreting B cells (B10) remain inadequately understood. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the signaling pathways involved in B10 activation and expansion, as well as to highlight the techniques for in vitro amplification and development of adoptive B10 therapy in transplantation, which aims to advance the field of cellular therapy targeting Bregs.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by its ability to evade the immune system, hindering the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Recent research has highlighted the important role of immunosuppressive macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in driving this immune evasion. In this study, we are the first to identify THEMIS2 as a key regulator of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated immunosuppression in GBM. We found that a high THEMIS2 expression is associated with poor patient outcomes and increased infiltration of immune cells, particularly macrophages. Functional analyses revealed THEMIS2’s critical involvement in immune-related pathways, including immune response activation, mononuclear cell differentiation, and the positive regulation of cytokine production. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing data demonstrated that macrophages with a high THEMIS2 expression were associated with increased phagocytosis, immune suppression, and enhanced tumor growth. These findings suggest that THEMIS2 could serve as both a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for enhancing anti-tumor immunity in GBM.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is regarded as a dysregulated immune response to infections. Recent study showed partially reversal of immunosuppression by trained immunity, which fosters an enhanced immune response towards a secondary challenge. However, the role of trained immunity in sepsis has not been fully understood. Methods We profiled the characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from septic patients using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. Murine double-hit models (pretreatment or post-treatment of β-glucan in septic mice) and murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 were used then. Results scRNA-seq revealed that Ring finger protein 146 (RNF146) and protein kinase B (Akt) were downregulated in the immunosuppression period of septic patients and were verified to be decreased in bone marrow and spleen monocytes from septic mice. While β-glucan pretreatment improved the immunosuppressed state in septic mice and increased dectin-1/Akt/RNF146 expressions in monocytes, along with the increased survival rate, inflammatory factors and aerobic glycolysis, indicating a change from immunosuppression to immune training. Moreover, RNF146 regulated dectin-1-Akt-mTOR signaling in the trained immune state of murine monocyte/macrophage RAW264.7 cell line and the expression of RNF146 was dependent on dectin-1-Akt activation. The inhibition of dectin-1 by its antagonist laminarin downregulated Akt-RNF146 signaling and partially reversed β-glucan induced trained immunity in septic mice. Conclusion RNF146 and Akt are downregulated in the immunosuppression period of sepsis, while increased after β-glucan pretreatment induced trained immunity in septic mice. Moreover, RNF146 regulates the immune trained state of monocyte through dectin-1-Akt-mTOR pathway, suggesting a possible target in reversal of immunosuppression in sepsis.">

 Secretory IgA (sIgA) is critical for the maintenance of the mucosal barrier function, preventing bacterial translocation and reducing the risk of chronic inflammation. Several decades of research have revealed a dysregulation of the B-cell compartment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of yet unknown origin1,2. While increased serum levels of (auto)antibodies against S. cerevisiae or the intestinal M-cell expressed FimH receptor glycoprotein 2 (GP2) are observed in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD)3, some studies indicated an impaired generation of intestinal immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells (PCs)4. To unravel the role of mucosal humoral immunity in CD pathogenesis, we aimed to provide an in-depth characterisation of colonic PC differentiation in patients with CD.



 In-depth phenotyping of patients with CD in remission and non-IBD controls (hospitalised normals) was performed using multi-omics analyses (spatial single-cell proteomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) of plasma or colon biopsy samples. Colonic switched memory B cells (sMBCs) were sorted from lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMNCs) by magnetic-activated cell sorting and ex vivo differentiated into PCs. The impact of mitochondrial function on colonic PC maturation was studied in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V-deficient ATP8 mutant mice and mice that underwent nutritional intervention.



 Despite a hyperactive colonic B-cell compartment, patients with CD displayed significantly diminished mucosal dimeric IgA (dIgA) and fecal IgA compared to non-IBD controls. Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) expression did not differ, excluding a defective epithelial transcytosis of dIgA. Spatial single-cell proteomics uncovered that colonic plasmablasts and immature CD19+CD45+ PCs were increased at the expense of the fully mature CD19-CD45- phenotype. Consistently, PCs generated ex vivo from CD-derived sMBCs revealed impaired capacity to differentiate into IgA-secreting PCs. Metabolic phenotyping indicated a colonic mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with CD that was also reflected in colonic PCs by increased expression of the cell-surface NADase CD38 in concert with decreased expression of mitochondrially encoded transcripts. Of note, splenic PCs isolated from ATP8 mutant mice displayed a hyperproliferative and low-differentiated phenotype, while colonic IgA-secreting PCs were reduced. Conversely, feeding mice an isocaloric glucose-free, high-protein diet, which promotes mitochondrial activity, increased colonic IgA levels.



 In summary, this study links mitochondrial dysfunction to impaired PC differentiation in patients with CD, resulting in reduced levels of sIgA and thereby compromised mucosal barrier integrity.

        <tr id="Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is a debilitating pulmonary disorder that occurs due to persistent exposure to beryllium (Be) particles in the workplace. Be-exposure causes activation of the innate immune system, resulting in the secretion of interleukins and chemokines that drive the accumulation of B and T cells in the lungs. However, the mechanisms by which innate molecules influence the recruitment of B cells and B cell-mediated protection in CBD are poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiple approaches to examine the role of innate immune signaling and CD4+ T cells in B cell recruitment and function in the lungs. We show that the absence or blocking of IL-1R1 signaling prevents the recruitment of B cells to the lungs of BeO-exposed mice. Additionally, we show that B cell recruitment to the lungs depends on the chemokine receptor, CXCR5, and CD4+ T cells. In BeO-exposed mice, lung B cells down-regulate IgM but showed an increased IgD and CD44 surface expression. Further, RNA sequencing of pulmonary tissue-specific B cells in CBD revealed distinct gene signatures compared to splenic B cells, with increased expression of pathways involved in antigen presentation, tight junction interactions, and interferon signaling. Overall, our study shows that B cell recruitment and aggregate formation during CBD depend on sequential activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.">

Here, single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is performed to map the landscape of immune cells, revealing a neutrophil-driven immunosuppressive program in the lungs of patients with immunosuppressive sepsis. Although immunosuppressive genes are upregulated in different immune cells, only neutrophils dramatically increase in the BALF of patients in immunosuppressive phase of sepsis. Five neutrophil subpopulations in BALF are identified, among which CXCR2+ and CD274 (PD-L1 coding gene)+IL1RN+ neutrophil subpopulations increased significantly during septic immunosuppression. Interestingly, a developmental trajectory from CXCR2+ to CD274+IL1RN+ neutrophil subpopulation is disclosed. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of CXCR2 blockade is observed on the survival of septic mice, along with a decreased number of PD-L1+ neutrophils. Taken together, the CXCR2+ neutrophil subpopulation is discovered as a contributor to immunosuppression in sepsis and identified it as a potential therapeutic target in sepsis treatment.">

        <tr id="Cytokines play a crucial role in mediating cell communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages are particularly influential in the regulation of immunosuppressive cytokines, thereby supporting tumor metastasis. The upregulation of Th2 cytokines in cancer cells is recognized for its involvement in suppressing anticancer immunity. However, the association between these cytokines and tumor-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) remains poorly understood. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the connection between tumor-promoting macrophages and melanoma-derived EVs. The analysis from altered cytokine profile data showed that melanoma-derived EVs upregulate Th2 cytokine expression in naïve macrophages, thereby contributing to the promotion of tumor-supporting functions. Notably, many of these cytokines were also found to be upregulated in metastatic melanoma patients (n = 30) compared to healthy controls (n = 33). Overall, our findings suggest a strong connection between melanoma secretory EVs and the induction of tumor-associated macrophages that facilitates the development of an immunosuppressive TME, supporting melanoma metastasis through regulation at both local and systemic levels.">

In their response, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and/or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and trigger the innate immune response. In this study we tested the hypothesis that DAMPs contribute to radiation-induced cellular plasticity in Glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is known to be organized hierarchically with a small number of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) driving treatment resistance and recurrences. Using patient-derived GBM specimens, we employed sphere forming capacity assays and in vitro extreme limiting dilution assays to examine how innate immune receptor signaling impacts the maintenance and self-renewal of GICs. By leveraging an imaging system for putative GICs we determined de novo induction of GICs from non-stem glioma cells. We find that GIC maintenance after irradiation is mediated by cGAS-independent STING signaling, possibly involving signaling through TLR4 and TLR9. Induction of radiation-induced plasticity involves TLR3 signaling, with potential roles for other receptors and processes modulated by MyD88. These findings suggest that targeting innate immune signaling could prevent radiation-induced cellular plasticity for potential therapeutic benefit.">

        <tr id="Respiratory epithelial cells can survive direct infection by influenza viruses, and the long-term consequences of that infection have been characterized in a subset of proximal airway cell types. The impact on the cells that survive viral infection in the distal lung epithelia, however, is much less well-characterized. Utilizing a Cre-expressing influenza B virus (IBV) and a lox-stop-lox tdTomato reporter mouse model, we identified that alveolar type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes, a progenitor cell type in the distal lung, can survive viral infection. We show that survival of infection is associated with transcriptional dysregulation compared to bystander AT2 pneumocytes from the same lung. Furthermore, ex vivo experiments revealed a significant reduction in proliferation rates in survivor AT2 pneumocytes compared to matched, non-directly infected bystander cells. Our findings not only enhance our understanding of the AT2 pneumocyte response to IBV infection but could also have broader implications for the mechanisms of respiratory epithelial repair post-viral infection.


IMPORTANCE
Alveolar type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes are a cell type critical for repair of the distal lung after an injury, such as a viral infection. After epithelial damage, AT2 pneumocytes proliferate for both self-renewal and differentiation into type I pneumocytes to repopulate the epithelium. Theoretically, some of the long-term lung sequelae associated with viral infections could be the result of inappropriate AT2 behavior. Here, the authors report that during an influenza B virus infection, some of the actively infected AT2 pneumocytes can ultimately eliminate all traces of the viral RNA and persist in the host long term. As a consequence of having been infected, however, the cells display an altered transcriptional profile and decreased proliferative capacity. These data together suggest a mechanism for how an acute viral infection can have long-term impacts on the pulmonary system.">

Nevertheless, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), one of the most prevalent complications associated with HSCT, remains a leading contributor to non-relapse mortality. In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the interplay between chemokines and their receptors in the context of acute GVHD. Chemokines exert substantial effects across various pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory processes, tumorigenesis, and metastatic dissemination. In this review, we aim to elucidate the role of chemokines in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD and further understand their potential as diagnostic biomarkers. We also present both preclinical and clinical insights into the application of chemokines in preventing and treating acute GVHD.

        <tr id="Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells are a unique subset of T cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity, displaying potent anti-tumor properties through cytokine secretion, direct cytotoxicity, and recruitment of immune effector cells such as CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Despite their therapeutic potential, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), limits iNKT cell efficacy. Patient-derived organoid (PDO) platforms provide an innovative model for dissecting these complex interactions and evaluating strategies to reinvigorate iNKT cell functionality within the TME. PDOs closely mimic the genetic, phenotypic, and structural characteristics of primary tumors, enabling the study of tumor–immune dynamics. Integrating iNKT cells into PDOs offers a robust platform for investigating CD1d-mediated interactions, Th1-biased immune responses driven by glycolipid analogs like α-GalCer, and combination therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, PDO systems can assess the effects of metabolic modulation, including reducing lactic acid accumulation or targeting glutamine pathways, on enhancing iNKT cell activity. Emerging innovations, such as organoid-on-a-chip systems, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, and multi-omics approaches, further expand the potential of PDO–iNKT platforms for personalized immunotherapy research. Although the application of iNKT cells in PDOs is still undeveloped, these systems hold immense promise for bridging preclinical studies and clinical translation. By addressing the challenges of the TME and optimizing therapeutic strategies, PDO–iNKT platforms offer a transformative avenue for advancing cancer immunotherapy and personalized medicine.">

        <tr id="Background Subjects with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), such as rheumatoid arthritis, with tuberculosis infection (TBI), have a high probability of progressing to tuberculosis disease (TB). We aim to characterize the impact of IMID on the immune response to M. tuberculosis (Mtb) in patients with TBI and TB disease. Methods We enrolled TBI and TB patients with and without IMID. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with Mtb-derived epitopes (MTB300). By flow-cytometry, we identified the Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells as cytokine-producing T cells or as CD25+ CD134+ CD4+ T cells. Memory and activation status of Mtb-specific T cells were assessed by evaluating: CD153, HLA-DR, CD45RA, CD27. Mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) was used to evaluate the ability of PBMCs to inhibit mycobacteria growth. A long-term stimulation assay was used to detect a memory response. Results The IMID status and therapy did not affect the magnitude of response to Mtb-antigen stimulation and the number of responders. TBI-IMID showed a cytokine profile like TBI and TB patients. The Mtb response of TBI-IMID patients was characterized by an effector memory and central memory phenotype as in TBI and TB groups. This memory phenotype allowed the increased IFN-γ production after 6 days of MTB300-stimulation. HLA-DR expression on Mtb-specific T cells was associated with TB, whereas CD153 was associated with TBI status. Finally, the TBI-IMID had an MGIA response like TBI and TB patients. Conclusion IMID condition does not affect key aspects of the immune response to Mtb, such as the cytokine response, memory and activation profile, and the ability to contain the mycobacteria replication. The immunological characterization of the fragile population of TBI-IMID patients is fundamental to understanding the correlation between protection and disease.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by self-antibody production and widespread inflammation affecting various body tissues. This disease is driven by the breakdown of immune tolerance, which promotes the activation of autoreactive B and T cells. A key feature of SLE is dysregulation in antigen presentation, where antigen-presenting cells (APCs) play a central role in perpetuating immune responses. Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly specialized for antigen presentation among APCs. At the same time, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can also express MHC-II molecules, although their role in SLE is less understood. Utilizing the SLE model, MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/J, we determined the presence of different phenotypes of DCs and MDSCs expressing MHC-II in secondary lymphoid organs, along with the gene expression of ICOSL, CD80 and CD86 in the spleen. Our study determined that the most abundant population of APCs in secondary lymphoid organs corresponds to cDC CD103−CD11b+ MHC-II+ throughout SLE development. Additionally, ICOSL expression increased over time, becoming more preponderant in week 16 in the SLE model, which could indicate that it is a crucial pathway for the development and progression of the pathology. In week 16, we observed a positive correlation between M-MDSC MHC-II and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells.">

        <tr id="Background: Immune dysregulation is a component of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Cannabidiol (CBD) has immunomodulatory and putative antidepressant effects. The relationship between apoptotic and exhaustion immune markers and the clinical features of MDD and the effects of CBD on these markers are still unknown. Objectives: To assess pro-apoptotic (CD95) and T cell exhaustion (TIM3) markers on immune cells in patients with MDD, as well as the impact of in vitro CBD administration on these markers. Methods: We recruited healthy controls and MDD patients and evaluated the immunophenotypes of T/B lymphocytes using flow cytometry in unstimulated and anti-CD3/CD28 stimulated conditions. We evaluated the immune profiles of M1 macrophages, T helper (Th)17 cells, immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), T cell proliferation, and immune-related neurotoxicity (IRN). We investigated the in vitro effects of CBD on immune cell subsets at concentrations of 0.1 ug/mL, 1 ug/mL, and 10.0 ug/mL. Results: The stimulated CD3+CD95+ cell percentages were substantially correlated with the number of depressive episodes, recurrence of illness, and suicidal behaviors. The stimulated CD8+TIM-3+ cell percentages were substantially and inversely associated with the M1, IRS, CIRS, T cell growth, and IRN immune profiles. TIM-3+ bearing CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD20+ cells were significantly suppressed by lower CBD concentrations (0.1 to 1 ug/mL). TIM3+ and all CD95+ bearing cells, with the exception of CD3+CD95+, were suppressed by the higher CBD concentrations. Discussion: Aberrations in immune checkpoint molecular processes impact the features of MDD. CBD significantly impacts apoptotic and exhaustion processes thereby possibly interfering with immune homeostasis.">

We systematically analyzed an established immunotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), by assessing 348,905 single-cell transcriptomes from 74 longitudinal bone marrow samples of 25 patients with relapsed leukemia; a subset was evaluated by both protein- and transcriptome-based spatial analysis. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) DLI responders, we identified clonally expanded ZNF683+ CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes with in vitro specificity for patient-matched AML. These cells originated primarily from the DLI product and appeared to coordinate antitumor immune responses through interaction with diverse immune cell types within the marrow microenvironment. Nonresponders lacked this cross-talk and had cytotoxic T lymphocytes with elevated TIGIT expression.

 Oncostatin M (OSM) is a cytokine linked to inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where it contributes to inflammation, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis. Despite its established role, the specific signals driving OSM expression in colitis remain unclear.



 Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were differentiated using M-CSF and stimulated for 36 hours with a range of Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, and bacterial lysates. OSM secretion was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). To dissect key signaling pathways, we applied chemical inhibitors and utilized macrophages derived from gene-deficient mice.



 Myd88-dependent stimuli, including TLR1/2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR4 (LPS), TLR2/6 (FSL-1), TLR7/8 (R848), IL-1α, and IL-33, significantly increased OSM expression in BMDMs. Gram-negative (E. coli, C. rodentium) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) bacterial lysates also enhanced OSM secretion. Pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ further boosted OSM levels, consistent with in vivo findings of OSM upregulation in inflammatory monocytes. Additionally, IL-4, which induces a tissue repair phenotype in macrophages, markedly increased OSM secretion.



 OSM expression in BMDMs is driven by multiple signaling pathways, indicating a synergistic effect of diverse stimuli. Identifying key stimulatory and inhibitory molecules, alongside macrophage-specific knockout analyses, will help clarify the upstream regulators of OSM. Understanding these drivers may uncover new therapeutic targets in IBD and offer insights into the onset of fibrotic processes.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Tumour-infiltrating T cells can mediate both antitumour immunity and promote tumour progression by creating an immunosuppressive environment. This dual role is especially relevant in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), characterised by a unique microenvironment and limited success with current immunotherapy.


OBJECTIVE
We evaluated T cell responses in patients with advanced HCC by analysing tumours, liver flushes and liver-draining lymph nodes, to understand whether reactive T cell populations could be identified despite the immunosuppressive environment.


DESIGN
T cells isolated from clinical samples were tested for reactivity against predicted neoantigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to evaluate the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of antigen-experienced T cells. Neoantigen-reactive T cells expressing 4-1BB were isolated and characterised through T-cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing.


RESULTS
Bioinformatic analysis identified 542 candidate neoantigens from seven patients. Of these, 78 neoantigens, along with 11 hotspot targets from HCC driver oncogenes, were selected for ex vivo T cell stimulation. Reactivity was confirmed in co-culture assays for 14 targets, with most reactive T cells derived from liver flushes and lymph nodes. Liver flush-derived T cells exhibited central memory and effector memory CD4+ with cytotoxic effector profiles. In contrast, tissue-resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with an exhausted profile were primarily identified in the draining lymph nodes.


CONCLUSION
These findings offer valuable insights into the functional profiles of neoantigen-reactive T cells within and surrounding the HCC microenvironment. T cells isolated from liver flushes and tumour-draining lymph nodes may serve as a promising source of reactive T cells and TCRs for further use in immunotherapy for HCC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Accumulating evidence suggests that phenotype switching of cancer cells is essential for therapeutic resistance. However, the immunological characteristics of drug-induced phenotype-switching melanoma cells (PSMCs) are unknown. We investigated PSMC elimination by host immunity using hyperdifferentiated melanoma model cells derived from murine B16F10 melanoma cells. Exposure of B16F10 cells to staurosporine induced a hyperdifferentiated phenotype associated with transient drug tolerance. Staurosporine-induced hyperdifferentiated B16F10 (sB16F10) cells expressed calreticulin on their surface and were phagocytosed efficiently. Furthermore, the inoculation of mice with sB16F10 cells induced immune responses against tumor-derived antigens. Despite the immunogenicity of sB16F10 cells, they activated the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint system and strongly resisted T cell-mediated tumor destruction. However, in vivo treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors successfully eliminated the tumor. Thus, hyperdifferentiated melanoma cells have conflicting immunological properties – enhanced immunogenicity and immune evasion. Inhibiting the ability of PSMCs to evade T cell-mediated elimination might lead to complete melanoma eradication.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcal-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS) is a clinical worsening or new presentation of cryptococcal disease following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. C-IRIS is primarily driven by an influx of pathological CD4+ T cells, which triggers a hyperinflammatory response. The murine model of C-IRIS is a way to study the disease in mice and understand how the immune system triggers life-threatening outcomes in patients. We previously developed a murine C-IRIS model and demonstrated that C-IRIS is triggered by pathological CD4+ T cells, particularly Th1 cells, in the brain, which triggers neurodegeneration and pulmonary dysfunction. Using this unique mouse model, we tested the therapeutic effect of a star-shaped glatiramer acetate (sGA), which is a more effective isomeric form than linear GA. Here, we observed that sGA suppresses Th1 differentiation in the lung tissues, reducing CD4+ T cell and Th1 cell count. It also reduced microglia populations in the brain. Together, these changes improved respiratory dysfunction caused by C-IRIS, lowered mortality rate, and reduced brain neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that sGA could be an effective therapeutic strategy for managing C-IRIS.">

        <tr id="Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has attained unprecedented clinical success, the tolerance and immune suppression mechanisms evolved by tumor cells and their tumor microenvironment (TME) hinder its maximum anti-cancer potential. Ferroptosis therapy can partially improve the efficacy of ICB, but it is still subject to immune suppression by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the TME. Recent research suggests that an MDSC blockade can unleash the full therapeutic potential of the combined therapy of ferroptosis and ICB in liver cancer treatment. However, whether blocking the intrinsic ferroptosis pathways of MDSCs can relieve imidazole ketone erastin (IKE)-initiated ferroptosis-induced immune suppression and ultimately trigger the optimal therapeutic effect of the combined ferroptosis and ICB therapy is still unknown. Here, we report that TIPE2, a phospholipid transfer protein, regulated the ferroptosis susceptibility in MDSCs through reprogramming lipid peroxidation-related phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) species composition. TIPE2-deficient MDSCs resisted IKE-induced ferroptosis by up-regulating SLC7A11 and GPX4, and dissolved ferroptosis-induced immunosuppressive function by down-regulating lipid ROS whilst encouraging T cell proliferation and infiltration into tumor tissues to improve ferroptosis therapy. More importantly, TIPE2-deficient MDSCs achieved the full anti-tumor therapeutic potential of IKE-induced ferroptosis therapy and a PD-L1 blockade. These findings indicate that TIPE2 confers the ferroptosis sensitivity of MDSCs, and combining the targeting of the TIPE2 of MDSCs, ferroptosis therapy, and ICB is a novel therapeutic option for cancer treatment.">

However, its success is often compromised by allograft rejection, a process in which T helper 17 (Th17) cells play a crucial role. These cells facilitate rejection by enhancing neutrophil infiltration into the graft and by activating endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Additionally, Th17 cells can trigger the activation of other T cell types, including Th1, Th2, and CD8+ T cells, further contributing to rejection. An imbalance between Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) is known to promote rejection. To counteract this, immunosuppressive drugs have been developed to inhibit T cell activity and foster transplant tolerance. Another approach involves the adoptive transfer of regulatory cells, such as Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, to dampen T cell functions. This review primarily focuses on the roles of Th17 cells in rejection and their interactions with other T cell subsets.

        <tr id="Cellular metabolism provides all molecules essential for the cell’s functions including nucleic acids, amino acids and fatty acids, but also energy via glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration (also known as OXPHOS). Viruses hijack these pathways to support the different steps of their replication, making the metabolic state of the infected cell a key factor influencing viral replication. In particular, Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains latent in resting, metabolically inactive CD4 T lymphocytes but actively replicates in activated CD4 T cells. In these cells, enhanced glycolysis and OXPHOS, and access to the major carbon sources such as glucose and glutamine are required for infection. Here, we took advantage of the recently developed Human Plasma-Like Medium (HPLM), that mimics physiological plasma concentration of metabolites, including carbon sources, to investigate how this physiologic environment would modulate HIV-1 infection of primary CD4 T cells. Using CD4 T cells activated in the conventional culture medium (RPMI) or HPLM, we show that HPLM enhanced HIV-1 infection despite similar levels of cell activation, proliferation and expression of viral receptor. Specifically, HPLM increases the reverse transcription step of the HIV-1 replication cycle. In contrast with previous studies performed in RPMI only, this increased infection in HPLM correlated with decreased glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, reflecting the low concentration of glucose and glutamine in this medium. Adjusting glucose and glutamine concentrations in RPMI or decreasing energy metabolism using chemical inhibitors did not increase infection to levels similar to HPLM suggesting that other metabolic pathways are involved. Taken together, this study shows that the metabolic state of activated CD4 T cells in a physiologically relevant environment is more permissive to HIV-1 infection than previously suggested by studies using conventional cell culture media. Our study demonstrates the importance of physiologic culture conditions to study viral infections while also highlighting the importance of non-energetic cell metabolism in HIV-1 infection.">

 Immunotherapies are a transformative force in clinical oncology, delivering prolonged disease-free survival in refractory cancers. However, in the setting of breast malignancies, clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are both low and ephemeral, particularly in the hormone receptor-positive (HR+) subtype. Effective responses are predicated on abundant neoantigens, the activity of immune effector cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the establishment of immunological memory. These prerequisites pose a significant efficacy barrier as BC patients carry low mutational burdens (neoantigens), and T-cells are profoundly hindered by the presence of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Radiotherapy (RT) holds a significant untapped potential to overcome the lack of neoantigens by triggering immunogenic cell death and recruiting adaptive immunity. However, the unavoidable tissue damage and clearance of dead cells by adjacent macrophages further enhance their wound-healing (immunosuppressive) phenotype, dampening the immunogenic potential of RT. Macrophages regulate immune responses through remarkably plastic activation states, including immune-stimulatory (M1) and immune-suppressive (M2). In breast tumors, macrophages undergo a well-documented but poorly understood “M2-education” process that facilitates immune evasion, utilizing a myriad of immune modulators (hormones, cytokines, and enzymes). Collectively, these dependencies highlight a tremendous therapeutic potential for combining RT with strategies that recover the M1 phenotype of TAMs, creating immune-supportive TME. Despite the potential, modulating TAM activities has proven exceptionally challenging, primarily due to the pleiotropic nature of their suppressive functions and the lack of scalable TME models to enable high-throughput target discovery. To overcome these limitations, we developed a scalable platform that recreates the breast TME at scale and phenotypic fidelity. This model contains the major BC constituents, including macrophages, tumor cells, and their supporting stroma, while preserving the functions, transcriptional programs, cell-cell interactions, and typical spatial organization. To identify reprogramming targets in TAMs, we performed a CRISPR screen utilizing Arg1 (a hallmark M2 marker) as a surrogate marker. Our screen exposed targets that convert immunosuppressive (M2) TAMs into immunostimulatory (M1) macrophages in established tumors. In vivo data show that TAM reprogramming is remarkably effective, promoting tumor regression and abscopal effect in HR+ and ovarian cancers. Reprogrammed TAMs enhanced responses to ICI and radiotherapy, a path we plan to optimize for future clinical development as “first-in-human” trials. Interventions that re-potentiate innate and adaptive immunities can benefit cancer patients, particularly those with limited therapeutic options. Our findings pioneer an actionable roadmap to unlock the full therapeutic potential of RT and immunotherapies in refractory human cancers.

        <tr id="Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection induces chronic immune activation by stimulating both the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in persistent inflammation and immune cell exhaustion. Of note, the modulation of cytokine production and its release can significantly influence the immune response. Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are cytokines that play a crucial role in innate immunity due to their potent antiviral effects, regulation of IFN-stimulated genes essential for viral clearance, and the initiation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, an understanding of the dual role of IFN-I (protective versus harmful) during HIV-1 infections and elucidating its contributions to HIV pathogenesis is crucial for advancing HIV therapeutic interventions. This review therefore delves into the intricate involvement of IFN-I in both the acute and chronic phases of HIV infection and emphasizes its impact on viral persistence, immune activation, and immunometabolism in treated HIV-infected individuals.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is mostly refractory to immunotherapy due to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and cancer cell-intrinsic T cell tolerance mechanisms. PDAC is described as a “cold” tumor type with poor infiltration by T cells and factors leading to intratumoral T cell suppression have thus received less attention. Here, we identify a cancer cell-intrinsic mechanism that contributes to a T cell-resistant phenotype and describes potential combinatorial therapy. Methods We used an unbiased screening approach of T cell resistant and sensitive murine KPC (KrasLSL-G12D/+; Trp53fl/fl; Ptf1aCre/+) PDAC cells in a three-dimensional co-culture platform with syngeneic antigen-educated T cells to identify potential cell-intrinsic drivers of T cell suppression in PDAC. Comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed to reveal promising candidates that mediate resistance to T cells. We investigated their contribution by shRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacological inhibition in murine in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as in patient-derived organoids (PDOs). A combination of transcriptomic analyses, cytometric and immunohistochemistry techniques allowed us to validate the underlying T cell response phenotypes of PDAC cells. The action of TGM2 via interaction with tubulin and the impact of microtubule dynamics and vesicle trafficking were evaluated by protein analyses and live-cell imaging. Correlation analyses via TCGA data complemented the functional studies. Results We identified transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) as a mediator of T cell suppression in PDAC. We report that high levels of TGM2 expression in patients’ tumors correlate with immunosuppressive signatures and poor overall survival. We found that TGM2 regulates vesicle trafficking by modulating microtubule network density and dynamics in pancreatic cancer cells, thus facilitating the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, which impair effector T cell functionality. In TGM2-expressing PDOs, pharmacological TGM2 inhibition or treatment with nocodazole increased T cell-mediated apoptosis. Also, pretreatment of TGM2high PDOs with sublethal doses of the spindle poisons paclitaxel or vincristine increased CD8+T cell activation and sensitized PDOs toward T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Conclusions These findings indicate that targeting microtubular function therapeutically may enhance antitumor T cell responses by impacting activity of immunosuppressive cytokines in the PDAC microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Tissue-repair regulatory T cells (trTregs) comprise a specialized cell subset essential for tissue homeostasis and repair. While well-studied in sterile injury models, their role in infection-induced tissue damage and antimicrobial immunity is less understood. We investigated trTreg dynamics during acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection, marked by extensive tissue damage and strong CD8+ immunity. Unlike sterile injury models, trTregs significantly declined in secondary lymphoid organs and non-lymphoid target tissues during infection, correlating with systemic and local tissue damage, and downregulation of function-associated genes in skeletal muscle. This decline was linked to decreased systemic IL-33 levels, a key trTreg growth factor, and promoted by the Th1 cytokine IFN-γ. Early recombinant IL-33 treatment increased trTregs, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, and parasite-specific CD8+ cells at specific time points after infection, leading to reduced tissue damage, lower parasite burden, and improved disease outcome. Our findings not only provide novel insights into trTregs during infection but also highlight the potential of optimizing immune balance by modulating trTreg responses to promote tissue repair while maintaining effective pathogen control during infection-induced injury.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), recognized for their self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capabilities, have garnered considerable wide attention since their discovery in bone marrow. Recent studies have underscored the potential of MSCs in immune regulation, particularly in the context of autoimmune diseases, which arise from immune system imbalances and necessitate long-term treatment. Traditional immunosuppressive drugs, while effective, can lead to drug tolerance and adverse effects, including a heightened risk of infections and malignancies. Consequently, adjuvant therapy incorporating MSCs has emerged as a promising new treatment strategy, leveraging their immunomodulatory properties. This paper reviews the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs and their application in autoimmune diseases, highlighting their potential to regulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. The immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs are primarily mediated through direct cell contact and paracrine activity with immune cells. This review lays the groundwork for the broader clinical application of MSCs in the future and underscores their significant scientific value and application prospects. Further research is expected to enhance the efficacy and safety of MSCs-based treatments for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Infectious agents have closely interacted with the human immune system, acquiring a set of highly sophisticated mechanisms for modulating immunity. One of the survival strategies for viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths and fungi is to target the regulatory T cell network (Treg: CD4+CD25hiCD127-) that controls immunopathogenic responses in many infections. Not only pathogens but also commensals are able to directly induce the conversion of naive T cells into suppressive Foxp3-expressing Tregs, while others activate pre-existing natural Tregs, in both cases suppressing pathogen-specific effector responses. However, Tregs can also contribute to immunity under certain conditions, such as at the initial stages of infection when effector cells must gain access to the site of infection, and subsequently in ensuring the generation of effector memory cells. It is noteworthy that currently little information on whether infections selectively drive pathogen-specific Tregs, and if so, whether such cells are also reactive to autoantigens are available. Further analysis of Treg subset specificity, along with a clearer picture of relative dynamics during the disease, should lead to rational strategies of immune intervention to optimize immunity and eliminate the infectious process. Thus, restoration of Treg function is important in the treatment of infectious, autoimmune and other diseases and can serve as a marker of their successful treatment. The article assesses the effect of exometabolites of derived from permafrost Bacillus bacteria obtained at different temperature conditions of their cultivation on the activity of Treg and effector T lymphocyte differentiation. Significant differences were established: secondary microbial exometabolites affect Treg (CD4+CD25hiCD127-) differentiation and expression of activation markers (CD69, CD25, HLA-DR) on CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. This effect is regulated by the type of metabolites obtained at different temperatures - "cold" (obtained at 5°C of bacterial incubation), "medium-temperature" (at 22°C) and "heat" (at 37°C) metabolites. In this case, an increase in the Treg level is associated with lower differentiation activity of CD4+ T-lymphocytes exposed to “cold” secondary exometabolites, a decrease in the differentiation activity of CD8+ T-lymphocytes treated with “warm” secondary exometabolites, and a roughly equivalent effect on the differentiation activity of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes acted upon by “medium-temperature” secondary exometabolites.">

While these therapies are primarily known for their direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, accumulating evidence indicates that they also influence the tumor microenvironment (TME), by altering the cytokine milieu and recruiting additional effector populations to help orchestrate the antitumor immune response. Conversely, the TME itself can modulate the behaviour of these therapies within the host by either supporting or inhibiting their activity. In this review we provide an overview of clinical and preclinical data on the bidirectional influences between T cell therapies and the TME. Unravelling the interactions between T cell-based therapies and the TME is critical for a better understanding of their mechanisms of action, resistance, and toxicity, with the goal of optimizing efficacy and safety.">

        <tr id="Immunometabolism is an emerging field that explores the intricate interplay between immune cells and metabolism. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which maintain immune homeostasis in immunometabolism, play crucial regulatory roles. The activation, differentiation, and function of Tregs are influenced by various metabolic pathways, such as the Mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and glycolysis. Correspondingly, activated Tregs can reciprocally impact these metabolic pathways. Tregs also possess robust adaptive capabilities, thus enabling them to adapt to various microenvironments, including the tumor microenvironment (TME). The complex mechanisms of Tregs in metabolic diseases are intriguing, particularly in conditions like MASLD, where Tregs are significantly upregulated and contribute to fibrosis, while in diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), they show downregulation and reduced anti-inflammatory capacity. These phenomena suggest that the differentiation and function of Tregs are influenced by the metabolic environment, and imbalances in either can lead to the development of metabolic diseases. Thus, moderate differentiation and inhibitory capacity of Tregs are critical for maintaining immune system balance. Given the unique immunoregulatory abilities of Tregs, the development of targeted therapeutic drugs may position them as novel targets in immunotherapy. This could contribute to restoring immune system balance, resolving metabolic dysregulation, and fostering innovation and progress in immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Familial platelet disorder (FPD) is associated with germline RUNX1 mutations, establishing a preleukemic state and increasing the risk of developing leukemia. Currently, there are no intervention strategies to prevent leukemia progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (n = 10) combined with functional analysis of samples from patients with RUNX1-FPD (n > 75) revealed that FPD hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) displayed increased myeloid differentiation and suppressed megakaryopoiesis because of increased activation of prosurvival and inflammatory pathways. Bone marrow from patients with RUNX1-FPD contained an elevated cytokine milieu, exerting chronic inflammatory stress on HSPCs. RUNX1-FPD HSPCs were myeloid biased, had increased self-renewal, and were resistant to inflammation-mediated exhaustion. The bone marrow from patients with RUNX1-FPD showed high transcript and protein expression of CD74 at the preleukemic stage compared with that of healthy controls, which remained high upon patient transformation into leukemia. Further, CD74-mediated signaling was exaggerated in RUNX1-FPD HSPCs compared with healthy controls, leading to the activation of mTOR and JAK/STAT pathways with increased cytokine production. Genetic and pharmacological targeting of CD74 with ISO-1 and its downstream targets JAK1/2 and mTOR reversed RUNX1-FPD differentiation defects in vitro and in vivo and reduced inflammation. Our results highlight that inflammation is an early event in RUNX1-FPD pathogenesis, and CD74 signaling is one of the drivers of this inflammation. The repurposing of JAK1/2i (ruxolitinib) and mTORi (sirolimus) and promoting the advancement of CD74 inhibitors in clinical settings as an early intervention strategy would be beneficial to improve the phenotype of patients with RUNX1-FPD and prevent myeloid progression.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a distinct type of stress-induced regulated cell death that can lead to adaptive immune responses and the establishment of immunological memory. ICD exhibits both similarities and differences when compared to apoptosis and other non-apoptotic forms of regulated cell death (RCD). The interplay between ICD-mediated immunosurveillance against cancer and the ability of cancer cells to evade ICD influences the host-tumor immunological interaction. Consequently, the restoration of ICD and the development of effective strategies to induce ICD have emerged as crucial considerations in the treatment of cancer within the context of immunotherapy. To enhance comprehension of ICD in the setting of cancer, this paper examines the interconnected responsive pathways associated with ICD, the corresponding biomarkers indicative of ICD, and the mechanisms through which tumors subvert ICD. Additionally, this review explores strategies for reinstating ICD and the therapeutic potential of harnessing ICD in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with gastrectomy being the primary treatment option. Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, may influence tumor growth by creating an immunosuppressive environment conducive to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Here, the effect of abdominal infection on tumor growth and metastasis was investigated through the implementation of a peritoneal metastasis model and a subcutaneous tumor model. In a murine model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to simulate the effects of sepsis, we observed significant immune dysregulation, including T-cell exhaustion and the release of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). This immune alteration was associated with increased programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression on T cells and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on MDSCs within the tumor microenvironment, fostering an immune-suppressive environment. Polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) expressing elevated PD-L1 after sepsis demonstrated more substantial suppressive effects on T-cell proliferation than controls. Treatment with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies successfully restored T-cell function, reduced mortality, and decreased metastasis in CLP mice. These findings emphasize the impact of sepsis on tumor progression and suggest targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as a potential therapeutic strategy for managing immune dysfunction in patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Natural killer (NK) cells are integral components of the innate immune system, serving a vital function in eliminating virally infected cells. This review highlights the significance of CXCR5+ NK cells in the context of chronic HIV/SIV infection and viral control.


RECENT FINDINGS
Controlled HIV/SHIV infection results in a substantial increase in the population of CXCR5+ NK cells within the B-cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). These CXCR5+ NK cells display enhanced functional characteristics, including elevated expression of activation markers and increased cytokine production, which are essential for effective viral control. These follicular NK cells are shown to be enriched in IL-15 signaling, and CXCR5 NK cells are negatively associated with viral burden during chronic HIV and SHIV infection.


SUMMARY
The distinct phenotypic and functional attributes of CXCR5+ NK cells, particularly in the lymphoid tissues of individuals living with HIV, emphasize their critical contribution to the anti-HIV-1 immune response. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and roles of CXCR5+ NK cells may present novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing NK-mediated viral control.">

 Resident intestinal macrophages play a key role in maintaining gut homeostasis and exhibit a hypoactive tolerogenic phenotype. Recently, several subsets of intestinal macrophages have been identified based on CD11c expression which differ in their inflammatory and functional profiles. Notably, pro-inflammatory CD11c+ monocyte-like macrophages are found elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). These cells are recruited from blood monocytes via the CCR2/CCL2 chemokine pathway. Our study is focused on observing the patterns of CCL2-driven blood monocyte migration and their translation into subsets of intestinal tissue macrophages that can determine the degree of gut inflammation in newly diagnosed patients.



 Patients referred with suspected IBD were seen in an inception clinic. Intestinal biopsies and matched blood samples were obtained from pre-treatment UC and CD patients during their index colonoscopy. Those with inflammation excluded during this procedure formed a ‘non-IBD’ control group. Biopsy segments were cultured to generate conditioned media and also digested for flow cytometry analysis. Plasma concentrations of CCL2 and intestinal secretome were measured using ELISA or Olink proteomic analysis respectively. Efficacy of blood monocyte chemotaxis towards CCL2 was assessed in the presence or absence of CCL2/CCR2 antagonists and the profile of monocyte subsets in whole blood were determined using whole blood flow cytometry analysis.



 As previously described, we observed distinct CD11c+ and CD11c- macrophage populations in IBD intestinal tissue, with expansion of the CD11c+ subset within inflamed regions which expressed higher levels of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1. Higher concentrations of CCL2 were observed in conditioned media from inflamed IBD tissue compared to non-inflamed regions and this correlated with elevated numbers of circulating blood monocytes. Chemotaxis assays revealed a corresponding increase in CCL2-induced monocyte migration in patients with IBD compared to the ‘non-IBD’ control group.



 Our study provides further insights into the role of the CCL2/CCR2 chemokine axis in driving monocyte recruitment and their differentiation into pro-inflammatory intestinal macrophages in IBD. We demonstrate that inflamed intestinal regions exhibit elevated levels of CCL2 correlating with an expansion of the CD11c⁺ macrophage subset and increased CCL2-driven monocyte migration in these subjects. These findings underscore the significance of targeting the CCL2/CCR2 pathway and that it might be an important driver in the development IBD.

        <tr id="The precise mechanisms by which the complement system contributes to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and promotes tumor progression remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of complement C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) in human and mouse cancer-associated dendritic cells (DCs). First, we observed an overexpression of C5aR1 in tumor-infiltrating DCs, compared to DCs from blood or spleen. C5aR1 expression was restricted to type 2 conventional DCs (cDC2) and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), which displayed a tolerogenic phenotype capable of inhibiting T-cell activation and promoting tumor growth. C5aR1 engagement in DCs drove their migration from tumors to tumor-draining lymph nodes, where C5a levels were higher. We used this knowledge to optimize an anticancer therapy aimed at enhancing DC activity. In three syngeneic tumor models, C5aR1 inhibition significantly enhanced the efficacy of poly I:C, a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist, in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. The contribution of C5aR1 inhibition to the antitumor activity of the combination treatment relied on type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s) and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, required lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs, and was associated with an increase in interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of the C5a/C5aR1 axis in the biology of cancer-associated DCs and provides compelling evidence for the therapeutic potential of modulating the complement system to enhance DC-mediated immune responses against tumors.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Metastasis is the major cause of cancer‐related mortality. The premetastatic niche is a promising target for its prevention. However, the generality and cellular dynamics in premetastatic niche formation have remained unclear. Aims This study aimed to elucidate the generality and cellular dynamics in premetastatic niche formation. Materials and Methods We performed comprehensive flow cytometric analysis of lung and peripheral immune cells at three time points (early premetastatic, late premetastatic, and micrometastatic phases) for mice with subcutaneous implants of three types of cancer cells (breast cancer, lung cancer, or melanoma cells). The immuno‐cell profiles were then used to predict the metastatic phase by machine learning. Results We found a common pattern of changes in both lung and peripheral immune cell profiles across the three cancer types, including a decrease in the proportion of eosinophils in the early premetastatic phase, an increase in that of regulatory T cells in the late premetastatic phase, and an increase in that of polymorphonuclear myeloid‐derived suppressor cells and a decrease in that of B cells in the micrometastatic phase. Machine learning using immune cell profiles could predict the metastatic phase with approximately 75% accuracy. Discussion Validation of our findings in humans will require data on the presence or absence of micrometastases in patients and the accumulation of comprehensive and temporal information on immune cells. In addition, blood proteins, extracellular vesicles, DNA, RNA, or metabolites may be useful for more accurate prediction. Conclusion The discovery of generalities in premetastatic niche formation allow prediction of metastatic phase and provide a basis for the development of methods for early detection and prevention of cancer metastasis in a cancer type‐independent manner.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has revolutionized treatment for a wide variety of cancers yet its use has been relatively limited in childhood malignancies. With the introduction of bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE®) and chimeric antigen T-cell receptor technologies, previously refractory patients have attained remission, including molecularly negative states of disease, thus providing the possibility of long-term cure. Blinatumomab is a widely available CD3-CD19 BiTE that has dramatically changed the landscape of therapy for some children with precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphomas. Challenges remain with using BiTE in a broader population although the appeal of now-confirmed reduced toxicity and deeper molecular remissions suggests that this approach will be an essential part of future treatment of childhood B-ALL. Herein, we review some of the pertinent literature covering clinical trials with blinatumomab and address future approaches and combination trials including BiTE.">

        <tr id="Kirsten Rat Sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) is one of the most frequent oncogenes. However, there are limited treatment options due to its intracellular expression. To address this, we developed a novel bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody targeting HLA-A2/KRAS G12V complex and CD3 (HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE). We examined its specific binding to tumor cells and T cells, as well as its anti-tumor effects in vivo. HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE was expressed in Escherichia coli and its binding affinities to CD3 and HLA-A2/KRAS G12V were measured by flow cytometry, along with T-cell activation. In a xenograft pancreatic tumor model, the HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE's anti-tumor effects were assessed through tumor growth, survival time, and safety. Our results demonstrated specific binding of HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE to tumor cells with an HLA-A2/KRAS G12V mutation and T cells. The HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE also activated T-cells in the presence of tumor cells in vitro. HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE in vivo testing showed delayed tumor growth without severe toxicity to major organs and prolonged mouse survival. This study highlights the potential of constructing BiTEs recognizing an HLA-peptide complex and providing a novel therapy for cancer treatment targeting the intracellular tumor antigen.">

Autoreactive memory B cells contribute to chronic and progressive courses in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The efficacy of belimumab (BEL), the first approved biologic treatment for SLE and lupus nephritis (LN), is generally attributed to depletion of activated naïve B cells and inhibition of B cell activation. BEL's effect on memory B cells (MBCs) is currently unexplained. We performed an in-depth cellular and transcriptomic analysis of BEL's impact on the blood MBC compartment in patients with SLE.


METHODS
A retrospective meta-analysis was conducted, pooling flow cytometry data from four randomized trials involving 1245 patients with SLE treated with intravenous BEL or placebo. Then, extensive MBC phenotyping was performed using high-sensitivity flow cytometry in patients with mild/moderate SLE and severe SLE/LN treated with subcutaneous BEL. Finally, transcriptomic characterization of surging MBCs was performed by single-cell RNA sequencing.


RESULTS
In BEL-treated patients, a significant increase in circulating MBCs, in a broad range of MBC subsets, was established at week 2, gradually returning to baseline by week 52. The increase was most prominent in patients with higher SLE disease activity, serologically active patients, and patients aged ≤18 years. MBCs had a non-proliferating phenotype with a prominent decrease in activation status and downregulation of numerous migration genes.


CONCLUSION
Upon BEL initiation, an increase of MBCs was firmly established. In the small cohort investigated, circulating MBCs were de-activated, non-proliferative, and demonstrated characteristics of disrupted lymphocyte trafficking, expanding on our understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of B cell-activating factor inhibition by BEL.

To report safety and efficacy of CD19-targeting CAR T cells in a child with refractory juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We describe the case of a 12-year-old Caucasian boy with severe, chronically active JDM, refractory to multiple immunosuppressive treatment lines, including B-cell depletion with rituximab. The patient received a single infusion of fresh, autologous, second-generation anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product (lentiviral vector) manufactured on the Prodigy device (1x106 CAR T cells/kg), after lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide (1000 mg/m2 over 2 days) and fludarabine (90 mg/m2 over 3 days). Immunosuppressive and glucocorticoid treatment were withdrawn before leukapheresis and CAR T-cell infusion.


RESULTS
Before anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, the patient had persistent severe skin and muscular disease activity. CAR T cells expanded significantly (peak at day 7, 32.69 cells/μL). Complete B-cell depletion was documented on day 5 in blood and at week 2 in bone marrow. The patient presented fever as part of mild cytokine release syndrome (G1), transient anemia (G2) and neutropenia (G4). Neither infection nor neurotoxicity were observed. Laboratory tests, MRI imaging, Physician's Global Assessment of disease activity (PGA), Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) and Cutaneous Assessment Tool for myositis (CAT) were performed at baseline and follow-up to assess treatment response, showing remarkable progressive improvement that persists over time, even after B-cell recovery.


CONCLUSIONS
This JDM patient with severe chronic disease, refractory to multiple treatments, achieved sustained B-cell depletion and ongoing immunosuppressive drug-free clinical and radiological improvement eight months after a single infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells.">

        <tr id="e19527 Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy caused by the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant plasma cells. Bispecific T Cell engagers (BiTEs) are a novel class of drugs currently assessed in the setting of relapsed/refractory MM. BiTEs are designed to target specific antigenic epitopes on the surface of plasma cells and CD3 on T cells. The plasma cell targets include B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), G protein coupled receptor, class C, group 5, member D (GPRC5D) and Fc receptor homolog 5 (FcRH5). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive review of the available literature including abstracts and full publications using PubMed/Scopus through Dec 31, 2023. We found 23 studies which include BCMA agents: teclistamab (Tec), elranatamab, linvoseltamab, pavurutamab, and alnuctamab; and non-BCMA targets including: GPRC5D, talquetamab (Tal) and FcRH5, cevostamab, as well as combination therapies including a BiTE, specifically Tec+Tal and Tal+daratumumab (Tal+D). A pooled analysis based on the Welch's test was then performed on all BiTEs to compare the safety profile of each agent. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was also applied to cluster 23 BiTEs based on their AEs. Results: We found a cohort of 1899 patients with MM across 23 studies. 1094 individuals underwent treatment involving BCMAs. 677 were subjected to non-BCMA anti-agents. 65 participants received Tec + Tal and 63 patients received Tal+D. The median follow-up duration for both BCMA BiTE and non-BCMA BiTE groups extended to 9 and 14 months. When analyzing hematological AEs of any grade, neutropenia and anemia affected 44% of patients and lymphopenia 40%. Respiratory infections manifested in 44%. CRS (Cytokine Release Syndrome) was reported in 64%. Dysgeusia was reported in only non-BCMA at 53%. Grade 3+ AEs were as follows: neutropenia at 40%, infections at 18%, CRS at 2%, anemia at 28%, and lymphopenia at 45%. Upon conducting a comprehensive pooled analysis, subtle disparities emerged between BCMA and non-BCMA BiTEs. More instances of CRS and CRS with Tocilizumab occurred with BCMA BiTEs vs non-BCMA BiTes, P < 0.024. Friedman's findings emphasized substantial distinctions between BCMA and non-BCMA agents for both overall and severe G3+ AEs (p < 0.0001). t-SNE was applied to examine the clustering patterns among agents across all grades and grades 3+ AEs. The findings revealed that agents with all grades and grades 3+ showed similar clustering patterns except for one agent. Conclusions: The use of BiTEs in MM has demonstrated remarkable efficacy; however, these have been linked to a unique AE profile. Our results showed that non-BCMA were associated with less hematotoxicity (combined G3+ AEs and hypogammaglobulinemia), whereas BCMA BiTEs were associated with less CRS rates. This is important information for treatment selection and mitigation strategy development aiming to optimize patient outcomes.">

B cell depletion therapy with rituximab is effective in most patients with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) but requires repeated cycles to prevent disease flares. We here aimed to assess B cells after rituximab to predict relapse of IgG4-RD and guide retreatment.


METHODS
Patients with active IgG4-RD included in this retrospective study fulfilled the ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria. Total CD19+ B cells, plasmablasts, naïve and memory B cells were measured on peripheral blood by flow-cytometry at baseline and six months after rituximab. All patients were treated with two 1 g infusions of rituximab 15 days apart and monitored for 48 months. Disease response was assessed using the IgG4-RD Responder Index.


RESULTS
Thirty-three patients were included. Six months after rituximab, disease response was observed in all patients. Complete depletion of CD19+ B cells, plasmablasts, naïve and memory B cell depletion was achieved in 30%, 55%, 39%, and 42% of cases, respectively. Twenty-three relapses (70%) were observed at a median time of 24 months after rituximab. Relapse rate was significantly higher in patients who failed to achieve complete depletion of CD19+ cells (60% vs 17%, p= 0.02), naïve B cells (54% vs 15%, p= 0.01), or memory B cells (50% vs 16%, p= 0.03) six months after rituximab. The median relapse free survival time was shorter in patients who failed to achieve complete depletion of CD19+ cells (19 vs 38 months, p= 0.02), naïve B cells (16 vs 38 months, p= 0.01), or memory B cells (19 vs 38 months, p= 0.03) six months after rituximab.


CONCLUSIONS
The degree of B cell depletion six months after rituximab may predict disease flare and may instruct on the pacing of B cell depletion therapy in IgG4-RD.">

        <tr id="While chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of B-cell malignancies, many patients relapse and therefore strategies to improve antitumor immunity are needed. We previously designed a novel autologous bispecific CAR targeting CD19 and CD22 (CAR19-22), which was well tolerated and associated with high response rates but relapse was common. Interleukin-15 (IL15) induces proliferation of diverse immune cells and can augment lymphocyte trafficking. Here, we report the results of a phase 1 clinical trial of the first combination of a novel recombinant polymer-conjugated IL15 receptor agonist (NKTR-255), with CAR19-22, in adults with relapsed / refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Eleven patients were enrolled, nine of whom successfully received CAR19-22 followed by NKTR-255. There were no dose limiting toxicities, with transient fever and myelosuppression as the most common possibly related toxicities. We observed favorable efficacy with eight out of nine patients (89%) achieving measurable residual disease negative remission. At 12 months, progression-free survival for NKTR-255 was double that of historical controls (67% vs 38%). We performed correlative analyses to investigate the effects of IL15 receptor agonism. Cytokine profiling showed significant increases in IL15 and the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. The increase in chemokines was associated with decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts and CD8+ CAR T-cells in blood and ten-fold increases in CSF CAR-T cells, suggesting lymphocyte trafficking to tissue. Combining NKTR-255 with CAR19-22 was safe, feasible and associated with high rates of durable responses (NCT03233854).">

        <tr id="7040 Background: CN201 is a novel CD19-targeting T-cell-engager IgG4 bispecific antibody, designed to reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) while retaining potent T-cell mediated cytotoxicities. A silenced Fc fragment was used to prevent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity while prolonging half-life of the molecule. Here, we report results of the phase I study of CN201 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma (R/R B-NHL) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06189391). Methods: The i3+3 dose-escalation design was used in adult patients with CD19+ R/R B-NHL to investigate safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary anti-tumor activity. Patients with R/R DLBCL who failed≧2 prior lines of therapy, or R/R indolent NHL(iNHL) who had at least 1 prior systemic therapy were eligible for enrollment. Patients received CAR-T therapy can be enrolled after 90 days washout periord provided that CD19 was still positive on tumor cells. Response were evaluated according to the Lugano 2014 criteria. Single-agent CN201 was administered intravenously once per week. Intial dose escalation was conducted in the patients at fixed ascending doses; later, a step-up dosing regimen was adopted, including a priming dose on cycle 1 Day 1 followed by an intermediate dose on Day 8 and the target dose administered on Day 15 and thereafter. Results: As of December 29, 2023, 58 adult patients received CN201, including 19 patients with fixed doses from 2.5μg to 600μg, 39 patients with step-up doses from 1.2mg to 40mg of the target doses. Maximum tolerated dose has not been reached. The most common treatment-related adverse effects (AEs) (≥20%) of any grade were white blood cell decreased (32%), neutropenia (30%), lymphopenia (29%), anemia (29%), pyrexia (25%) and platelet decreased (23%). The most common AEs (≥10%) of grade 3 or higher were lymphopenia (24%) and neutropenia (14%). CRS occurred in 4 (7%) patients, mainly occurred following the first dose. All of those CRS were low-grade, no ≥Grade 3. No immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was observed. In patients with fixed doses up to 600 μg and target dose up to 2.5mg, stable diseases (SD) were observed. The best overall responses dramatically improved in patients received full doses ≥ 5mg, ranging from 5 mg to 40 mg investigated so far. Among 22 evaluable patients with full doses ≥ 5mg, the objective response rate (ORR) was 77% and the complete remission (CR) rate was 22%. Among 11 patients with indolent B-NHL, the ORR was 91%, CR rate was 45.5%, including one patient had failed previous CAR-T therapy. The responses at higher doses are still under evaluation, and additional data will be reported. Conclusions: CN201 has a well tolerable safety profile and promising anti-tumor activity in patients with R/R B-NHL. Clinical trial information: NCT06189391 .">

In autoimmune disease, B cells orchestrate antigen presentation, cytokine production and autoantibody production, the latter via their differentiation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts and plasma cells. This article addresses the current therapeutic strategies to deplete B cells in order to ameliorate or potentially even cure autoimmune disease. It addresses the main target antigens in the B-cell lineage that are used for therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, it summarises the current evidence for successful treatment of autoimmune disease with monoclonal antibodies targeting B cells and the limitations and challenges of these approaches. Finally, the concept of deep B-cell depletion and immunological reset by chimeric antigen receptor T cells is discussed, as well as the lessons from this approach for better understanding the role of B cells in autoimmune disease.">

        <tr id="6505 Background: Patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) still need more and better treatment options. CN201 is a novel CD19-targeting T-cell-engaging IgG4 bispecific antibody. This phase I study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CN201 in B-ALL (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05579132). The data from the dose escalation and expansion of the ongoing study is presented. Methods: The study is enrolling patients with B-ALL who are refractory to primary induction therapy or to salvage therapy, or relapse. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive after two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were eligible. Single-agent CN201 was administered intravenously once per week with a step-up dose approach during cycle 1, a priming dose on Day 1 followed by an intermediate dose on Day 8 and the target dose administered on Day 15 and thereafter. The patients will receive 2 cycles of CN201 for induction. Responders will continue to receive a further 3 cycles for consolidation, and up to an additional 7 cycles for maintenance treatment or until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Results: As of January 31, 2024, 42 adult patients received CN201 with full dose from 600 μg to 40mg. 37 patients were evaluable for efficacy (Table1). Maximum tolerated dose has not reached. The most common adverse events (≥20%) of grade 3 or higher were leukopenia (47.6%), lymphopenia (42.9%), neutropenia (38%), thrombopenia (33.3%) , anaemia (26.2%). 6 patients (14.3%) had infections of grade 3 or higher. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 13 (30.9%) patients, mainly occurred following the first dose, most were low-grade, except for one patient with grade 3. No immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was observed. Overall, 11 (30%) of 37 patients had complete remission (CR), 1 (2.7%) patient had complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi), 75% of responders had MRD negativity. The CR rate significantly increased with dose descalation, reached 50% (4 of 8 patients) with 10mg target dose, two of those occurred within the first two weeks following CN201 treatment. Among those responders, 100% were MRD negative. The CR rate in patients with higher dose levels are under investigation. Conclusions: Preliminary data show CN201 has a well tolerable safety profile and promising activity in adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. Clinical trial information: NCT05579132 .

        <tr id="Bispecific T-cell Engagers (TCEs) are promising anti-cancer treatments that bind to both the CD3 receptors on T cells and an antigen on the surface of tumor cells, creating an immune synapse, leading to killing of malignant tumor cells. These novel therapies have unique development challenges, with specific safety risks of cytokine release syndrome. These on-target adverse events fortunately can be mitigated and deconvoluted from efficacy via innovative dosing strategies, making clinical pharmacology key in the development of these therapies. This review assesses dose selection and the role of quantitative clinical pharmacology in the development of the first eight approved TCEs. Model informed drug development (MIDD) strategies can be used at every stage to guide TCE development. Mechanistic modeling approaches allow for (1) efficacious yet safe first-in-human dose selection as compared with in vitro minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) approach; (2) rapid escalation and reducing number of patients with subtherapeutic doses through model-based adaptive design; (3) virtual testing of different step-up dosing regimens that may not be feasible to be evaluated in the clinic; and (4) selection and justification of the optimal clinical step-up and full treatment doses. As the knowledge base around TCEs continues to grow, the relevance and utilization of MIDD strategies for supporting the development and dose optimization of these molecules are expected to advance, optimizing the benefit-risk profile for cancer patients.">

        <tr id="The potential of the immune system to eradicate leukemic cells has been consistently demonstrated by the Graft vs. Leukemia effect occurring after allo-HSCT and in the context of donor leukocyte infusions. Various immunotherapeutic approaches, ranging from the use of antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates, bispecific T-cell engagers, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, and therapeutic infusions of NK cells, are thus currently being tested with promising, yet conflicting, results. This review will concentrate on various types of immunotherapies in preclinical and clinical development, from the point of view of a clinical hematologist. The most promising therapies for clinical translation are the use of bispecific T-cell engagers and CAR-T cells aimed at lineage-restricted antigens, where overall responses (ORR) ranging from 20 to 40% can be achieved in a small series of heavily pretreated patients affected by refractory or relapsing leukemia. Toxicity consists mainly in the occurrence of cytokine-release syndrome, which is mostly manageable with step-up dosing, the early use of cytokine-blocking agents and corticosteroids, and myelosuppression. Various cytokine-enhanced natural killer products are also being tested, mainly as allogeneic off-the-shelf therapies, with a good tolerability profile and promising results (ORR: 20–37.5% in small trials). The in vivo activation of T lymphocytes and NK cells via the inhibition of their immune checkpoints also yielded interesting, yet limited, results (ORR: 33–59%) but with an increased risk of severe Graft vs. Host disease in transplanted patients. Therefore, there are still several hurdles to overcome before the widespread clinical use of these novel compounds.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Novel T-cell immunotherapies such as bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are emerging as promising therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer. BiTEs are engineered bispecific antibodies containing two distinct binding domains that allow for concurrent binding to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) as well as immune effector cells, thus promoting an immune response against cancer cells. Prostate cancer is rich in tumor associated antigens such as, but not limited to, PSMA, PSCA, hK2, and STEAP1 and there is strong biologic rationale for employment of T-cell redirecting BiTEs within the prostate cancer disease space. Early generation BiTE constructs employed in clinical study have demonstrated meaningful antitumor activity, but challenges related to drug delivery, immunogenicity, and treatment-associated adverse effects limited their success. The ongoing development of novel BiTE constructs continues to address these barriers and to yield promising results in terms of efficacy and safety. This review will highlight some of most recent developments of BiTE therapies for patients with advanced prostate cancer and the evolving data surrounding BiTE constructs undergoing clinical evaluation.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVES
B-cell depletion time after rituximab (RTX) treatment is prolonged in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) compared with other autoimmune diseases. We investigated central and peripheral B-cell development to identify the causes for the defect in B-cell reconstitution after RTX therapy.


METHODS
We recruited 91 patients with AAV and performed deep phenotyping of the peripheral and bone marrow B-cell compartment by spectral flow and mass cytometry. B-cell development was studied by in vitro modelling and the role of BAFF receptor by quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and in vitro assays.


RESULTS
Treatment-naïve patients with AAV showed low transitional B-cell numbers, suggesting impaired B-lymphopoiesis. We analysed bone marrow of treatment-naïve and RTX-treated patients with AAV and found reduced B-lymphoid precursors. In vitro modelling of B-lymphopoiesis from AAV haematopoietic stem cells showed intact, but slower and reduced immature B-cell development. In a subgroup of patients, after RTX treatment, the presence of transitional B cells did not translate in replenishment of naïve B cells, suggesting an impairment in peripheral B-cell maturation. We found low BAFF-receptor expression on B cells of RTX-treated patients with AAV, resulting in reduced survival in response to BAFF in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
Prolonged depletion of B cells in patients with AAV after RTX therapy indicates a B-cell defect that is unmasked by RTX treatment. Our data indicate that impaired bone marrow B-lymphopoiesis results in a delayed recovery of peripheral B cells that may be further aggravated by a survival defect of B cells. Our findings contribute to the understanding of AAV pathogenesis and may have clinical implications regarding RTX retreatment schedules and immunomonitoring after RTX therapy.">

        <tr id="This article endeavors to navigate the clinical journey of bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), from elucidating common toxicities and management strategies to examining novel agents and broadening access in community health care. These drugs, commonly through T-cell activation, result in shared adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Variations in target antigens and designs, however, might introduce unique toxicities for different BsAbs, warranting specific management approaches. Recent US Food and Drug Administration approvals of BsAbs targeting CD3+ T cells linked to CD20 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and to B-cell maturation antigen or GPRC5D for multiple myeloma have transformed the treatment landscape for hematologic malignancies. Emerging new agents promise further enhancement and safety, exploring novel antigen targets, innovative structures such as trispecific antibodies, and the engagement of diverse immune cells. Simultaneously, the expansion of BsAbs into community practices is underway, demanding a multifaceted strategy that encompasses educational initiatives, operational adaptations, and collaborative frameworks.

        <tr id="CAR-T cell (Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of various hematologic malignances. CD19 targeted CAR-T cell therapy is coming in a big way in rheumatic diseases. Recent case reports and case series have shown encouraging results in diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis and antisynthetase syndrome which have been refractory to multiple existing therapies. The dramatic response encompasses objective improvement across multiple clinical domains as well as seroconversion. Side effects of concern with CAR-T cell therapy are related to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). The reported side effects of this therapy for autoimmune diseases were of low grade and were managed without any fatality. Several modifications in CAR-T cell therapy have been proposed to maximize the safety and improving the efficacy. This therapy has got the potential to be a major breakthrough in management of rheumatic diseases, especially wherein existing therapies have been refractory.">

        <tr id="Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are artificially engineered antibodies that can bind simultaneously to the CD3 subunit within the T-cell receptor complex and an antigen on tumor cells, leading to T-cell activation and tumor cell killing. BsAbs against BCMA or GPRC5D have shown impressive clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), with some agents having already received regulatory approval after the third (by the European Medicines Agency, EMA) or fourth (by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA) line of therapy; the results of early-phase clinical trials targeting FcRH5 are also promising. Overall, BsAbs as monotherapy correlated with an ORR that exceeded 60%, with a high CR rate ranging between 25% and 50% and a median PFS of around 1 year among patients with a median of 4–6 prior lines of therapy. The main toxicities include cytokine release syndrome, cytopenias, hypogammaglobulinemia, and infections; on-target off-tumor adverse events involving the skin, mucosa, hair, and nails may also occur with anti-GPRC5D BsAbs. Active research to increase their efficacy and improve their tolerance is still in progress, including combination therapies and application in earlier treatment lines and the development of novel agents. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance is a challenge and could lead to more personalized approaches.">

        <tr id="TPS2687 Background: CF33-CD19 is a novel chimeric vaccinia virus that selectively replicates in tumor cells and can provoke anti-tumor immunity. CF33-CD19 expresses a truncated and non-signaling CD19 protein on the surface of infected tumor cells before virus-mediated tumor lysis, labeling them for CD19-targeted therapies. Preclinical studies with CF33-CD19 have shown that combination therapy with CD19 targeting chimeric antigen receptor T cells is more effective than either monotherapy in murine xenograft and syngeneic models [1]. Likewise, combination therapy with bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE)s that bind CD3-positive T cells and infected solid tumor cells that express de novo CD19, showed pronounced recruitment of T cells to the tumor microenvironment, resulting in tumor growth inhibition in mouse models. CD19xCD3 targeting BiTEs such as blinatumomab may offer an off-the-shelf alternative to adoptive cell therapies. This phase I study, called OASIS, dose escalates CF33-CD19 administered intravenously (IV) or intratumorally (IT) combined with blinatumomab in adults with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Methods: The OASIS study (NCT06063317) is enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy. Patients who have received prior treatment with a poxvirus based oncolytic virus or a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager are excluded. A safety run-in will evaluate the safety of CF33-CD19 monotherapy administered IT or IV before initiating the combination therapy regimen. Combination therapy will be administered in 28-day cycles with CF33-CD19 on days 1 and 15. Following viral transduction to promote de novo CD19 expression, blinatumomab is given on days 2-9 and 16-23 via a 7-day continuous infusion. Patients > 45 kg will receive 9 mcg of blinatumomab during the first week of cycle 1, then 28 mcg during the third week of cycle 1 and subsequent cycles. The study consists of two parts. Part 1 follows a 3+3 dose escalation scheme independently of each route of CF33-CD19 administration (IT and IV) with dose levels of CF33-CD19 ranging from 1.0x107 to 3.0x109 PFU. Part 2 is a cohort expansion in select indications at the optimal dose. The co-primary endpoints are safety and identification of the recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST. Enrollment began in October 2023. 1. Park et al.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
The management of relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) has witnessed dramatic changes in the recent past. Despite the availability of multiple novel immunotherapies in R/R setting, there remains an unmet need for off-the-shelf therapies, particularly in patients with primary refractory, multiply relapsed disease or those experiencing cellular immunotherapy failure. To harness the power of the T-cell mediated immunity, a novel class of drugs called bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have been developed. These BsAbs are currently under investigation both in frontline and R/R setting and hold the potential to revolutionize the management of LBCL.


AREAS COVERED
This review article summarizes the currently available BsAbs, their mode of action, efficacy, and safety data for untreated and R/R LBCL. In addition, the role of these BsAbs in combination with currently available chemoimmunotherapy regimens is also discussed.


EXPERT OPINION
Two bispecific antibodies have secured FDA approval for R/R LBCL, with expected approval of more BsAbs (including in earlier treatment lines). These drugs provide a highly efficacious and relatively safe treatment option for patients with highly pre-treated disease including relapse after cellular immunotherapies. In addition, these BsAbs provide a platform for chemotherapy-free regimen for older/frail patients.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignant plasma cell diseases, the incidence of which is increasing year by year. The application of immunomodulators drugs, proteasome inhibitors, anti-CD38 antibodies, CAR-T, and HSCT have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with MM, however new therapeutic tools need to be developed to improve the prognosis of patients with relapsed/refractory after conventional regimens treatment. Bispecific antibodies are a novel immunotherapeutic approach that generates immune synapses by binding to targets on malignant plasma cells and cytotoxic immune effector cells (T cells/natural killer cells), leading to T/NK cells activation and malignant plasma cell lysis. Several preclinical and phase I clinical studies have shown good efficacy, bringing new possibilities for patients with relapsed/refractory MM to improve their prognosis in the future in combination with the rest of the treatment options. This article summarizes the classification of bispecific antibodies developed in recent years, and the results of preclinical and clinical trials, which will provide some reference for treating MM.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) presents a significant global health burden, with disparities in incidence and outcomes reflecting challenges in recognition and treatment. Talquetamab, a bispecific CD3 T-cell engager targeting G-protein coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D), has emerged as a promising immunotherapy for relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM). In August 2023, talquetamab received accelerated approval from the US FDA for RRMM treatment, followed by conditional marketing authorization from the EMA. Clinical trials demonstrated talquetamab's efficacy, with overall response rates (ORR) of 69% and 76% in heavily pretreated RRMM patients. The phase I monumenTAL-1 trial showcased talquetamab's effectiveness, particularly in high-risk MM and extramedullary disease, with ORRs around 71-74%. Subsequent phase 2 results reaffirmed its efficacy, even in patients with prior T-cell redirection therapies. Combination therapy with daratumumab further enhanced talquetamab's efficacy, addressing concerns of T cell exhaustion. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed sustained responses and manageable adverse events with subcutaneous administration, facilitating convenient dosing regimens. However, talquetamab carries risks of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity, necessitating close monitoring and prompt management. Common adverse events included fever, CRS, musculoskeletal pain, and infections, although severe events were infrequent. Vigilant management strategies, including prophylactic measures and supportive care, mitigate these risks. In conclusion, talquetamab represents a significant advancement in RRMM treatment, offering a promising avenue for T-cell redirection therapy. Ongoing research aims to optimize treatment sequencing and combination strategies, fostering improved outcomes for MM patients. Continued investigation will refine the strategic integration of talquetamab and other immunotherapies, paving the way for enhanced treatment efficacy and patient care in RRMM.">

        <tr id="6534 Background: CD19-targeted therapies have shown remarkable efficacy in patients with B-cell malignancies. However, relapse with CD19 loss as a mechanism of tumor escape is common and represents a serious challenge. Patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior CD19-directed therapy have limited salvage options and a very poor prognosis. The B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) is functionally expressed in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), including in patients with CD19-negative relapse (Qin et al., Sci Transl Med. 2019). As a critical regulator of B-cell function and survival, BAFF-R may be less prone to downregulation by tumors as a mechanism of antigen escape. Methods: We are conducting two phase 1 clinical trials of BAFFR-CAR T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-ALL (NCT04690595) and NHL (NCT05370430). Primary endpoints are dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and all other toxicities. Secondary endpoints include response rate, minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate, PFS and OS. Response is evaluated using European LeukemiaNet criteria for B-ALL and Lugano 2014 for NHL. Results: As of Feb. 1st, 2024, 1 B-ALL and 3 NHL patients have completed treatment and post-treatment evaluations. Each received 50M BAFFR CAR T cells (starting dose level in both trials). The B-ALL patient had CD19/CD20/CD22-negative disease, and had received prior blinatumomab. NHL patients #1 and #2 both had CD19-expressing mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and had received prior CD19 CAR T cells. Patient #2 had also received a CD3/CD20 bispecific antibody. NHL patient #3 had CD19/CD20-negative T cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRBCL) and had not received prior CD19 CAR T cells. There were no DLTs, all patients had Gr. 1 cytokine release syndrome, and 2/3 NHL patients had Gr. 1 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Robust CAR T cell expansion was seen in all patients with a peak on days 12-14 post-infusion. The B-ALL and the 2 MCL patients reached MRD-negative complete response (CR) at 1 month post-treatment. The THRBCL patient had partial response (PR) at 1 month that converted to CR at 3 months. The B-ALL patient successfully transitioned to allogeneic HCT while in CR at 3 months post-infusion. Responses are ongoing in all NHL patients at 14, 10, and 8 months for patients #1, #2 and #3, respectively. Additional patients have been enrolled at the next dose level (200M CAR T cells). Results for these patients will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: With a 100% CR rate at 3 months in the first 4 patients and durable responses at dose level 1, BAFFR-CAR T cells are a promising therapeutic option for patients with r/r B-cell malignancies who are ineligible or failed prior CD19-targeted therapy, including with CD19 antigen loss.

Using representative cases, we highlight the key differences between KMT2A-rearranged and KMT2A-germline infant ALL, and how advances in molecular diagnostics are unpicking KMT2A-germline genetics and guiding treatment reduction. We focus on KM2TA-rearranged infant B-cell ALL where the last few years have seen the emergence of novel therapies which both are more effective and less toxic than conventional chemotherapy. Of these, there is promising early data on the efficacy and tolerability of the bi-specific T-cell engager monoclonal antibody, blinatumomab, as well as the use of autologous and allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. We discuss how we can improve risk stratification and incorporate these new agents to replace the most toxic elements of currently deployed intensive chemotherapy schedules with their associated unacceptable toxicity.">

        <tr id="Objectives Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) maintains peripheral immune tolerance by preventing T cell continuous activation. Aiming to understand the extent of PD-1 expression in inflammatory arthritis beyond its involvement with T cells, we assess its presence on various circulating single cells. Methods Mass cytometry analysis of patients with active seropositive/seronegative rheumatoid (RA; n=9/8) and psoriatic (PsA; n=9) arthritis versus healthy controls (HC; n=13), re-evaluating patients after 3 months of anti-rheumatic treatment. Results PD-1 was expressed in all leukocyte subpopulations, with the highest PD-1+ cell frequencies in eosinophils (59-73%) and T cells (50–60%), and the lowest in natural-killer cells (1–3%). PD-1+ cell frequencies and PD-1 median expression were comparable between patient subgroups and HC, in the majority of cell subsets. Exceptions included increases in certain T cell/B cell subsets of seropositive RA and specific monocyte subsets and dendritic cells of PsA; an expanded PD-1+CD4+CD45RA+CD27+CD28+ T subset, denoting exhausted T cells, was common across patient subgroups. Strikingly, significant inverse correlations between individual biomarkers of systemic inflammation (ESR and/or serum CRP) and PD-1+ cell frequencies and/or median expression were evident in several innate and adaptive immunity cell subsets of RA and PsA patients. Furthermore, all inverse correlations noted in individuals with active arthritis were no longer discernible in those who attained remission/low disease activity post-treatment. Conclusion PD-1 expression may be insufficient, relative to the magnitude of the concomitant systemic inflammatory response on distinct leukocyte subsets, varying between RA and PsA. Our results point to the potential therapeutic benefits of pharmacological PD-1 activation, to rebalance the autoimmune response and reduce inflammation.">

        <tr id="Objectives This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BCMA-CD19 compound chimeric antigen receptor T cells (cCAR) to dual reset the humoral and B cell immune system in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with lupus nephritis (LN). Methods This is a single-arm open-label multicentre phase 1 study of BCMA and CD19-directed cCAR in patients suffering from SLE/LN with autoantibodies produced by B cells and plasma/long-lived plasma cells. In this clinical trial, we sequentially assigned biopsy-confirmed (classes III–V) LN patients to receive 3×106 cCAR cells/kg postcessation of all SLE medications and conditioning. The primary endpoint of safety and toxicity was assessed. Complete immune reset was indicated by B cell receptor (BCR) deep sequencing and flow cytometry analysis. Patient 11 (P11) had insufficient lymphocyte counts and was underdosed as compassionate use. Results P1 and P2 achieved symptom and medication-free remission (MFR) from SLE and complete remission from lymphoma. P3–P13 (excluding P11) received an initial dose of 3×106 cCAR cells /kg and were negative for all autoantibodies, including those derived from long-lived plasma cells, 3 months post-cCAR and the complement returned to normal levels. These patients achieved symptom and MFR with post-cCAR follow-up to 46 months. Complete recovery of B cells was seen in 2–6 months post-cCAR. Mean SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 reduced from 10.6 (baseline) to 2.7 (3 months), and renal function significantly improved in 10 LN patients ≤90 days post-cCAR. cCAR T therapy was well tolerant with mild cytokine-release syndrome. Conclusions Data suggest that cCAR therapy was safe and effective in inducing MFR and depleting disease-causing autoantibodies in patients with SLE.">

        <tr id="7030 Background: The therapeutic landscape for relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is evolving to include targeted T-cell based immunotherapies, including CD19-targeted CAR-T and CD3xCD20 T-cell engaging (TCE) bispecific antibodies. Yet, there remains an unmet medical need for patients who are refractory to, or ineligible for these treatments. Leveraging natural killer (NK) cells emerges as a promising strategy in hematological malignancies, as shown in a Phase 1 study with IPH6101/SAR’579 in R/R AML (Stein, ASCO 2023; Bajel, ASH 2023). Methods: We developed IPH6501, a tetraspecific antibody-based NK cell engager that simultaneously targets on NK cells the CD16a and NKp46 receptors, the IL-2 receptor with an engineered IL-2 variant (IL2v) and on B-NHL cells the CD20 antigen. This approach boosts NK cell activation and proliferation, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, and cytokine production. The IL-2 variant is designed with mutations that prevent binding to CD25 (IL-2Rα), limiting Treg activation and potential IL-2-related side effects. IPH6501 has been evaluated in mouse, non-human primate, and human-derived models, including cells from R/R B-NHL patients. Results: In vivo studies in non-human primates and tumor mouse models revealed that IPH6501, at well-tolerated doses, significantly boosted peripheral NK cell proliferation, drove their accumulation at tumor locations, and effectively eradicated CD20+ cells in blood and tissues. In human derived-models, IPH6501 significantly induced NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Notably, IPH6501 showed potent activity against a range of B-NHL cell lines, including those with low CD20 expression. In addition, IPH6501 upregulated the expression of activating receptors on NK cells, such as NKG2D, essential for the recognition and killing of malignant cells, thereby introducing another mode of action enabling the elimination of CD20-negative tumor cells. In a comparative analysis with a CD3xCD20 TCE, IPH6501 induced lower cytokine secretion, suggesting a potentially safer profile. Additionally, IPH6501 showed higher killing efficacy compared to the TCE in samples from healthy individuals as well as R/R B-NHL patients, underscoring its therapeutic potential. Conclusions: The preclinical demonstrations of IPH6501 activities across various in vivo models and its effectiveness in ex vivo assays using cells from R/R B-NHL patients provide compelling evidence of its therapeutic potential and tolerability. IPH6501 is emerging as a promising new candidate within the treatment landscape for R/R B-NHL and is currently being investigated in a global, first-in-human phase 1/2 study (NCT 06088654).">

        <tr id="7022 Background: T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody (TCB) had emerged as a promising therapy for blood malignancies, including relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-NHL. However, severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remains to be a significant challenge in TCB treatment. To overcome this setback, we re-designed a new CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody (EX103) with a lower affinity to CD3. Clinical data from an ongoing first-in-human phase I/II study demonstrates that EX103 has an encouraging safety and promising single-agent antitumor activity in heavily pretreated R/R B-NHL patients. We present updated safety and efficacy data from the ongoing trial (CTR20212096). Methods: Eligible patients received EX103 with 3 step-up doses followed by target doses in 28-day cycles (iv, QW: cycle 1-2; Q2W thereafter) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At data cut off (Dec 24, 2023), a total of 23 patients were evaluated, including 18 patients in dose-escalation part and 5 patients in dose-expansion part. Results: Among 23 evaluable patients (median age: 51 years [range 42-70]; median prior lines of treatment: 4 [range 2-10]), 13 patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 4 had FL 1-3a, 2 had FL grade 3B, 1 had marginal zone lymphoma, 1 had mantle cell lymphoma, and 2 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Median time since last therapy was 2.5 (range 0.3-39.2) months. No DLT and treatment-related death were observed. CRS was the most common treatment related adverse event. All CRS events were grade (Gr) 1-2 (Gr 1: 78.3%, Gr 2: 13.0%), no Gr 3 or higher events. Most CRS events occurred in the first or second treatment cycle, and all CRS-related clinical symptoms were resolved within 48 hours. No cases of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome or other clinically significant neurologic AEs were observed. For dose ≥ 6 mg cohorts, the overall response rate (ORR) for aggressive B-NHL is 78.6% and the complete response (CR) rate is 50.0% (14 patients). Meanwhile, the ORR for indolent B-NHL is 100%, and CR rate is 25.0% (4 patients). The overall DCR is 89.5%. Currently, treatment is ongoing for 18 patients. The longest duration of response is 14 months. Patients who were refractory to previous therapies achieved impressive responses to EX103 treatment. 3 patients who failed CAR-T therapy achieved either CR or partial response (PR) (2 CR and 1 PR), 2 patients who failed CD19×CD3 bispecific antibody treatment both achieved PR, and 4 patients who failed ASCT achieved either CR or PR (2 CR and 2 PR). Conclusions: EX103 can induce deep and durable responses in heavily pretreated patients with R/R B-NHL, such as those patients who failed CAR-T treatment (3 cases), CD19xCD3 bispecific antibody treatment (2 cases) and ASCT (4 cases).

        <tr id="The treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma has improved substantially in the last 5–10 years based on the development and use of several novel classes of drugs and drug combinations. These advances have led to improvements in progression-free and overall survival as well as quality of life. The general tendency has been to advance drugs/combinations that have performed well in advanced disease to the earlier line settings (frontline, first/early relapse). There are several triplet drug combinations that, when used as part of first or early relapse, can provide remission durations of 3 years or longer. More recently, impressive responses have been seen with the use of targeted immunotherapeutics (chimeric antigen receptor T-cells and bispecific antibodies) in heavily pretreated patients with MM. These treatments, however, have been associated with some new and occasionally severe toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and severe infections, including opportunistic infections and profound cytopenias. These potential toxicities bring into question whether these immune-targeting drugs should remain as late-line therapeutics or whether the high single-agent overall response rates mandate that these agents be used in earlier line settings. Herein, the authors provide a point and counterpoint about the future use of these agents.">

        <tr id="7549 Background: While CART and BiTE have led to unprecedented responses in RRMM, some patients (pts) do not respond or have short-lived responses. Currently no predictive markers exist to identify these pts. This study explored pretreatment T-cell fitness and efficacy/toxicity in RRMM using a novel single-cell secretome analysis. We hypothesized that pretreatment Polyfunctional Strength Index (PSI) may predict efficacy to BCMA-directed T-cell therapies. Methods: We included 14 RRMM pts treated with idecabtagene vicleucel or teclistamab at Yale Cancer Center with ≥6 mos post-treatment follow-up. Peripheral blood prior to treatment was frozen and then PBMC’s thawed for analysis. PSI, a metric for T-cell fitness combining polyfunctional T-cells % with the intensity of secreted cytokines, was obtained using the IsoPlexis’ Single-Cell Secretome Platform. The overall PSI was an average of CD4+ and CD8+ PSIs. Response was assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group criteria and response duration was defined as time from response to disease progression. Responder (R) was defined as ≥very good partial response for ≥6 mos. Non-responder (NR) was defined as stable or progressive disease ≤3 mos. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune-effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were graded using the American Society for Transplantation & Cellular Therapy system. Statistics were performed with Mann-Whitney U test using GraphPad PRISM v.9. Results: There were 7 pts in R group (2 BiTE & 5 CART) and 7 pts in NR group (3 BiTE & 4 CART). Median follow-up time was 13.5 mos(range, 7-27). Median age at treatment was 64 yrs in R and 63 yrs in NR. Extramedullary disease (EM) was present in 14.3%(n=1) in R and 71.4%(n=5) in NR. High-risk cytogenetics, defined as del17p, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), 1q gain/amplification and del1p, were seen in 42.9%(n=3) in R and 85.7%(n=6) in NR. Median prior lines of therapy was 6(range, 4-9) in R and 8(range, 4-10) in NR. CRS/ICANS occurred 85.7%(n=6) in R and 28.6%(n=2) in NR. Overall PSI was 184 in R and 91 in NR(p=0.1649). CD4+ PSI was 160 in R and 75 in NR(p=0.1649). CD8+ PSI was 207 in R and 108 in NR(p=0.1981). Overall PSI was 143 in CRS/ICANS and 130 in no CRS/ICANS(p=0.7546). Conclusions: Overall PSI, CD4+ PSI and CD8+ PSI were 1.9-2.1 times higher in R compared to NR and overall PSI was slightly higher in CRS/ICANS compared to no CRS/ICANS though the difference was not statistically significant. One limitation was a small sample size and thus testing PSI in a larger cohort might yield statistically significant results. The NR group had more high-risk cytogenetics and higher EM. One confounder could be that measuring peripheral T-cell fitness may not be sufficient to predict response in EM where spatial determinants of T-cell influx play a role.">

        <tr id="Autoimmunity is a pathological process associated with a violation of immunological tolerance to normal structural components of the body (autoantigens), associated with the predominance of active (adaptive) immunity and manifested by hyperproduction of autoantibodies. Systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) are among the most common and severe nosological forms of this pathology associated with autoimmunity. Problems of pharmacotherapy of SARDs are the subject of intensive research. At the beginning of the 21st century, more than 20 biologic agents were developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis – monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and recombinant proteins that control inflammation associated with the overproduction of “pro-inflammatory” cytokines, the use of which has dramatically improved the results of pharmacotherapy. However, much less research has been devoted to studying the possibilities of pharmacotherapy aimed at selective suppression of the “autoimmune” component of the pathogenesis of SADRs associated with uncontrolled activation of B cells and restoration of immunological tolerance to autoantigens. In the spectrum of drugs whose mechanism of action is associated with the suppression of pathological activation of B cells, the leading place is occupied by rituximab (RTM). It is noteworthy that 20 years ago (2004), a group of researchers led by prof. J.C. Edwards first demonstrated the effectiveness of RTM in patients with RA, which was soon successfully repositioned to treat a wide range of SARDs. A major achievement in the pharmacotherapy of SARDs is associated with the use of CAR (сhimeric antigen receptor) T cell therapy, developed for the treatment of refractory hematological tumors. The main component of CART-cells is a genetically engineered T-cell receptor that recognizes the target antigen without the participation of the major histocompatibility complex. Although limited, extremely impressive data regarding high remission rates have been obtained by adapting CD19 CART-cell therapy to treat patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other SARDs refractory to standard immunosuppressive medications. The article discusses the results of the use of CART-cell therapy in SLE and other SARDs and prospects for further research.">

        <tr id="The conventional clinical therapies for autoimmune diseases (ADs) lack specificity, necessitating long-term medication that can lead to serious side effects. In contrast, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for ADs, characterized by fewer side effects and longer-lasting therapeutic effects, represents a new direction for the specific treatment of ADs. T cells modified with CAR genes possess the ability to not only secrete perforin, granzymes, and other molecules that target autoreactive immune cells but also to lead effector and regulatory T cells into autoimmune environments, thereby exerting transport, proliferation, and immune regulatory functions. Chimeric autoantibody receptor T cells can recognize and kill autoreactive cells expressing target autoantibodies through their specific antigens. In this article, we comprehensively expound on the application of CAR-T cell therapy in different ADs and summarize the current research progress in this regard. This review aims to enhance the application of CAR-T therapy in AD treatment and facilitate further studies aimed at addressing the existing gaps in CAR-T therapy for ADs.">

        <tr id="Introduction and Objectives: In healthy individuals, activation and expansion of CD8 regulatory T cells (CD8 Treg) leads to selective killing of pathogenic CD4 T cells without broad immunosuppression. In patients with autoimmunity, CD8 Treg appear dysfunctional, allowing pathogenic CD4 T cell expansion and downstream inflammatory events, causing damage to healthy tissues. MTX-101 is a bispecific CD8 Treg modulator targeting CD8 and KIR2DL(1/2/3), co-expressed on CD8 Treg. MTX-101 targets CD8 Treg to restore their function and reduce inflammation without unwanted immune cell activation or global immune suppression. By targeting a root cause of CD4-driven autoimmune diseases, our data suggest that MTX-101 is a promising CD8 Treg-specific therapeutic to restore immune balance for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).
 Methods: We evaluated MTX-101 binding, mechanism of action, and specificity in vitro using human PBMCs and in vivo using a human CD4 T cell-driven GVHD model. Pharmacology and early tolerability were evaluated in humanized CD34+-engrafted NSG(IL-15Tg) mice.
 Results: MTX-101 increased the activation and functions of CD8 Treg without activating other immune cells or affecting global immune responses in vitro, and improved outcomes in the acute GVHD model. In Balb/c and humanized mice, MTX-101 pharmacokinetics were consistent with antibody-like molecules. In humanized mice, MTX-101 bound CD8 Treg in peripheral blood and terminal tissues, with no resulting activation of immune cells. No induction of proinflammatory serum cytokines were observed following MTX-101 dosing at concentrations up to 50 mg/kg.
 Conclusion: MTX-101 restores CD8 Treg functions and may provide durable resistance to autoimmune disease progression.

        <tr id="Antibody-based immune checkpoint blockade therapy has revolutionized the field of cancer immunotherapy, yet its efficacy remains limited in immunologically cold tumors. Combining checkpoint inhibitors with costimulatory agonists improves tumoricidal activity of T cells but also can lead to off-target hepatotoxicity. Although bispecific antibodies confer tumor selectivity to alleviate undesirable adverse effects, toxicity concerns persist with increased dosing. In this issue of Cancer Research, Yuwen and colleagues introduce ATG-101, a tetravalent PD-L1×4-1BB bispecific antibody with high programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) affinity and low 4-1BB affinity, aiming to mitigate hepatotoxicity. ATG-101 demonstrates PD-L1-dependent 4-1BB activation, leading to selective T-cell activation within the tumor microenvironment. ATG-101 exhibits potent antitumor activity, even in large, immunologically cold, and monotherapy-resistant tumor models. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals significant shifts of immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment from protumor to antitumor phenotypes following ATG-101 treatment. In cynomolgus monkeys, no serious cytokine storm and hepatotoxicity are observed after ATG-101 treatment, indicating a broad therapeutic window for ATG-101 in cancer treatment. This study highlights the potential of tetravalent bispecific antibodies in cancer immunotherapy, with implications for various antibody-based treatment modalities across different fields.

        <tr id="2550 Background: Antigen-specific cancer immunotherapies, based on engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or the systemic administration of bispecific T cell-engagers (TCEs), have a significant impact on relapsed/refractory (R/R) B cell malignancies. However, a significant percentage of patients relapse following CAR-T or TCE therapy, with antigen loss accounting for up to one third of relapses/progressions. To avoid antigen loss after administration of single-targeted CAR-T cells and to minimize tumor escape, strategies targeting two antigens simultaneously have been developed and validated in both preclinical models and clinical trials. Nevertheless, despite lowering the risk of antigen loss, these strategies still have some limitations, mainly related to design and manufacturing challenges. Methods: In this context, we have generated the first dual-target strategy for hematological malignancies based on T cells bearing an anti-CD22 CAR and secreting an anti-CD19 T-cell engager antibody (CAR-STAb-T cells) and conducted a comprehensive preclinical study comparing its therapeutic potential with a previously validated anti-CD19/CD22 tandem CAR therapy (TanCAR-T) for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Results: We have demonstrated in both short- and long-term assays, using contact and non-contact co-culture systems, that CAR-STAb-T cells efficiently redirect bystander T cells, resulting in enhanced cytotoxic activity compared to that exhibited by TanCAR-T cells at very low E:T ratios. In addition, CAR-STAb-T cells induce more potent and faster cytotoxic responses than TanCAR-T cells in both short- and long-term co-culture assays when reproducing antigen-downmodulated conditions in vitro. In vivo assays conducted in NSG mice transplanted with a B-ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX), followed by intravenous injection of CAR-STAb-T or TanCAR-T cells under a T cell-limiting experimental setting, also showed that CAR-STAb-T cells maintained a tighter control of tumor progression than TanCAR-T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Conclusions: In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the combination of a cell surface CAR and a soluble TCE recognizing different antigens may be advantageous over the use of conventional multi-targeted strategies based on cell surface-anchored receptors. Furthermore, we have proven that a small number of transduced CAR-STAb-T cells is sufficient to redirect non-transduced bystander T cells specifically and efficiently in the presence of leukemia cells, providing a significant advantage over current dual-targeted CAR-T cell therapies. CAR-STAb-T cells could therefore become an alternative to CAR-T therapies for the treatment of R/R B cell malignancies, especially in lymphodepleted patients with low T cell counts.">

        <tr id="6515 Background: Patients with relapsed/refractory T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (r/r T-ALL/LBL) are clinically manifested by rapid disease progression, poor prognosis and lack of therapeutic options. There is an urgent need to develop other effective modalities. Apart from its expression in normal T and NK cells and no expression in other tissue cells, CD7 is highly expressed in T-ALL/LBL cells. Therefore, CD7 is considered a potential target for the development of CAR-T therapy for T-ALL/LBL. The challenge, however, is to avoid fratricide caused by the expression of CD7 in T cells. We developed a CAR-T cell injection based on CD7 nano antibodies, named PA3-17 injection, by blocking the expression of CD7 molecule on the surface of T cells through anti-CD7 protein expression blocker (PEBL) and evaluate the safety, efficacy and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of PA3-17 Injection in patients with r/r T-ALL/LBL in a phase I clinical study. Methods: The clinical study (NCT05170568) adopted a "3+3" dose escalation schema and proceed cohort expansion. T-ALL/LBL patients who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were deployed by entering three dose groups (DL: 0.5×106, 2×106, 4×106 CAR-T/kg) to evaluate the initial safety, efficacy and dose-limited toxicities (DLTs). All patients were treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy pre-treatment before CAR-T cell infusion. The primary endpoints were DLTs and maximum tolerable dose (MTD). Results: As of Nov 28th, 2023, a total of 12 patients were enrolled (3 patients in dose 1, 2, 3 group, 3 patients in RP2D group), all of whom received a single infusion of PA3-17 injection and completed a 28- day DLTs assessment. The median age of enrolled patients was 33.5 years (range 20-64), and 25.0% (3/12) of patients had previously received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No DLTs occurred. The RP2D was 2×106 CAR-T/kg. The safety analysis showed that 83.3% (10/12) of patients developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS), of which 25% (3/12) had grade 3, and no grade 4 CRS occurred, 16.7% (2/12) of patients experienced 1-2 grade of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and no grade 3 or higher ICANS occurred. The efficacy data showed that the best ORR was 83.3% (10/12) and the CR rate was 75% (9/12). The median follow-up time was 213.5 days. Five patients (Pt 1/5/6/7/9) maintained CR for more than 6 months. One patient (Pt6) had a tumor mass with a diameter greater than 7cm at baseline prior CAR-T infusion but achieved CR 28 days after infusion, then she underwent transplantation at sixth month but died at eighth month because of heart problems, which is unrelated with PA3-17 infusion. Conclusions: PA3-17 injection has shown a good safety profile and encouraging efficacy in r/r T-ALL/LBL patients. RP2D has been determined and the key Phase II clinical study is about to begin.

        <tr id="2536 Background: While being efficient in hematological malignancies, bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), like CAR T cells, are not yet established in solid tumors. Moreover, all T cell-mobilizing strategies cause side effects that endanger patients and may limit applicable doses and thus efficacy. We report on the clinical development of CC-1, a PSMAxCD3 bsAb in an IgG-based format that induces fully target cell-restricted T cell activity against prostate cancer (1). Targeting PSMA, which is expressed on both the malignant cells and the neovasculature, improves accessibility of the tumor site for immune effector cells as critical prerequisite for therapeutic success in solid tumors. Methods: A FIH trial evaluating CC-1 included patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC) (NCT04104607) and consisted of two parts: Dose escalation (n=10-66) using a novel intra-individual dose escalation design to rapidly reach the target dose of 826µg to determine safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (2), and Dose expansion, which exposed patients to CC-1 at MTD and explored efficacy to define RP2D (n=14). Currently, subcutaneous (SC) application as different application mode is being evaluated. Based on very favorable safety and preliminary efficacy data, another phase I trial was initiated where CC-1 is evaluated as first line treatment in patients with hormone sensitive biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PC (NCT05646550), where tumor burden is low and accordingly lower side effects and long-lasting efficacy are expected. Results: Recruitment in the FIH trial in mCRPC has been completed. 28 patients completed treatment with the most frequently observed (86%) toxicity being cytokine release syndrome (CRS, max. 2°). Other adverse events (all ≤2°) included hematologic events (93%) as well as elevated liver enzymes (61%), hypertension (18%) and xerostomia (7%). A rapid and profound decline of PSA levels with up to 62% reduction compared to baseline was documented in all but one of the heavily pretreated patients that received the target dose. Twelve patients received multiple treatment cycles. Recruitment of patients to receive SC application of CC-1 is currently ongoing. In the phase I trial in BCR of PC, the first four dose cohorts have so far been completed. CC-1 application was well tolerated in all patients. In all but one of so far treated patients, mild CRS (transiently elevated temperature) that ceased within 24h upon dosing with antipyretics was observed. No other CC-1 related toxicities were observed and recruitment is ongoing. Conclusions: CC-1 is a promising compound with a favourable toxicity profile and promising clinical activity. Details on study designs and updated data from the clinical trials will be presented at the meeting. 1. Zekri et al, EMBO Mol Med, 2020. 2. Labrenz et al, Pharm Stat, 2022.

Several prospective clinical trials have explored the use of these agents in adults with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL, with promising outcomes observed in younger and older adults and in both Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive and Ph-negative ALL. These novel regimens result in high rates of deep measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity and may improve survival compared with chemotherapy-only approaches, allowing for less reliance on intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This review discusses novel approaches to integrating INO and/or blinatumomab into frontline ALL regimens, including the potential role of chemotherapy-free regimens in some subgroups. The role of MRD monitoring is also discussed, including how this can inform decisions for consolidative allogeneic HSCT or investigational approaches with CD19 CAR T-cells.">

        <tr id="The treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has reached overall survival rates exceeding 90%. The present and future challenges are to cure the remainder of patients still dying from disease, and to reduce morbidity and mortality in those who can be cured with standard-of-care chemotherapy by replacing toxic chemotherapy elements while retaining cure rates. With the novel therapeutic options introduced in the last years, including immunotherapies and targeted antibodies, the treatment of ALL is undergoing major changes. For B-cell precursor ALL, blinatumomab, an anti-CD19 bispecific antibody, has established its role in the consolidation treatment for both high- and standard-risk first relapse of ALL, in the presence of bone marrow involvement, and may also have an impact on the outcome of high-risk subsets such as infant ALL and Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 drug conjugated antibody, has demonstrated high efficacy in inducing complete remission in relapsed ALL, even in the presence of high tumor burden, but randomized phase III trials are still ongoing. For T-ALL the role of CD38-directed treatment, such as daratumumab, is gaining interest, but randomized data are needed to assess its specific benefit. These antibodies are currently being tested in patients with newly diagnosed ALL and may lead to major changes in the present paradigm of treatment of pediatric ALL. Unlike the past, lessons may be learned from innovations in adult ALL, in which more drastic changes are piloted that may need to be translated to pediatrics.">

        <tr id="In the last decade, there has been a surge in developing immunotherapies to enhance the immune system's ability to eliminate tumor cells. Bispecific antibodies known as T cell engagers (TCEs) present an attractive strategy in this pursuit. TCEs aim to guide cytotoxic T cells toward tumor cells, thereby inducing a strong activation and subsequent tumor cell lysis. In this study, we investigated the activity of different TCEs on both conventional alpha-beta (αβ) T cells and unconventional gamma delta (γδ) T cells. TCEs were built using camelid single-domain antibodies (VHHs) targeting the tumor-associated antigen CEACAM5 (CEA), together with T cell receptor chains or a CD3 domain. We show that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells display stronger in vitro antitumor activity than αβ T cells when stimulated with a CD3xCEA TCE. Furthermore, restricting the activation of fresh human peripheral T cells to Vγ9Vδ2 T cells limited the production of protumor factors and proinflammatory cytokines, commonly associated with toxicity in patients. Taken together, our findings provide further insights that γδ T cell-specific TCEs hold promise as specific, effective, and potentially safe molecules to improve antitumor immunotherapies.">

Recently, the treatment based on Venetoclax (VEN), a specific B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor, in combination with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) or low-dose cytarabine, has emerged as a promising clinical strategy in AML. To better understand the immunological effect of VEN treatment, we characterized the phenotype and immune checkpoint (IC) receptors’ expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from AML patients after the first and second cycle of HMA in combination with VEN. HMA and VEN treatment significantly increased the percentage of naïve CD8+ T cells and TIM-3+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and reduced cytokine-secreting non-suppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs). Of note, a comparison between AML patients treated with HMA only and HMA in combination with VEN revealed the specific contribution of VEN in modulating the immune cell repertoire. Indeed, the reduction of cytokine-secreting non-suppressive Tregs, the increased TIM-3 expression on CD8+ T cells, and the reduced co-expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are all VEN-specific. Collectively, our study shed light on immune modulation induced by VEN treatment, providing the rationale for a novel therapeutic combination of VEN and IC inhibitors in AML patients.">

        <tr id="7546 Background: Elranatamab is a BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody with an accelerated approval in the US and EU for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Elranatamab binds to CD3 on T cells and BCMA on MM tumor cells; this dual binding results in T cell activation, cytokine release, and tumor cell killing. Engagement of the BCMA surface receptor by its ligands, APRIL and BAFF, mediates plasma cell proliferation and survival. Elevated BCMA, as well as BAFF and APRIL are present in MM patients, yet in vitro functional assays have shown physiologically relevant soluble APRIL or BAFF concentrations did not significantly impact elranatamab activity. Moreover, emerging clinical data from relapsed patients has identified novel, yet relatively rare BCMA protein mutations that may impact BCMA ligand or targeted modality binding. Here we characterized the BCMA binding affinity, evaluated the impact on BCMA binding to BAFF and APRIL interactions, and identified the BCMA binding epitope. We also generated a model from crystal structure data to map reported BCMA mutations identified in patients. Methods: Elranatamab binding affinity to recombinant human BCMA and characterization of BAFF and APRIL interactions with elranatamab-bound BCMA were calculated via SPR at 37˚C with a classical sandwich format. The elranatamab BCMA binding epitope was identified by a co-crystal structure with a parental anti-BCMA Fab that has identical CDR sequences to elranatamab. Alpha-fold modeling was used to map identified BCMA mutations on the antibody/BCMA interface. Results: Elranatamab binds to BCMA with higher affinity (~38 pM) compared to reported binding affinities of BAFF (μM range) and APRIL (nM range) ligands. The identified elranatamab epitope largely overlaps with known ligand epitopes, supporting that elranatamab higher affinity BCMA binding blocks ligand binding. Alpha fold modeling of four recently reported rare BCMA mutations shows that they lie along the binding interface. Conclusions: Due to its high affinity for BCMA, elranatamab potency is unlikely to be impacted by elevated levels of soluble BAFF or APRIL in RRMM patients. Future studies are needed to characterize the impact of emerging MM patient BCMA mutations on the binding and function of anti-BCMA targeting modalities, particularly given the small extracellular domain of BCMA available for therapeutic targeting and the highly overlapping binding epitopes reported for approved BCMA agents.">

        <tr id="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an orphan neurodegenerative disease. Immune system dysregulation plays an essential role in ALS onset and progression. Our preclinical studies have shown that the administration of exogenous allogeneic B cells improves outcomes in murine models of skin and brain injury through a process termed pligodraxis, in which B cells adopt an immunoregulatory and neuroprotective phenotype in an injured environment. Here, we investigated the effects of B-cell therapy in the SOD1G93A mouse preclinical model of ALS and in a person living with ALS. Purified splenic mature naïve B cells from haploidentical donor mice were administered intravenously in SOD1G93A mice for a total of 10 weekly doses. For the clinical study in a person with advanced ALS, IgA gammopathy of unclear significance, and B lymphopenia, CD19+ B cells were positively selected from a healthy haploidentical donor and infused intravenously twice, at a 60-day interval. Repeated intravenous B-cell administration was safe and significantly delayed disease onset, extended survival, reduced cellular apoptosis, and decreased astrogliosis in SOD1G93A mice. Repeated B-cell infusion in a person with ALS was safe and did not appear to generate a clinically evident inflammatory response. An improvement of 5 points on the ALSFRS-R scale was observed after the first infusion. Levels of inflammatory markers showed persistent reduction post-infusion. This represents a first demonstration of the efficacy of haploidentical B-cell infusion in the SOD1G93A mouse and the safety and feasibility of using purified haploidentical B lymphocytes as a cell-based therapeutic strategy for a person with ALS.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that, while latent in most individuals, poses a great risk to immunocompromised patients. In contrast to directly acting traditional antiviral drugs, such as ganciclovir, we aim to emulate a physiological infection control using T cells. For this, we constructed several bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) constructs targeting different viral glycoproteins of the murine cytomegalovirus and evaluated them in vitro for their efficacy. To isolate the target specific effect without viral immune evasion, we established stable reporter cell lines expressing the viral target glycoprotein B, and the glycoprotein complexes gN-gM and gH-gL, as well as nano-luciferase (nLuc). First, we evaluated binding capacities using flow cytometry and established killing assays, measuring nLuc-release upon cell lysis. All BiTE constructs proved to be functional mediators for T-cell recruitment and will allow a proof of concept for this treatment option. This might pave the way for strikingly safer immunosuppression in vulnerable patient groups.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a breakthrough cancer therapy over the past decade. Remarkable outcomes in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and multiple myeloma have been reported in both pivotal trials and real-word studies. Traditionally, the use of a patient’s own (autologous) T cells to manufacture CAR products has been the standard practice. Nevertheless, this approach has some drawbacks, including manufacturing delays, dependence on the functional fitness of the patient’s T cells, which can be compromised by both the disease and prior therapies, and contamination of the product with blasts. A promising alternative is offered by the development of allogeneic CAR-cell products. This approach has the potential to yield more efficient drug products and enables the use of effector cells with negligible alloreactive potential and a significant CAR-independent antitumor activity through their innate receptors (i.e., natural killer cells, γδ T cells and cytokine induced killer cells). In addition, recent advances in genome editing tools offer the potential to overcome the primary challenges associated with allogeneic CAR T-cell products, namely graft-versus-host disease and host allo-rejection, generating universal, off-the-shelf products. In this review, we summarize the current pre-clinical and clinical approaches based on allogeneic CAR T cells, as well as on alternative effector cells, which represent exciting opportunities for multivalent approaches and optimized antitumor activity.">

        <tr id="e19008 Background: Bispecific antibodies (BsAb) have emerged as a new treatment modality for relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas (R/R NHL). They exert their effect by binding to CD3 on T-cells and CD19 or CD20 on lymphoma cells, activating the T-cell to exert cytotoxic effects against the tumor and normal B-cells. Treatment related adverse events (TRAE) include infections, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (ICANS). This meta-analysis was conducted to assess prevalence of TRAEs from prospective clinical trials that evaluated BsAb in R/R NHL. Methods: A systematic review was conducted through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane to identify BsAb clinical trials in NHL through October 2023. Eligible studies included phase I-III trials evaluating BsAb in any type of NHL, either as monotherapy or combination therapy irrespective of prior lines of treatment. Primary outcomes of interest include infection, neutropenia, CRS, and ICANS. All studies were weighted equally. Pooled prevalence estimates of TRAE were calculated using common and random effects models. Heterogeneity tests were performed using Cochran’s Q test. Subgroup analysis examined infection rates in monotherapy versus combination therapy cohorts. Results: After screening 1039 studies, 36 clinical trials with 2162 patients were included. The lymphoma subtypes were diffuse-large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. The BsAbs included mosunetuzumab (13 studies), epcoritamab (10 studies), blinatumomab (5 studies), glofitamab (5 studies), odronextamab (2 studies), and AFM11 (1 study). The median age of patients was 66 years, and patients had received a median of two prior lines of therapy. Median follow-up duration was 9.1 months. The prevalence of all-grade infections was 35% (95% CI: 0.33-0.38; I2 = 79%). For grade ≥3 infections, the prevalence was 16% (95% CI: 0.14-0.18, (I2 = 77%). There were higher rates of all-grade infections in the combination therapy cohort (41%, 95% CI: 0.36-0.47) compared with the monotherapy cohort (33%, 95% CI: 0.30-0.36). All-grade and grade ≥3 neutropenia occurred in 31% (95% CI: 0.29-0.34; I2 = 80%) and 22% (95% CI: 0.20-0.24, I2 = 61%) of patients. CRS was observed in 45% of patients (95% CI: 0.43-0.48, I2 = 85%). Grade ≥3 CRS occurred in only 2% of patients (95% CI: 0.02-0.03, I2 = 0%, p = 0.99). ICANS occurred in 12% (95% CI: 0.10-0.14, I2 = 90%) while grade ≥3 ICANS was rare, at 3% (95% CI: 0.02-0.03, I2 = 0%, p = 0.99). Conclusions: BsAb is associated with nontrivial rates of infections and neutropenia. The rates of high grade CRS and ICANS are low. The heterogeneity of the findings could be attributed by an underreporting of TRAE and small sample sizes from various studies. These results highlight the need for vigilant practices to diagnose and treat infections early and consideration for antibacterial prophylaxis in this immunocompromised population.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Interleukin-6 receptor antibodies (IL-6R Abs), including satralizumab, are increasingly used to prevent relapse for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). However, the detailed mechanism of action of this treatment on the lymphocyte phenotype remains unclear. This study focused on B cells in patients with NMOSD, hypothesizing that IL-6R Ab enables B cells to acquire regulatory functions by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated in vitro to induce the expansion of B-cell subsets, double-negative B cells (DNs; CD19+ IgD−, CD27−) and plasmablasts (PBs; CD19+, CD27hi, CD38hi). Whole B cells, DNs, or PBs were isolated after culture with IL-6R Ab, and IL-10 expression was quantified using quantitative PCR and a cytometric bead array. RNA sequencing was performed to identify the marker of regulatory PBs induced by IL-6R Ab. Results DNs and PBs were observed to expand in patients with NMSOD during the acute attacks. In the in vitro model, IL-6R Ab increased IL-10 expression in B cells. Notably, IL-10 expression increased in PBs but not in DNs. Using RNA sequencing, CD200 was identified as a marker of regulatory PBs among the differentially expressed upregulated genes. CD200+ PBs produced more IL-10 than CD200− PBs. Furthermore, patients with NMOSD who received satralizumab had a higher proportion of CD200+ PBs than patients during the acute attacks. Discussion Treatment with IL-6 signaling blockade elicited a regulatory phenotype in B cells and PBs. CD200+ PBs may be a marker of treatment responsiveness in the context of NMOSD pathophysiology.">

        <tr id="7066 Background: Despite advanced treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T), a significant proportion of patients succumb to relapsed and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL). In vitro experiments suggest synergism between BTK inhibitor (BTKi) and T-cell engager, we initiated a multicenter trial of poseltinib and glofitamab in combination with lenalidomide in R/R DLBCL. Methods: This is a phase II, open label, single arm study aiming to enroll 76 participants with adult R/R DLBCL patients (NCT05335018). Patients refractory to frontline therapy or those who failed more than two lines of therapies were enrolled. Previous anti-CD19 CAR-T was allowed, while previous CD20 T-cell engager was not permitted. Participants received glofitamab (In cycle 1, dose is increased weekly from 2.5mg to 10mg, and after cycle 2, 30mg is administered on Day 1), lenalidomide (20mg daily from Day 1-14), and poseltinib (40mg twice daily from Day 1-21) (GPL) every 3 weeks for a total of 12 cycles(induction). Maintenance with poseltinib and lenalidomide for 17 cycles were given to patients after induction period. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR), with secondary endpoints including duration of response (DoR), complete response rate (CRR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and incidence of treatment related adverse events. Results: No safety signals were observed in the safety cohort (n=6, 3+3 design). As of November 2023, 37 patients (median age 71) have been treated with GPL, with a median follow up duration of 3.6 months. In prior lines of therapy, 13 patients (35.1%) received treatment more than 2, and 26 patients (70.3%) were with Ann Arbor stage III/IV and 7 patients (18.9%) were refractory to frontline treatment. Previously, 3 patients (8.1%) received CAR-T. Out of 28 evaluable patients, ORR was 89.3%, with CRR of 42.9%. Six-month OS and PFS rate were 81% and 55%. DoR at 6 months was 66%. Neutropenia (45.9%) was the most common grade(gr) 3-4. Three patients (8.1%) died of gr5. There was 1 case (2.7%) of gr3 atrial fibrillation and gr1 bleeding. No incidence of gr3 or above liver/renal toxicity were observed. Overall, 3 patients (8.1%) discontinued GPL treatment due to toxicity, and cytokine release syndrome was observed in 7 patients (18.9%) and only 2 patients (5.4%) were gr3-4. Conclusions: Interim analysis indicates that the GPL regimen is an effective and safe regimen for R/R DLBCL patients. High response rates observed support further investigation of GPL for potential synergism between T-cell engagers and BTKi. This multicenter study is actively recruiting patients and is set to complete enrollment within this year. Clinical trial information: NCT05335018 . [Table: see text]">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative treatment for various hematological malignancies. Still, its remarkable efficacy is accompanied by unique adverse events that must be carefully managed. This comprehensive literature review evaluates the safety profile of CAR T-cell therapy, focusing on cytopenia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and other potential complications. Cytopenia, characterized by reduced blood cell counts, affects a significant proportion of patients, with rates of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia reaching up to 60%, 70%, and 80%, respectively. Risk factors include high tumor burden, prior chemotherapy, and bone marrow involvement. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurs in 13% to 77% of patients and is linked to the cytokine storm induced by CAR T cells, target antigen expression, and preexisting immune dysregulation. Other notable adverse events discussed are cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and infections. Understanding the mechanisms, risk factors, and management strategies for these adverse events is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and unlocking the full potential of this revolutionary therapy. The review highlights the need for continued research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and evidence-based approaches to enhance the safety and efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy.">

Distinct alterations in peripheral B cell subsets have been described in individuals with TAK. Advancements in technology have facilitated the identification of novel autoantibodies in TAK. Moreover, emerging data suggest that dysregulated signaling cascades downstream of B cell receptor families, including interactions with innate pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors, as well as co-stimulatory molecules like CD40, CD80 and CD86, may result in the selection and proliferation of autoreactive B cell clones in TAK. Additionally, ectopic lymphoid neogenesis within the aortic wall of TAK patients exhibits functional characteristics. In recent decades, therapeutic interventions targeting B cells, notably utilizing the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, have demonstrated efficacy in TAK. Despite the importance of the humoral immune response, a systematic understanding of how autoreactive B cells contribute to the pathogenic process is still lacking. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biological significance of B cell-mediated autoimmunity in TAK pathogenesis, as well as insights into therapeutic strategies targeting the humoral response. Furthermore, it examines the roles of T-helper and T follicular helper cells in humoral immunity and their potential contributions to disease mechanisms. We believe that further identification of the pathogenic role of autoimmune B cells and the underlying regulation system will lead to deeper personalized management of TAK patients. We believe that further elucidation of the pathogenic role of autoimmune B cells and the underlying regulatory mechanisms holds promise for the development of personalized approaches to managing TAK patients.">

        <tr id="7567 Background: BCMA targeting bispecific Antibody (bsAb) therapy has shown unprecedented response and survival rates in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The clinical activity of bsAb therapy has been shown to depend on T-cell function, yet clinical parameters, such as absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) have not been found to be associated with response to bsAbs. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether distinct T cell subsets, such as CD4 and CD8 counts as well as their proportion within the ALC are associated with outcome of BCMA targeting bsAb therapy. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on 79 patients who had been treated with at least one full dose of a BCMA targeting bsAb. T cell subsets, including ALC, total CD3, CD4 and CD8, were measured from peripheral blood within 7 days prior to bsAb therapy initiation. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS version 9.4 using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Median age of the patient cohort was 72 (31-84) years with 40/79 (51%) being male and 15/79 (19%) being African American. Median lines of therapy was 5 (2-12) with 78/79 (99%) patients being triple class refractory and 50/79 (63%) being penta-drug refractory. 59/79 (75%) of patients had at least one prior stem cell transplant (SCT) with 35/79 (44%) having had at least two SCTs. 26/79 (33%) patients had prior exposure to BCMA targeting therapy, with 18/79 (23%) and 8/79 (10%) previously having received belantamab mafodotin or BCMA targeting Car-T cell therapy respectively. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 38/79 (48%) of patients with the majority (92%) being grade 1 with the remainder being grade 2. Median ALC was 1.02 (0.25-5) x103/mL, median CD4 count was 0.27 (0.04-1.13) x103/mL while median CD8 count was 0.5 (0.07-2.97) x103/mL. Overall response (OR) rate of the whole cohort was 82% (69/79) with best responders (³very good partial response) comprising 51% (40/79). While total ALC, CD4 and CD8 counts did not appear to impact response to BCMA targeting bsAb therapy, the ratio of CD4 to ALC proved to be significantly associated with OR (univariate p=0.04) and best response (univariate p= 0.004, multivariate p=0.01) . The CD8 to ALC ratio had no significant impact in this patient population. The only other factor to show a significant association with response was the number of prior lines of therapy with higher numbers being associated with worse response (p=0.046). Conclusions: Our study suggests that an increased proportion of CD4 cells within the ALC is significantly associated with better response to BCMA targeting bsAb. While future studies are needed to elaborate on CD4 function in bsAB therapy, our findings imply that therapeutic strategies to increase the CD4 proportion could lead to improved bsAb therapy effectiveness.">

        <tr id="Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) is one of several childhood-onset autoimmune disorders characterized by a type I interferon response and autoantibodies. Treatment options are limited due to incomplete understanding of how the disease emerges from dysregulated cell states across the immune system. We therefore investigated the blood of JDM patients at different stages of disease activity using single-cell transcriptomics paired with surface protein expression. By immunophenotyping peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we observed skewing of the B cell compartment towards an immature naive state as a hallmark of JDM at diagnosis. Furthermore, we find that these changes in B cells are paralleled by T cell signatures suggestive of Th2-mediated inflammation that persist despite disease quiescence. We applied network analysis to reveal that hyperactivation of the type I interferon response in all immune populations is coordinated with previously masked cell states including dysfunctional protein processing in CD4+ T cells and regulation of cell death programming in NK, CD8+ T cells and gdT cells. Together, these findings unveil the coordinated immune dysregulation underpinning JDM and provide insight into strategies for restoring balance in immune function.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells and Bispecific Antibodies (BsAb) are the leading platforms for redirecting the immune system against cells expressing the specific antigen, revolutionizing the treatment of hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). In MM, drug-resistant relapses are the main therapy-limiting factor and the leading cause of why the disease is still considered incurable. T-cell-engaging therapies hold promise in improving the treatment of MM. However, the effectiveness of these treatments may be hindered by T-cell fitness. T-cell exhaustion is a condition of a gradual decline in effector function, reduced cytokine secretion, and increased expression of inhibitory receptors due to chronic antigen stimulation. Areas covered This review examines findings about T-cell exhaustion in MM in the context of T-cell redirecting BsAbs and CAR-T treatment. Expert opinion The fitness of T-cells has become an important factor in the development of T-cell redirecting therapies. The way T-cell exhaustion relates to these therapies could affect the further development of CAR and BsAbs technologies, as well as the strategies used for clinical use. Therefore, this review aims to explore the current understanding of T-cell exhaustion in MM and its relationship to these therapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T-cell engaging (TCE) bispecific antibodies are potent drugs that trigger the immune system to eliminate cancer cells, but administration can be accompanied by toxic side effects that limit dosing. TCEs function by binding to cell surface receptors on T cells, frequently CD3, with one arm of the bispecific antibody while the other arm binds to cell surface antigens on cancer cells. On-target, off-tumor toxicity can arise when the target antigen is also present on healthy cells. The toxicity of TCEs may be ameliorated through the use of pro-drug forms of the TCE, which are not fully functional until recruited to the tumor microenvironment. This can be accomplished by masking the anti-CD3 arm of the TCE with an autoinhibitory motif that is released by tumor-enriched proteases. Here, we solve the crystal structure of the antigen-binding fragment of a novel anti-CD3 antibody, E10, in complex with its epitope from CD3 and use this information to engineer a masked form of the antibody that can activate by the tumor-enriched protease matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2). We demonstrate with binding experiments and in vitro T-cell activation and killing assays that our designed prodrug TCE is capable of tumor-selective T-cell activity that is dependent upon MMP-2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a similar masking strategy can be used to create a pro-drug form of the frequently used anti-CD3 antibody SP34. This study showcases an approach to developing immune-modulating therapeutics that prioritizes safety and has the potential to advance cancer immunotherapy treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a prevalent kidney cancer for which long-term survival rates are abysmal, though immunotherapies are showing potential. Not yet clinically vetted are bispecific T cell engagers (BTEs) that activate T cell-mediated cancer killing through intercellular synapsing. Multiple BTE formats exist, however, with limited cross-characterizations to help optimize new drug design. Here, we developed BTEs to treat ccRCC by targeting carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) while characterizing the persistent BTE (PBTE) format and comparing it to a new format, the persistent multivalent T cell engager (PMTE). These antibody therapies against ccRCC are developed as both recombinant and synthetic DNA (synDNA) medicines. Methods Antibody formatting effects on binding kinetics were assessed by flow cytometry and intercellular synaptic strength assays while potency was tested using T-cell activation and cytotoxicity assays. Mouse models were used to study antibody plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics, as well as antitumor efficacy as both recombinant and synDNA medicines. Specifically, three models using ccRCC cell line xenografts and human donor T cells in immunodeficient mice were used to support this study. Results Compared with a first-generation BTE, we show that the PBTE reduced avidity, intercellular synaptic strength, cytotoxic potency by as much as 33-fold, and ultimately efficacy against ccRCC tumors in vivo. However, compared with the PBTE, we demonstrate that the PMTE improved cell avidity, restored intercellular synapses, augmented cytotoxic potency by 40-fold, improved tumor distribution pharmacokinetics by 2-fold, and recovered synDNA efficacy in mouse tumor models by 20-fold. All the while, the PMTE displayed a desirable half-life of 4 days in mice compared with the conventional BTE’s 2 hours. Conclusions With impressive efficacy, the CA9-targeted PMTE is a promising new therapy for advanced ccRCC, which can be effectively delivered through synDNA. The highly potent PMTE format itself is a promising new tool for future applications in the multispecific antibody space.">

        <tr id="B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting therapeutics have dramatically improved outcomes in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). However, whether the mechanisms of resistance between these therapies are shared and how the identification of such mechanisms before therapy initiation could refine clinical decision-making remains undefined. We analyzed outcomes for 72 RRMM patients treated with teclistamab, a CD3 x BCMA bispecific antibody (BsAb), 42% (30/72) of whom had prior BCMA-directed therapy exposure. Malignant plasma cell BCMA expression was present in all BCMA therapy-naïve patients. Prior therapy-mediated loss of plasma cell BCMA expression before teclistamab treatment, measured by immunohistochemistry, was observed in 3 patients, none of whom responded to teclistamab, and one of whom also did not respond to ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Whole exome sequencing of tumor DNA from one patient revealed biallelic loss of TNFRSF17 following treatment with belantamab mafodotin. Low-to-undetectable peripheral blood soluble BCMA levels correlated with the absence of BCMA expression by bone marrow plasma cells. Thus, although rare, loss of BCMA expression following TNFRSF17 gene deletions can occur following any BCMA-directed therapy and prevents response to subsequent anti-BCMA-directed treatments, underscoring the importance of verifying the presence of a target antigen.">

        <tr id="Immune responses to primary COVID-19 vaccination were investigated in 58 patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) as part of the PETReA trial of frontline therapy (EudraCT 2016-004010-10). COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1) were administered before, during or after cytoreductive treatment comprising rituximab (depletes B cells) and either bendamustine (depletes CD4+ T cells) or cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. Blood samples obtained after vaccine doses 1 and 2 (V1, V2) were analysed for antibodies and T cells reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the Abbott Architect and interferon-gamma ELISpot assays respectively. Compared to 149 healthy controls, patients with FL exhibited lower antibody but preserved T-cell responses. Within the FL cohort, multivariable analysis identified low pre-treatment serum IgA levels and V2 administration during induction or maintenance treatment as independent determinants of lower antibody and higher T-cell responses, and bendamustine and high/intermediate FLIPI-2 score as additional determinants of a lower antibody response. Several clinical scenarios were identified where dichotomous immune responses were estimated with >95% confidence based on combinations of predictive variables. In conclusion, the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in FL patients is influenced by multiple disease- and treatment-related factors, among which B-cell depletion showed differential effects on antibody and T-cell responses.">

        <tr id="Leveraging endogenous tumor-resident T-cells for immunotherapy using bispecific antibodies (BsAb) targeting CD20 and CD3 has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. However, features associated with treatment response or resistance are unknown. To this end, we analyzed data from patients treated with epcoritamab-containing regimens in the EPCORE NHL-2 trial (NCT04663347). We observed downregulation of CD20 expression on B-cells following treatment initiation both in progressing patients and in patients achieving durable complete responses (CR), suggesting that CD20 downregulation does not universally predict resistance to BsAb-based therapy. Single-cell immune profiling of tumor biopsies obtained following one cycle of therapy revealed substantial clonal expansion of cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in patients achieving CR, and an expansion of follicular helper and regulatory CD4+ T-cells in patients whose disease progressed. These results identify distinct tumor-resident T-cell profiles associated with response or resistance to BsAb therapy.">

Mol Ther. 2015 Jan;23(1):184-91). CD123 CAR T-cell therapy has weak proliferation and low CR rates (Wermke M, et al. Blood. 2021 Jun 3;137(22):3145-3148; Cummins, Katherine D. et al. Blood. 2017; 130: 1359), while CLL1 CAR T-cell therapy has induced anti-leukemic responses in a small subset of patients without sustained expansion (Pei K, et al. Cancer Med. 2023 Apr;12(8):9655-9661; Jin X, et al. J Hematol Oncol. 2022 Jul 7;15(1):88). Here, we present early safety and efficacy of functionally enhanced CD33 CAR T cells in AML. Methods: We improved the performance of CD33 CAR T cells by adding a potentiating molecule linked to human CD33 scFv by P2A. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04835519). The trial used the “3+3” approach, starting with an initial dose of 5×105 (±20%)/kg. The primary endpoint was safety with efficacy secondary. Results: Four relapsed patients, including three who underwent stem cell transplantation, were enrolled and received initial dose of CAR T cells between April 13, and July 28, 2021. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee approved the preliminary report. Three patients (75%) experienced grade 1−2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), while one (25%) had grade 4 CRS. One developed grade 2 CRS after the second infusion. One patient had dose-limiting toxicity. Two patients (50%) had grade 1 neurotoxicity, and two (50%) developed grade 1–2 graft-versus-host disease. All patients experienced grade 2–4 neutropenia, monocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. One patient developed sepsis. Two patients achieved CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) and were MRD-negative at day 30, while two had no response. Of these, one patient received a second infusion and achieved MRD+ CRi. Two patients have remained disease free for over two years. One patient remained disease free for one year before CD33+ relapse. The two patients with CRi had peak CAR T cell counts of 192 and 23.5 cells/μl, while the two without CRi had lower peak counts of 2.12 and 10.3 cells/μl. One patient peaked at 1.73 cells/μl after the second infusion. The two patients with CRi also had a higher proportion of CAR T cells among the lymphocytes (46.8% and 53.0%). As expected, peripheral blood CD33+ cells decreased. Conclusions: We report the safety and efficacy of functionally enhanced CD33 CAR T cells. While some patients had CRi, there was also depletion of CD33-positive normal cells. Thus, further research is needed to address the issue of normal cell depletion.

        <tr id="HBI0101 is an academic chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) targeted to BCMA for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) and light chain amyloidosis. Herein, we present the Phase Ib/II results of fifty heavily pre-treated RRMM patients dosed with 800x106 CART cells (NCT04720313). Inclusion criteria were relatively permissive (i.e., performance status and baseline organ function) and consequently, about half of the enrolled patients would have been ineligible for pivotal clinical trials. The median time elapsed from patient enrolment until CART delivery was 25 days (range, 14-65). HBI0101-related toxicities included grade 1-3 cytokine-release syndrome, grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities and grade 1-2 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Responses were achieved in 90% of the patients, 56% achieved stringent and complete response (sCR/CR), and 70% reached a minimal residual disease negativity. Within a median follow-up of 12.3 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.0 months; (95% CI, 6.2-14.6), and the overall survival was not reached (95% CI, 13.3-not reached). Multivariable analysis on patient/disease and CART cell-related characteristics revealed that high-risk cytogenetic, extramedullary disease, and increased number of effector-memory T-cells in CART products were independently associated with inferior PFS. In conclusion, comprehensive analyses of the parameters affecting the response to CART therapy are essential for improving patients' outcome.">

Evidence of immune evasion during AML progression, such as HLA loss and T-cell exhaustion, suggests that antileukemic immune responses contribute to disease control and could be harnessed by immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss a spectrum of AML immunotherapy targets, encompassing cancer cell-intrinsic and surface antigens as well as targeting in the leukemic milieu, and how they can be tailored for personalized approaches. These targets are overviewed across major immunotherapy modalities applied to AML: immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, therapeutic vaccines, bispecific/trispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T and CAR-NK cells. Significance: Immune therapies in AML treatment show evolving promise. Ongoing research aims to customize approaches for varied patient profiles and clinical scenarios. This review covers immune surveillance mechanisms, therapy options like checkpoint inhibitors, antibodies, CAR-T/NK cells, and vaccines, as well as resistance mechanisms and microenvironment considerations.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for eradicating human cancers. Their therapeutic success and durability of clinical responses hinges, in large part, on their functional capacity, including the ability of these engineered cells to simultaneously expand and persist after infusion into patients. CD19 CAR T-cell polyfunctionality, assessing the simultaneous functions of cytokine production, proliferation, and cytotoxicity has been reported to correlate with clinical outcomes. Assay optimization is potentially limited by the heterogeneous nature of CAR T-cell infusion products and target specificity. We optimized a single-cell platform for polyfunctionality using CAR T cell products manufactured from healthy donors, engineered against a novel target, BAFF-R, and validated the protocol using CD19 CAR T cells. We observed distinct qualitative differences between BAFF-R and CD19 CAR T cells relative to the proportions of stimulatory vs. effector cytokines, based on target antigen density, and generally, CD19 CAR T cells exhibited lower indices of polyfunctionality. Finally, we applied our assay to the autologous BAFF-R CAR T-cell product generated from the first NHL patient treated on an ongoing clinical trial who had progressed after prior CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. We observed robust indicators of polyfunctionality, which correlated with successful CAR T cell expansion after infusion and achievement of durable complete remission ongoing after 18 months. The precise identification of factors determining the role of BAFF-R CAR T-cell fitness on toxicity and clinical outcome will require the application of this robust assay in the analysis of additional treated patients.">

        <tr id="7058 Background: Follicular and marginal zone B cell lymphoma (FL; MZL) demonstrate an indolent course with heterogeneous outcomes anda potential for spontaneous remissions indicating immune system intervention. Therapeutic immunization is therefore an attractive approach but new antigens that evoke a strong immune response are needed. EO2463 expands pre-existing memory CD8+ T cells recognizing non-self protein sequences from gut bacteria which cross-react with B cell antigens and can kill HLA-A2 restricted cells (T2) loaded with target peptides. EO2463 includes 4 HLA-A2 synthetically produced epitopes which exhibit molecular mimicry with the B cell markers CD20, CD22, CD37, and CD268 (BAFF-receptor), as well as a the CD4 helper-epitope UCP2 derived from hTERT. EO2463 is being used to drive anti-tumor activity against B cell malignancies. Methods: Patients (pts) with FL and MZL, stage 1-3A, and HLA-A2, are eligible. In the safety lead-in pts with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease were given EO2463 SC q2 weeks (w) x 4, then q4w, for a max of 12 months; at w7 lenalidomide (20 mg/day for 21/28 days up to 12 cycles) is added (EL), and if no complete remission (CR) at w19, rituximab (375 mg/m2 IV, q1w x 4, then q4w x 4) is also added (ER2). Doses evaluated: 150 μg and 300μg/peptide. Results: 3 pts received 150 μg/peptide and 6 pts 300 μg/peptide (EO2463 1 pat, EL 2 pts, ER2 6 pts): 2 MZL, 7 FL pts with median 2 lines (range 1-4) of prior systemic therapy. No related grade ≥3 adverse events were seen with EO2463 monotherapy. Most common related events were grade 1 to 2 local administration site reactions in 5/9 pts. Adverse events during combination treatment were as expected for R2. PET-CT on w6 after EO2463 monotherapy suggested clinical activity in 4/9 pts (1 PR, 1 pt size reduction 15%, 1 pt 20% reduced tracer uptake, 1 pt 5/6 target lesions reduced metabolic activity). Overall objective responses (OR) were seen in 6/9 pts (67%; 1st OR on EO2463 1 pat, EL 4 pts, ER2 1 pat), with CR in 5/9 (56%) pts; median time to response was 18w (range 8-43w), response ongoing in 5 pts, range 24-76w. Expansion of specific CD8+ T cells against mimic peptides and targeted B cell antigens were detected in all responding pts, incl. 2 pts with no measurable B cells at baseline (prior anti-CD20). Expansion of specific T cells was detected at w5 in 5/6 pts and was maintained as long as currently tested (up to w94, 43w after last EO2463 dose). No decline in expansions were seen after start rituximab. Conclusions: EO2463 (300 μg/peptide) monotherapy, EL, and ER2 are well tolerated, with encouraging clinical activity with EO2463 monotherapy and with subsequent CR in 5/9 pts on combo. Rapid and durable expansion of specific CD8+ T cells was seen in all responding pts, consistent with the preclinical hypothesis. Additional cohorts investigate EO2463 alone or in combination in newly diagnosed or R/R pts. Results will be reported at the meeting. Clinical trial information: NCT04669171 .">

        <tr id="Bispecific T-cell engagers (bsTCEs) have emerged as a promising class of cancer immunotherapy. BsTCEs enable physical connections between T cells and tumor cells to enhance T-cell activity against cancer. Despite several marketing approvals, the development of bsTCEs remains challenging, especially at early clinical translational stages. The intricate design of bsTCEs makes their pharmacologic effects and safety profiles highly dependent on patient's immunological and tumor conditions. Such context-dependent pharmacology introduces considerable uncertainty into translational efforts. In this study, we developed a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) model, through context unification, that can facilitate the translation of bsTCEs preclinical data into clinical activity. Through characterizing the formation dynamics of immunological synapse (IS) induced by bsTCEs, this model unifies a broad range of contexts related to target affinity, tumor characteristics, and immunological conditions. After rigorous calibration using both experimental and clinical data, the model enables consistent translation of drug potency observed under diverse experimental conditions into predictable exposure-response relationships in patients. Moreover, the model can help identify optimal target-binding affinities and minimum efficacious concentrations across different clinical contexts. This QSP approach holds significant promise for the future development of bsTCEs.">

Owing to the rapidly progressing field of CAR-T cell therapy and the lack of generally accepted treatment guidelines, we hypothesized significant differences between European centers in prevention, diagnosis and management of short- and long-term complications. To capture the current CAR-T cell management among EBMT centers and to determine the medical need and specific areas for future clinical research the EBMT Transplant Complications Working Party performed a survey among 227 EBMT CAR-T cell centers. We received complete servey answers from 106 centers (47%) addressing questions in the areas of product selection, CAR-T cell logistics, management of cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome as well as management in later phases including prolonged cytopenias. We identified common patterns in complication management, but also significant variety in clinical management of the centers in important aspects. Our results demonstrate a high medical need for treatment harmonization and future clinical research in the following areas: treatment of steroid-refractory and very severe CRS/neurotoxicity, treatment of cytopenia, early discharge and outpatient management, as well as immunoglobulin substitution.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
We present a phase I/II first-in-human trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of 50 mg and 200 mg doses of linvoseltamab, a B-cell maturation antigen × CD3 bispecific antibody in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).


METHODS
Phase II eligible patients had RRMM that either progressed on/after ≥three lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI), an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), and an anti-CD38 antibody or was triple-class (PI/IMiD/anti-CD38) refractory. Phase II treatment was once a week through week 14 and then once every 2 weeks. Phase II 200 mg patients who achieved a ≥very good partial response by week 24 received linvoseltamab once every 4 weeks. The primary end point in phase II was overall response rate (ORR).


RESULTS
Among the 117 patients treated with 200 mg, the median age was 70 years, 39% had high-risk cytogenetics, and 28% had penta-refractory disease. At a median follow-up of 14.3 months, the ORR was 71%, with 50% achieving ≥complete response (CR). In 104 patients treated with 50 mg at a median follow-up of 7.4 months, the ORR was 48%, with 21% achieving ≥CR. The median duration of response (DOR) for 200 mg patients (n = 83) was 29.4 months (95% CI, 19.2 to not evaluable). Among 200 mg patients, the most common adverse events included cytokine release syndrome (35.0% Gr1, 10.3% Gr2, 0.9% Gr3), neutropenia (0.9% Gr2, 18.8% Gr3, 23.1% Gr4), and anemia (3.4% Gr1, 4.3% Gr2, 30.8% Gr3). Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 7.7% of patients (2.6% each Gr1, Gr2, Gr3). Infections were reported in 74.4% of patients (33.3% Gr3, 2.6% Gr4); infection frequency and severity declined over time.


CONCLUSION
Linvoseltamab 200 mg induced deep and durable responses, with a median DOR of 29.4 months, in patients with RRMM with an acceptable safety profile.">

        <tr id="Although preclinical investigations have shown notable efficacy in solid tumor models utilizing in vitro-differentiated Th17 cells for adoptive cell therapy (ACT), the potential benefits of this strategy in enhancing ACT efficacy in hematological malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), remain unexplored. CLL is a B-cell malignancy with a clinical challenge of increased resistance to targeted therapies. T-cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have demonstrated limited success in CLL, which is attributed to CLL-mediated T-cell dysfunction and skewing toward immunosuppressive phenotypes. Herein, we illustrate the feasibility of polarizing CD4+ T cells from the Eμ-TCL1 murine model, the most representative model for human CLL, into Th17 phenotype, employing a protocol of T-cell activation through the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) alongside a polarizing cytokine mixture. We demonstrate augmented memory properties of in vitro-polarized IL-17-producing T cells, and preliminary in vivo persistence in leukemia-bearing mice. Our findings gain translational relevance through successful viral transduction of Eμ-TCL1 CD4+ T cells with a CD19-targeted CAR construct during in vitro Th17 polarization. Th17 CAR T cells exhibited remarkable persistence upon encountering antigen-expressing target cells. This study represents the first demonstration of the potential of in vitro-differentiated Th17 cells to enhance ACT efficacy in CLL.">

        <tr id="e14589 Background: MAGEA1, identified as a cancer/testis antigen, is highly expression in various solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, but absent in normal tissues except male germ cells and placenta, both of which lacking HLA class molecules. This selective expression of HLA-MAGEA1 epitope makes it a promising target for cancer therapy. However, its intracellular localization poses a challenge for conventional antibodies designed to target surface-expressed antigens. TCR-based T-cell engagers, such as Tebentafusp, overcome this hurdle by targeting intracellular protein-derived peptides presented on cancer cell surfaces via HLA, enabling precise cytotoxic T cell attacks. Notably, Tebentafusp has shown significant clinical benefits by improving survival rates in metastatic uveal melanoma, underscoring the efficacy of TCR-based T-cell engagers in treating MAGEA1-positive tumors. Methods: We have developed an advanced structural format, CR62, consisting of a anti-CD3 single chain fragment, a soluble modified TCR, and an Fc region. Additionally, the use of CorreGene's SMART-TCR system has facilitated the acquisition of TCRs with high affinities in the pico-molar range. By leveraging CR62 and a high-affinity TCR, we have conceptualized the TCR-based T-cell engager, CRPA1A2. Comprehensive preclinical assessments have been conducted to evaluate CRPA1A2's safety and efficacy. Results: CRPA1A2 is designed to specifically target the HLA-A*02:01-restricted MAGEA1 epitope, effectively inhibiting tumor growth. CRPA1A2 is characterized by its exceptional soluble expression in CHO cells, minimal homodimer miss-assembly and simplifying purification. It is strategically engineered with a high-affinity TCR and a low-affinity anti-CD3 scFv to optimize the efficacy and safety. In vitro studies, CRPA1A2 showed strong ability to eliminate tumor cells and induce IFN-γ release, effective even at low MAGEA1 epitope densities, with a therapeutic window that spans over three orders of magnitude, suggesting a 1000-fold greater activity against antigen-positive cancer cells compared to antigen-negative cells. In vivo, using a tumor-bearing mouse model, CRPA1A2 has been shown to recruit T cells into subcutaneous solid tumors, expand CD8+ T cell populations, and significantly reduce tumor mass. Notably, CRPA1A2 has an extended half-life of 120 hours and demonstrates preferential accumulation in tumor tissues, thereby enhancing its therapeutic potential. Moreover, the safety assessments for CRPA1A2 highlight its exceptional specificity, with in vitro studies showing no evidence of off-target toxicity, on-target off-tumor toxicity, or alloreactivity and favorable tolerance in mice during in vivo studies. Conclusions: CRPA1A2 has emerged as a superior TCR-based T-cell engager with exceptional antitumor efficacy and promising safety profile.">

        <tr id="TPS7100 Background: Despite the promising efficacy of CAR-T for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphomas (LBCL), more than 60% of patients will relapse, the majority of which occur in the first 6 months. Approximately 30% of patients with LBCL treated with CAR-T achieve a partial response (PR) on day 30 (D30) PET-CT assessment. Of patients in a D30 PR, 70% will eventually progress, yet the standard of care remains close observation. Early consolidative treatment strategies utilizing therapies with a different mechanism of action may improve outcomes, but there are currently no reliable biomarkers. Epcoritamab (Epco), a bispecific antibody directed against CD20 and CD3, has been approved by the FDA for LBCL patients who relapse after at least 2 lines of therapy. In the phase 2 study, Epco was associated with an overall response rate (ORR) of 63% and a complete response (CR) rate of 39%, including similar responses in a subset of patients who were relapsed 100 days post CAR-T. This study is a trial-in-progress that will evaluate the efficacy of epco compared to observation for patients with LBCLs achieving a PR on D30 post CAR-T PET-CT assessment. Methods: This is an investigator-initiated, randomized, phase II, multicenter, open-label study (NCT06238648) evaluating epco monotherapy for a fixed duration of 12 cycles compared to observation for LBCL patients with D30 PR after standard of care CAR-T. A maximum of 120 patients will be randomized 1:1 to epco or observation across 10 academic centers. Stratification factors include line of CAR-T (second vs third line) and costimulatory domain (CD28 vs 4-1BB). Key inclusion criteria include PET evidence of a D30 PR. non-bulky disease ( <7.5cm), ANC of >1000, hemoglobin >7 g/dL if asymptomatic or >8 if symptomatic, platelet count >50,000. G-CSF, pRBCs and platelet transfusions are allowed. Key exclusion criteria include prior anti CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody therapy, ongoing or uncontrolled CRS or ICANS, and active or symptomatic CNS disease. Epco is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.16mg on day 1, 0.8mg on day 8, prior to full dose of 48mg on day 15. Epco is administered weekly in 28 day cycles (C) for C1-3, on day 1 and 15 of C4-9 and on day 1 of C10-12. PET-CT response is assessed by the 2014 Lugano criteria after 2 cycles, and then every 3 months during active treatment. The primary objective is efficacy, measured as conversion from D30 PR to CR. The secondary endpoints include frequency and severity of treatment emergent adverse events, ORR, duration of response, duration of complete response, progression free survival, event free survival, and overall survival. Peripheral blood samples will be collected pre-treatment and during treatment to assess for biomarkers of response and resistance. The study was activated in January 2024 and recruitment is ongoing.

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by a systemic dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems, leading to an attack on healthy tissues of the body. During the development of SLE, pathogenic features, such as the formation of autoantibodies to self-nuclear antigens, caused tissue damage including necrosis and fibrosis, with an increased expression of type Ⅰ interferon (IFN) regulated genes. Treatment of lupus with immunosuppressants and glucocorticoids, which are used as the standard therapy, is not effective enough and causes side effects. As an alternative, more effective immunotherapies have been developed, including monoclonal and bispecific antibodies that target B cells, T cells, co-stimulatory molecules, cytokines or their receptors, and signaling molecules. Encouraging results have been observed in clinical trials with some of these therapies. Furthermore, a chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as the most effective, safe, and promising treatment option for SLE, as demonstrated by successful pilot studies. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis may play a significant role in the severity of SLE, and the use of methods to normalize the gut microbiota, particularly fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), opens up new opportunities for effective treatment of SLE.">

        <tr id="Objectives The tuning effects of JAK/TYK2 inhibitors on the imbalance between T follicular helper (Tfh) and T regulatory (Treg) cells, related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis, were investigated using human peripheral blood samples. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from untreated patients with SLE and healthy controls were analysed. Tfh1 cells were identified in nephritis tissue, and the effect of Tfh1 cells on B-cell differentiation was examined by coculturing naïve B cells with Tfh1 cells. Results Tfh1 cell numbers were increased in the peripheral blood of patients, and activated Treg cell counts were decreased relative to Tfh1 cell counts. This imbalance in the Tfh to Treg ratio was remarkably pronounced in cases of lupus nephritis, especially in types III and IV active nephritis. Immunohistochemistry revealed Tfh1 cell infiltration in lupus nephritis tissues. Co-culture of Tfh1 cells (isolated from healthy individuals) with naïve B cells elicited greater induction of T-bet+ B cells than controls. In JAK/TYK2-dependent STAT phosphorylation assays using memory CD4+ T cells, IL-12-induced STAT1/4 phosphorylation and Tfh1 cell differentiation were inhibited by both JAK and TYK2 inhibitors. However, phosphorylation of STAT5 by IL-2 and induction of Treg cell differentiation by IL-2+TGFβ were inhibited by JAK inhibitors but not by TYK2 inhibitors, suggesting that TYK2 does not mediate the IL-2 signalling pathway. Conclusions Tfh1 cells can induce T-bet+ B cell production and may contribute to SLE pathogenesis-associated processes. TYK2 inhibitor may fine-tune the immune imbalance by suppressing Tfh1 differentiation and maintaining Treg cell differentiation, thereby preserving IL-2 signalling, unlike other JAK inhibitors.">

        <tr id="e14695 Background: PM1009 is an anti-TIGIT x PVRIG bispecific antibody containing a fully human anti-TIGIT IgG1 fused with a fully human anti-PVRIG scFv at the C terminus. PM1009 can potently block the TIGIT/CD155/CD112 and PVRIG/CD112 signaling pathways, and supports the depletion of TIGIT-positive Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment through FcγR engagement. This leads to the enhancement of T cell and NK cell activity towards the killing of tumor cells. PM1009 showed robust in vitro and in vivo efficacy with good safety in preclinical studies. Methods: This is the first-in-human study of PM1009, which includes a dose escalation stage (accelerated titration & 3+3 design) followed by dose expansion. In the dose escalation stage, PM1009 was administered as flat doses of 120, 300, 600 and 1200 mg for DLT evaluation after 3 weeks followed by administration Q2W. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, and the secondary endpoints were PK, ORR and DCR (per RECIST 1.1). Results: As of February 1, 2024, a total of 12 patients were enrolled for dose escalation and received at least one dose of PM1009, with 3 patients in each of the 120, 300, 600 and 1200 mg dose-levels. Median number of prior therapies was 5 lines (range 1- 9). No DLTs were observed up to 1200 mg. Any-grade TRAEs occurred in 11 patients (91.7%), and ≥ Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 2 patients (16.7%). Any-Grade irAEs occurred in 7 patients (58.3%), and ≥ Grade 3 irAEs occurred in 1 patient (8.3%). Treatment interruption due to TRAE occurred in 2 patients (16.7%), with infusion related reaction (the main symptom was nausea, and the single infusion was eventually completed), and neutrophil count decrease respectively. Treatment discontinuation due to TRAE occurred in 2 patients (16.7%), with acute myocardial infarction, and neutrophil count decrease respectively. The most common TRAEs were ALP elevation (33.3%) and AST elevation (25.0%). 12 patients completed at least one tumor evaluation. The DCR per RECIST 1.1 by investigator was 33.3% (4/12; 95% CI: 9.92 - 65.11), best overall response was SD. Pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional with a terminal half-life of 5.2-7.4 days across the dose range of 120-1200 mg. Conclusions: PM1009 was well-tolerated up to 1200 mg with signs of anti-tumor activity. These findings support further clinical investigation of PM1009 especially for the combination with chemotherapy or PD-1/L1-based checkpoint inhibitors. Clinical trial information: NCT05607563 .">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cell (CAR T-cell) therapy has revolutionized the management of hematological malignancies. In addition to impressive malignancy-related outcomes, CAR T-cell therapy has significant toxicity-related adverse events, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT), and opportunistic infections. Different CAR T-cell targets have different epidemiology and risk factors for infection, and these targets result in different long-term immunodeficiency states due to their distinct on-target and off- tumor effects. These effects are exacerbated by the use of multimodal immunosuppression in the management of CRS and ICANS. The most effective course of action for managing infectious complications involves determining screening, prophylactic, and monitoring strategies and understanding the role of immunoglobulin replacement and re-vaccination strategies. This involves considering the nature of prior immunomodulating therapies, underlying malignancy, the CAR T-cell target, and the development and management of related adverse events. In conclusion, we now have an increasing understanding of infection management for CAR T-cell recipients. As additional effector cells and CAR T-cell targets become available, infection management strategies will continue to evolve.">

        <tr id="e19060 Background: The current treatment regimen for DLBCL consisting of rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone (RCHOP), is challenged by molecular and prognostic characterization of DLBCL. Activated B-cell (ABC) lymphoma has a significantly worse prognosis (5 yr OS rate: 45% - 56%) than germinal center B-cell (GCB) lymphoma (78% - 80%) after RCHOP treatment. Around 40% of patients ultimately relapse and/or develop primary refractory disease, cardiotoxicity and long-term secondary malignancies. Efforts are being made to improve the RCHOP backbone by including dose intensification and by the addition of new agents to increase the efficacy and reduced toxicity of RCHOP (McKelvey EM Cancer 1976; Wilson WH Blood 2002; Molina TJ JCO 2014; Coiffier B Hematology 2016). AVM0703, an immunomodulatory drug, mobilizes bispecific γδ and inv-TCR double-positive novel T and NKT cells. In a previous study employing an aggressive, immune resistant A20 mouse lymphoma model (Bascuas T J Transl Med. 2016), neoadjuvant AVM0703 was additive/synergistic, when cyclophosphamide/fludarabine (CyFlu) was dosed 3 and 24 hr later, with no additional toxicities. In the present study we combined AVM0703 with RCHOP to evaluate the efficacy in A20 mice model. Methods: 10 week old Balb/c mice were injected with 2x106 murine A20 B-cells in the flank and were randomized (1:1 male: female) into 1) Placebo 2) 3 cycles RCHOP 3) 3 cycles AVM0703 (18mg/kg HED) 4) 3 cycles AVM0703+RCHOP, when tumor size reached ~100 mm3. Mice who achieved complete remission (CR) were re-challenged at 21-25 wks later. Pre and post re-challenge, presence of memory cells was analyzed using flow cytometer. All mice were monitored continuously as per the IACUC protocol. Results: Mice treated with the combination of AVM0703+RCHOP achieved superior CR compared to RCHOP alone, which was not curative in any mice. In first phase of the study, 3 out of 11 AVM0703 +RCHOP treated mice showed CR after only 1-cycle. In second phase, 2 of 12 mice survived in CR for >150 days after 3 cycles, whereas no RCHOP mice survived beyond 2 cycles. AVM0703+RCHOP treated mice in long-term CR, had memory cells (CD44hi-Cd62low) pre- and post re-challenge, and no A20 engraftment, suggesting strong immunological memory induced by AVM0703+RCHOP. Conclusions: AVM+RCHOP demonstrated anti-tumor activity in A20 lymphoma mice, with reduced toxicity, compared to RCHOP. Larger preclinical studies are underway to confirm the activity of AVM0703+RCHOP against RCHOP resistant ABC DLBCL, and the potential to reduce total RCHOP exposure to only 3 cycles while maintaining or improving efficacy.

Despite the successes achieved in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), overcoming the toxicity of standard chemotherapy regimens and the treatment of relapsed/refractory (r/r) forms of the disease remains relevant. The most promising option is to use immunotherapy (IT), including a monoclonal antibody blinatumomab (BM). The purpose of the study. To analyze indications of using, as well as efficacy and tolerability of BM in children with V-ALL. Materials and methods. From April 2016 to January 2024 a retrospective assessment of using of BM in children with B-ALL in the chemotherapy department of oncohematological diseases and TCM for children in Almazov National Medical Research Centre was performed. Results. The study included 53 patients, including 28 (53 %) girls and 25 (47 %) boys with median age of 7,7 (2,08–19,8) years. Indications for using of BM were as follows: (1) consolidation of remission (CR) with primary ALL (n = 17, 32 %); (2) persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) (n = 23, 43 %) after completion of chemotherapy (CT) induction or before the stage of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT); (3) replacement of the standard CR due to the previous toxicity of СT or other contraindications to its implementation (n = 12, 23 %); (4) salvage therapy for r/r ALL (n = 1, 1,9 %). The status of MRD-negative remission after the 1st course of IT was achieved in 89 % of cases. Therapy using BM in a patient with the r/r ALL and total blast infiltration of the bone marrow was effective and facilitated reducing the tumor population to 7,2% by day 15 of therapy, however, there was a fatal outcome due to development and progression of preexisted severe infection. The most common variants of grade III–IV toxicity were leuko-/neutropenia (28 %) and neurotoxicity (3,7 %). BM dose reduction for the purpose of relieving toxicity was required in 19 % of patients, while the median days of therapy with dose reduction was 4. Corticosteroids were used for this purpose in 11 % of cases, antibacterial therapy — in 13 %. At the time of results evalution, there were no relapses of the disease in the study group. The article analyzes the international experience of using BM in patients with B-ALL.Conclusion. Our experience and the presented literature data demonstrate a reasonable expansion of indications for using of BM in children with B-ALL with high efficacy and satisfactory toxicity profile.">

This study introduces and characterizes OriA631-B, an innovative CD39/PD-L1 bispecific antibody. By simultaneously targeting the metabolic checkpoint CD39 and the immune checkpoint PD-L1, this novel antibody has the potential to significantly augment anti-tumor efficacy, particularly in cold tumors characterized by a scarcity of infiltrating immune cells. The development of OriA631-B marks a breakthrough in concurrently addressing two crucial immunosuppressive pathways. Methods: The creation of OriA631-B involved cutting-edge antibody engineering methodologies to guarantee optimal binding affinity and specificity for its target antigens, CD39 and PD-L1. With meticulous design and refinement, OriA631-B was developed to exhibit robust binding capabilities to both CD39 and PD-L1, enabling simultaneous and precise recognition. Leveraging advanced antibody engineering techniques was instrumental in crafting OriA631-B as a potent tool with heightened binding properties, broadening its potential applications across diverse therapeutic contexts. Results: In vitro investigations revealed the efficacy of OriA631-B, derived from the foundation of a clinically validated in-house generated PD-L1 antibody (YN035). This innovative antibody effectively thwarted CD39-mediated adenosine production, resulting in heightened effector T cell function and proliferation. In vivo efficacy assessments conducted on syngeneic hot tumor models MC38 and Hepa1-6 underscored the remarkable effectiveness of OriA631, the CD39 monoclonal antibody (mAb), in controlling tumor growth. Notably, OriA631-B, the CD39/PD-L1 bispecific antibody, exhibited even more profound impacts, significantly restraining tumor growth beyond the effects observed with single-target treatments in the hot tumor model or combination therapies in both the hot tumor model MC38 and the cold tumor model CT26. These findings underscore the potent therapeutic potential of OriA631-B and its capacity to exert robust anti-tumor activity by concurrently targeting CD39 and PD-L1. Additionally, safety profiling revealed an acceptable toxicity profile for OriA631-B, with no significant adverse events observed during the study. Conclusions: In summary, OriA631-B demonstrates potential as an innovative immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment by concurrently targeting CD39-mediated immune suppression and PD-L1-mediated T cell exhaustion. Further exploration, including clinical trials, is imperative to fully uncover the therapeutic capabilities of this groundbreaking bispecific antibody in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a plasma cell disorder distinguished from multiple myeloma (MM) by the degree of organ involvement due to tissue deposition of misfolded proteins. Treatments for AL amyloidosis have largely been borrowed from those developed for patients with MM. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has historically been associated with the best outcomes. The recent incorporation of daratumumab into up front therapy represents a significant advance and has changed the treatment paradigm, calling into question the role of ASCT. The development of very active novel immune and cellular therapies, specifically B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed therapies, has similarly been transformative for patients with MM and is now being studied in patients with AL amyloidosis. These include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, bispecific antibodies, and antibody drug conjugates. Although limited, preliminary data in patients with relapsed and refractory AL amyloidosis are showing promising results, and it is expected that the treatment landscape for AL amyloidosis will continue to evolve. Particular attention to safety, potential for organ recovery, and quality of life will be important when evaluating new treatments and/or treatment paradigms.">

        <tr id="Multiple chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell and bispecific antibody (bsAb) therapies have been approved, demonstrating impressive clinical efficacy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Currently, these treatment share overlapping approval indications in the relapsed/refractory space, highlighting the importance of optimal selection and sequencing to maximize clinical efficacy. For patients previously unexposed to T-cell-directed therapies, several factors should be weighed when both options are available. These factors include access and logistical challenges associated with CAR T-cell therapy, disease-specific factors such as tempo of disease relapse, in addition to patient-specific factors such as frailty, and distinct toxicity profiles across these agents. Sequential therapy, whether it involves CAR T-cell therapy followed by bsAb or vice versa, has demonstrated clinical efficacy. When sequencing these agents, it is crucial to consider various factors that contribute to treatment resistance with careful selection of treatments for subsequent therapy in order to achieve favorable long-term patient outcomes.">

Autoimmune blistering diseases have a high morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic apheresis is an essential supportive treatment for severe and refractory dermatological diseases with an immunologic origin, particularly autoimmune blistering diseases. This approach has been shown to significantly improve the prognosis of these diseases. Therapeutic apheresis, combined with immunosuppressive therapy and/or human monoclonal antibodies, has treated successfully autoimmune blistering skin disorders. These diseases are caused by the immune system’s targeting of structural proteins in the skin and/or mucous membranes. Improved diagnostic methods have allowed to determine that the incidence and prevalence of these disorders have doubled in the last 15 years to 25 new cases per million people per year owing to an aging population. Over the last 45 years, therapeutic apheresis, in combination with immunosuppression and/or human monoclonal antibodies, has significantly increased survival rates. Therapeutic apheresis using hollow fiber modules is safe and highly effective in eliminating autoantibodies and other toxins from the bloodstream, leading to rapid clinical improvement in dermatological conditions.

        <tr id="Objective Resolvin D1 (RvD1) is one of the specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, which control inflammation resolution and regulate immune responses. Previous research showed that RvD1 could block the progression of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the detailed mechanism remains to be fully understood. Method Plasma RvD1 levels, and proportions of T follicular helper cells (Tfh cells) were measured in SLE patients and healthy controls. Plasma RvD1 levels and proportions of Tfh cells were quantitated in an MRL/lpr mouse model of lupus treated with RvD1. Naïve CD4+ T cells were purified from MRL/lpr mice to study the effect of RvD1 on Tfh cell differentiation in vitro. Results In patients, there were significant negative correlations between plasma RvD1 levels and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, as well as between plasma RvD1 and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels, and numbers of peripheral Tfh cells and plasma cells. In MRL/lpr mice, the expected amelioration of disease phenotype and inflammatory response with RvD1 treatment correlated with decreased percentages of Tfh cells and plasma cells. In addition, the differentiation and proliferation of Tfh cells were markedly suppressed by RvD1 in vitro. Conclusion RvD1 may control SLE progression through the suppression of Tfh cell differentiation and subsequent inhibition of B-cell responses.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
 In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy across diverse malignancies. Notably, in patients with advanced gastric cancer, the use of programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade has significantly prolonged overall survival, marking a pivotal advancement comparable to the impact of Herceptin over the past two decades. While the therapeutic benefits of ICIs are evident, the increasing use of immunotherapy has led to an increase in immune-related adverse events.
 CASE SUMMARY
 This article presents the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer and chronic plaque psoriasis. Following sintilimab therapy, the patient developed severe rashes accompanied by cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Fortunately, effective management was achieved through the administration of glucocorticoid, tocilizumab, and acitretin, which resulted in favorable outcomes.
 CONCLUSION
 Glucocorticoid and tocilizumab therapy was effective in managing CRS after PD-1 blockade therapy for gastric cancer in a patient with chronic plaque psoriasis.">

        <tr id="TPS5632 Background: Mucin 16 (MUC16) is a cell surface glycoprotein that is overexpressed in ovarian cancer (OC) and endometrial cancer (EC). Ubamatamab is a MUC16 × cluster of differentiation 3 (MUC16×CD3) bispecific antibody that bridges MUC16 on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells to promote T-cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Cemiplimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor, enhanced MUC16×CD3 activity in preclinical models. In Phase 1 of this first-in-human study (NCT03564340), ubamatamab alone and in combination with cemiplimab demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, durable clinical activity across a range of doses, and linear pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients (pts) with recurrent OC (Liu et al. IGCS 2023. Plenary 03). Phase 2 will assess the efficacy of ubamatamab alone and in combination with cemiplimab in pts with recurrent OC. Ubamatamab will also be evaluated for recurrent advanced or metastatic EC that is MUC16+. Methods: For individuals with recurrent OC, elevated serum cancer antigen (CA)-125 ≥2× the upper limit of normal, and up to four prior lines of cytotoxic therapy, weekly dosing of ubamatamab alone or in combination with cemiplimab will be evaluated in monotherapy and combination therapy expansion cohorts. A Phase 2 cohort will also be randomized 1:1:1 to receive ubamatamab 250 mg IV Q3W or 800 mg IV Q3W or ubamatamab 250 mg IV Q3W + cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W. For the EC cohort (≥25% of tumor cells MUC16+, as assessed by immunohistochemistry [IHC]) pts with advanced or metastatic EC that has progressed or is recurrent after prior anti–PD-1 therapy and prior platinum-based chemotherapy will be enrolled. The initial EC cohort will receive ubamatamab 250 mg IV Q3W. Based upon observed safety and activity, additional cohorts may be enrolled to receive ubamatamab 800 mg IV Q3W and/or ubamatamab 250 mg IV Q3W + cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W. To limit the risk of cytokine release syndrome, all pts will receive ubamatamab once-weekly step-up dosing prior to addition of cemiplimab and/or Q3W dosing. Expansion cohorts will use a Simon 2-stage study design, with an interim analysis after the first 20 pts. Any treatment arm with ≥3 objective responses may be expanded to 50 pts. In Phase 2, the primary endpoint will be the objective response rate for each arm (RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints include duration of response and progression-free survival, safety, PK, and change from baseline in quality of life. Exploratory objectives include clinical correlation with serum CA-125, MUC16 IHC, and immune markers. The study is currently enrolling to these OC and EC expansion cohorts.

        <tr id="Bispecific and multispecific agents have become increasingly utilized in cancer treatment and immunotherapy, yet their complex design parameters present a challenge in developing successful therapeutics. Bispecifics that crosslink receptors on two opposing cells can provide specific activation of a receptor only when these cells are in close spatial proximity, such as an immune cell and cancer cell in a tumor. These agents, including T cell activating bispecifics, can avoid off-tumor toxicity through activation only in the tumor microenvironment by utilizing a tumor target to cluster T-cell receptors for a selective costimulatory signal. Here, we investigate a panel of PD-1/CD137 targeted Humabody VH domains to determine the key factors for T cell activation, such as affinity, valency, expression level, domain orientation, and epitope location. Target expression is a dominant factor determining both specificity and potency of T cell activation. Given an intrinsic expression level, the affinity can be tuned to modulate the level of activation and IC50 and achieve specificity between low and high expression levels. Changing the epitope location and linker length showed minor improvements to activation at low expression levels, but increasing the valency for the target decreased activation at all expression levels. By combining non-overlapping epitopes for the target, we achieved higher receptor activation at low expression levels. A kinetic model was able to capture these trends, offering support for the mechanistic interpretation. This work provides a framework to quantify factors for T cell activation by cell-crosslinking bispecific agents and guiding principles for the design of new agents.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy for the treatment of neurological autoimmune diseases is promising, but CAR T cell kinetics and immune alterations after treatment are poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell multi-omics sequencing of paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) treated with anti–B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T cells. Proliferating cytotoxic-like CD8+ CAR T cell clones were identified as the main effectors in autoimmunity. Anti-BCMA CAR T cells with enhanced features of chemotaxis efficiently crossed the blood-CSF barrier, eliminated plasmablasts and plasma cells in the CSF, and suppressed neuroinflammation. The CD44-expressing early memory phenotype in infusion products was potentially associated with CAR T cell persistence in autoimmunity. Moreover, CAR T cells from patients with NMOSD displayed distinctive features of suppressed cytotoxicity compared with those from hematological malignancies. Thus, we provide mechanistic insights into CAR T cell function in patients with neurological autoimmune disease. CAR T cells display distinctive profiles and actions in patients with CNS autoimmunity. Editor’s summary Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a promising avenue for the treatment of autoimmunity, but how these cells work in vivo is poorly understood. Qin et al. performed a single-cell multi-omics analysis of longitudinal blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from five patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) undergoing treatment with anti–B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T cells. They characterized CAR T cell expansion and function and found that peak expansion occurred within 10 days. Moreover, persistent CSF-infiltrating CAR T clones were CXCR3+ and exhibited an enhanced chemotactic transcriptional program. Last, Qin et al. observed that CAR T cells taken from treated patients with NMOSD were less cytotoxic than CAR T cells taken from treated patients with myeloma and patients with B cell lymphoma. These findings may help optimize future immunotherapies for autoimmune disorders. —Seth Thomas Scanlon">

        <tr id="Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) constitute the backbone of modern acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis regimens but have limited efficacy in the prevention and treatment of chronic GVHD (cGVHD). We investigated the effect of CNIs on immune tolerance after stem cell transplantation with discovery-based single-cell gene expression and T cell receptor (TCR) assays of clonal immunity in tandem with traditional protein-based approaches and preclinical modeling. While cyclosporin and tacrolimus suppressed the clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells during GVHD, alloreactive CD4+ T cell clusters were preferentially expanded. Moreover, CNIs mediated reversible dose-dependent suppression of T cell activation and all stages of donor T cell exhaustion. Critically, CNIs promoted the expansion of both polyclonal and TCR-specific alloreactive central memory CD4+ T cells (TCM) with high self-renewal capacity that mediated cGVHD following drug withdrawal. In contrast to posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy), CSA was ineffective in eliminating IL-17A–secreting alloreactive T cell clones that play an important role in the pathogenesis of cGVHD. Collectively, we have shown that, although CNIs attenuate aGVHD, they paradoxically rescue alloantigen-specific TCM, especially within the CD4+ compartment in lymphoid and GVHD target tissues, thus predisposing patients to cGVHD. These data provide further evidence to caution against CNI-based immune suppression without concurrent approaches that eliminate alloreactive T cell clones.">

        <tr id="5096 Background: High-risk prostate cancer (HR-PCa) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Previous studies reported that a high density of immunosuppressive B cells in HR-PCa resection specimens was found to correlate with biochemical failure. In this context, a single arm prospective study assessing neoadjuvant rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody used to deplete B cells, was previously conducted on patients with HR-PCa eligible for radical prostatectomy (“PROTUX”). Here, we performed deep TCR sequencing to elucidate the impact of B cell depletion on T cells in prostate cancer patients. Methods: A single arm study enrolled patients with HR-PCa to receive neoadjuvant rituximab prior to radical prostatectomy (NCT: 01804712). Patients were treated with rituximab 375 mg/m2 once weekly for 4 treatments followed by prostatectomy within 14 days of the final treatment of rituximab. A matched cohort of patients with HR-PCa who underwent prostatectomy without any prior therapy were used as controls. Specimens from 14 patients were retrieved and genomic DNA was isolated using a QIAamp DNA FFPE Advanced UNG kit. TCR sequencing was performed with Adaptive Biotechnologies using the Ultradeep TCRB v4b assay. Data were then analyzed using the Adaptive immunoSEQ Analyzer. Groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analysis and graphing were done in Prism 10 and R. Results: We observed that patients treated with rituximab had higher TCRb productive clonality (0.080 vs 0.026, p = 0.03). Strikingly, the calculated number of T cells present in prostatectomy samples was significantly greater in patients receiving rituximab compared to controls (1.18 cells/ng DNA input vs 0.10 cells/ng, p = 0.002). Maximum productive frequency and the cumulative frequency of the top 10 clones were not significantly different between the two cohorts. However, we found that the T cells from patients who received rituximab had longer TCRb CDR3 regions (proportion CDR3 ≥16 amino acids of 0.232 vs 0.197, p = 0.007), suggesting a less antigen-experienced phenotype. Conclusions: Using specimens from a clinical trial assessing the use of neoadjuvant rituximab in HR-PCa, we found that B cell depletion can significantly affect T cell infiltration, clonality, and phenotype. Given the increasing appreciation for crosstalk between T cells and B cells in mediating anti-tumor immune responses, these findings suggest a context dependent role of B-cells in patients with HR-PCa.

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
CAR-T cell therapy, emerging as an efficient treatment option for patients with secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, is frequently complicated with immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).


CASE PRESENTATION
We report a case of a 64-year-old woman with transformed follicular lymphoma, developing high-grade ICANS with eosinophilic pleocytosis following third-line therapy with CAR-T cells (tisagenlecleucel). During bridging therapy, she declined neurologically and was diagnosed with secondary CNS lymphoma. She received methotrexate-cytarabine-thiotepa-rituximab regimen with clinical and radiological improvement. Post-CAR-T cell infusion she developed cytokine release syndrome grade II and ICANS grade III. Given the lack of response to steroids, anakinra was initiated with complete ICANS resolution. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, performed only on day +10 due to thrombocytopenia, revealed eosinophils, while infections were excluded.


CONCLUSION
This report emphasizes the importance of CSF analysis in individuals with CAR-T-related neurotoxicity for elucidating the role of specific immune cells in such complications.">

        <tr id="7027 Background: Approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies targeting CD19 with a single co-stimulatory domain in the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL) may face challenges including drug resistance and disease recurrence. This Phase 1 study was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY007, a novel CD20-targeting CAR-T cell containing both OX40 and 4-1BB co-stimulatory domains to enhance CAR-T cell proliferation and anti-cancer cytotoxicity, for the treatment of r/r B-NHL pts. Methods: In this open-label, single-arm phase 1 trial, r/r B-NHL pts were infused with LY007 in 3 dose levels (DLs) (DL1, 0.5 x 106 cells/ kg; DL2, 1.5 x 106 cells/ kg; DL3, 5.0 x 106 cells/ kg) based on a standard 3+3 dose escalation design after cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion. The main objectives were to determine the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of LY007. The key eligibility criteria included pts with cytologically or histologically confirmed CD20 positive r/r B-NHL according to WHO 2016 including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL). Results: As of December 25th, 2023, 9 pts were treated with single LY007 infusions at 3 dose levels with a median follow-up of 5.09 (range 0.92-18.10) months. The median age of treated pts was 65 years (range, 44 to 69), and 44% (4/9) of pts had received three prior lines of therapy. Their B-NHL subtypes were all DLBCL. Among the treated pts, 78% (7/9) relapsed after prior lines of treatment, 89% (8/9) had extranodal involvement, 78% (7/9) had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of ≥ 2, and 44% (4/9) had a maximum tumor length of ≥ 5 cm. The overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) were 67% (6/9) and 33% (3/9) at day28, 83% (5/6), and 67% (4/6) at month 3 of the pts evaluable for efficacy. Among all study participants, the best reported ORR was 89% (8/9). The longest duration of remission was 12.3 months to date. The overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 100% and 88.9% at 6 months, respectively. The LY007 was generally well tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. And no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) or G3+ cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported. The most common G3+ AEs were lymphopenia (9/9), leukopenia (9/9), and neutropenia (7/9). No pts discontinued, withdrew, or died due to AE. 6 pts experienced G1/2 CRS. Pts at all 3 dose levels had good CAR-T expansion and long-term persistence, particularly in the LD3 cohort, where the highest mean cell copy number of 93,750 copies/μg DNA was achieved at day 11 and was still detectable to date. Conclusions: This phase 1 trial demonstrated that LY007 was well tolerated at the dose levels up to 5.0 x 106 cells/ kg and showed a favorable dose-response relationship for the treatment of r/r B-NHL. Clinical trial information: NCT06279611.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptors are synthetically produced receptors engineered to engage with target cells with high specificity. These cells are created by inserting an artificial T-cell receptor into an immunoglobulin’s antigen-binding region, allowing the cells to combine and target specific antigens. The use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has been a remarkable achievement in the field of immunotherapy, particularly in the treatment of ophthalmic tumors like retinoblastoma and uveal melanoma. However, there are some documented side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immunological effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Additionally, ocular side effects such as blurred vision, vision impairment, and intraocular infections are also concerning and require further evaluation. This review highlights the advances made in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapy, including its structure and manufacture, as well as relevant clinical discoveries and associated adverse effects. By identifying the gaps in current research, this analysis provides insights into potential strategies and solutions for addressing some of the most severe side effects.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by persistent activation of immune cells and overproduction of autoantibodies. The accumulation of senescent T and B cells has been observed in SLE and other immune‐mediated diseases. However, the exact mechanistic pathways contributing to this process in SLE remain incompletely understood. In this study, we found that in SLE patients: (1) the frequency of CD4+CD57+ senescent T cells was significantly elevated and positively correlated with disease activity; (2) the expression levels of B‐lymphoma‐2 (BCL‐2) family and interferon‐induced genes (ISGs) were significantly upregulated; and (3) in vitro, the cytokine IL‐15 stimulation increased the frequency of senescent CD4+ T cells and upregulated the expression of BCL‐2 family and ISGs. Further, treatment with ABT‐263 (a senolytic BCL‐2 inhibitor) in MRL/lpr mice resulted in decreased: (1) frequency of CD4+CD44hiCD62L−PD‐1+CD153+ senescent CD4+ T cells; (2) frequency of CD19+CD11c+T‐bet+ age‐related B cells; (3) level of serum antinuclear antibody; (4) proteinuria; (5) frequency of Tfh cells; and (6) renal histopathological abnormalities. Collectively, these results indicated a dominant role for CD4+CD57+ senescent CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of SLE and senolytic BCL‐2 inhibitor ABT‐263 may be the potential treatment in ameliorating lupus phenotypes.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy caused by the clonal expansion of immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or extramedullary sites. Common manifestations of MM include anemia, renal dysfunction, infection, bone pain, hypercalcemia, and fatigue. Despite numerous recent advancements in the MM treatment paradigm, current therapies demonstrate limited long-term effectiveness and eventual disease relapse remains exceedingly common. Myeloma cells often develop drug resistance through clonal evolution and alterations of cellular signaling pathways. Therefore, continued research of new targets in MM is crucial to circumvent cumulative drug resistance, overcome treatment-limiting toxicities, and improve outcomes in this incurable disease. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the landscape of novel treatments and emerging therapies for MM grouped by molecular target. Molecular targets outlined include BCMA, GPRC5D, FcRH5, CD38, SLAMF7, BCL-2, kinesin spindle protein, protein disulfide isomerase 1, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, Sec61 translocon, and cyclin-dependent kinase 6. Immunomodulatory drugs, NK cell therapy, and proteolysis-targeting chimera are described as well.">

        <tr id="e19013 Background: Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are emerging as a promising new immunotherapy modality in patients with lymphoma. Mosunetuzumab is a CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific monoclonal antibody that redirects T cells to eliminate malignant B cells, was first to receive approval for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. Here, we report the safety and efficacy of Mosunetuzumab as a first line therapy in combination or monotherapy regimen in non-hodgkin lymphoma. Methods: A literature search was performed on PubMed with keywords for “Mosunetuzumab” AND “lymphoma”. The search was performed from the inception of data till 1/1/2024. A total of 237 articles were screened and three non-randomized clinical trials (nRCTs, N=124) were included. PRISMA guidelines were followed while conducting this systematic review. Results: In 3 clinical trials, 54 patients were treated with mosunetuzumab monotherapy, 40 with mosunetuzumab + cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), and 30 with subcutaneous mosunetuzumab. 94 patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and 30 patients had follicular lymphoma. ORR, CR, and PR were reported in 56%, 43%, and 13% patients, respectively, treated with mosunetuzumab monotherapy in DLBCL. ORR, CR, and PR were reported in 87.5%, 85%, and 2.5% patients, respectively, treated with mosunetuzumab + CHOP in DLBCL. ORR, CR, and PR were reported in 96%, 83%, and 12.5% patients, respectively, treated with subcutaneous mosunetuzumab in follicular lymphoma. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infections, and fatigue were common adverse effects given in the table. Conclusions: Mosunetuzumab with CHOP showed higher efficacy results and was well tolerated by most of the patients and can be an option to achieve high response rates in DLBCL. Subcutaneous mosunetuzumab was active in follicular lymphoma with manageable toxicity in follicular lymphoma. However, long-term results are needed to determine the durability of responses and long-term safety and survival rates with these regimens. [Table: see text]">

        <tr id="TPS5112 Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies but application of CAR T cell therapy in solid malignancies remains a high priority. We previously demonstrated initial safety of a PSCA CAR T cells in patients with mCRPC following a reduced lymphodepletion regimen (LD) in a phase 1 trial (NCT03873805). There was preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity (Dorff 2023) but escalation was not pursued due to concerns of toxicity. Additional dose exploration is needed. Preclinical work suggests that radiation therapy directed to tumor sites modifies the tumor microenvironment providing rationale for combining metastasis directed radiation therapy (MDRT) with CAR T cell therapy. The phase 1b dose exploration study aims to test a multi-dose strategy and whether the addition of MDRT could further enhance response. Methods: This is a single-center, open-label, phase Ib trial for patients with PSCA+ mCRPC. Key inclusion criteria are a diagnosis of mCRPC with evaluable disease, at least one area of metastasis amenable for radiation (for the MDRT cohort), PSCA expression by immunohistochemistry on archival tissue, and prior progression on abiraterone or enzalutamide or both; prior taxane chemotherapy is allowed. The primary objective will be to assess the feasibility, safety, and activity of PSCA CAR T cell therapy. Primary endpoints will include evaluation of toxicity through DLT’s and activity through rate of PSA50 and objective responses. Secondary endpoints will include overall survival, progression-free survival (PCWG3 criteria), measurement of CAR T cell and cytokine kinetics, and T cell infiltration in pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies. Exploratory endpoints will include phenotypes and frequencies of immune cell subsets in peripheral blood pre- and post-therapy, gene expression of CTCs, CAR immunogenicity by the presence of anti CAR antibodies or T cell mediated immune responses, urine analysis, cfDNA whole exome sequencing, and phenotype tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. This study includes 2 treatment plans (TP). The participants on TP 1 will receive 50 million PSCA CAR T cells every 2 weeks for up to 6 doses after LD chemotherapy. Based on these results, the number of cycles of CAR T will be determined for TP2. Participants on TP 2 will receive PSCA CAR T therapy after MDRT and LD. The first 3 participants on each TP will be staggered, all further participants will be treated in cohorts of 3. Toxicities will be monitored based on a Wald sequential probability ratio test. Rates and associated 90% Clopper and Pearson binomial confidence limits will be estimated for DLTs within the DLT period, disease response based on PSA50/RECIST/PCWG3 criteria, PFS at 6 months, and OS at 1 year. The results will be used to identify the optimal strategy to move to phase 2. The study is currently open to enrollment. Clinical trial information: NCT05805371 .">

        <tr id="Inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO), a novel therapeutic drug for relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RR)‑(ALL), is a humanized anti‑cluster of differentiation (CD) 22 monoclonal antibody conjugated with calicheamicin that causes DNA single‑ and double‑strand breaks. Although the efficacy of IO is significantly improved compared with that of conventional chemotherapies, the prognosis for RR‑ALL remains poor, highlighting the need for more effective treatment strategies. The present study examined the role of DNA damage repair inhibition using the poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors olaparib or talazoparib on the enhancement of the antitumor effects of IO on B‑ALL cells in vitro. The Reh, Philadelphia (Ph)‑B‑ALL and the SUP‑B15 Ph+ B‑ALL cell lines were used for experiments. Both cell lines were ~90% CD22+. The half‑maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of IO were 5.3 and 49.7 ng/ml for Reh and SUP‑B15 cells, respectively. The IC50 values of IO combined with minimally toxic concentrations of olaparib or talazoparib were 0.8 and 2.9 ng/ml for Reh cells, respectively, and 36.1 and 39.6 ng/ml for SUP‑B15 cells, respectively. The combination index of IO with olaparib and talazoparib were 0.19 and 0.56 for Reh cells and 0.76 and 0.89 for SUP‑B15 cells, demonstrating synergistic effects in all combinations. Moreover, the addition of minimally toxic concentrations of PARP inhibitors augmented IO‑induced apoptosis. The alkaline comet assay, which quantitates the amount of DNA strand breaks, was used to investigate the degree to which DNA damage observed 1 h after IO administration was repaired 6 h later, reflecting successful repair of DNA strand breaks. However, DNA strand breaks persisted 6 h after IO administration combined with olaparib or talazoparib, suggesting inhibition of the repair processes by PARP inhibitors. Adding olaparib or talazoparib thus synergized the antitumor effects of IO by inhibiting DNA strand break repair via the inhibition of PARP.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective first-line therapy for solid cancers. However, low response rate and acquired resistance over time has led to the need for additional therapeutic options. Here, we evaluated synergistic anti-tumor efficacy of EGFR x MET targeting bispecific antibody, amivantamab with PD-L1 immunotherapy, pembrolizumab in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tumor bearing humanized PDX models. We demonstrated that pembrolizumab or amivantamab alone was ineffective and that combination treatment induced a significant reduction of tumor growth in both models (p<0.0001 and p<0.01, respectively). It appeared that combination of amivantamab and pembrolizumab significantly enhanced infiltration of granzyme B-producing CD8 T cells was in the TME of HNSCC PDX (p<0.01), and enhanced neoantigen-associated central memory CD8 T cells in circulating immune cells. Analysis of single cell RNA transcriptomics suggested that the tumor cells dramatically upregulated EGFR and MET in response to PD-L1 immunotherapy, potentially creating a metabolic state fit for tumor persistence in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and rendered pembrolizumab ineffective. We demonstrated that EGFRHIGHMETHIGH subcluster displayed an increased expression of genes implicated in production of lactate (SLC16A3 and LDHA) compared to the EGFRLOWMETLOW cluster. Accumulation of lactate in the TME has been associated with immunosuppression by hindering the infiltration of tumor killing CD8 T and NK cells. This study proved that amivantamab reduced glycolytic markers in the EGFRHIGHMETHIGH subcluster including SLC16A3 and LDHA and highlighted remodeling of the TME by combination treatment, providing rationale for additional therapy of amivantamab with PD-1 immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Treatment with autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has emerged as a highly effective approach in neuroimmunological disorders such as myasthenia gravis. We report a case of successful anti-CD19 CAR T cell use in treatment-refractory stiff-person syndrome (SPS). To investigate clinical and immunological effects of anti-CD19 CAR T cell use in treatment-refractory SPS, a 69-y-old female with a 9-y history of treatment-refractory SPS with deteriorating episodes of stiffness received an infusion of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells (KYV-101) and was monitored clinically and immunologically for more than 6 mo. CAR T cell infusion resulted in reduced leg stiffness, drastic improvement in gait, walking speed increase over 100%, and daily walking distance improvement from less than 50 m to over 6 km within 3 mo. GABAergic medication (benzodiazepines) was reduced by 40%. KYV-101 CAR T cells were well tolerated with only low-grade cytokine release syndrome. This report of successful use of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in treatment-refractory SPS supports continued exploration of this approach in SPS and other B cell–related autoimmune disorders.">

        <tr id="B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator (BTLA) is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed by most immune cells, playing a role in negatively regulating immune responses. Studies in MRL/lpr lupus mice deficient for BTLA, indicate that BTLA has a protective role in lupus. We have previously shown an altered BTLA expression by regulatory T cells and an impaired capacity of BTLA to inhibit CD4+ T cell activation in lupus patients. In this study, we thoroughly analyzed BTLA expression and function in the NZB/W lupus-mouse model. We found that diseased NZB/W mice exhibit a BTLA expression and function pattern similar to that observed in lupus patients, emphasizing the importance of this mouse model in evaluating the therapeutic potential of targeting BTLA. Administration of a monoclonal anti-BTLA antibody (clone 6F7, which displays agonist properties ex vivo) into pre-diseased NZB/W mice resulted in a delayed onset of proteinuria, limited kidney damages and an increased survival rate compared to isotype-treated mice. This beneficial effect was associated with a decrease in circulating B cell frequency and required continuous exposure to the antibody. Regarding its mode of action, we demonstrated that the 6F7 antibody is not a depleting antibody and does not block HVEM binding to BTLA, but instead induces BTLA down modulation, leading to a selective reduction of follicular B cell numbers, and exhibits in vivo agonist activity. Overall, our data confirm the involvement of BTLA in lupus pathogenesis and provide the first evidence that BTLA is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of lupus.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy produces high response rates in refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but long-term data are minimal to date. Here, we present long-term follow-up of a pilot trial testing a CD20-targeting 3rd generation CAR in patients with relapsed B-cell lymphomas following cyclophosphamide-only lymphodepletion. Two of the 3 patients in the trial, with mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, had remissions lasting more than 7 years, though they ultimately relapsed. The absence of B cell aplasia in both patients suggested a lack of functional CAR T cell persistence, leading to the hypothesis that endogenous immune responses were responsible for these long remissions. Correlative immunologic analyses supported this hypothesis, with evidence of new humoral and cellular anti-tumor immune responses proximal to clinical response time points. Collectively, our results suggest that CAR T cell therapy may facilitate epitope spreading and endogenous immune response formation in lymphomas.">

        <tr id="Introduction Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) can simultaneously target two epitopes of different antigenic targets, bringing possibilities for diversity in antibody drug design and are promising tools for the treatment of cancers and other diseases. T-cell engaging bsAb is an important application of the bispecific antibody, which could promote T cell-mediated tumor cell killing by targeting tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and CD3 at the same time. Methods This study comprised antibodies purification, Elisa assay for antigen binding, cytotoxicity assays, T cell activation by flow cytometry in vitro and xenogenic tumor model in vivo. Results We present a novel bsAb platform named PHE-Ig technique to promote cognate heavy chain (HC)-light chain (LC) pairing by replacing the CH1/CL regions of different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the natural A and B chains of PHE1 fragment of Integrin β2 based on the knob-in-hole (KIH) technology. We had also verified that PHE-Ig technology can be effectively used as a platform to synthesize different desired bsAbs for T-cell immunotherapy. Especially, BCMA×CD3 PHE-Ig bsAbs exhibited robust anti-multiple myeloma (MM) activity in vitro and in vivo. Discussion Moreover, PHE1 domain was further shortened with D14G and R41S mutations, named PHE-S, and the PHE-S-based BCMA×CD3 bsAbs also showed anti BCMA+ tumor effect in vitro and in vivo, bringing more possibilities for the development and optimization of different bsAbs. To sum up, PHE1-based IgG-like antibody platform for bsAb construction provides a novel strategy for enhanced T-cell immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease in which multiple organs are damaged by the immune system. Although standard treatment options such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), glucocorticoids (GCs), and other immunosuppressive or immune-modulating agents can help to manage symptoms, they do not offer a cure. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of novel drugs and therapies. In recent decades, cell therapies have been used for the treatment of SLE with encouraging results. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, mesenchymal stem cells, regulatory T (Treg) cell, natural killer cells, and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells are advanced cell therapies which have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials in humans. In clinical application, each of these approaches has shown advantages and disadvantages. In addition, further studies are necessary to conclusively establish the safety and efficacy of these therapies. This review provides a summary of recent clinical trials investigating cell therapies for SLE treatment, along with a discussion on the potential of other cell-based therapies. The factors influencing the selection of common cell therapies for individual patients are also highlighted.">

        <tr id="Currently, therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor-T Cell (CAR-T) and immune checkpoint inhibitors like programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) blockers are showing promising results for numerous cancer patients. However, significant advancements are required before CAR-T therapies become readily available as off-the-shelf treatments, particularly for solid tumors and lymphomas. In this review, we have systematically analyzed the combination therapy involving engineered CAR-T cells and anti PD-1 agents. This approach aims at overcoming the limitations of current treatments and offers potential advantages such as enhanced tumor inhibition, alleviated T-cell exhaustion, heightened T-cell activation, and minimized toxicity. The integration of CAR-T therapy, which targets tumor-associated antigens, with PD-1 blockade augments T-cell function and mitigates immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment. To assess the impact of combination therapy on various tumors and lymphomas, we categorized them based on six major tumor-associated antigens: mesothelin, disialoganglioside GD-2, CD-19, CD-22, CD-133, and CD-30, which are present in different tumor types. We evaluated the efficacy, complete and partial responses, and progression-free survival in both pre-clinical and clinical models. Additionally, we discussed potential implications, including the feasibility of combination immunotherapies, emphasizing the importance of ongoing research to optimize treatment strategies and improve outcomes for cancer patients. Overall, we believe combining CAR-T therapy with PD-1 blockade holds promise for the next generation of cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="TPS6115 Background: Despite the excitement and approval of anti-PD1 therapy in first line setting of patients with aHNSCC, prognosis remains poor, with the majority experiencing disease progression after therapy. Consequently, novel strategies to improve treatment activity represent a critical and unmet need for this patient population. Cell therapies offer the advantage of a more personalized therapy for patients over standard immune checkpoint inhibitors. Historically, cell therapies have relied on bulk products that may not effectively select a tumor-reactive T cell population. TBio-4101 is produced by an industrialized manufacturing approach leveraging single-cell sorting of patient-specific neoepitope-reactive TIL with the potential to address immunologically ‘cold’ tumors. The TBio-4101 process specifically enriches polyclonal, polyfunctional, tumor-reactive T cells with an endogenous neoantigen-reactive T cell receptor repertoire that can target multiple tumor antigens. Non-tumor-reactive bystander T cells, which may negatively impact treatment efficacy via product dilution, and typically account for ≥90% of bulk TIL, are substantially reduced by this process. Inspired by the early academic clinically efficacious NCI selection and enrichment strategies (Tran et al 2014, 2016; Zacharakis et al, 2022), TBio-4101 is refined to better identify and potentially enrich to >70% tumor-reactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (median < 3% in bulk TIL). Methods: This is a Phase 1b, open-label, single-center study of TBio-4101 and pembrolizumab. Eligible patients are 18 to 75 years of age with aHNSCC. Prior to receiving pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy as first line standard-of-care (SOC), these patients undergo tumor harvest for TILs followed by apheresis to collect monocytes. TILs are isolated from the tumor and expanded in vitro. Patient-specific neoepitopes are defined by whole exome and RNA sequencing of tumor versus germline to manufacture a peptide pool representing potential tumor-specific mutations. Monocytes isolated from apheresis are differentiated into dendritic cells, pulsed with the neoepitope peptides, and co-cultured with the TILs. Tumor-reactive T cells are specifically activated and selected based on upregulation of activation markers prior to expansion in culture. This process results in a patient-specific T cell product enriched for tumor-reactive T cells. Enrolled patients who progress on first line SOC therapy are preconditioned with 5 days of nonmyeloablative lymphodepletion followed by TBio-4101 infusion. Thereafter, patients receive ≤6 doses of IL-2 (600,000 IU/kg) every 8h, and pembrolizumab (200 mg) every 3 weeks until disease progression. The trial is currently open, with a target enrollment of 15 patients (NCT06236425). Clinical trial information: NCT06236425 .">

        <tr id="7531 Background: MM eventually becomes refractory to current treatments, and new therapeutic options with convenient dosing and improved safety are needed to enhance patient (pt) adherence, access, and outcomes. ABBV-383 is a distinctive next-generation BCMA x CD3 bispecific antibody composed of 2 high-affinity BCMA-binding domains, a low-affinity CD3-binding domain designed to reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risk, and a silenced Fc tail for an extended half-life allowing convenient dosing. ABBV-383 monotherapy has shown promising activity in the ongoing first-in-human phase 1 trial in RRMM (Vij et al. Blood 2023;142[suppl 1]:3378). Here, safety and efficacy results are reported that support the RP2D of 60mg Q4W as the optimal therapeutic ABBV-383 monotherapy dose. Methods: This phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation/expansion trial (NCT03933735) enrolled pts with RRMM who received ≥3 prior lines of therapy with exposure to PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 mAb. ABBV-383 regimens explored in the expansion phase included 60mg Q4W and 40 or 60mg Q3W. A modified dexamethasone premedication schedule and shortened CRS monitoring period were implemented in the 60mg Q4W cohort for cycle 1. IV ABBV-383 was administered as a flat dose with no step-up schedule. Treatment was continued until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives were to assess safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and determine the RP2D. Efficacy evaluation was a secondary objective. TEAEs were assessed per CTCAE v5.0 and tumor response per IMWG 2016 criteria. Results: As of May 2023, 220 pts received ABBV-383 (median age: 68 yr [35–92]; median prior therapy lines: 5 [3‒23]). Median FU was 4.1 mo (0.8–5.2) at 60mg Q4W (n=21), 12.2 mo (1.3–34.4) at 40mg Q3W (n=55), and 24.2 mo (0.6–33.4) at 60mg Q3W (n=61). At 60mg Q4W, with the modified premedication regimen, CRS was reported in 43% of pts (38% G1, 5% G2), and ICANS in 5% of pts (G2). In Q3W cohorts, CRS was reported in 71% (40mg; 45% G1, 25% G2) and 70% (60mg; 51% G1, 18% G2, 2% G3) of pts. The incidence of G3/4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia was 14/24/10% at 60mg Q4W, 31/31/16% at 40mg Q3W, and 34/13/13% at 60mg Q3W. G3/4 infections occurred in 10/24/34% of pts at 60mg Q4W, 40mg and 60mg Q3W, respectively. ORR and ≥VGPR were 65/50% at 60mg Q4W, 64/53% at 40mg Q3W, and 60/52% at 60mg Q3W. Corresponding exposure-response (ER) analyses and correlative analyses further supported RP2D determination (separate abstract submissions). Conclusions: The optimal therapeutic dose of 60mg Q4W ABBV-383 monotherapy was selected on the basis of safety, efficacy, and ER analyses. The extended interval of Q4W, with a shortened CRS monitoring period in cycle 1 and no step-up dosing, will improve convenience and reduce the treatment burden for pts. ABBV-383 at 60mg Q4W will be investigated in the registrational phase 3 trial (NCT06158841) in RRMM. Clinical trial information: NCT03933735 .">

        <tr id="Rituximab, targeting CD20, is one of the first-line treatments against Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Follicular Lymphoma, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma (LPL), and other B cell mutations. As the patent on Rituximab expires and a large number of biosimilars are on the market, Rituximab is an important milestone in the era of immunotherapy as the first monoclonal antibody to be approved for oncology treatment. The mechanisms of its anticancer effects include Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC), Antibody-Dependent Phagocytosis (ADCP), direct signaling-induced cell death, etc. The biosimilar Truxima, which is now used worldwide, is also tending to surpass it by the expiration of the original Rituximab patent. This paper focuses on the working principle and clinical effects of Rituximab, the characteristics and pathway principles of the drug target CD20, as well as the physical and chemical properties of reference drugs and biosimilars. This review also summarizes the importance of monoclonal antibody technologies such as Rituximab and CD20 antibodies in the treatment of related cancers. Further studies are required for clinical applications of Truxima as a substitute for Rituximab.">

        <tr id="The treatment of CLL has evolved from traditional chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) to an increasing number of targeted and biologic approaches. Randomized trials have demonstrated superiority of covalent bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (cBTKis) over CIT, and second-generation compounds such as acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib appear to have a more favorable efficacy/safety profile than ibrutinib. The noncovalent BTKi, pirtobrutinib, has shown impressive activity after failure of the cBTKis and is quite tolerable. The Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax plus a CD20, generally obinutuzumab, provides a high level of efficacy as initial treatment or after failure on a cBTKi, with many patients achieving a state of undetectable minimal residual disease. Promising novel approaches include BTK degraders, bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T)-cell therapy. What is clear is that CIT is archaic, and current and future targeted approaches will continue to improve the outcome for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common type of B cell neoplasm, and can be cured by traditional chemoimmunotherapy in 60–70% of cases. Relapsed/refractory patients usually have a dismal prognosis and most of them finally succumb to lymphoma. In the last decade, several new innovative therapies have been approved against DLBCL, targeting both surface antigens and the intracellular pathways of neoplastic B cells. Compared to standard chemotherapy, new monoclonal antibodies and engineered T cells have shown an increased response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival, but, on the other side of the coin, patients have been experiencing new kinds of toxicities, previously unknown, that clinicians have been learning to manage. Here, we review new drugs that are already approved or under investigation for DLBCL and the corresponding molecular target on lymphoma cells. Abstract Since the introduction of rituximab in the late 1990s, significant progress has been made in advancing targeted therapies for B cell lymphomas, improving patients’ chance of being cured and clinicians’ therapeutic armamentarium. A better understanding of disease biology and pathogenic pathways, coupled with refinements in immunophenotypic and molecular diagnostics, have been instrumental in these achievements. While traditional chemotherapy remains fundamental in most cases, concerns surrounding chemorefractoriness and cumulative toxicities, particularly the depletion of the hemopoietic reserve, underscore the imperative for personalized treatment approaches. Integrating targeted agents, notably monoclonal antibodies, alongside chemotherapy has yielded heightened response rates and prolonged survival. A notable paradigm shift is underway with innovative-targeted therapies replacing cytotoxic drugs, challenging conventional salvage strategies like stem cell transplantation. This review examines the landscape of emerging targets for lymphoma cells and explores innovative therapies for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). From Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cells to more potent monoclonal antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, and small molecules targeting intracellular pathways, each modality offers promising avenues for therapeutic advancement. This review aims to furnish insights into their potential implications for the future of DLBCL treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1) is a life-threatening, autosomal recessive syndrome caused by autoimmune regulator (AIRE) deficiency. In APS-1, self-reactive T cells escape thymic negative selection, infiltrate organs, and drive autoimmune injury. The effector mechanisms governing T-cell-mediated damage in APS-1 remain poorly understood.


METHODS
We examined whether APS-1 could be classified as a disease mediated by interferon-γ. We first assessed patients with APS-1 who were participating in a prospective natural history study and evaluated mRNA and protein expression in blood and tissues. We then examined the pathogenic role of interferon-γ using Aire-/-Ifng-/- mice and Aire-/- mice treated with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib. On the basis of our findings, we used ruxolitinib to treat five patients with APS-1 and assessed clinical, immunologic, histologic, transcriptional, and autoantibody responses.


RESULTS
Patients with APS-1 had enhanced interferon-γ responses in blood and in all examined autoimmunity-affected tissues. Aire-/- mice had selectively increased interferon-γ production by T cells and enhanced interferon-γ, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1), and CXCL9 signals in multiple organs. Ifng ablation or ruxolitinib-induced JAK-STAT blockade in Aire-/- mice normalized interferon-γ responses and averted T-cell infiltration and damage in organs. Ruxolitinib treatment of five patients with APS-1 led to decreased levels of T-cell-derived interferon-γ, normalized interferon-γ and CXCL9 levels, and remission of alopecia, oral candidiasis, nail dystrophy, gastritis, enteritis, arthritis, Sjögren's-like syndrome, urticaria, and thyroiditis. No serious adverse effects from ruxolitinib were identified in these patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings indicate that APS-1, which is caused by AIRE deficiency, is characterized by excessive, multiorgan interferon-γ-mediated responses. JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib in five patients showed promising results. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others.).">

        <tr id="Immune cell engagers are molecular agents, usually antibody-based constructs, engineered to recruit immune cells against cancer cells and kill them. They represent a versatile and powerful tool for cancer immunotherapy. Despite the multiplication of new engagers tested and accepted in the clinics, how molecular and cellular parameters influence their action is poorly understood. In particular, disentangling the respective role of host immune cells and engager biophysical characteristics is needed to improve their design and efficiency. Focusing here on harnessing antibody dependent Natural Killer cell cytotoxicity, we measure the efficiency of 6 original bispecific antibodies (bsAb), associating an anti-HER2 nanobody and an anti-CD16 nanobody. In vitro cytotoxicity data using primary human NK cells on different target cell lines exposing different antigen densities were collected, exhibiting a wide range of bsAb dose response. In order to rationalize our observations, we introduce a simple multiscale model, postulating that the density of bsAb bridging the two cells is the main parameter triggering the cytotoxic response. We introduce two new microscopic parameters: the surface cooperativity describing bsAb affinity at the bridging step and the threshold of bridge density determining the donor-dependent response. Both parameters permit to rank Abs and donors and to predict bsAb potency as a function of antibodies bulk affinities and receptor surface densities on cells. Our approach thus provides a general way to decouple donor response from immune engagers characteristics, rationalizing the landscape of molecule design.">

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction. Treatment with CM313, a novel anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, can result in targeted clearance of CD38-positive cells, including plasma cells.


METHODS
We conducted a phase 1-2, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CM313 in adult patients with ITP. CM313 was administered intravenously at a dose of 16 mg per kilogram of body weight every week for 8 weeks, followed by a 16-week follow-up period. The primary outcomes were adverse events and documentation of two or more consecutive platelet counts of at least 50×109 per liter within 8 weeks after the first dose of CM313. The status of peripheral-blood immune cells in patients and changes in the mononuclear phagocytic system in passive mouse models of ITP receiving anti-CD38 therapy were monitored.


RESULTS
Of the 22 patients included in the study, 21 (95%) had two consecutive platelet counts of at least 50×109 per liter during the treatment period, with a median cumulative response duration of 23 weeks (interquartile range, 17 to 24). The median time to the first platelet count of at least 50×109 per liter was 1 week (range, 1 to 3). The most common adverse events that occurred during the study were infusion-related reaction (in 32% of the patients) and upper respiratory tract infection (in 32%). After CD38-targeted therapy, the percentage of CD56dimCD16+ natural killer cells, the expression of CD32b on monocytes in peripheral blood, and the number of macrophages in the spleen of the passive mouse models of ITP all decreased.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, anti-CD38 targeted therapy rapidly boosted platelet levels by inhibiting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity on platelets, maintained long-term efficacy by clearing plasma cells, and was associated with mainly low-grade toxic effects.

        <tr id="Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a muco-cutaneous autoimmune disease characterized and caused by autoantibodies targeting type VII collagen (COL7). The treatment of EBA is notoriously difficult, with a median time to remission of 9 months. In preclinical EBA models, we previously discovered that depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) enhances autoantibody-induced, neutrophil-mediated inflammation and blistering. Increased EBA severity in Treg-depleted mice was accompanied by an increased cutaneous expression of interferon gamma (IFN-γ). The functional relevance of IFN-γ in EBA pathogenesis had been unknown. Given that emapalumab, an anti-IFN-γ antibody, is approved for primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis patients, we sought to assess the therapeutic potential of IFN-γ inhibition in EBA. Specifically, we evaluated if IFN-γ inhibition has modulatory effects on skin inflammation in a pre-clinical EBA model, based on the transfer of COL7 antibodies into mice. Compared to isotype control antibody, anti-IFN-γ treatment significantly reduced clinical disease manifestation in experimental EBA. Clinical improvement was associated with a reduced dermal infiltrate, especially Ly6G+ neutrophils. On the molecular level, we noted few changes. Apart from reduced CXCL1 serum concentrations, which has been demonstrated to promote skin inflammation in EBA, the expression of cytokines was unaltered in the serum and skin following IFN-γ blockade. This validates IFN-γ as a potential therapeutic target in EBA, and possibly other diseases with a similar pathogenesis, such as bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid.">

However, no specific vaccine or antiviral therapy has been approved for clinical use. To develop an effective treatment, we isolated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). SF5 and SF83 are two neutralizing mAbs that recognize two viral glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), respectively. We found that their epitopes are closely located, and we then engineered them as several bispecific antibodies (bsAbs). Neutralization and animal experiments indicated that bsAbs display more potent protective effects than the parental mAbs, and the cryoelectron microscopy structure of a bsAb3 Fab-Gn-Gc complex elucidated the mechanism of protection. In vivo virus passage in the presence of antibodies indicated that two bsAbs resulted in less selective pressure and could efficiently bind to all single parental mAb-escape mutants. Furthermore, epitope analysis of the protective mAbs against SFTSV and RVFV indicated that they are all located on the Gn subdomain I, where may be the hot spots in the phleboviruses. Collectively, these data provide potential therapeutic agents and molecular basis for the rational design of vaccines against SFTSV infection.">

        <tr id="2520 Background: MCLA-145, a human common light chain bispecific antibody targeting CD137 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, is designed to enhance both antigen-mediated T cell activation via CD137 costimulation, and blockade of inhibitory PD-L1. Interim data from the ongoing phase 1 study (NCT03922204) are presented. Methods: Patients (pts) with PD-L1 ≥1% advanced/metastatic solid tumors received MCLA-145 IV as monotherapy Q2W/Q3W in 21/28-d cycles respectively, or in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W in 21-d cycles. Pts enrolled in combination had cancers that either relapsed after PD-(L)1 therapies or were immunotherapy naïve. Primary objectives are safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of MCLA-145 alone or combined with pembrolizumab, and determination of the recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Secondary endpoints include efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity. Results: As of a December 4, 2023 data cutoff, 72 pts with 26 cancer types were treated; 25% of pts had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 3 pts were continuing combination therapy. Monotherapy: 53 pts (median age 60 y, 49% male) were treated across 8 dose levels (47 pts 0.4-75 mg Q2W, 6 pts 40 mg Q3W). Median number of cycles was 2 (range 1-39). 6 pts had DLTs in the 25-75 mg dose range (febrile neutropenia [2 pts], hemolytic anemia, myositis, ALT/AST increase, neutrophil/platelet decrease [1 pt each]). Most common adverse events (AEs; all grades/G3-4) were fatigue (51%/4%), decreased appetite (34%/2%), dyspnea (32%/0%), anemia (30%/9%), ALT/AST increase (25%/11%), and pyrexia (25%/0%). The incidence of any G3-4 AE was lower with 40 mg Q3W than across all Q2W dose levels (33% vs 66%). Combination: 19 pts (median age 61 y, 47% male) were treated with MCLA-145 10, 25 or 40 mg plus Q3W. Median number of cycles was 5 (range 1-16). No DLTs occurred. Most common AEs (all grades/G3-4) were fatigue (58%/11%), cough (42%/0%), constipation (32%/0%) and ALT/AST increase (21%/11%). The RDE was established at 40 mg Q3W for both monotherapy and combination. Preliminary antitumor activity was observed with monotherapy (52 evaluable pts): 5 partial responses (PRs) in glioblastoma (lasting >3 y), sarcoma, cervical, anal, and gastric cancer (treated for 2-11 mo); and combination (19 evaluable pts): 1 PR in Merkel cell carcinoma (treated 12+ mo), 1 complete response in PD-L1+ NSCLC (treated 6+ mo), both after prior immunotherapy. Disease control rate was 37% with monotherapy and 68% with combination. Exposure was dose-dependent with a terminal half-life of 69 h at 75 mg. Measure of peripheral blood Ki67+ CD8 T cells supports maximal PD activity at 40 mg. Conclusions: MCLA-145 given alone or in combination with pembrolizumab had a well-tolerated and manageable safety profile with encouraging clinical activity, including in pts who relapsed after PD-(L)1 therapies.

        <tr id="Background Treatment strategies for Crohn’s disease (CD) suppress diverse inflammatory pathways but many patients remain refractory to treatment. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has emerged as a therapy for medically refractory CD. SCT was developed to rescue cancer patients from myelosuppressive chemotherapy but its use for CD and other immune diseases necessitates reimagining SCT as a cellular therapy that restores appropriately responsive immune cell populations from hematopoietic progenitors in the stem cell autograft (i.e. immune “reset”). Here we present a paradigm to understand SCT as a cellular therapy for immune diseases and reveal how SCT re-establishes cellular immunity utilizing high-dimensional cellular phenotyping and functional studies of the stem cell grafts. Methods Immunophenotyping using CyTOF, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing was performed on peripheral blood and intestinal tissue samples from refractory CD patients who underwent SCT. The stem cell graft from these patients was analyzed using flow cytometry and functionally interrogated using a murine model for engraftment. Results Our study revealed a remodeling of intestinal macrophages capable of supporting mucosal healing that was independently validated using multimodal studies of immune reconstitution events including CyTOF and scRNA-seq. Functional interrogation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) using a xenograft model demonstrated that HSCs shape the timing of immune reconstitution, the selected reconstitution of specific cell lineages and potentially the clinical efficacy of SCT. Conclusions These studies indicate that SCT serves as a myeloid-directed cellular therapy re-establishing homeostatic intestinal macrophages that support intestinal healing and suggest refractory CD evolves from impairment of restorative functions in myeloid cells. Furthermore, we report heterogeneity among HSCs from CD patients which may drive SCT outcomes and suggests an unrecognized impact of CD pathophysiology on HSC in the marrow niche.">

        <tr id="e20518 Background: Treatment choice for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after front-line immuno-chemotherapy therapy is limited. As the first approved dual programmed cell death-1(PD-1) / cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) bispecific antibody worldwide, cadonilimab combined with anlotinib, a vascular epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, showed potential anti-tumor activity in advanced NSCLC patients resistant to anti-PD-1/ programmed cell death ligand-1(PD-L1) antibodies in a phase Ib/II clinical trial. Methods: We retrospectively collectedthe efficacy and safety data in advanced NSCLC patients treated with cadonilimab in later therapy lines. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety results. The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS). Results: Totally, 41 advanced NSCLC patients who were refractory to previous chemotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and treated with later line cadonilimab-based regimens were enrolled. More than half of patients received cadonilimab as a fourth or later line of treatment. Until the data cut-off date (August 29, 2023), the treatment efficacy of 23 patients could be evaluated. One (4.3%) patient had partial response, 8 (34.8%) patients had stable disease, and 14 (60.9%) patients progressed. The ORR and DCR were 4.3% and 39.1%, respectively. The median PFS of all evaluated patients was 108.0 days (95% confidence interval: 62.3-153.7). Due to the short follow-up, median OS has not been reached yet. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occurred in 26(63.4%) and 9(22%) patients, respectively. The most common AEs included gamma-glutamyl transferase elevation (17.1%), coughing (14.6%), and fatigue (12.2%). Five patients (12.2%) experienced grade≥3 AEs. Two patients temporarily paused medication due to Grade 2 rash. One patient and 2 patients permanently discontinued medication due to Grade 3 myocarditis and Grade 2 infusion reactions, respectively. Metabolomics results showed that lipids and lipid-like molecules were rich in stools of patients responsive to cadonilimab treatment. Conclusions: In this heavily treated advanced NSCLC patient cohort, cadonilimab-based regimens only showed moderate anti-tumor efficacy with a generally tolerable and manageable safety profile. More evidence supporting administration of cadonilimab is needed in NSCLC patients refractory to previous anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.">

        <tr id="We report on the first-in-human clinical trial using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CD37, an antigen highly expressed in B- and T-cell malignancies (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04136275). Five patients with relapsed or refractory CD37+ lymphoid malignancies were enrolled and infused with autologous CAR-37 T-cells. CAR-37 T-cells expanded in the peripheral blood of all patients and, at peak, comprised >94% of the total lymphocytes in 4/5 patients. Tumor responses were observed in 4/5 patients, with 3 complete responses, 1 mixed response, and 1 patient whose disease progressed rapidly and with relative loss of CD37 expression. Three patients experienced prolonged and severe pancytopenia, and in two of these patients, efforts to ablate CAR-37 T-cells (which were engineered to co-express truncated EGFR) with cetuximab, were unsuccessful. Hematopoiesis was restored in these two patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No other severe, non-hematopoietic toxicities occurred. We investigated the mechanisms of profound pancytopenia and did not observe activation of CAR-37 T-cells in response to hematopoietic stem cells in vitro or hematotoxicity in humanized models. Patients with pancytopenia had sustained high levels of IL-18, with low levels of IL-18 binding protein in their peripheral blood. IL-18 levels were significantly higher in CAR-37-treated patients relative to both cytopenic and non-cytopenic cohorts of CAR-19-treated cohorts of patients. In conclusion, CAR-37 T-cells exhibited anti-tumor activity, with significant CAR expansion and cytokine production. CAR-37 T-cells may be an effective therapy in hematologic malignancies as a bridge to hematopoietic stem cell transplant.">

        <tr id="7559 Background: The B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted antibody drug conjugate belantamab mafodotin enhances cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Elotuzumab, a signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 7 (SLAMF7) checkpoint inhibitor, activates NK cells and induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Bela-Elo (NCT05002816) is an ongoing phase Ib/II trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the unique combination of these two agents in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma (RRMM). We report data from phase I part of this trial. Methods: This single-arm phase Ib/II study is enrolling patients with triple-class refractory RRMM. Patients with progression after prior BCMA-targeted therapy are eligible. Elotuzumab is administered via intravenous (IV) infusion at an established dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 every 28 days for cycles 1 and 2; followed by 20mg/kg on day 1 of each 28-day cycle. Belantamab mafodotin is administered via IV infusion with the starting dose of 1.9 mg/kg IV at every 4-week interval, with subsequent dose-reduction based on toxicity. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient demographics and safety and efficacy outcomes. Results: As of data cut-off (January 20, 2024) 12 subjects have been enrolled; and 10 subjects received treatment on study. Median age of patients was 66.5 years (range 59-79). The patient population was heavily pretreated with 5 prior median lines of therapy (range 2-8); 40% (4/10) of patients were refractory to prior BCMA-targeted therapy (2 post-BCMA bispecific antibody, 2 post-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy [CART]). Phase I part of the study has completed. Median duration of treatment was 4 months (range 2-19). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Four severe adverse events were observed possibly related to the study treatment in 3 patients, including grade 3 pulmonary infection (n=1) and lymphopenia (n=3). Ocular keratopathy developed in 40% of patients, all were grades 1-2 and resolved after discontinuation or dose-reduction of belantamab. Preliminary activity is noted with partial responses (PR) in 4/10 (40%) and stable disease (SD) in additional 3/10 (30%) of patients. Among the four patients who were refractory to prior BCMA therapy, 2 (50%) achieved PR, with duration of response (DOR) of 19 months and 9 months, respectively. Conclusions: This novel combination immune therapy with belantamab mafodotin and elotuzumab appears to have an encouraging safety profile and a promising preliminary efficacy in patients with heavily pretreated RRMM, including in those with prior failure of BCMA-targeted therapy.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains an unresolved matter of concern regarding adverse outcomes. This case study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of blinatumomab, with or without door lymphocyte infusion (DLI), in treating measurable residual disease (MRD)-positive B-ALL. Methods: All patients who received blinatumomab salvage therapy were included in this study. Eleven patients were included in the study. All patients were evaluated for MRD-negativity. Results: Before starting blinatumomab therapy, seven patients tested positive for MRD, three tested negative, and one had refractory disease. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was reserved for five patients with persistent MRD. Six patients became MRD-negative and subsequent HCT was not performed. Only two patients relapsed; one patient died of relapse, and the other one received carfilzomib-based therapy and was MRD-negative thereafter. Nine patients were MRD-negative at a median follow-up of 28 months (15–52 months). Two of three MRD-positive post-transplant patients remained in complete molecular remission after preemptive DLI at the last follow-up date. In the first salvage, blinatumomab may achieve complete remission and bridging to HCT in pediatric patients with end-of-induction MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL. Conclusions: The decision on how to treat post-transplant relapse continues to affect survival outcomes. Blinatumomab combined with DLI may extend the armamentarium of release options for high-risk pediatric patients. This approach is encouraging for high-risk ALL patients who are MRD-positive post-transplantation.">

        <tr id="Adoptive immunotherapy with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-specific T cells is an effective treatment for relapsed or refractory EBV-induced post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) with overall survival rates of up to 69%. EBV-specific T cells have been conventionally made by repeated stimulation with EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), which act as antigen-presenting cells. However, this process is expensive, takes many months, and has practical risks associated with live virus. We have developed a peptide-based, virus-free, serum-free closed system to manufacture a bank of virus-specific T cells (VST) for clinical use. We compared these with standard LCL-derived VST using comprehensive characterization and potency assays to determine differences that might influence clinical benefits. Multi-parameter flow cytometry revealed that peptide-derived VST had an expanded central memory population and less exhaustion marker expression than LCL-derived VST. A quantitative HLA-matched allogeneic cytotoxicity assay demonstrated similar specific killing of EBV-infected targets, though peptide-derived EBV T cells had a significantly higher expression of antiviral cytokines and degranulation markers after antigen recall. High-throughput T cell receptor-beta (TCRβ) sequencing demonstrated oligoclonal repertoires, with more matches to known EBV-binding complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences in peptide-derived EBV T cells. Peptide-derived products showed broader and enhanced specificities to EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) in both CD8 and CD4 compartments, which may improve the targeting of highly expressed latency antigens in PTLD. Importantly, peptide-based isolation and expansion allows rapid manufacture and significantly increased product yield over conventional LCL-based approaches.">

        <tr id="7024 Background: The EHA/EBMT immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT) grading system characterizes hematotoxicity after CAR T-cell therapy based on depth and duration of neutropenia (Rejeski et al, Blood, 2023). We evaluated pre- and post-infusion factors associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT and developed a predictive model in 602 patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing CAR T-cell therapy at Fred Hutch Cancer Center. Methods: Grading of early hematotoxicity (day-0-30 after CAR T-cell cell infusion) was automated using the heatwaveR package. Associations with 50 patient, disease-related, and laboratory factors, and grade 3-4 ICAHT were modeled using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Results: The most common disease types were aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n = 293; 49%), indolent NHL (n = 150; 25%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 94; 16%). The most common CAR T-cell products were the investigational CD19 CAR T-cell product JCAR014 (n = 197; 33%), axicabtagene ciloleucel (n = 129; 21%), and lisocabtagene maraleucel (n = 73; 12%). Incidences of early ICAHT grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 319 (53%), 96 (16%), 60 (10%), and 35 (6%) patients, respectively. Baseline patient factors associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT included ALL (reference: aggressive NHL, OR = 4.18, 95% CI, 2.41-7.26, p < 0.001) , Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (OR = 2.17, 95% CI, 1.07-4.20, p = 0.025), and lower age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.02-1.05, p < 0.001). Pre-lymphodepletion (LD) laboratory factors associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT in univariate analyses included lower ANC (OR = 6.67 per log10 cells/μL, 95% CI, 4.0-11.1, p < 0.001), LDH (OR = 8.70per log10U/L, 95% CI, 4.03-19.4, p < 0.001), CRP (OR = 3.18 per log10mg/L, 95% CI, 2.06-5.07, p < 0.001), and ferritin (OR = 6.07 per log10mg/L, 95% CI, 3.65-10.6, p < 0.001). Peak CRP (OR = 15.6, 95% CI, 7.27-36.4, p < 0.001), peak ferritin (OR = 7.41, 95% CI, 5.02-11.3, p < 0.001), peak CRS grade (OR = 2.01, 95% CI, 1.59-2.56, p < 0.001), and peak ICANS grade (OR = 1.51, 95% CI, 1.29-1.77, p < 0.001) after CAR T-cell infusion were also strongly associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT. A multivariable model using restricted cubic splines and including disease type, pre-LD ANC, pre-LD LDH, peak CRP, peak ferritin, and CRS grade demonstrated high discrimination to predict grade 3-4 ICAHT (C-index = 0.89). Internal validation using bootstrapping showed near-perfect calibration without overfitting. Sensitivity and specificity based on the Youden criteria was 74% and 90%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the CAR-HEMATOTOX score in predicting grade 3-4 ICAHT was 93% and 30%, respectively. Conclusions: We identified pre- and post-infusion predictors of grade 3-4 ICAHT and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model including disease-type, pre-LD ANC, pre-LD LDH, peak CRP, peak ferritin, and CRS grade. We plan to further evaluate our model in an external cohort.">

We present updated CM data from monotherapy (mono) and anti-PD1 combination (combo) cohorts. Methods: HLA-A*02:01+ unresectable/metastatic (m) CM patients (pts) previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) were eligible. Primary objectives were safety and selection of recommended dose; additional objectives were efficacy and ctDNA response (Natera, Guardant). Stable disease (SD) with any tumor reduction confirmed with ≥ 1 subsequent scan was analyzed based on association with overall survival (OS) for tebentafusp. Molecular response was defined ≥ 0.5 log [68%] ctDNA reduction by week 9. PRAME was tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC; PRAME+ defined as H-score ≥1). Efficacy is presented by PRAME− and PRAME+ (documented + and unknown) groups. IMC-F106C dosed IV with 2 step-up doses and weekly target dose (20-320 mcg mono, 160 mcg combo). Pembrolizumab (pembro) dosed at IV 400 mg Q6W. Data cutoff: Dec 2023. Median follow-up of mono was 11 months. Results: 46 mCM pts (40 mono, 6 combo) received IMC-F106C ≥ 20 mcg. All mono pts received prior ICI (100% anti-PD1, 88% anti-CTLA4); 25% had prior BRAF/MEK inhibitors. 35/40 mono pts were grouped by IHC as positive (25 PRAME+, 10 unknown) vs. 5 PRAME−. Adverse events (AEs) were consistent with prior experience. Most common AE was Grade 1/2 CRS (50%); mostly in first 3 weeks. No drug related AEs led to treatment discontinuation or death. Safety for pembro combo to date was consistent with the individual agents. 31/40 mono pts had a RECIST evaluable tumor assessment. The clinical benefit rate (CBR) of PR + SD was 61% (19/31). 35% (11/31) had any tumor reduction that was confirmed on ≥ 1 subsequent scan, including 4 PR (ORR 13%) and 7 SD (26 of 31 pts were PRAME+; the CBR in these was 65% and included all 11 (42%) with confirmed tumor reduction. In 5 PRAME−, there was no tumor reduction. Both median progression free survival (PFS) and 6-month OS rates were higher in PRAME + vs –: 4.5 vs 2.1 months and 94% vs 40%, respectively. 12/40 mono pts received therapy for > 6 months and 14/40 mono pts remain on therapy. 41% of ctDNA-evaluable, PRAME+ mono pts had a molecular response (9/22); this was associated with longer PFS and OS. Correlative biomarkers will be shared. Conclusions: IMC-F106C was well tolerated with promising clinical activity in ICI-pretreated, mCM patients without clinical options. Clinical activity, measured by any confirmed tumor reduction and ctDNA molecular response, is enriched in PRAME+ patients at ~40% and associated with longer PFS and OS. IMC-F106C can be combined with anti-PD1. A Ph 3 trial of IMC-F106C with nivolumab in 1st line mCM has been initiated (PRISM-MEL301; NCT06112314). Clinical trial information: NCT04262466 .">

        <tr id="Allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells offer many advantages over autologous therapies, but their benefits are curtailed by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and elimination by recipient immune cells. Moreover, just as with autologous therapies, allogeneic CAR T cells are susceptible to activation-induced cell death (AICD) caused by chronic antigen exposure (CAE). Granzyme B (GzmB) and Fas/FasL-initiated, caspase-mediated apoptosis are key mechanisms of T-cell death caused by T/NK cell-mediated allorejection or CAE. We explored a protective strategy of engineering CAR T cells to overexpress variants of the GzmB-specific serine protease inhibitor, SerpinB9 (SB9), to improve allogeneic T-cell persistence and antitumor efficacy. We showed that the overexpression of an SB9 variant with broadened caspase specificity, SB9(CAS), not only significantly reduced rejection of allogeneic CAR T cells, but also increased their resistance to AICD and enabled them to thrive better under CAE, thus improving allogeneic T-cell persistence and antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, while SB9(CAS)-overexpression improved the efficacy of allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy by conferring protection to cell death, we did not observe any autonomous growth and the engineered CAR T cells were still susceptible to an inducible suicide switch. Hence, SB9(CAS)-overexpression is a promising strategy that can strengthen current development of cell therapies, broadening their applications to address unmet medical needs.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has ushered in substantial advancements in the management of various B-cell malignancies. However, its integration into chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treatment has been challenging, attributed largely to the development of very effective chemo-free alternatives. Additionally, CAR T-cell responses in CLL have not been as high as in other B-cell lymphomas or leukemias. However, a critical void exists in therapeutic options for patients with high-risk diseases who are resistant to the current CLL therapies, underscoring the urgency for adoptive immunotherapies in these patients. The diminished CAR T-cell efficacy within CLL can be traced to factors such as compromised T-cell fitness due to persistent antigenic stimulation inherent to CLL. Resistance mechanisms encompass tumor-related factors like antigen escape, CAR T-cell-intrinsic factors like T-cell exhaustion, and a suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). New strategies to combat CAR T-cell resistance include the concurrent administration of therapies that augment CAR T-cell endurance and function, as well as the engineering of novel CAR T-cells targeting different antigens. Moreover, the concept of “armored” CAR T-cells, armed with transgenic modulators to modify both CAR T-cell function and the tumor milieu, is gaining traction. Beyond this, the development of readily available, allogeneic CAR T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells presents a promising countermeasure to innate T-cell defects in CLL patients. In this review, we explore the role of CAR T-cell therapy in CLL, the intricate tapestry of resistance mechanisms, and the pioneering methods studied to overcome resistance.">

        <tr id="The activity of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with Richter's transformation (RT) to aggressive large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) is largely unknown. In a multicenter retrospective study, we report the safety and efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in patients with RT (n=30) compared to patients with aggressive B cell lymphoma (n=283) and patients with transformed indolent Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (iNHL) (n=141) between April 2016 and January 2023. Two-thirds of patients received prior therapy for CLL before RT and 89% of them received B-cell receptor and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. Toxicities of CAR T cell therapy in RT were similar to other lymphomas, with no fatalities related to cytokine release syndrome or immune effector-cell associated neurotoxicity synderome. The 100-day overall response rate and complete response rates in patients with RT were 57% and 47%, respectively. With a median follow up of 19 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.9 months in patients with RT compared to 18 months in de-novo LBCL and not reached in patients with transformed iNHL. The OS at 12 months was 45% in patients with RT compared with 62% and 75% in patients with de novo LBCL and transformed iNHL, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, worse OS was associated with RT histology, elevated LDH, and more prior lines of therapy. CAR T cell therapy can salvage a proportion of patients with CLL and RT exposed to prior targeted agents; however, efficacy in RT is inferior compared to de novo LBCL and transformed iNHL.">

        <tr id="e15572 Background: GCC19CART is a multitargeted CAR-T cell therapy designed to overcome the limitations of conventional CAR-T cells in solid malignancies by pairing a solid tumor targeting CAR with additional CD19-targeting CARs. This addition is meant to amplify proliferation, activation, and persistence of the CAR-T cells with a goal to overcome the inherent resistance of solid tumors to CAR-T cells. Guanylate cyclase-C (GCC) has been reported to be expressed in over 80% of colorectal cancers with normal expression largely restricted to the luminal side of the GI tract, making it an appealing target for CAR-T cell therapy. A Phase 1 investigator-initiated clinical trial in China reported preliminary results with an ORR of 15.4% (2/13), mOS of 13.3 months in dose level 1 (1x106 CAR-T cells/kg) and 50% (4/8), mOS of 26.1 months in dose level 2 (2x106 CAR-T cells/kg). Common adverse events included cytokine release syndrome (CRS), diarrhea/colitis, and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Methods: A phase 1 study in the United States was initiated in August, 2022, for patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. As of a data cutoff of December 31, 2023, with a prespecified analysis after the DLT window for the first patient treated at dose level 2, 5 subjects have been reinfused: 4 in dose level 1 and 1 in dose level 2. Subjects were screened for GCC expression. Over 95% of participants screened positive, so this requirement was removed. Eligible subjects underwent leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy with a single dose of fludarabine 30mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2, and infusion of GCC19CART. Responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1 by site investigator and an independent third-party imaging review. Results: Five subjects have been treated, 4 in dose level 1 (1x106 cells/kg) and 1 in dose level 2 (2x106 cells/kg), and have completed the 30 day DLT period. The most common CAR-T related adverse events were CRS in 5/5 subjects (grade 1: 2/5 (40%) and grade 2: 3/5 (60%)), diarrhea in 4/5 subjects (grade 1: 1/5 (20%), grade 2: 2/5 (40%), and grade 3: 1/5 (20%)), and ICANS (grade 2: 1/5 (20%)). All adverse events resolved with therapy. The ORR was 40% (2/5) by independent review: 2 subjects demonstrated a partial response however 1 additional subject had partial metabolic response on PET/CT with stable disease. Progressive disease was seen in 2 participants by RECIST 1.1, but 1 has a falling tumor marker suggesting tumor flare. Conclusions: Preliminary results demonstrate that GCC19CART has an acceptable safety profile and meaningful clinical activity in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. This trial is ongoing and updated data will be presented, including from patients treated at dose level 2 (2x106 CAR-T cells/kg). Clinical trial information: NCT05319314 .">

        <tr id="Globally, the efforts to find the best cancer treatment are demanding and very intensive. Immunotherapy has gained an important role as a second or sometimes first line of treatment for various types of cancer. PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are an impending category of immunotherapy, and their mechanism, as well as their interaction with T cells, are well studied. However, our knowledge about any possible effect(s) of immunotherapy on B cells is limited. In this prospective study, we asked the question of any possible alterations of circulating B cells (numbers and subsets) occurring during immunotherapy in patients with cancer and of the potential correlation of such changes with the outcomes and with development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). We enrolled 20 cancer patients who received PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors and 8 healthy donors (HD). Patients underwent regular clinical assessment and imaging using the iRECIST criteria for 6 months following immunotherapy. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and during PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed, evaluating various circulating B cell subset phenotypes, including mature naïve B cells, memory B cells, regulatory B cells (Bregs), antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and age-related B cells (ABCs). Statistical analysis was employed to compare the differences of B cells between different groups and among sequential data within the same group. Total circulating CD19+ B cell counts remained stable across both groups (responders (R), nonresponders (NR)) and timepoints. However, there was a significant rise in mature naïve B cells and decline in memory B cells at the initiation of the treatment in the R group compared to healthy donors and to the NR group. Such changes were correlated with a good response to immunotherapy. On the contrary, higher numbers of ABCs at baseline were seen in the NR group and were correlated with resistance to treatment. As far as immune-related adverse events are concerned, no significant changes were recorded among the different B cell subpopulations evaluated in both groups. Our study provides preliminary data suggesting that B cell subset changes during immunotherapy may correlate with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced clinical responses in patients with neoplasia. Further investigations to delineate the potential role(s) of B cells in patients undergoing immunotherapy are needed.">

        <tr id="Introduction Therapeutic antibodies have become a major strategy to treat oncologic diseases. For chronic lymphocytic leukemia, antibodies against CD20 are used to target and elicit cytotoxic responses against malignant B cells. However, efficacy is often compromised due to a suppressive microenvironment that interferes with cellular immune responses. To overcome this suppression, agonists of pattern recognition receptors have been studied which promote direct cytotoxicity or elicit anti-tumoral immune responses. NOD2 is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that participates in the detection of peptidoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls. This detection then mediates the activation of multiple signaling pathways in myeloid cells. Although several NOD2 agonists are being used worldwide, the potential benefit of these agents in the context of antibody therapy has not been explored. Methods Primary cells from healthy-donor volunteers (PBMCs, monocytes) or CLL patients (monocytes) were treated with versus without the NOD2 agonist L18-MDP, then antibody-mediated responses were assessed. In vivo, the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model of CLL was used to test the effects of L18-MDP treatment alone and in combination with anti-CD20 antibody. Results Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with L18-MDP led to activation of monocytes from both healthy donors and CLL patients. In addition, there was an upregulation of activating FcγR in monocytes and a subsequent increase in antibody-mediated phagocytosis. This effect required the NF-κB and p38 signaling pathways. Treatment with L18-MDP plus anti-CD20 antibody in the Eµ-TCL model of CLL led to a significant reduction of CLL load, as well as to phenotypic changes in splenic monocytes and macrophages. Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that NOD2 agonists help overturn the suppression of myeloid cells, and may improve the efficacy of antibody therapy for CLL.">

        <tr id="e19005 Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor modified R Cell Immunotherapy (CAR-T) cell products have revolutionized the landscape of treatment of relapsed and refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies and multiple myeloma. Yet, these therapies emerged with their own challenges, Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are the most common and serious adverse events. The model of CAR-T cell therapy in the University of Oklahoma is unique as it is designated as an outpatient therapy. Little is known regarding risk factors for hospitalization after CAR-T therapy. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of all consecutive adult patients who had CAR-T therapy from 9/1/2019 through 9/30/2023 at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC). Inclusion criteria were adult patients with hematologic malignancies who received an FDA approved CAR-T therapy. Exclusion criteria included patients who were younger than 18 at the time of infusion, those who received cellular therapy for solid tumors and those who received investigational CAR-T cell products. Descriptive statistics were created for continuous and categorical variables. Chi-Square analysis and independent samples t-tests were used to measure association with hospital admission and treatment response. Logistic regression was used to explore associations for all covariates with each outcome. SAS 9.4 was used to perform all analysis. An alpha of 0.05 was used to determine significance. Results: A total of 118 patients received outpatient CAR-T/Cellular therapy at OUHSC during the study period with 78 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. The mean age at time of infusion was 58.6 (range=18-85) with most being male (n=46, 59.0%), White (n=63, 80.8%), and overweight/obese (n=50, 64.1%). The majority of patients received anti CD19 CAR-T (n=64, 82.1%) while 18.0% received anti BCMA products. CRS grade 0,1 occurred in 79.5% of patients (n=62) and 79.2% of patients were hospitalized within 30 days after CAR-T therapy (Median day of admission post CAR-T=5.5). Of patients who were hospitalized 26% had grades 2-4 CRS. Complete remission was achieved in 54.7% of patients. We compared the hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients across multiple characteristics, there was no association or predictors of hospitalization found. Albumin was the only predictor for CR. Conclusions: Our study provides data for safety and feasibility of outpatient CAR-T therapy despite potential risks for hospitalization. There are no clear predictors for hospitalizations after CAR-T therapy except for the development of CRS and ICAN. Higher baseline (pre-CAR-T) serum Albumin level was associated with higher odds of achieving CR.">

        <tr id="TPS7085 Background: Autologous (auto) CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy can induce long-term remissions for pts with R/R LBCL but approximately 60% will experience disease progression resulting in poor outcomes (Neelapu, 2023; Zurko, 2023). CRG-022 is a novel CAR T-cell product targeting CD22, a common B-cell antigen widely expressed in LBCL. Key features of CRG-022 include a fully human scFv derived from the m971 monoclonal antibody and 4-1BB/CD3z intracellular signaling domains (Singh, 2021). This CD22 CAR construct was developed at the National Cancer Institute and was investigated in phase (ph) 1 studies of pediatric/young adult pts with R/R CD22+ malignancies (Shah, 2020; NCT02315612) and at Stanford University in adults with R/R LBCL (Baird, 2021; NCT04088890) primarily in pts who received prior CD19-directed CAR-T therapy. The Stanford ph 1b study reported an overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rates of 66% and 52%, respectively in 29 pts treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 1x106 CAR+ T cells/kg (Frank, 2023). After a median follow-up of 27.3 months, the median overall survival had not been reached at the RP2D (Su, 2023). At the RP2D, no grade >3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune-effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), or immune effector cell associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome (IEC-HS) occurred; two pts (7%) developed grade 2 IEC-HS (Su, 2023; Srinagesh, 2023). Based on these notable results, this potentially pivotal ph 2 trial has been initiated. Methods: This Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety/efficacy of CRG-022 at 1x106 CAR+ T cells/kg in pts with R/R LBCL whose disease has progressed after CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. The primary endpoint is ORR according to Lugano response criteria (Cheson, 2014) by blinded independent review. Adverse events (AEs) are graded per CTCAE v5 except with CRS, ICANS, and IEC-HS graded per ASTCT guidelines. Pts with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL transformed from follicular or marginal zone lymphoma, follicular large B-cell lymphoma (FLBL)/FL Grade 3B, and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma are eligible. Other eligibility criteria include adequate hematologic and organ function, and no prior allogeneic stem cell transplant. Pts with prior treatment to both a CD19-directed auto CAR-T and a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody are also eligible within a separate cohort. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day for 3 days will be administered ahead of a single infusion of CRG-022. The study is designed to enroll approximately 123 pts. Study enrollment commenced in the US in August 2023, with 9 pt infused as of 08 JAN 2024. Clinical trial information: NCT05972720 .">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance are plasma cell dyscrasias characterized by monoclonal proliferation of pathological plasma cells with uncontrolled production of immunoglobulins. Autoimmune pathologies are conditions in which T and B lymphocytes develop a tendency to activate towards self-antigens in the absence of exogenous triggers. The aim of our review is to show the possible correlations between the two pathological aspects. Molecular studies have shown how different cytokines that either cause inflammation or control the immune system play a part in the growth of immunotolerance conditions that make it easier for the development of neoplastic malignancies. Uncontrolled immune activation resulting in chronic inflammation is also known to be at the basis of the evolution toward neoplastic pathologies, as well as multiple myeloma. Another point is the impact that myeloma-specific therapies have on the course of concomitant autoimmune diseases. Indeed, cases have been observed of patients suffering from multiple myeloma treated with daratumumab and bortezomib who also benefited from their autoimmune condition or patients under treatment with immunomodulators in which there has been an arising or worsening of autoimmunity conditions. The role of bone marrow transplantation in the course of concomitant autoimmune diseases remains under analysis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction While CAR T-cell therapy has led to remarkable responses in relapsed B-cell hematologic malignancies, only 50% of patients ultimately have a complete, sustained response. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance and relapse after CAR T-cell therapy is crucial to future development and improving outcomes. Areas covered We review reasons for both primary resistance and relapse after CAR T-cell therapies. Reasons for primary failure include CAR T-cell manufacturing problems, suboptimal fitness of autologous T-cells themselves, and intrinsic features of the underlying cancer and tumor microenvironment. Relapse after initial response to CAR T-cell therapy may be antigen-positive, due to CAR T-cell exhaustion or limited persistence, or antigen-negative, due to antigen-modulation on the target cells. Finally, we discuss ongoing efforts to overcome resistance to CAR T-cell therapy with enhanced CAR constructs, manufacturing methods, alternate cell types, combinatorial strategies, and optimization of both pre-infusion conditioning regimens and post-infusion consolidative strategies. Expert opinion There is a continued need for novel approaches to CAR T-cell therapy for both hematologic and solid malignancies to obtain sustained remissions. Opportunities for improvement include development of new targets, optimally combining existing CAR T-cell therapies, and defining the role for adjunctive immune modulators and stem cell transplant in enhancing long-term survival.">

        <tr id="Background: Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a breakdown of immune tolerance; in ITP, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets. This study aims to investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of FOXP3 in chronic ITP.
Methods: Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes from 20 patients with chronic ITP (CITP), 20 acute ITP (AITP) controls, and 20 healthy individuals.
CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with CITP using magnetic beads and then treated with phosphate-buffered saline solution or decitabine (a methylation inhibitor) for 48 h. The levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10, and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) in the plasma and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were assessed by Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). FOXP3 level was measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was adopted to detect the status of FOXP3 methylation.
Results: The number of Treg cells and the contents of IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β1 decreased in patients with CITP, compared to the AITP control group and normal group. FOXP3 expression was reduced and FOXP3 methylation increased in patients with CITP, compared to the AITP control group and normal group. Hypermethylation of FOXP3 promoter led to decrease in FOXP3 level in Treg cells. Inhibition of FOXP3 promoter hypermethylation promoted the secretion of IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β1 in Treg cells.
Conclusion: The number of Treg cells in CITP patients decreased, and the hypermethylation of FOXP3 promoter led to reduction of its expression in Treg cells, thus affecting the immune functioning of Treg cells.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Although significant advances have been made in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), leading to unprecedented response and survival rates among patients, the majority eventually relapse, and a cure remains elusive. This situation is closely related to an incomplete understanding of the immune microenvironment, especially monocytes/macrophages in patients with treatment-naïve MM. The aim of this study was to provide insight into the immune microenvironment, especially monocytes/macrophages, in patients with treatment-naïve MM.


METHODS
This study used the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of both patients with MM and heathy donors to identify immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and monocytes/macrophages. Transcriptomic data and flow cytometry analysis of monocytes/macrophages were used to further examine the effect of monocytes/macrophages in treatment-naïve MM patients.


RESULTS
A significant difference was observed between the bone marrow (BM) immune cells of the healthy controls and treatment-naïve MM patients through scRNA-seq. It is noteworthy that, through an scRNA-seq data analysis, this study found that interferon (IFN)-induced NK/T cells, terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) cells, T-helper cells characterized by expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG + Th cells), IFN-responding exhausted T cells, mannose receptor C-type 1 (MRC1) + DCs, IFN-responding DCs, MHCII + DCs, and immunosuppressive monocytes/macrophages are enriched in patients with treatment-naïve MM. Significantly, transcriptomic data of monocytes/macrophages demonstrated that "don't eat me"-related genes and IFN-induced genes increase in treatment-naïve MM patients. Furthermore, scRNA-seq, transcriptomic data, and flow cytometry also showed an increased proportion of CD16 + monocytes/macrophages and expression level of CD16. Cell-cell communication analysis indicated that monocytes/macrophages, especially the migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and interleukin 16 (IL-16) signaling pathway, are key players in treatment-naïve MM patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings provide a comprehensive and in-depth molecular characterization of BM immune cell census in MM patients, especially for monocytes/macrophages. Targeting macrophages may be a novel treatment strategy for patients with MM.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Predicting Immune-effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) in patients infused with Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR-T) is still a conundrum. This complication, thought to be consequent to CAR-T cell activation, arises a few days after infusion, when circulating CAR-T cells are scarce and specific CAR-T cell-derived biomarkers are lacking.


METHODS
Human CD19.CAR-T cells were generated to gain insight into CAR+ extracellular vesicle (CAR+EV) release upon target engagement. A prospective cohort of 100 B-cell lymphoma patients infused with approved CD19.CAR-T cell products (axi-cel, brexu-cel and tisa-cel) was assessed for plasma CAR+EVs as potential biomarkers of in vivo CD19.CAR-T cell activation and predictors of ICANS. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived neural cells were used as a model for CAR+EV-induced neurotoxicity.


RESULTS
In vitro, exosome-like CAR+EVs were released by CD19.CAR-T cells upon target engagement. In vivo, CAR+EVs were detectable as early as 1 hour in the plasma of patients. A concentration > 132.8 CAR+EVs/μl at hour +1 or > 224.5 CAR+EVs/μl at day +1 predicted ICANS in advance of 4 days, with a sensitivity up to 96.55% and a specificity up to 80.36%, outperforming other potential ICANS predictors. Enolase 2 (ENO2+) nanoparticles were released by iPSCs-derived neural cells upon CAR+EVs exposure and were increased in the plasma of ICANS patients.


CONCLUSIONS
These results convey that plasma CAR+EVs are an immediate signal of CD19.CAR-T cell activation, are suitable predictors of neurotoxicity, and may be involved in ICANS pathogenesis.

        <tr id="2530 Background: The humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody NEO-201 binds to Core 1 and/or extended Core 1 O-glycans expressed by several human solid and blood tumors, as well as neutrophils, and mediates killing of cancer cells, neutrophils, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) via ADCC and CDC. Resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade may be due to the accumulation of Tregs and gMDSCs in the tumor microenvironment (TME). NEO-201 was proven to bind and reduce the amount of circulating Tregs in cancer patients. This supports the rationale of the ongoing phase II clinical trial (NCT03476681) evaluating the activity of NEO-201 with pembrolizumab in adults with solid tumors resistant to prior checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, elevated serum levels of soluble MICA (sMICA) have been correlated with decreased NK cell activity. Methods: Cancer patients were treated each cycle with 3 doses of NEO-201 1.5mg/kg every 2 weeks and pembrolizumab 400mg IV every 6 weeks and imaged for response every 2 cycles. PBMCs and serum from cancer patients pre- and at multiple time points post-treatment were used to evaluate the percentage of circulating gMDSCs and Tregs (flow cytometry) and sMICA levels (ELISA). Results: NEO-201 recognizes naïve Tregs (nTregs: CD3+/CD4+/CD45RA+/Foxp3low cells) but not effector Tregs (eTregs: CD3+/CD4+/CD45RA-/Foxp3high cells). NEO-201 also binds to gMDSCs, defined as HLA-DRneg/CD33+/CD15+/ CD14neg/CD66b+ cells. In patients with durable SD, a patient with HNSCC (SD >11 months) showed >50% reduction of nTregs and >90% of gMDSCs at C3D1 (beginning of cycle 3) compared to baseline. One patient with cervical cancer (SD >8 months) showed 40% reduction of nTregs at C3D1 compared to baseline, while gMDSCs trended down to baseline levels at C3D1 after initial increase. Conversely, we observed a general uptrend of nTregs and gMDSCs in patients with PD after treatment. Median serum levels of sMICA pre-treatment were 33-fold higher in patients with PD compared to patients with SD. Levels of sMICA remained elevated in patients with PD and low in patients with SD at all time points post-treatment. Conclusions: Depletion of circulating Tregs and gMDSCs may prevent their accumulation in the TME and enhance the efficacy of pembrolizumab in subjects with tumors resistant to checkpoint inhibitors. The decrease in circulating nTregs and gMDSCs after treatment with NEO-201 and pembrolizumab was associated with durable SD. High levels of sMICA can impair ADCC mediated by NEO-201, resulting in poor clinical response. Low levels of sMICA in patients with SD, together with the reduction of both circulating nTregs and gMDSCs, could be favorable prognostic markers for clinical benefit following treatment with NEO-201 and pembrolizumab. Ongoing enrollment in this clinical trial will validate these findings in larger cohorts. Clinical trial information: NCT03476681 .">

 Despite the Indolent lymphoma is a slowly growing tumor that has many therapeutic options and good initial response, it is usually incurable. Relapses and HT to aggressive form may occur and some patients die from their disease. For the RR iNHL Several novel targeted therapies may be recommended such as antibody–drug conjugates (ADC) and bispecific T cell engagers (BiTE). B cell maturation antigen is a transmembrane glycoprotein that regulate B cell proliferation, survival, maturation and differentiation into PCs. IT is expressed in multiple myeloma and B cell neoplasms. The effects of BCMA have been studied in multiple myeloma and a new BCMA-targeted immunotherapy has been approved for the treatment RRMM patients. Few studies done to detect BCMA in other Hematologic malignancies as a diagnostic or prognostic tool and a therapeutic potential of antiBCMa targeted therapy in these malignancies. In this study we detect sBCMA in the serum of iNHL patients.



 To measure the levels soluble BCMA (sBCMA) in the serum of adult patients with indolent non Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL).



 A case control study conducted on adult patients of iNHL attending hematology department of Ain Shams university with a participant of 40 cases of newly diagnosed and RR iNHL plus 40 control.



 In the present study we found that there was no statistically significant difference between the studied groups as regard sex, TLC, Hb, platelet counts and tumor subtypes in relation to BCMA level . While there is a statistically significant correlation between Age, stage and LDH to the BCMA level. The results suggest that the BCMA level is significantly higher in patients with iNHL than the healthy controls.



 This study suggest that the BCMA level is significantly higher in patients with iNHL than the healthy controls. By increasing the Age ≥ 40 years the risk of iNHL is increased by 1.71 folds than otherwise healthy controls. The BCMA level was positively correlated to LDH implying that BCMA could be related to iNHL proliferation rate and possibly lymphoma aggressiveness. The level of BCMA more than 430 ng/dL correlated with a more than a 4.5-fold rise in the risk of higher disease stage with borderline significance. Further studies are needed to detect the relation between The BCMA level and the disease prognosis that may be useful for a promising AntiBCMA targeted therapy for RR patients.

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is characterized by autoantibodies targeting keratinocytes adhesion proteins desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and 3, and by the HLA-DRB1-0402 predisposition allele. Treatment using rituximab (RTX) combined with short-term corticosteroids (CS) allows disease control and long-lasting remission.


OBJECTIVE
The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of RTX on the circulating subpopulations of Dsg-3-specific T lymphocytes that specifically regulate B cell responses: follicular helper (Tfh) and follicular regulatory T (Tfr) lymphocytes.


METHODS
Using the HLA-DRB1-0402 tetramer loaded with the Dsg-3 immunodominant peptide, we analysed by flow cytometry the frequency, the polarisation and the activation status of blood Dsg-3-specific follicular T cell populations at baseline, Month 6 and long-term follow-up (Month 60-90) from PV patients.


RESULTS
At baseline, we observed a predominance of Tfh1* and Tfh17 subsets and an underrepresentation of the Tfh2 subset among autoreactive Dsg-3-specific Tfh cells as compared with non-autoreactive Tfh cells. RTX treatment induced a decrease of autoreactive Tfh cells with no effect on their polarisation during patients' follow-up. In parallel, we observed the emergence of a Dsg-3-specific Tfr subpopulation with a significant overexpression of the surface activation markers PD1, ICOS, and CD25 that was not observed at the surface of autoreactive Tfh and non-autoreactive Tfr cells of the same PV patients. In contrast, a very few Dsg-3 specific Tfr cells were observed in PV patients treated with CS alone.


CONCLUSION
Here we show that the emergence of circulating autoreactive Dsg-3-specific Tfr cells is associated with the long-term efficacy of RTX in PV patients.">

        <tr id="6552 Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (alloHSCT) offer a potential curative treatment for many hematological cancers, however, traditional alloHSCT is associated with high mortality from complications including infection, graft versus host disease (GvHD) and relapse. Orca-T is an investigational allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy that includes stem and immune cells, derived from allogeneic donors, that leverages highly purified, polyclonal donor regulatory T cells to control alloreactive immune responses. In this sub-group analysis, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who were treated with Orca-T. Methods: Data from 37 patients with the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in CR/CRi who received myeloablative conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa (BFT) followed by Orca-T by 6/30/22 as part of a multicenter phase 1b single-arm trial (NCT04013685) are reported here. Patients enrolled in the phase 1b trial who did not meet these criteria were not included in this analysis. Patients received BFT prior to Orca-T, followed by single-agent GvHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus, and had an 8/8 related or unrelated matched donor. Donors were matched via DNA-based high-resolution typing of HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1. Results: Orca-T was successfully manufactured at a centralized GMP facility, distributed, and infused at study sites throughout the U.S. Vein-to-vein time (i.e. time between end of donor apheresis to start of recipient’s Orca-T infusion) was < 72 hours for all patients, with the majority < 60 hours. Median age was 51 years, 49% were female and 16% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Twenty-three (62%) had matched related donors and 14 (38%) had matched unrelated donors. Baseline HCT-CI score was 3 and 4 in 27% and 8% of the patients, respectively. The majority had intermediate DRI scores (89%) and 41% were MRD positive at baseline. The median duration of follow-up was 14 months. Relapse-free survival at 12 months was 81.4% (95% CI: 62.9, 91.2). Non-relapse mortality and overall survival were 0% and 100% at 12 months, respectively. Conclusions: These encouraging results suggest that investigational Orca-T could represent a reduced toxicity alternative to conventional alloHSCT. This combination of Orca-T with myeloablative BFT led to > 80% RFS without treatment related mortality, and 100% overall survival in this AML patient population. These outcomes were accomplished with consistent and reliable cell manufacturing and distribution of Orca-T at a national scale. A multi-center randomized controlled phase 3 trial comparing Orca-T to SOC, utilizing BFT or TBI-based conditioning, will complete enrollment during the first half of 2024. (NCT05316701).

        <tr id="Background Despite continuous improvements in the new target and construction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T, relapse remains a significant challenge following CAR-T therapy. Tumor microenvironment (TME) strongly correlates with the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA), which exerts a multifaceted and controversial role in regulating the TME, acts not only as a ligand on antigen-presenting cells but also functions as a receptor on T cells. However, the characteristics and underlying mechanisms governing endogenous T-cell activation by VISTA, which are pivotal for reshaping the TME, remain incompletely elucidated. Methods The immunocompetent B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), lymphoma, and melanoma murine models were employed to investigate the characteristics of endogenous T cells within the TME following CD19 and hCAIX CAR-T cell therapy, respectively. Furthermore, we examined the role of VISTA controlled by interferon (IFN)-γ signaling in regulating endogenous T-cell activation and functionality in B-ALL mice. Results We demonstrated that the administration of CD19 CAR-T or hCAIX CAR-T cell therapy elicited augmented immune responses of endogenous T cells within the TME of B-ALL, lymphoma, and melanoma mice, thereby substantiating the efficacy of CAR-T cell efficacy. However, in the TME lacking IFN-γ signaling, VISTA levels remained elevated, resulting in attenuated cytotoxicity of endogenous T cells and reduced B-ALL recipient survival. Mice treated with CD19 CAR-T cells exhibited increased proportions of endogenous memory T cells during prolonged remission, which possessed the tumor-responsive capabilities to protect against B-ALL re-challenge. Compared with wild-type (WT) CAR-T treated mice, the administration of IFN-γ−/− CAR-T to both WT and IFN-γ−/− recipients resulted in a reduction in the numbers of endogenous CD4+ and CD8+ effectors, while exhibiting increased populations of naïve-like CD4+ T and memory CD8+ T cells. VISTA expression consistently remained elevated in resting or memory CD4+ T cells, with distinct localization from programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expressing T subsets. Blocking the VISTA signal enhanced dendritic cell-induced proliferation and cytokine production by syngeneic T cells. Conclusion Our findings confirm that endogenous T-cell activation and functionality are regulated by VISTA, which is associated with the therapeutic efficiency of CAR-T and provides a promising therapeutic strategy for relapse cases in CAR-T therapy.">

        <tr id="e19059 Background: Loncastuximab tesirine-lpy (Lonca) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising an anti-CD19 antibody conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer cytotoxin. Epcoritamab-bysp (Epco) is a CD20×CD3 T cell-engaging bispecific antibody (bsAb) that redirects T-cells to eliminate malignant B-cells. Epco and Lonca target different B-cell surface antigens and combining both is expected to have additive or synergistic efficacy. Previously, a novel QSP model for Lonca was developed (Utsey K et al. Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev. 2023;12:123-125) and validated with clinical data from patients with R/R DLBCL (Caimi P et al. Blood. 2022;140:9548-9550). A combination QSP model for Lonca with Epco in R/R DLBCL was described to predict potential anti-tumor synergies in proposed clinical trials. Methods: The model reduced previous Lonca model complexity while maintaining core functionality and was combined with a published QSP model for T-cell bsAbs (Hosseini I et al. Npj Syst Bio Appl. 2020;6(1):1-11) to predict tumor dynamics after Lonca and/or Epco treatment. Assumptions included: 1) Lonca or Epco induce healthy and malignant B-cell killing; 2) tumor comprises malignant B- & T-cells; 3) tumor volume is based on malignant B-cell count; 4) T-cells can enter or leave tumor as with other tissues; 5) CD19-/low CD20+ B-cells account for tumor heterogeneity from cells insensitive to Lonca treatment. Results: Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was predicted to plateau by Cycle (C) 2 with Epco monotherapy. By end of C3, however, predicted median normalized tumor volume reduction with co-dosing Lonca and Epco was approximately 1 log order greater than Epco alone. Maximum activity of Lonca and Epco therapy was not observed until C4 or later as depth of tumor regression increased with additional treatment cycles. Since patients with DLBCL may present with low T-cell counts (Hutchings et al. Lancet. 2021) the effect of T-cell count at baseline was evaluated. A 50% decrease at baseline from 2000-1000 T-cells/µL significantly reduced antitumor effect with Epco alone but made no difference with Lonca in combination. Conclusions: These results resemble predictions for Lonca in combination with other bsAbs (Lonca plus mosunetuzumab or glofitamab; abstract submitted to AACR 2024). By end of C3, Lonca plus Epco was predicted to promote substantially more TGI than Epco or Lonca alone. While increased doses of Lonca from 90-150 µg/kg in combination had limited additional therapeutic benefit, combination treatment beyond C3 was predicted to increase depth of tumor regression. Response from Lonca and Epco co-dosing was predicted to be less affected by suppressed T-cell counts at baseline compared to Epco alone; a feature that may enhance responsiveness when T-cell level is moderate.">

        <tr id="CD70 is an attractive target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of both solid and liquid malignancies. However, the functionality of CD70-specific CAR T cells is modest. We optimized a CD70-specific VHH-based CAR (nanoCAR). We evaluated the nanoCARs in clinically relevant models in vitro, using co-cultures of CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells with malignant rhabdoid tumor organoids, and in vivo, using a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Whereas the nanoCAR T cells were highly efficient in organoid co-cultures, they showed only modest efficacy in the PDX model. We determined that fratricide was not causing this loss in efficacy, rather CD70 interaction in cis with the nanoCAR induced exhaustion. Knocking out CD70 in nanoCAR T cells using CRISPR/Cas9, resulted in dramatically enhanced functionality in the DLBCL PDX model. Through single-cell transcriptomics, we obtained evidence that CD70 knock out (KO) CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells were protected from antigen-induced exhaustion. In addition, we demonstrated that WT CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells already exhibited signs of exhaustion shortly after production. Their gene signature strongly overlapped with gene signatures of exhausted CAR T cells. On the other hand, the gene signature of KO CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells overlapped with the gene signature of CAR T-cell infusion products that led to complete responses in chronic lymphatic leukemia patients. Our data show that CARs targeting endogenous T-cell antigens negatively affect CAR T-cell functionality by inducing an exhausted state, which can be overcome by knocking out the specific target.">

        <tr id="2546 Background: SUPLEXA therapeutic cells are the initial autologous and non-engineered candidate to emerge from the novel ENLIST cells training platform. Manufacturing is robust, reproducible and with an acceptable cost of goods. The method requires 35 days to produce multiple doses. Multiple mechanisms of SUPLEXA therapeutic cells have been delineated and all appear to complement that of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with SUPLEXA cells serving to enhance the number of primed anti-tumor host T cells while ICIs serve to increase the durability of primed T cells by blocking their premature down-regulation. Methods: A 35 patient Phase 1 single-agent study survey study is currently ongoing in Australia to test the safety and clinical activity of SUPLEXA cells in end-stage patients with various tumor types. No chemo preconditioning or concomitant cytokine treatment was employed. CYTOF analysis of longitudinal peripheral blood is used to monitor changes to the host immune system. Results: To date, SUPLEXA therapeutic cells have demonstrated safety and significant clinical benefit with an observed CR, PR, and many durable SD in approximately half the patients. Several solid tumor patients remain on study beyond 1 year and doing well. Longitudinal analysis of PBMCs from SUPLEXA cell treated cancer patients demonstrated durable changes in the composition of myeloid immune cell subsets in SUPLEXA treated patients, impacting the anti-tumor bias of the host immune system. Specifically, we identified a dramatic decrease in the number of peripheral myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), within 3 weeks of SUPLEXA treatment. In patients with CR and PR, we also identified stable increases in activated classical CD14+ blood monocytes. Conclusions: SUPLEXA therapeutic cells are a highly differentiated approach to cellular therapy. The first-in-human experience demonstrated a pristine safety profile and strong clinical benefit as a single-agent. The pharmacodynamic decrease of in the number of MDSCs, known to suppress the anti-tumor immune response and limit immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) efficacy, supports the further clinical testing to test the hypothesis that the multiple mechanisms of SUPLEXA cells will enhance the clinical activity of ICIs.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been used for almost 40 years in the treatment of autoimmune and systemic inflammatory diseases. Numerous cells are involved in the innate immune response, including monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, natural killer cells, and innate lymphoid cells. Many studies have investigated the mechanisms by which IVIg down-modulates inflammatory and autoimmune processes of innate immune cells. However, questions remain regarding the precise mechanism of action in autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. The aim of this work was to review the immunomodulatory effect of IVIg on only human innate immune cells. A narrative review approach was chosen to summarize key evidence on the immunomodulatory effects of commercially available and unmodified IVIg on human innate immune cells.


SUMMARY
Numerous different immunomodulatory effects of IVIg have been reported, with some very different effects depending on the immune cell type and disease. Several limitations of the different studies were identified. Of the 77 studies identified and reviewed, 29 (37.7%) dealt with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. Otherwise, the immunomodulatory effects of IVIg were studied only in healthy donors using an in vitro experimental approach. Some of the documented effects showed disease-specific effects, such as in Kawasaki disease. Various methodological limitations have also been identified that may reduce the validity of some studies.


KEY MESSAGE
As further insights have been gained into the various inflammatory cascades activated in immunological diseases, interesting insights have also been gained into the mechanism of action of IVIg. We are still far from discovering all the immunomodulatory mechanisms of IVIg.">

        <tr id="e14535 Background: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most common complication of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) for hematologic malignancies. We hypothesized that patients undergoing CAR-T therapy who are on metformin will experience a lower incidence or severity of CRS than patients not on this medication. Methods: We evaluated all patients treated with CAR-T at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1/1/2018 and 1/31/2023, and abstracted relevant clinical and laboratory characteristics to determine the incidence and severity of CRS, PFS as well as OS in patients who were, or were not, on metformin before and during CAR-T therapy for Type 2 diabetes mellitus. We used the Chi-Square test, Mann-Whitney test and the Kaplan-Meier method to analyze data. Results: In the 5-year interval under consideration 237 patients received CAR-T, 168 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 69 for multiple myeloma (MM). 23 patients (15 NHL and 8 MM) were on metformin at the time of CAR-T. 15 patient developed CRS while on metformin and 175 patients not on metformin (p=0.05). Grade 3 or 4 CRS incidence was 4% in both groups (p=0.41). Of the 153 patients with NHL not on metformin, 121 developed any grade of CRS, while 10 of 15 patients on metformin developed CRS (p=0.268). 4 NHL patients developed CRS Grade ≥3 or higher, while 0 of 15 on metformin developed Grade ≥3 CRS (p=0.237). For the MM patients, the incidence of CRS was 49 patients not on metformin and 5 patients on metformin (p<0.001). 3 MM patients developed CRS Grade ≥3 or higher, while 0 of 8 on metformin developed Grade ≥3 CRS (p=0.346). 12 of 15 patients on metformin with NHL achieved CR compared to 92 of 153 patients not on metformin (p=0.1305). 3 of 8 patients with MM on metformin compared to 24 of 61 patients with MM not on metformin achieved CR or better post CAR-T (p=0.92). Tocilizumab was used in 40% of patients on metformin but in 66% of patients not on metformin (p=0.0016). In NHL patients, PFS from CAR-T infusion was not reached (range: 6.3 to NR) for patients on metformin versus 9.9 months (range: 6.3–19.5) in patients not on metformin (p = 0.3332). In the MM patients, progression-free survival (PFS) from CAR-T infusion was 8.4 months (95% CI: 7.9–not reached [NR]) for patients on metformin and 22.6 months (13.7–NR) for those not on metformin (p = 0.07). Median OS for NHL patients on metformin was not reached (9.766–NR) versus 32.6 months (18.6–NR) for patients not on metformin (p = 0.7022). Median OS was 17 months (95% CI: 8.3 to NR) for patients with MM on metformin vs NR (95% CI: 9.4 to NR) for patients not on metformin (p = 0.2559). Conclusions: In this retrospective study, the co-administration of metformin during CAR-T cell therapy for NHL and MM appears to be associated with a numerically reduced incidence of CRS.

        <tr id="2027 Background: Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is a devastating complication from cancer, with a median survival of 6-8 weeks. The incidence of LMD is highest in melanoma (5-25%) carrying the worst prognosis. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) showed complete and durable responses in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. CSF-derived T cell populations in LMD shift to more exhausted phenotypes compared to extracranial and brain metastases. Ex vivo large T cell expansion can overcome this shortfall, with adoptive T cell transfer representing a novel therapeutic approach to treat melanoma LMD (M-LMD). The goal of this study is to optimize rapid CSF-derived tumor reactive T cell expansion in M-LMD, and evaluate the immune microenvironment in CSF compared to peripheral immunity and anti-tumoral response. Methods: CSF was collected from M-LMD patients (n=6) via lumbar puncture or Ommaya. Cells were plated following established TIL culture protocols to determine optimal expansion conditions i.e.: 1) 6000 IU/mL IL-2, 2) IL-2+OKT3, 3) IL-2+anti-4-1BB agonistic antibody, 4) IL-2+IL-7+IL-15+IL-21, 5) IL-2+anti-CD3/CD28 human dynabeads, & 6) IL-2+anti-CD3/CD28/CD137 human dynabeads. After 4 weeks, T cells were propagated via rapid expansion protocol (REP) and phenotyped for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with flow cytometry. T cells were co-cultured for 18-24 hours with HLA-matched melanoma cell lines to assess functionality, and IFN-y levels evaluated in supernatant. Ongoing studies are evaluating other biomarkers i.e., chemokines via Luminex. To examine the expanded TCR clonotypes, TCR beta seq was done in CSF-derived T cells at different times point of expansion and peripheral T cells. Results: Collected CSF yielded an average 8.12e4 viable cells for expansion (range 5e2-2.43e6). After initial culture in IL-2, 61.9% of samples showed increased cell yield with an average 101.68-fold expansion (range 2.35-1054). PreREP T cells were predominantly CD4+ (45.7%). REP was completed with a 100% success rate (mean 187.47-fold expansion). Post-REP flow cytometry analysis revealed similar results with further expansion of T cells. Additional culture supplements (Methods #2-6) produced similar expansion with a reduced T cell input requirement and demonstrated the potential to enrich for CD8+ T cells. M-LMD T cells were highly functional, producing substantial levels of IFN-y in response to HLA-matched melanoma cell lines. Anti-CD3/CD28 produced a larger expansion of T cells with higher levels of IFN-y. Preliminary TCR beta sequencing data revealed a distinct clonal distribution between peripheral and CSF-derived T cells. Conclusions: Therapies for LMD patients are desperately needed. Results demonstrate successful expansion of T cells ex vivo from CSF in M-LMD. Results raise potential to use autologous CSF-derived T cells as therapeutic strategy for patients with LMD.">

        <tr id="Persistent inflammation driven by cytokines such as type-one interferon (IFN-I) can cause immunosuppression. We show that administration of the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor itacitinib after anti–PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) immunotherapy improves immune function and antitumor responses in mice and results in high response rates (67%) in a phase 2 clinical trial for metastatic non–small cell lung cancer. Patients who failed to respond to initial anti–PD-1 immunotherapy but responded after addition of itacitinib had multiple features of poor immune function to anti–PD-1 alone that improved after JAK inhibition. Itacitinib promoted CD8 T cell plasticity and therapeutic responses of exhausted and effector memory–like T cell clonotypes. Patients with persistent inflammation refractory to itacitinib showed progressive CD8 T cell terminal differentiation and progressive disease. Thus, JAK inhibition may improve the efficacy of anti–PD-1 immunotherapy by pivoting T cell differentiation dynamics. Editor’s summary Cancer immunotherapy is a type of treatment that mobilizes a patient’s immune system to kill tumor cells. It has been successful in treating certain tumors, but patients frequently have chronic inflammation and immunosuppression, which can limit treatment response. Two independent clinical trials looked at whether dialing down inflammation using drugs called JAK inhibitors could improve the efficacy of anti–PD-1 immunotherapy in cancer patients (see the Perspective by Gadina and O’Shea). Mathew et al. conducted a phase 2 trial to investigate the drug combination as a first-line therapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Delayed administration of itacitinib after treatment with pembrolizumab improved therapeutic response. Zak et al. performed a phase 1/2 trial in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A combination of ruxolitinib and nivolumab resulted in improved clinical efficacy in patients who had previously failed checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Inflammation is a hallmark of cancer but is also required to generate optimal antitumor immune responses. Although short exposure to cytokines such as interferon (IFN) can enhance tumor immunity, prolonged exposure can result in immunosuppression. The dual nature of inflammation makes it challenging to harness the beneficial effects of cytokine activation during cancer immunotherapy while avoiding detrimental consequences. Thus, a therapeutical strategy to effectively modulate these often-opposing functions of cytokine signaling could improve immunotherapy efficacy and mitigate development of resistance. RATIONALE Preclinical studies in mice have demonstrated that blockade of type-one IFN (IFN-I) signaling can improve immune function during chronic viral infections and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy for cancer. Moreover, tumors from patients with lung and other cancer types that relapse after—or are resistant to—immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) can have high expression of IFN-stimulated genes. Thus, we conducted a phase 2 clinical trial for first-line metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression ≥50%. Patients were administered 6 weeks of anti–PD-1 (PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1) immunotherapy, followed by a combination of anti–PD-1 and itacitinib [a selective Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor] for 6 weeks before continuing with anti–PD-1 alone. To understand the immunological effects of transient JAK inhibition aimed at interfering with persistent inflammation occurring after anti–PD-1, we evaluated the association between clinical response and the evolution of CD8 T cell differentiation, immune signaling, and inflammatory markers. RESULTS In mice, the addition of itacitinib after the start of ICB improved response of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)–high resistant tumors and increased the proportion of proliferating precursor-like CD8 T cells in the periphery. Use of an IFN-I–receptor blocking antibody similarly improved ICB efficacy, suggesting that blockade of IFN-I signaling is sufficient to phenocopy the effects of delayed JAK inhibition. In humans, the combination of anti–PD-1 with delayed, transient, itactinib treatment in patients with NSCLC led to an overall response rate of 67% and median progression-free survival of 23.8 months. Patients were categorized into three response groups based on the timing of radiographic response: patients with clinical response within the first two cycles of anti–PD-1 monotherapy (αPD1.R), patients who responded only after a 6-week course of concurrent itacitinib was added at the start of the third cycle of anti–PD-1 (JAKi.R), or patients who did not respond regardless of treatment (NR). Each clinical response group had distinctive immunological changes coupled to inflammatory features. The αPD1.R patients had low baseline inflammation and CD8 T cell responses after anti–PD-1 alone. JAKi.R patients had elevated inflammatory markers, poor CD8 T cell responses, and blunted immune signaling after anti–PD-1 alone. However, after addition of itacitinib, subsequent clinical responses in JAKi.R patients were associated with decreased inflammatory signaling accompanied by an increase in a “fate-flexible” CD8 T cell progenitor-like population. This fate-flexible population was linked to features of greater CD8 T cell plasticity. By contrast, NR patients had high baseline inflammation refractory to JAK inhibition. This persistent inflammatory and IFN-I signaling in NR patients was associated with CD8 T cell terminal differentiation and treatment failure. CONCLUSION As a therapeutic strategy to block the immunosuppressive effects of persistent IFN and/or chronic inflammation, JAK inhibition after initial anti–PD-1 is safe, feasible, and associated with durable and high response rates in NSCLC. JAK inhibition may be particularly beneficial in patients with elevated inflammation who have poor CD8 T cell responses to anti–PD-1 alone. In this study, JAK inhibition enhanced CD8 T cell plasticity by decreasing the inflammatory and IFN-I signals that drive terminal differentiation of CD8 T cells. However, some patients with the highest baseline levels of inflammation were largely unaffected by JAK1 inhibition and had progressive terminal CD8 T cell differentiation and disease progression. Our findings suggest that JAK inhibition can target chronic immunoregulatory functions of cytokine signaling that contribute to relapse during cancer immunotherapy and is a strategy warranting further preclinical and clinical investigation. JAK inhibitors to improve clinical and immune response to anti–PD-1 for lung cancer patients. In a clinical trial of patients with NSCLC treated with anti–PD-1, mitigating persistent IFN-I and inflammation with a JAK inhibitor decreased terminal differentiation of CD8 T cells and expanded fate-flexible CD8 T cell progenitors in responding patients. Patients with progressive disease had high baseline inflammation that minimally changed with JAK1 inhibition.">

        <tr id="3139 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has proved efficacy in MSI colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC), but its use in MSS tumors remains a challenge. As the mechanisms of action of CTLA-4 and PD-1 are non-redundant, targeting both pathways may have additive or synergistic activity in comparison with single PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition in MSS and MSI CRC and EC tumors, while single cell characterization of persistent cells upon treatment would enable to describe cell populations and build a detailed single-cell map of the immune, tumor and stromal cell composition. A single dose of tremelimumab (Trem) 300mg, while maintaining a similar overall exposure, has 3- to 4-fold higher Cmax compared to 4 doses of Trem 1 mg/kg, which may have the potential for better anti-tumor activity while potentially avoiding cumulative toxicity. Here we present the results of patients (pts) with refractory ICI-naïve MSS EC and CRC treated with Dur plus Trem and the characterization of immune and persistent cells with longitudinal single-cell analyses. Methods: Pts with advanced MSS/pMMR CRC and EC that have progressed during or after standard therapy with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1, ECOG ≤1, were treated with Dur 1500mg plus Trem 300mg at Week 0, followed by Dur 1500 mg Q4W. Response rate was correlated with transcriptome and T cell repertoire dynamics measured at single-cell level from freshly processed biopsies at three different timepoints: baseline, upon treatment and at progression. Results: 24 samples for single-cell analysis were obtained (4 MSS CRC and 4 MSS EC). The response rate (RR) was 0%, while disease control rate was 12.5%. Despite the lack of response, we found a massive shift in the immune tumor microenvironments of all patients. Following treatment, immune cell composition shifted to increased frequency of effector-memory, proliferating CD8+ cells and CD4+ cells, surprisingly, with enriched T helper phenotypes. Both lineages showed strong signals of exhaustion. The integration of matched T cell receptor (TCR) data pointed to an infiltration of new clonotypes, rather than the expansion of pre-existing tumor-resident T cells, with distinct degrees of dysfunctional phenotypes between the clones. Intriguingly, expanded clonotypes could be detected and monitored in peripheral blood cells using ultra-deep TCR sequencing. Conclusions: Dual treatment with Dur and Trem does not result in an improved RR in patients with refractory MSS/pMMR CRC and EC, despite profound dynamics in the tumor infiltrating immune cells landscape. The infiltration of CD4+ T helper cells provides mechanistic insights of immune evasion, a potential avenue to treat MSS/pMMR tumors. Clinical trial information: 2021-004061-13 .">

        <tr id="Checkpoint blockade therapy (CBT) involving anti-PD1 antibodies represents the standard approach for cHL patients who do not respond to second-line therapy. Nonetheless, only 20% of relapsed/refractory (R/R) cHL patients treated with CBT achieve complete remission. In this study, we extensively examined the immune dynamics in eight R/R cHL patients treated with CBT, consisting of four complete responders (CR) and four experiencing disease progression (PD), by single cell analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Our unique approach encompassed longitudinal analysis with three time points, providing a comprehensive understanding of the evolving immune responses during anti-PD1 therapy. Through gene expression profiling, we identified a stable and distinctive KLRG1+/FOS+/JUN+/GZMA+/CD8+ T cell phenotype in patients achieving complete responses. This specific CD8+ T cell subset exhibited sustained activation, underscoring its potential pivotal role in mounting an effective immune response against cHL. Furthermore, T cell receptor (TCR) analysis revealed that in responder patients there is clonal expansion between TCR clonotypes specifically in the KLRG1+/FOS+/JUN+/GZMA+/CD8+ T cell subset. Our longitudinal study offers unique insights into the complex immune dynamics of multiply relapsed/highly pre-treated cHL patients undergoing anti-PD1 therapy.">

        <tr id="TPS6585 Background: Despite improved outcomes with azacitidine (AZA) and venetoclax (VEN) in newly diagnosed (ND) unfit acute myeloid leukemia (AML), only a subset of patients (pts) respond (CR 37%; CR/CRi 66%) and long-term survival remains inadequate (mOS <15m, DiNardo NEJM 2020). The measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative rate was 41% in AZA-VEN treated pts in VIALE-A which was associated with improved survival (Pratz JCO 2022). CD123 is expressed on the majority of AML blasts and leukemic stem cells while minimally expressed on normal hematopoietic stem cells (Kovtun Blood Adv 2018). Pivekimab sunirine (PVEK, IMGN632) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising a high-affinity CD123 antibody, cleavable linker, and an indolinobenzodiazepine pseudodimer (IGN) payload. The IGN payload alkylates DNA and causes single strand breaks without crosslinking. IGNs are designed to have high potency against tumor cells, while demonstrating less toxicity to normal marrow progenitors than other DNA-targeting payloads. Clinical data from the first 50 pts in the dose expansion cohorts 1 and 2 with ND AML demonstrated a 76% (22/29) MRD negativity rate (by flow cytometry, negativity threshold <0.1%) (Daver ASH 2023), supporting the continued enrollment of the PVEK+AZA+VEN triplet and further evaluation of the regimen’s antileukemia activity and safety in consideration of potential registration-enabling trials. Methods: This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1b/2 study of PVEK administered in a combination with AZA+VEN in pts with ND CD123-positive (CD123+ by flow cytometry or IHC) AML, with no prior treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMA). Pts will receive the recommended phase 2 dose of PVEK 0.045 mg/kg IV as a < 30-minute outpatient infusion on day 7, AZA 75 mg/m2 SC or IV daily on days 1 to 7, and VEN 400 mg PO daily for up to 28 days in a 28-day cycle. During cycle 1, a bone marrow evaluation at or around day 21 is required to inform VEN dose duration. Current eligibility criteria for continued enrollment of AML patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy include age ≥ 75 years old, or age < 75 years old with ECOG 2-3, or at least one defined comorbidity. The primary study objectives are to assess antileukemia clinical activity (composite CR [complete remission] rate, overall response rate, duration of remission) and MRD-negativity rates. Key secondary objectives are safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. The PVEK+AZA+VEN triplet in pts with ND unfit AML is currently enrolling across sites in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and USA. Clinical trial information: NCT04086264 .">

        <tr id="Background Adoptive cell therapy using genetically modified T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-T) has shown encouraging results, particularly in certain blood cancers. Nevertheless, over 40% of B cell malignancy patients experience a relapse after CAR-T therapy, likely due to inadequate persistence of the modified T cells in the body. IL15, known for its pro-survival and proliferative properties, has been suggested for incorporation into the fourth generation of CAR-T cells to enhance their persistence. However, the potential systemic toxicity associated with this cytokine warrants further evaluation. Methods We analyzed the persistence, antitumor efficacy and potential toxicity of anti-mouse CD19 CAR-T cells which express a membrane-bound IL15-IL15Rα chimeric protein (CD19/mbIL15q CAR-T), in BALB/c mice challenged with A20 tumor cells as well as in NSG mice. Results Conventional CD19 CAR-T cells showed low persistence and poor efficacy in BALB/c mice treated with mild lymphodepletion regimens (total body irradiation (TBI) of 1 Gy). CD19/mbIL15q CAR-T exhibits prolonged persistence and enhanced in vivo efficacy, effectively eliminating established A20 B cell lymphoma. However, this CD19/mbIL15q CAR-T displays important long-term toxicities, with marked splenomegaly, weight loss, transaminase elevations, and significant inflammatory findings in some tissues. Mice survival is highly compromised after CD19/mbIL15q CAR-T cell transfer, particularly if a high TBI regimen is applied before CAR-T cell transfer. Conclusion Tethered IL15-IL15Rα augments the antitumor activity of CD19 CAR-T cells but displays long-term toxicity in immunocompetent mice. Inducible systems to regulate IL15-IL15Rα expression could be considered to control this toxicity.">

Upon BNT142 RNA-LNP delivery in cell culture, mice, and cynomolgus monkeys, RNA is translated, followed by self-assembly into and secretion of the functional bispecific antibody RiboMab02.1. In vitro, RiboMab02.1 mediated CLDN6 target cell–specific activation and proliferation of T cells, and potent target cell killing. In mice and cynomolgus monkeys, intravenously administered BNT142 RNA-LNP maintained therapeutic serum concentrations of the encoded antibody. Concentrations of RNA-encoded RiboMab02.1 were maintained longer in circulation in mice than concentrations of directly injected, sequence-identical protein. Weekly injections of mice with BNT142 RNA-LNP in the 0.1- to 1-μg dose range were sufficient to eliminate CLDN6-positive subcutaneous human xenograft tumors and increase survival over controls. Tumor regression was associated with an influx of T cells and depletion of CLDN6-positive cells. BNT142 induced only transient and low cytokine production in CLDN6-positive tumor-bearing mice humanized with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). No signs of adverse effects from BNT142 RNA-LNP administration were observed in mice or cynomolgus monkeys. On the basis of these and other findings, a phase 1/2 first-in-human clinical trial has been initiated to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of BNT142 RNA-LNP in patients with CLDN6-positive advanced solid tumors (NCT05262530). The anti-CLDN6 T cell engager RiboMab02.1 encoded by BNT142 RNA-LNP shows favorable preclinical pharmacology against CLDN6-positive solid tumors. Editor’s summary Bispecific T cell–engaging antibodies (BsAbs) have been approved to treat hematological malignancies; however, current forms are limited because of manufacturing and short serum half-lives. To improve these BsAbs, Stadler et al. have created BNT142, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)–formulated RNA encoding a BsAb against CD3 and the oncofetal antigen claudin 6 (CLDN6). The authors then showed inhibition of tumor growth in treated preclinical mouse models and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and no adverse effects in cynomolgus monkeys.

        <tr id="Recent years have seen a marked increase in research on chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells, with specific relevance to the treatment of hematological malignancies. Here, the structural principles, iterative processes, and target selection of CAR-T cells for therapeutic applications are described in detail, as well as the challenges faced in the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. These challenges include insufficient infiltration of cells, off-target effects, cytokine release syndrome, and tumor lysis syndrome. In addition, directions in the iterative development of CAR-T cell therapy are discussed, including modifications of CAR-T cell structures, improvements in specificity using multi-targets and novel targets, the use of Boolean logic gates to minimize off-target effects and control toxicity, and the adoption of additional protection mechanisms to improve the durability of CAR-T cell treatment. This review provides ideas and strategies for the development of CAR-T cell therapy through an in-depth exploration of the underlying mechanisms of action of CAR-T cells and their potential for innovative modification.">

        <tr id="Hematological toxicity is a common side effect of CAR-T therapies, being particularly severe in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patients. In this study, we analyzed a cohort of 48 patients treated with BCMA CAR-T cells to characterize the kinetics of cytopenia, identify predictive factors and determine potential mechanism underlying these toxicities. The overall incidence of cytopenia was 95.74%, and grade>3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia one month after infusion was observed in 57% and 53% of the patients and was still present after 1 year in 4 and 3 patients respectively. Presence of cytopenia at baseline and high peak inflammatory markers highly correlated with cytopenia persisting up to three months. To determine potential mechanisms underpinning cytopenias, we evaluated the paracrine effect of BCMA CAR-T cells on the differentiation of HSPCs using an ex-vivo myeloid differentiation model. Phenotypic analysis showed that supernatants from activated CAR-T cells (spCAR) halted HSPCs differentiation promoting more immature phenotypes, with reduced expression of granulocytic, monocytic and erythroid markers. Single-cell RNAseq demonstrated an upregulation of transcription factors associated with early stages of hematopoietic differentiation in the presence of spCAR (GATA2, RUNX1 and CEBPA) and decreased activity of key regulons involved in neutrophil and monocytic maturation (ID2 and MAFB). Our results suggest that CAR-T cell activation negatively influences hematopoietic differentiation through paracrine effects inducing arrest of HSPCs maturation and contributes to the understanding of severe cytopenia observed after CAR-T cell treatment in MM patients. These results may identify regulatory mechanisms involved in alter hematopoiesis and could lead to alternative therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="2602 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibition of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has demonstrated durable clinical benefit in patients with advanced solid tumors. However, dose density is limited due to toxicity. BA3071 is a conditionally active biologic (CAB) anti–CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands CD80 and CD86 [1]. CABs are activated within the acidic tumor microenvironment. Conditional and reversible binding of BA3071 may reduce on- and off-tumor immune-related adverse events (AEs) and autoimmunity, avoid tissue-mediated drug deposition, and improve pharmacokinetics. We evaluated the safety and antitumor activity of BA3071 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods: Patients naïve to anti–CTLA-4 therapy with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of single-agent BA3071 every 3 weeks (Q3W) at cycle 1, followed by combination BA3071 + nivolumab from cycle 2 onward. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response assessment was performed Q6W with RECIST v1.1. Results: Eighteen patients were treated with BA3071 (7–700 mg) and nivolumab (240 mg); 61% had received ≥3 lines of prior systemic therapy, and all patients had experienced failure of anti–PD-1 therapy. Four patients experienced grade 3 related treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; hypertension, increased lipase, atrial fibrillation, gastritis, and diabetic ketoacidosis); no grade 4 related TEAEs were observed. Two patients experienced grade 3 immune-related TEAEs (diarrhea [BA3071 350 mg] and diabetic ketoacidosis [BA3071 700 mg]). Among 16 efficacy-evaluable patients, 9 experienced stable disease, and 2 out of 5 patients receiving BA3071 in the 350-mg cohort achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 responses (complete response in cervical carcinoma and partial response in gastroesophageal carcinoma). One patient with metastatic small cell lung cancer who received 7 mg BA3071 remained without progression for >1 year (69 weeks). Conclusions: Treatment with the novel, conditionally active anti–CTLA-4 agent BA3071, in combination with anti–PD-1 therapy (at doses higher than those currently approved for anti–CTLA-4/PD-1 therapy), yielded confirmed responses with a promising tolerability profile. Phase 1 dose escalation of BA3071 continues at 700 mg up to 1000 mg, and phase 2 monotherapy and combination therapy expansion cohorts are currently enrolling at a starting dose level of 350 mg. 1.

        <tr id="Cancer encompasses various elements occurring at the cellular and genetic levels, necessitating an immunotherapy capable of efficiently addressing both aspects. T cells can combat cancer cells by specifically recognizing antigens on them. This innate capability of T cells has been used to develop cellular immunotherapies, but most of them can only target antigens through major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). New gene-editing techniques such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-cas9) can precisely edit the DNA sequences. CRISPR-cas9 has made it possible to generate genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that can overcome the problems associated with old immunotherapies. In chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, the patient’s T cells are isolated and genetically modified to exhibit synthetic CAR(s). CAR-T cell treatment has shown remarkably positive clinical outcomes in cancers of various types. Nevertheless, there are various challenges that reduce CAR-T effectiveness in solid tumors. It is required to address these challenges in order to make CAR-T cell therapy a better and safer option. Combining CAR-T treatment with other immunotherapies that target multiple antigens has shown positive outcomes. Moreover, recently generated Boolean logic-gated advanced CARs along with artificial intelligence has expanded its potential to treat solid tumors in addition to blood cancers. This review aims to describe the structure, types, and various methods used to develop CAR-T cells. The clinical applications of CAR-T cells in hematological malignancies and solid tumours have been described in detail. In addition, this discussion has addressed the limitations associated with CAR-T cells, explored potential strategies to mitigate CAR-T-related toxicities, and delved into future perspectives.">

        <tr id="e19045 Background: CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy has been demonstrated to be a valuable treatment option for relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (r/r B-NHL). It has been shown that between 39% and 97% of clinical samples of B-NHL also express BCMA. To further improve safety and efficacy, we have developed GC012F, a CD19 and BCMA dual-targeting CAR-T, manufactured using the novel next-day FasT CAR-T process, for the treatment of r/r B-NHL. The data from an investigator-initiated trial of GC012F for r/r B-NHL were reported at ASCO 2023 (# 7562). Here, we present updated results of the trial, including more pts and a longer follow-up period. Methods: This is a single-arm, open label trial (ChiCTR2100047061). The patients (pts) were enrolled and treated with a single infusion of GC012F in escalating dosing cohorts after a standard lymphodepletion regimen. The primary objectives of this study were safety and tolerability; the secondary were pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were graded by ASBMT 2019, adverse effects were evaluated according to CTCAE 5.0. Efficacy assessment of GC012F was referred to the Lugano criteria. Results: As of data cut-off on January 30th, 2024, with a median of 410.5 days (range: 28 - 839) of follow-up, all pts received single GC012F infusions at dose levels ranging from 3.7×104 to 3×105 CAR-T/kg. The median age was 49.5 years (range: 18 - 67). Ten pts were Ann Arbor stage III/IV disease. All pts lymphoma samples expressed CD19, and 9 out of 11 expressed BCMA. Ptsreceived a median of 2 prior lines (range: 2 - 3) of therapy including rituximab and anthracyclines. Two ptsreceived the auto-HSCT previously. 91.7% (11/12) of the pts achieved ORR at month 3 post GC012F infusion; 66.7% (8/12) CR at month 6 and 60% (6/10) CR at month 12, respectively. To date, the longest duration of remission is 27.0 months. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. One pt had grade 3 CRS and recovered within 2 days. No ICANS were observed. Grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicities included lymphocytopenia (11/12), neutropenia (11/12) and leukopenia (10/12). All TEAEs were resolved after treatment with standard of care and supportive care. The median peak copy number of CAR-T cells in the peripheral blood was 70,083 copies/μg DNA (range: 6,876 - 185,039), and the median peak time was 14 days (range: 9 - 21). CAR-T cells were also detected in tumor biopsies from all six pts tested. In five pts at progressive disease, the primary or new lesions were CD19 positive, and no CAR-T cells were detected. Conclusions: This first-in-human trial of GC012F for the treatment of r/r DLBCL showed a manageable safety profile and promising clinical responses and a long-lasting duration of a remission. Overall, CD19-BCMA dual targeting CAR-T product GC012F is a promising therapy for r/r DLBCL pts and longer follow-up is ongoing. Clinical trial information: ChiCTR2100047061 .">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Modern immunotherapy approaches are revolutionizing the treatment scenario of relapsed/refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM) patients, providing an opportunity to reach deep level of responses and extend survival outcomes. Areas covered Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and T-cell redirecting treatments, including bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells therapy, have been recently introduced in the treatment of RRMM. Some agents have already received regulatory approval, while newer constructs, novel combinations, and applications in earlier lines of therapy are currently being explored. This review discusses the current landscape and possible development of ADCs, BsAbs and CAR-T cells immunotherapies. Expert Opinion ADCs, BsAbs, and CAR-T therapy have demonstrated substantial activity in heavily pretreated, triple-class exposed (TCE) MM patients, and T-cell redirecting treatments represent new standards of care after third (European Medicines Agency, EMA), or fourth (Food and Drug Administration, FDA), line of therapy. All these three immunotherapies carry advantages and disadvantages, with different accessibility and new toxicities that require appropriate management and guidelines. Multiple on-going programs include combinations therapies and applications in earlier lines of treatment, as well as the development of novel agents or construct to enhance potency, reduce toxicity and facilitate administration. Sequencing is a challenge, with few data available and mechanisms of resistance still to be unraveled.">

        <tr id="Background Approximately half of the neuroblastoma patients develop high-risk neuroblastoma. Current treatment involves a multimodal strategy, including immunotherapy with dinutuximab (IgG ch14.18) targeting GD2. Despite achieving promising results, the recurrence rate remains high and poor survival persists. The therapeutic efficacy of dinutuximab is compromised by suboptimal activation of neutrophils and severe neuropathic pain, partially induced by complement activation. Methods To enhance neutrophil cytotoxicity, IgG ch14.18 was converted to the IgA isotype, resulting in potent neutrophil-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), without complement activation. However, myeloid checkpoint molecules hamper neutrophil cytotoxicity, for example through CD47 that is overexpressed on neuroblastomas and orchestrates an immunosuppressive environment upon ligation to signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) expressed on neutrophils. In this study, we combined IgA therapy with CD47 blockade. Results In vitro killing assays showed enhanced IgA-mediated ADCC by neutrophils targeting neuroblastoma cell lines and organoids in comparison to IgG. Notably, when combined with CD47 blockade, both IgG and IgA therapy were enhanced, though the combination with IgA resulted in the greatest improvement of ADCC. Furthermore, in a neuroblastoma xenograft model, we systemically blocked CD47 with a SIRPα fusion protein containing an ablated IgG1 Fc, and compared IgA therapy to IgG therapy. Only IgA therapy combined with CD47 blockade increased neutrophil influx to the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the IgA combination strategy hampered tumor outgrowth most effectively and prolonged tumor-specific survival. Conclusion These promising results highlight the potential to enhance immunotherapy efficacy against high-risk neuroblastoma through improved neutrophil cytotoxicity by combining IgA therapy with CD47 blockade.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with targeting CD30-expressing Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and immune checkpoint modulation induced by combination therapies of CTLA-4 and PD1.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, trial NCT01896999 enrolled patients with refractory or relapsed HL (R/R HL) after one or more lines of therapy, with adequate performance status and organ function. Using peripheral blood, we assessed soluble proteins, cell composition, T cell clonality, and tumor antigen-specific antibodies in 54 patients enrolled in the phase 1 component of the trial.


RESULTS
NCT01896999 reported high (>75%) overall objective response rates with brentuximab-vedotin (BV) in combination with ipilimumab (I) and/or nivolumab (N) in patients with R/R HL. We observed durable increase in soluble PD-1 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells as well as decreases in plasma CCL17, ANGPT2, MMP12, IL13, and CXCL13 in N-containing regimens (BV+N and BV+I+N) compared with BV+I (p<0.05). Non-responders and patients with short progression free-survival showed elevated CXCL9, CXCL13, CD5, CCL17, adenosine-deaminase, and MUC16 at baseline or after one treatment cycle and a higher prevalence of NY-ESO-1-specific autoantibodies (p<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest a circulating tumor-immune-derived signature of BV±I+N treatment resistance that may be useful for patient stratification in combination checkpoint therapy.">

        <tr id="Background The primary treatment for acute relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) is the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone (IVMP). However, the mechanisms through which corticosteroid treatment impacts acute neuroinflammation in people with MS (pwMS) remain not fully understood. In particular, the changes induced by glucocorticoids (GCs) on cells of the innate immune system and the differences between patients with distinct immunotherapies have received little attention to date. Methods We conducted immunophenotyping using flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of pwMS who received IVMP treatment during a relapse. We compared the impact of an IVMP treatment on a broad variety of immune cell subsets within three groups: twelve patients who were treatment-naïve to disease modifying therapies (wDMT) to ten patients on platform therapies (PT) and eighteen patients on fingolimod therapy (FTY). Results We observed pronounced interindividual short- and intermediate-term effects of IVMP on distinct immune cells subsets. In addition to the well-documented decrease in T-helper cells (Th cells), we detected significant alterations after the first IVMP infusion within the innate immune response among neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil granulocytes, monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). When comparing patients wDMT to the PT and FTY cohorts, we found that IVMP had a similar impact on innate immune cells across all treatment groups. However, we did not observe a significant further decline in T lymphocyte counts during IVMP in patients with pre-existing lymphopenia under FTY treatment. Although T cell apoptosis is considered the main mechanism of action of GCs, patients with FTY still reported symptom improvement following IVMP treatment. Conclusion In addition to T cell suppression, our data suggests that further immunoregulatory mechanisms of GC, particularly on cells of the innate immune response, are of greater significance than previously understood. Due to the regulation of the adaptive immune cells by DMTs, the impact of GC on these cells varies depending on the underlying DMT.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is rapidly becoming a standard of care in the treatment of many cancer types. However, the subset of patients who respond to this type of therapy is limited. Another way to promote antitumoral immunity is the use of immunostimulatory molecules, such as cytokines or T cell co-stimulators. The systemic administration of immunotherapeutics leads to significant immune-related adverse events (irAEs), therefore, the localized antitumoral action is needed. One way to achieve this is intratumoral non-viral gene-immune therapy, which allows for prolonged and localized gene expression, and multiple drug administration. In this study, we combined the previously described non-viral gene delivery system, PEG-PEI-TAT copolymer, PPT, with murine OX40L-encoding plasmid DNA.The resulting OX40L/PPT nanoparticles were characterized via gel mobility assay, dynamic light scattering analysis and in vitro transfection efficiency evaluation. The antitumoral efficacy of intratumorally (i.t.) administered nanoparticles was estimated using subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted CT26 (colon cancer), B16F0 (melanoma) and 4T1 (breast cancer) tumor models. The dynamics of stromal immune cell populations was analyzed using flow cytometry. Weight loss and cachexia were used as irAE indicators. The effect of combination of i.t. OX40L/PPT with intraperitoneal PD-1 ICB was estimated in s.c. CT26 tumor model.The obtained OX40L/PPT nanoparticles had properties applicable for cell transfection and provided OX40L protein expression in vitro in all three investigated cancer models. We observed that OX40L/PPT treatment successfully inhibited tumor growth in B16F0 and CT26 tumor models and showed a tendency to inhibit 4T1 tumor growth. In B16F0 tumor model, OX40L/PPT treatment led to the increase in antitumoral effector NK and T killer cells and to the decrease in pro-tumoral myeloid cells populations within tumor stroma. No irAE signs were observed in all 3 tumor models, which indicates good treatment tolerability in mice. Combining OX40L/PPT with PD-1 ICB significantly improved treatment efficacy in the CT26 subcutaneous colon cancer model, providing protective immunity against CT26 colon cancer cells.Overall, the anti-tumor efficacy observed with OX40L non-viral gene therapy, whether administered alone or in combination with ICB, highlights its potential to revolutionize cancer gene therapy, thus paving the way for unprecedented advancements in the cancer therapy field.">

        <tr id="2553 Background: Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising approach that uses viruses to target and destroy cancer cells while activating an anti-tumor immune response. However, a major challenge is the rapid elimination of oncolytic viruses (OVs) by the patient’s immune system. Calidi’s innovative platform addresses this issue by combining allogeneic stem cells with an OV payload, preventing immune system elimination, and promoting viral amplification at tumor sites. This induces immunogenic cell death and stimulates potent anti-tumor immune responses, effectively targeting primary and metastatic tumors. Prior clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of autologous stem cells loaded with Vaccinia virus CAL1 (ACAM2000) in multiple tumor types, especially when combined with checkpoint inhibitors. However, this approach is costly, lacks scalability and reproducibility. To overcome those limitations, we developed CLD-201 (or SuperNova-1), an innovative concept based on CAL1-loaded allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells, specifically designed for intratumoral administration. This study presents selected non-clinical studies performed to support the upcoming clinical trial to treat multiple solid tumors. Methods: We tested the tumor selectivity and efficacy of CLD-201 in Melanoma, Triple Negative Breast Cancer, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. We also assessed its ability to kill cancer cells in the presence of complement and neutralizing antibodies. Immune cell infiltration in treated and untreated tumors was analyzed using flow cytometry. We conducted dose escalation, safety, toxicology, and biodistribution studies of CLD-201 in multiple immune-compromised and immunocompetent mouse models. Results: Vaccinia virus CAL1 showed preferential amplification in tumor cells and, when loaded into adipose stem cells (CLD-201), demonstrated greater resistance to inactivation by the humoral immune system compared to the unprotected CAL1 virus. CLD-201 significantly inhibited the growth of tumors even at a very low dose of 1.5x103 cells containing 1.6x104viral plaque-forming units (PFU). Massive CD4 and CD8 T-cell infiltrations were detected in both treated and untreated tumors. CLD-201’s safety profile is studied in both GLP and non-GLP toxicology/ biodistribution nonclinical studies. Conclusions: CLD-201 offers several important advantages over the autologous approach, including enhanced potency through significant viral amplification within the stem cells, improved manufacturing reproducibility, off-the-shelf ability to treat multiple cancer types, and significantly lower cost. Non-clinical studies revealed that both intratumoral and systemic administration were well-tolerated. A phase I non-randomized clinical trial has been designed to evaluate the safety and initial anti-tumor effects of intratumoral administration of CLD-201.">

        <tr id="7520 Background: There are 2 CAR-T products and 3 bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) that are FDA-approved for patients (pts) with relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Clinical trials experience to date suggests that clinical response of BsAb is less impacted after CAR-T therapy. We examined the outcome of pts who received BsAb in standard-of-care (SOC) practice at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Methods: Retrospective analysis of MM patients who received FDA-approved BsAb at Mayo Clinic, Rochester between 12/2022- 1/2024. IMWG criteria was used for clinical response. Results: Sixty-two patients received BsAbs: 77% (48/62) received teclistamab, and 23% (14/62) received talquetamab. Median age was 62 years (range: 33-81), 60% (37/62) were males, and 45% (28/62) received prior CAR-T. Patients who had prior CAR-T therapy had more prior lines of therapy compared to those who did not. Overall, ORR to teclistamab was 61%, which is comparable to previous studies and other real-world reports. ORR and ≥CR rates were comparable between patients with and without prior CAR-T (Table). Of the 28 pts who received CAR-T before BsAbs, 61% (17/28) received idecabtagene vicleucel, 10% (3/28) were ciltacabtagene autoleucel, and 29% (8/28) on clinical trial. We then compared outcome of BsAb between pts who had relapsed from CAR-T within 1 year (n=21, median PFS: 8.84 months (range, 1.12, 10.84)) or after 1 year (n=7, median PFS: 16.62 months (range, 13.30, 36.20)). At the time of BsAb infusion, pts with who relapsed < 1 year vs ≥1 year post CAR-T had comparable blood counts, ALC, M-protein and involved FLC levels, CRP, ferritin and LDH. BsAb CR/sCR rate was significantly higher in pts with disease relapse ≥1 year compared to <1 year post CAR-T (57% vs 14%, p=0.02). Conclusions: Irrespective of prior CAR-T exposure, BsAb have clinical activity in SOC practice in pts with MM. Our preliminary data suggest that responses to BsAbs are better in pts with late compared to early relapse post CAR-T. Longer follow-up is needed to understand the duration of response. Larger, multi-center studies with longer follow-up will help identify factors that impact BsAb response post CAR-T.[Table: see text]">

        <tr id="8090 Background: Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 3 (DLL3) is highly expressed on the cell surface of neuroendocrine carcinomas, which have few approved treatment options in the refractory, metastatic setting. HPN328 is DLL3-targeting T-cell engager. HPN328 has 3 binding domains including anti-DLL3 for target engagement, anti-albumin for half-life extension, and anti-CD3 for T cell engagement and activation. Methods: Pts with relapsed/refractory, metastatic SCLC, neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and other NEC associated with DLL3 expression are eligible. Primary objectives are safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK). Secondary objectives are immunogenicity and efficacy. Overall response rate (ORR) is determined using modified RECIST v1.1 to include extracranial response assessment for pts treated with radiotherapy for brain metastases while on treatment. HPN328 is administered IV QW or Q2W with priming dose preceding target dose in higher dose cohorts. Results: As of January 5, 2024, 86 pts received HPN328 doses of 0.015-24 mg across 14 cohorts (SCLC [n = 54;63%]; other NEC [n = 32;37%]). The median (range) number of prior regimens was 3 (1-7); 83% previously received a PD-1/PD-L1 blocker. Treatment is ongoing in 24 of 46 (52%) pts in the dose optimization cohorts (1 mg priming dose with 12 or 24 mg target doses QW or Q2W). Treatment-related AEs in ≥ 10% of pts included CRS (59% [30% G1, 26% G2, 3% G3+]), dysgeusia (36%), fatigue (34%), diarrhea (19%), nausea (17%), vomiting (14%), decreased appetite and decreased neutrophil count (13% each), and weight decreased (11%). No G3-4 CRS was seen at target doses. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) occurred in 9% of pts, all G1-2. The maximum tolerated priming dose was 1 mg; dose escalation of target dose continued up to 24 mg QW without reaching a maximum tolerated target dose. Among efficacy evaluable pts treated in dose optimization cohorts, the confirmed ORR in SCLC was 50% (12/24), with one complete response (CR). In NEC (other than NEPC) the confirmed ORR was 44% (4/9), with one CR. Four of eleven pts with NEPC had unconfirmed PRs in 1 mg priming dose cohorts, with 5 NEPC pts remaining on treatment > 20 weeks. HPN328 exhibited linear PK with dose-proportional increases in exposure and a median T1/2 of 71 hrs. Transient increases in cytokines up to 24 hrs post-dose and T-cell activation were observed. Conclusions: HPN328 is well tolerated and clinically active in SCLC, NEC, and NEPC. Current dose optimization cohorts have completed enrollment and data continue to mature; selection of a recommended phase 2 dose will be made based upon complete mature data. Updated safety and efficacy results will be presented. Clinical trial information: NCT04471727 .">

Gamma delta T cells, a unique subset of lymphocytes with inherent tumor recognition capabilities and versatile immune functions, have garnered increasing attention in recent years. In this review, we will present how arming Vδ2-T cells might be the basis for next-generation immunotherapies against solid tumors.

        <tr id="The current treatment for neuroblastoma involves an immunotherapy regimen that includes a monoclonal antibody that recognizes disialoganglioside (GD2), expressed at high levels on neuroblastoma. GD2 is not present on most normal tissues but is expressed on nerves. Thus, anti-GD2 treatment causes substantial, dose-limiting, neuropathic pain. B7-H3 is overexpressed on multiple tumor types, including neuroblastoma, with minimal normal cell expression and is absent on nerves. We designed a bispecific antibody (bsAb) that requires simultaneous binding of these two tumor antigens to achieve tight-binding of tumor cells. Our preclinical research shows that when compared to an anti-GD2 monospecific antibody, the GD2xB7-H3 bsAb has improved tumor specificity with similar efficacy and reduced toxicity. Since this bsAb does not bind to nerves, it may be possible to administer increased or additional doses beyond the tolerable dose of monospecific anti-GD2 antibodies, which could improve therapeutic efficacy and quality of life for patients with neuroblastoma.">

        <tr id="Introduction Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas with unacceptably low cure rates occurring often in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 defects. To investigate oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (oHSV) as an immunotherapeutic approach, we compared viral replication, functional activity, and immune response between unarmed and interleukin 12 (IL-12)-armed oncolytic viruses in virus-permissive (B109) and -resistant (67C-4) murine MPNSTs. Methods This study compared two attenuated IL-12-oHSVs with γ134.5 gene deletions (Δγ134.5) and the same transgene expression cassette. The primary difference in the IL-12-oHSVs was in their ability to counter the translational arrest response in infected cells. Unlike M002 (Δγ134.5, mIL-12), C002 (Δγ134.5, mIL-12, IRS1) expresses an HCMV IRS1 gene and evades dsRNA activated translational arrest in infected cells. Results and discussion Our results show that oHSV replication and gene expression results in vitro were not predictive of oHSV direct oncolytic activity in vivo. Tumors that supported viral replication in cell culture studies resisted viral replication by both oHSVs and restricted M002 transgene expression in vivo. Furthermore, two IL-12-oHSVs with equivalent transcriptional activity differed in IL-12 protein production in vivo, and the differences in IL-12 protein levels were reflected in immune infiltrate activity changes as well as tumor growth suppression differences between the IL-12-oHSVs. C002-treated tumors exhibited sustained IL-12 production with improved dendritic cells, monocyte-macrophage activity (MHCII, CD80/CD86 upregulation) and a polyfunctional Th1-cell response in the tumor infiltrates. Conclusion These results suggest that transgene protein production differences between oHSVs in vivo, in addition to replication differences, can impact OV-therapeutic activity.">

        <tr id="The spread of cancer from organ to organ (metastasis) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however, most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread. It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner, and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors (IL-6R and IL-8R) with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects. However, while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential, elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 BsAb, exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antibody-receptor) complexes. Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.">

        <tr id="Multiple chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies are FDA approved, and several are under development. While effective for some cancers, toxicities remain a limitation. The most common toxicities, i.e. cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), are well described. With increasing utilization, providers worldwide are reporting on other emergent, and often complicated toxicities. Given the evolving toxicity profiles and urgent need to catalogue these emerging and emergent CAR T toxicities and describe management approaches, the American Society of Hematology Subcommittee on Emerging Gene and Cell Therapies organized the first Scientific Workshop on CAR T cell toxicities during the annual society meeting. The workshop functioned to 1) aggregate reports of CAR T emergent toxicities, including movement disorders after BCMA CAR T, coagulation abnormalities, and prolonged cytopenias; 2) disseminate bedside to bench efforts elucidating pathophysiological mechanisms of CAR-T toxicities, including the intestinal microbiota and systemic immune dysregulation; and 3) highlight gaps in the availability of clinical tests such as cytokine measurements, which could be utilized to expand our knowledge around the monitoring of toxicities. Key themes emerged. First, while clinical manifestations may develop before the pathophysiologic mechanisms are understood, these must be studied to aid in the detection and prevention of such toxicities. Second, systemic immune dysregulation appears central to these emergent toxicities and research is needed to elucidate links between tumor, CAR T, and microbiota. Finally, there was consensus around an urgency to create a repository to capture emergent CAR-T toxicities and the real-world management.">

        <tr id="2574 Background: While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies, they are less effective in treating solid tumors, which is in part due to the poor persistence and decreased survival of these cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling axis has emerged as a promising target to remodel the TME to make it more immune favorable, and work from our group previously demonstrated that STING agonists could improve the persistence and antitumor activity of CAR T cells in an immunocompetent murine breast tumor model. Yet, the T cell intrinsic effect of STING activation is thought to decrease T cell proliferation and lead to T cell death. Thus, we sought to better understand the impact of activating STING in different T cell subsets to be able to more effectively target STING as an adjunct to cellular therapies. Methods: Primary T cell cultures generated from murine splenocytes and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were polarized in vitro towards either a Th/Tc1 or Th/Tc17 lineage and treated with the mammalian STING agonist 2’3’-cGAMP. Cells were subsequently characterized by immunophenotyping, bioenergetic analysis, and RNA sequencing. Adoptive cell transfer experiments in a murine melanoma model and an immunocompetent murine breast cancer model utilizing an anti-Neu CAR T cell were employed to determine the differential impact of STING agonism on T cell subsets in vivo. Results: While treatment of Th/Tc1 cells with cGAMP led to impaired proliferation and T cell death, Th/Tc17 cells were immune to this effect. Instead, cGAMP triggered activation of a non-canonical STING pathway in Th/Tc17 cells resulting in metabolic reprogramming in favor of fatty acid oxidation over glycolysis. Th/Tc17 cells treated with cGAMP assumed more of a stem like memory T cell phenotype and displayed a more favorable bioenergetic profile with improved mitochondrial health and decreased reactive oxygen species production. Adoptive transfer of cGAMP conditioned Th/Tc17 memory like cells enhanced tumor control in an aggressive murine melanoma model, which was secondary to improved persistence of T cells in the TME. Further, while intratumoral delivery of STING agonists augmented the antitumor activity of Th/Tc17 cells, the function of Th/Tc1 cells was impeded by activating STING. Conclusions: STING activation in T cells leads to differential responses within T cell subsets as Th/Tc17 cells uniquely shift to a more fit T cell with improved antitumor properties. As cGAMP is found in the tumor microenvironment and can be secreted by tumor cells, CAR T cells with a greater Th/Tc17 footprint may be able to better subsist in the TME. Our findings also provide insight into how to engineer cellular therapies to take advantage of this non-canonical pathway to optimize the integration of STING based therapeutics into patient treatments.">

        <tr id="Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the standard of care for chemotherapy-refractory leukemia patients, but cure rates are still dismal. To prevent leukemia relapse following HSCT, we aim to improve the early graft-versus-leukemia effect mediated by natural killer (NK) cells. Our approach is based on the adoptive transfer of Therapeutic Inducers of Natural Killer cell Killing (ThINKK). ThINKK are expanded and differentiated from HSC, and exhibit blood plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) features. We previously demonstrated that ThINKK stimulate NK cells and control acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) development in a preclinical mouse model of HSCT for ALL. Here, we assessed the cellular identity of ThINKK and investigated their potential to activate allogeneic T cells. We finally evaluated the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on ThINKK-NK cell interaction. Methods ThINKK cellular identity was explored using single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry. Their T-cell activating potential was investigated by coculture of allogeneic T cells and antigen-presenting cells in the presence or the absence of ThINKK. A preclinical human-to-mouse xenograft model was used to evaluate the impact of ThINKK injections on graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Finally, the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on ThINKK-induced NK cell cytotoxicity against ALL cells was tested. Results The large majority of ThINKK shared the key characteristics of canonical blood pDC, including potent type-I interferon (IFN) production following Toll-like receptor stimulation. A minor subset expressed some, although not all, markers of other dendritic cell populations. Importantly, while ThINKK were not killed by allogeneic T or NK cells, they did not increase T cell proliferation induced by antigen-presenting cells nor worsened GvHD in vivo. Finally, tacrolimus, sirolimus or mycophenolate did not decrease ThINKK-induced NK cell activation and cytotoxicity. Conclusion Our results indicate that ThINKK are type I IFN producing cells with low T cell activation capacity. Therefore, ThINKK adoptive immunotherapy is not expected to increase the risk of GvHD after allogeneic HSCT. Furthermore, our data predict that the use of tacrolimus, sirolimus or mycophenolate as anti-GvHD prophylaxis regimen will not decrease ThINKK therapeutic efficacy. Collectively, these preclinical data support the testing of ThINKK immunotherapy in a phase I clinical trial.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy has the potential to increase antitumor immunity by modifying cells in-vitro to expand lymphocytes that recognize and attack the tumor. The functional capacity and survival of the cells transferred to the patient heavily depends on the memory subpopulations that are being expanded in the laboratory, hence, obtaining early memory cells is desirable. The main objective of our work was to determine a strategy for in-vitro expansion of human stem cell-like memory T CD4 lymphocytes. Starting from naive cells, stimulated with a polyclonal agent supplemented with different combinations of cytokines from the common gamma family, we found that the combination of IL-7, IL-15 and IL-21 or IL-7 and IL-21 were the cocktails that produced a greater number of cells with a stem memory phenotype, measured by flow cytometry. Additionally, through the measurement of membrane proteins and in-silico analysis, a close relationship between stem cell-like memory and the follicular helper T cells differentiation program was established, which we believe contributes to a better understanding of the processes that underlie the generation and maintenance of memory and, therefore, may improve current strategies of expansion of T cells for immunotherapy purposes.">

        <tr id="e19011 Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy can induce durable remission in some patients but requires time for a patient’s own cells to be reengineered to produce CAR proteins that can bind to and destroy cancer cells. During this time, bridging therapy is often used in debulking to reduce treatment toxicities and to control the disease while waiting for the manufacturing of CAR-T cells. Because bridging therapy often involves systemic treatment, the bridging therapies can induce responses, in and of themselves, in clinical trials testing CAR-T therapies. As such, we sought to assess bridging therapies used in CAR-T trials. Methods: Using the FDA labels (labels.fda.gov) to identify the indications and the pivotal clinical trials that led to the approval of each CAR-T cell therapy, we looked at which bridging therapies were used, whether multiple therapies were combined, response rates, and the reported adverse events associated with bridging therapy. We took note of all relevant comments regarding bridging therapy in the main paper and supplemental results. Results: Of the 11 studies testing CAR-T therapies, 10 reported the bridging therapies that were used in the study. Notably, only three of 11 studies provided clear information about which combinations of bridging therapy treatments were used during the trials. Of those that reported the types of bridging therapies (n=10), the most commonly used bridging therapy was dexamethasone, which was used in every study (10/10). The next three most commonly used treatments include rituximab (6/10), gemcitabine (5/10), and etoposide (5/10). Of the trials, 2/11 clearly reported whether patients had a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or very good partial response (VGPR) to bridging therapy. 5/11 vaguely reported responses, using terminology outside of CR, PR, VGPR. 4/11 trials did not report or mention any response information in regards to bridging therapy. Of all the trials, 1/11 clearly reported adverse events associated with bridging therapy in the supplement, while 10/11 of the trials listed adverse events associated with the treatment groups, without clarifying those associated with bridging. Conclusions: Although patients are often refractory to first-line therapies, which share considerable overlap with the bridging therapies used, these therapies may still induce responses. Despite this possibility, the reporting of bridging therapy combinations and their subsequent response rates and adverse event rates, is highly variable. Of 11 pivotal clinical trials that led to the approval of a CAR-T cell therapy, none clearly reported bridging therapy data that encompassed all three categories (combinations used, response rates, adverse events). What is more, these data were often omitted completely. These findings highlight the need for greater transparency in the reporting of bridging therapy in order to more reliably assess the efficacy of CAR-T therapies.">

        <tr id="Cancers only develop if they escape immunosurveillance, and the success of cancer immunotherapies relies in most cases on their ability to restore effector T-cell functions, particularly IFN-γ production. Revolutionizing the treatment of many cancers, immunotherapies targeting immune checkpoints such as PD1 can increase survival and cure patients. Unfortunately, although immunotherapy has greatly improved the prognosis of patients, not all respond to anti-PD1 immunotherapy, making it crucial to identify alternative treatments that could be combined with current immunotherapies to improve their effectiveness. Here, we show that iron supplementation significantly boosts T-cell responses in vivo and in vitro. This boost is associated with a metabolic reprogramming of T cells in favor of lipid oxidation. We also found that the "adjuvant" effect of iron led to a marked slowdown of tumor-cell growth after tumor-cell line transplantation in mice. Specifically, our results suggest that iron supplementation promotes anti-tumor responses by increasing IFN-γ production by T cells. In addition, iron supplementation considerably improves the efficacy of anti-PD1 cancer immunotherapy in mice. Finally, our study suggests that, in cancer patients, the quality and efficacy of the anti-tumor response following anti-PD1 immunotherapy may be modulated by plasma ferritin levels. In summary, our results suggest the benefits of iron supplementation on the reactivation of anti-tumor responses and support the relevance of a fruitful association between immunotherapy and iron supplementation.">

        <tr id="Abstract BACKGROUND Immunotherapy is a developing but challenging field of research for the treatment of central nervous system malignancies. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has been effective in treating hematologic malignancies, but that success has not been clinically translated to solid tumors in children. B7-H3 has been identified as a promising immunotherapy target as it is highly expressed in pediatric glioblastoma and correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis. We aim to evaluate a nanobody-based CAR-T cell therapy that binds B7-H3 with high affinity and hypothesize that anti-B7-H3 nanobody CAR-T cells can effectively kill B7-H3-expressing tumor cells. METHODS B7-H3 nanobodies were isolated from camel phage libraries and cloned into lentiviral CAR-T cell constructs. Human T cells were transduced by lentivirus to express CAR on the surface. Nanobody CAR-T cell functionality was evaluated by an impedance-based cytotoxicity assay and cytokine release was measured by ELISA. CAR-T avidity was quantified by the Lumicks z-Movi assay. In vivo studies are evaluating the efficacy of B7-H3 CAR-T cells in an orthotopic glioblastoma model in immunodeficient mice. Mice were treated with B7-H3 CAR-T cells by intracerebroventricular or intravenous delivery. RESULTS We confirmed high expression of B7-H3 on the surface of three pediatric glioblastoma cell lines by flow cytometry and Quantibrite staining. We confirmed effective killing of B7-H3-expressing tumor cells and the release of high levels of cytokines. B7-H3 nanobody CAR-T cells were observed to have high avidity compared to control CAR-T cells. In vivo studies are currently ongoing and treatment response will be evaluated by luminescence imaging and endpoint histologic analysis. CONCLUSION We have shown that B7-H3 nanobody CAR-T cells demonstrate significant preclinical efficacy. It is critical to study CAR-T cell therapy in immunocompetent in vivo models for further development and clinical application.">

BV has been shown to be safe and effective in treating Hodgkin's lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. This multicenter, prospective, single-arm phase I/II study evaluated the efficacy of BV in Japanese patients with CD30+ cutaneous lymphomas, namely CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Participants were divided into two groups: those with CD30+ MF or pcALCL (cohort 1, n = 13) and those with CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders other than those in cohort 1 (cohort 2, n = 3). The studied population included the full analysis set (FAS), modified FAS (mFAS), and safety analysis set (SAF). These sets were identified in cohorts 1 and 1 + 2 and labeled FAS1 and FAS2, mFAS1 and mFAS2, and SAF1 and SAF2, respectively. Each treatment cycle lasted 3 weeks, and BV was continued for up to 16 cycles after the third cycle based on treatment response. The primary endpoint was the 4-month objective response rate (ORR4) determined by the Independent Review Forum (IRF). ORR4 was 69.2% for FAS1 and 62.5% for FAS2 (P < 0.0001). Secondary endpoints of ORR, assessed using the global response score (53.8% in FAS1) and modified severity-weighted assessment tool (62.5% in FAS1), using the IRF, provided results comparable to the primary findings. The incidence of ≥grade 3 adverse events (≥15%) in SAF1 was peripheral neuropathy in three patients (23%) and fever and eosinophilia in two patients (15%). In conclusion, BV showed favorable efficacy, tolerability, and safety profile in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The trial was registered with University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry, Japan (protocol ID: UMIN000034205).">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered a prototypic autoimmune disease of the CNS. It is the leading cause of chronic neurologic disability in young adults. Proinflammatory B cells and autoreactive T cells both play important roles in its pathogenesis. We aimed to study alterations of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which likely also contribute to the disease, but their involvement is less clear. Methods By combining multiple experimental approaches, we examined the Treg compartments in 41 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 17 healthy donors. Results Patients with MS showed a reduced frequency of CD4+ T cells and Foxp3+ Tregs and age-dependent alterations of Treg subsets. Treg suppressive function was compromised in patients, who were treated with natalizumab, while it was unaffected in untreated and anti-CD20–treated patients. The changes in natalizumab-treated patients included increased proinflammatory cytokines and an altered transcriptome in thymus-derived (t)-Tregs, but not in peripheral (p)-Tregs. Discussion Treg dysfunction in patients with MS might be related to an altered transcriptome of t-Tregs and a proinflammatory environment. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Tregs and their subtypes in MS.">

        <tr id="2593 Background: PD-1 blockade has demonstrated positive anti-tumor activity across multiple tumor types. While the anti-tumoral response can be substantial and even curative, response rates remain low in many cancer types. Long-lasting responses are only observed in a minority of patients, and additional immunotherapeutic alternatives remain limited for patients who fail to respond or initially respond but subsequently experience progression. Combining anti-PD-1 with other immunotherapies may improve the durability and depth of anti-tumoral immune responses. Non-clinical data suggest anti-PD-1 interactions with macrophage Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) compromise therapeutic activity by several mechanisms including the rapid removal of anti-PD-1 from its target on CD8+ T-cells and phagocytosis of anti-PD-1 coated CD8+ T cells. Accordingly, we and others have shown that blockade of Fc/FcγR interactions with immunocompetent antibodies to the inhibitory FcγRIIB, a receptor highly upregulated in the tumor microenvironment, overcomes these resistance mechanisms and enhances anti-PD-1 efficacy in vitro and in vivo. BI-1206 is a fully human IgG1 targeting CD32b (FcγRIIB). Methods: This is a Ph1/2a trial in patients with advanced solid tumors who received previous lines of treatment with anti-PD 1/PD-L1 agents to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK/PD of BI-1206 at ascending IV and SC doses after coadministration with pembrolizumab Q3W using a mTPI-2 design. Results: Dose escalation with BI-1206 IV has been completed with no formal MTD defined. The most frequent related adverse events were infusion-related reactions, thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. All were transient without any clinical consequences, and adequate pre-medication with corticosteroids or split dose administration reduced the risk and/or intensity of these events. Out of 15 evaluable patients, 5 patients showed SD, including one lasting >24 months in a metastatic melanoma patient. Furthermore, long-lasting PR (>24 months) was observed in a uveal melanoma patient, and CR was observed in a metastatic melanoma patient who previously received three prior anti-PD-1 containing treatments (one including anti-CTLA4). Enrollment to BI-1206 SC dose escalation began Nov2023. Dose level and administration route to be further explored in Phase 2a will be determined after an integrated review of PK, PD and safety. The Ph2a consists of 3 expansion cohorts at the RP2D, each comprising a specific subset of subjects with advanced solid tumors (e.g., NSCLC, MM, and other tumors responsive to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition). More than one dose level may be evaluated if warranted. Conclusions: Coadministration of BI-1206 with pembrolizumab was well tolerated in a heavily pretreated population, with promising hints of responses to be further explored in Ph2.

        <tr id="Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCL) have a poor prognosis with current treatments. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (AHCT) is used as a consolidation strategy after achieving clinical remission with first-line therapy, as well as in chemosensitive relapse if allogeneic transplant is not an option. CD25 is a targetable protein often highly expressed in PTCL. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we tested the addition of beta-emitting 90Y-labeled chimeric anti-CD25 basiliximab (aTac) to BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) as conditioning for AHCT in patients with PTCL. Twenty-three AHCT-eligible patients were enrolled, and 20 received therapeutic 90Y-aTac-BEAM AHCT. Radiation doses of 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 mCi/kg were tested. With no observed dose-limiting toxicities, 0.6 mCi/kg was deemed the recommended phase 2 dose. The most prevalent adverse effect, grade 2 mucositis, was experienced by 80% of patients. As of this report, 6 (30%) of the treated patients had died, 5 due to progressive disease and 1 due to multiple organ failure [median time of death 17 mo (range: 9-21 mo)] post-AHCT. Median follow-up was 24 mo (range: 9-26 mo) overall and 24 mo (range: 13-26 mo) for surviving patients. For patients who received therapeutic 90Y-aTac-BEAM AHCT, the 2-year progression-free and overall survival were 59% (95% CI: 34-77%) and 68% (95% CI: 42-84%), respectively. 90Y-aTac-BEAM appears to be safe as an AHCT conditioning regimen for PTCL, with no increased toxicity over the toxicities historically seen with BEAM alone in this patient population. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as # NCT02342782.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in cancer treatment. Still, most patients receiving CAR T cells relapse within 5 years of treatment. CAR-mediated trogocytosis (CMT) is a potential tumor escape mechanism in which cell surface proteins transfer from tumor cells to CAR T cells. CMT results in the emergence of antigen-negative tumor cells, which can evade future CAR detection, and antigen-positive CAR T cells, which is hypothesized to lead to CAR T cell fratricide and dysfunction. Using a system to selectively degrade trogocytosed antigen in CAR T cells, we show that the presence of trogocytosed antigen in CAR T cells directly causes CAR T cell fratricide and exhaustion. By performing a small molecule screening using a custom high throughput CMT-screening assay, we identified the cysteine protease cathepsin B (CTSB) as a key driver of CMT. We show that overexpression of cystatin A (CSTA), an endogenous human inhibitor of CTSB, reduces trogocytosis resulting in prolonged antitumor activity and increased CAR T cell expansion/persistence. Overall, we show that targeting CMT is an effective approach to enhance CAR T cell function, which may improve their clinical efficacy. One sentence summary CAR-mediated trogocytosis directly causes CAR T cell exhaustion and fratricide but can be prevented by inhibiting the cysteine protease cathepsin B through overexpression of human cystatins.">

        <tr id="Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Significant unmet need remains for patients with relapsed/refractory FL after ≥3 lines of prior therapy. While recent advancements have likely improved the survival of patients with FL, most patients will eventually relapse. The treatment of patients with FL after multiple relapses or those with refractory disease has historically led to lower overall response rates (ORR) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) with each subsequent line of therapy. New treatments with high ORR and durable PFS are needed in this setting, particularly in patients that progress within 2 years of first line chemoimmunotherapy (POD24) and/or those refractory chemoimmunotherapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies targeting the B-cell antigen CD-19 have shown to be an efficacious treatment option for both heavily pretreated patients and/or patients with refractory FL, resulting in a high ORR and durable remissions.">

        <tr id="Background Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies have achieved remarkable success in the treatment of hematological tumors. However, given the distinct features of solid tumors, particularly heterogeneity, metabolic aggressiveness, and fewer immune cells in tumor microenvironment (TME), the practical utility of CAR-T cells for solid tumors remains as a challenging issue. Meanwhile, although anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) has shown clinical efficacy, most mAbs also show limited clinical benefits for solid tumors due mainly to the issues associated with the lack of immune cells in TME. Thus, the infiltration of targeted immunological active cells into TME could generate synergistic efficacy for mAbs. Methods We present a combinational strategy for solid tumor treatment, which combines armored-T cells to express Fc-gamma receptor I (FcγRI) fragment on the surfaces for targeting various tumors with therapeutically useful mAbs. Choosing CD20 and HER-2 as the targets, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo efficacy and latent mechanism of the combination drug by using flow cytometry, ELISA and other methods. Results The combination and preprocessing of armored T-cells with corresponding antibody of Rituximab and Pertuzumab exerted profound anti-tumor effects, which is demonstrated to be mediated by synergistically produced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effects. Meanwhile, mAb was able to carry armored-T cell by preprocessing for the infiltration to TME in cell derived xenograft (CDX) model. Conclusions This combination strategy showed a significant increase of safety profiles from the reduction of antibody doses. More importantly, the present strategy could be a versatile tool for a broad spectrum of cancer treatment, with a simple pairing of engineered T cells and a conventional antibody.">

Background: This study aims to evaluate the oncolytic potential of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) against colon cancer and explore the immune response associated with its therapeutic effects. Methods: NDV was tested for its oncolytic potential in colon cancer cell lines using MTT assays and apoptosis assessments. Tumor-induced mice were treated with NDV, tumor cell lysate (TCL), or a combination of both. After the euthanasia of murine subjects, an assessment of oncolytic efficacy was performed through flow cytometry analysis of murine blood and tumor tissue, targeting CD83, CD86, CD8, and CD4. An ELISA was also performed to examine interferon-gamma levels, interleukin-4 levels, interleukin-12 levels, and interleukin-10 levels in serum and spleen homogenate. Results: Cell viability was low in HCT116 and HT-29, indicating a cytotoxic effect in the MTT assay. NDV+TCL recorded the highest rate of cell death (56.72%).

        <tr id="e19050 Background: Tafasitamab (tafa) is a CD19-targeting immunotherapy that induces enhanced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. Tafa received accelerated FDA approval in 2020 for treating relapsed or refractory DLBCL in combination with lenalidomide in patients ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, based on results from L-MIND, a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial. FirmMIND (NCT05429268) is an ongoing identical study, further evaluating efficacy and safety of tafa in this setting. Several other CD19 targeting agents are available; however, CD19 antigen loss following treatment with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy targeting CD19 (CART19) has raised concerns over CD19-targeted therapy sequencing. Loss of CD19 has not been observed to date in tafa clinical trials or practice. Methods: To evaluate CD19 expression at screening and after disease progression in firmMIND, we developed an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay using a mAb that binds to an intracellular epitope of CD19 clone LE-CD19. To validate that CD19 expression is detectable after tafa treatment, we treated cultured SU-DHL-4 or Jurkat cells with tafa at a saturating concentration for 24 hours. After washing out unbound tafa, cells were harvested at specific timepoints. Resulting cell line blocks were assessed for CD19 expression by IHC. We also monitored CD19 trafficking in response to fluorescently labeled tafa by confocal microscopy. Results: By IHC, CD19 expression was comparable between treatment conditions, suggesting the assay can effectively measure CD19 expression in lymphoma biopsy samples post-tafa. Confocal microscopy showed a fraction of tafa-bound CD19 internalized and colocalized with a CD19 intracellular pool labeled with anti-CD19 mAb clone EPR5906; this mAb also detected CD19 that remained localized on the cell surface. The data demonstrated that CD19 persists on tumor cells after tafa treatment at levels that could be bound by other CD19-targeting therapies. As of the January 25, 2024 data cutoff, we received 6 end-of-treatment (EOT) samples from patients in firmMIND. Biopsies were collected 14-26 days after the last tafa dose; 5 of 6 samples were biopsies from lymph nodes or liver and showed ≥80% of tumor cells staining CD19+ on membranes with 3+ intensity by IHC, except 1 that was collected only 6 days after last dose and showed 50% positivity. The sixth biopsy (extranodal subcutaneous lesion) showed no CD19 expression at baseline or EOT. Conclusions: Patient biopsy analysis and preclinical data suggest that following tafa treatment, CD19 antigen is preserved on the surface of tumor cells after short and transient internalization and could be targeted by other CD19 agents, such as CART therapy. This conclusion is supported by sequential treatment with tafa followed by CART in vivo (Sakemura, 2024). Analyses are ongoing to confirm these findings.">

        <tr id="7060 Background: IMM0306 is a fusion protein of CD20 monoclonal antibody with the CD47 binding domain of SIRPα on both heavy chains. It exerts excellent cancer killing efficacy by activating both macrophages and NK cells via blockade of CD47-SIRPα interaction and FcɣR engagement. Here, we report the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy results of phase I study in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). Methods: Eligible pts with R/R CD20-positive B-NHL were enrolled in this multicenter phase I study (NCT05805943). IMM0306 was administered as monotherapy at escalating doses of 0.04, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 mg/kg intravenously once a week until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated in the first 28 days. Safety was evaluated per CTCAE 5.0, PK and PD analysis were also assessed, tumor assessments performed once every 8 weeks by Lugano 2014 criteria. Results: As of Nov 21, 2023, 48 pts were enrolled. The median age was 56 years with 30 (62.5%) males. The median prior lines of therapy were 2. All pts received previous anti-CD20 therapy. No DLTs were observed. Recommended phase II dose was determined as 2.0 mg/kg. The most frequent treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were WBC decreased (66.7%), anemia (64.6%), lymphocyte decreased (58.3%), ANC decreased (47.9%), PLT decreased (45.8%), infusion-related reactions (35.4%). ≥grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 33 (68.8%) pts, with the most common being lymphocyte decreased (56.3%), WBC decreased (18.8%), ANC decreased (18.8%). 8 (16.7%) pts experienced treatment related serious adverse event. Discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 1 pt (grade 4 PLT decreased at 1.6mg/kg without bleeding). No AE led to death. IMM0306 exhibited approximate dose-proportional increase in PK exposure from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg and no obvious accumulation was observed after repeated dosing. At 1.2 mg/kg and higher dose, CD47 receptor occupancy on peripheral lymphocytes was saturated, suggesting IMM0306 is well tolerated from perspective of CD47 engagement. B-cell depleted rapidly at doses ≥ 0.8 mg/kg. Elevated cytokines levels were observed after first dosing of IMM0306, but multiple dosing did not stimulate further cytokine activation. Among 33 pts who received doses ≥ 0.8 mg/kg, 5 CR (4 follicular lymphoma [FL], 1 marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]), 5 PR (3 FL, 1 MZL, 1 diffuse large B cell lymphoma) and 11 SD were seen; the median PFS was 10.58 months (95% CI, 2.2, NA) and the median OS was not reached. Among 17 FL pts, 7 (41%) responded including 4 CR and 3 PR; among 6 MZL pts, 2 (33.3%) responded including 1 CR and 1 PR. Conclusions: IMM0306 was well-tolerated and with promising preliminary anti-tumor activity especially in pts with R/R FL and MZL. The phase Ⅱ study is ongoing.

 Background: Relapsed/refractory (R/R) aggressive lymphomas, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma double-hit (HGBCL-DH), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), have poor outcomes with standard therapy. VIP152 (enitociclib) leads to rapid depletion of short-lived mRNA transcripts such as MYC and MCL1 through CDK9 inhibition. Preclinical studies have identified BCL2 overexpression as a mechanism of resistance to CDK9 inhibition, and synergistic cytotoxicity has been shown with venetoclax (BCL2 inhibitor), steroids, and CDK9 inhibitors in DLBCL. Based on this preclinical data, we hypothesized that the combination of VIP152 with venetoclax and prednisone (VVIP) would result in acceptable safety and improved efficacy in R/R lymphoid malignancies.
 Methods: R/R non-GCB DLBCL, MYC-rearranged DLBCL/HGBCL-DH, and PTCL pts after 2 prior systemic therapies are eligible. In phase I, pts are treated at 4 dose levels (DL) of VIP152 and venetoclax in combination with fixed-dose prednisone to identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). VIP152 (15mg, 22.5mg, or 30mg) is given IV on days 2 and 9 in combination with venetoclax (600mg or 800mg) PO and prednisone 100 mg PO on days 1-10 every 21 days. Phase II expansion cohorts are included at the RP2D. VVIP x 12 cycles is given for pts who achieve complete response (CR), with a max of 24 cycles for pts not in CR. TLS, G-CSF, and PCP prophylaxis are given to all pts. Baseline CT, PET, and BM are performed with CT after cycles 1 and 2 then every 2 cycles and PET after cycles 6 and 12. CT is then performed q3m x 1y, q4m x 1y, q6m x 1y, then q12m x 2y post-therapy.
 Results: As of March 26, 2024, 5 pts were enrolled (3 at DL1 and 2 at DL2), including 3 PTCL, 1 non-GCB DLBCL, and 1 HGBCL-DH. Median (range) age was 56 (55-77) yrs, with stage 3/4 disease in 100%, >/=2 extranodal sites in 100%, IPI >/=3 in 80%, and elevated LDH in 40%. Median (range) prior therapies were 3 (3-6), with prior ASCT, allo-HSCT, and CAR-T in 1 (20%) pt each, and 80% of pts refractory per SCHOLAR-1 criteria. All 5 pts completed the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) window with no DLTs observed. The most common adverse events (AEs) (% pts) included hypokalemia (100%), thrombocytopenia (80%), neutropenia (80%), and anemia (80%). Two (40%) pts had G3-4 neutropenia and 1 (20%) pt had G3 hypokalemia, with no other >/=G3 AEs observed. No dose reductions occurred and only 1 pt required a dose delay due to infection. Tumor reduction was observed in 80% (4/5) of pts, with an overall response rate of 60% (3/5). Partial responses include 1 HGBCL-DH pt refractory to both CAR-T and epcoritamab (71% tumor reduction) and 2 PTCL pts refractory to CHOP and targeted therapy (86% and 91% tumor reduction). Four pts have progressed, and no pts have died.
 Conclusions: Preliminary results show VVIP to be safe and well tolerated with no DLTs observed. Early activity is noted in pts with HGBCL-DH and PTCL. Enrollment continues to identify the RP2D and to further assess the safety and efficacy of VVIP in R/R aggressive lymphomas.

        <tr id="Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors improve antitumor responses The understanding of the immune system has increased considerably in the past 30 years, leading to the development of better therapies for cancer as well as immune-mediated disorders. These advances include unleashing T cell antitumor activity with monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis or jakinibs) that block cytokine signaling for autoimmune, atopic, and inflammatory pathologies (1, 2). On pages 1315 and 1314 of this issue, Zak et al. (3) and Mathew et al. (4), respectively, report that combining these therapeutic approaches results in improved clinical responses compared with immune checkpoint inhibition alone in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma as well as metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These are exciting advances, but at the same time the strategy might seem paradoxical. Why would jakinibs enhance immune-mediated elimination of cancer cells given that they limit lymphocyte activation and proliferation?">

These Tpex cells are notable for their remarkable self-renewal and rapid proliferation abilities. Recent strides in immunotherapy have demonstrated that Tpex cells expand and differentiate into responsive exhausted CD8+ T cells, thus underscoring their critical role in the immunotherapeutic retort. Clinical examinations have further clarified a robust positive correlation between the proportional abundance of Tpex cells and enhanced clinical prognosis. Tpex cells have found noteworthy applications in the formulation of inventive immunotherapeutic approaches against tumors. This review describes the functions of Tpex cells in the tumor milieu, particularly their potential utility in tumor immunotherapy. Precisely directing Tpex cells may be essential to achieving successful outcomes in immunotherapy against tumors.">

        <tr id="2557 Background: While the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized the field of tumor therapy. the resistance remains a major challenge. We have previously developed WTX-212, an erythrocyte-antibody conjugate covalently linking anti-PD-1 antibody to erythrocyte membranes. Unlike conventional antibodies, WTX-212 exhibits natural accumulation in the spleen and remodels the splenic immune landscape in tumor-bearing mice. WTX-212 treatment efficiently activates CD8+ T cells in the spleen, which subsequently infiltrate into tumors and exhibit anti-tumor cytotoxicity. Additionally, activated T cells reduce the splenic reservoir of Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and those within tumors, further enhancing overall anti-tumor responses. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that WTX-212 can significantly suppress tumor growth in xenograft tumor models resistant to anti-PD-1 immunotherapies. A first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial is now investigating its potential in human cancer patients. Methods: The FIH trial (NCT05707325) is aimed to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of WTX-212 in cancer patients with advanced malignancies. All of patients had previously received anti-PDs therapies and developed resistance to these treatments. By Feb 5th, 2024, the tumor lesions were assessed using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Blood and tumor samples were collected for correlative analysis. Results: 7 metastasized patients with various solid tumors, having undergone a median of 3.1 prior lines of therapy (ranging from 1-6), received WTX-212 monotherapy. None of patients treated with WTX-212 experienced treatment-related adverse events greater than Grade 3, indicating a high safety profile. WTX-212 was detectable in peripheral blood at the end of cycle in a dose dependent manner. Disease control was achieved in 5/7 patients (DCR=71%). Specifically, a patient with esophageal cancer, achieved a confirmed complete remission after 6-cycle treatment. Additionally, two patients, one with esophageal cancer (3L) and another with HPV-negative cervical cancer (4L), maintained stable disease for over 40 and 30 weeks, respectively. Consistent with our pre-clinical findings, a substantial reduction in MDSCs were observed in 6/7 patients (ranging from 24%-82%). Furthermore, a median 1.5-fold increase in T cells was noted in all patients in the peripheral blood after the 1st cycle of the treatment. Conclusions: WTX-212 treatment is safe and tolerable and shows promising clinical signs in cancer patients resistant to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, supporting further investigation and exploration of WTX-212 monotherapy and combination therapy.

        <tr id="TPS1137 Background: BriaCell (BC) human immortalized cell lines have been engineered to trigger robust immune responses and deliver efficacy through diverse mechanisms, including adaptive (involving T-cells) and innate responses (dendritic and NK cells). BC can match patients’ HLA antigens for optimal effectiveness. BC works by several mechanisms, including direct antigen presentation and activation of CD4+ T-cells. When combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, the BC regimen has demonstrated clinical benefit in 54 heavily treated MBCs. Most pts whose disease has progressed after checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy showed similar or improved PFS compared to the patient's last treatment regimen. Disease control after prior antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) has been observed in 40% of patients, and clinical benefit has been seen in 5/7 patients with untreated intracranial metastases. CD8+ Immuno PET shows an increase in CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes suggesting systemic activation and infiltration into lymphoid organs and metastatic sites. Sequencing of CPI with BC and the latest phase 3 formulation are associated with improved clinical outcomes, including OS (median 13.4 months), PFS, and CBR, which are reflected in the design of this ongoing pivotal registration enabling Phase 3 study [doi:10.1158/1538-7445.sabcs22-p3-07-12]. Methods: Multicenter randomized, open label Bria-IMT regimen (with SV-BR-1-GM cells) plus CPI vs Treatment of Physicians' Choice (TPC) in MBCs with no approved curative therapies available. ECOG <2 allowed with no limit on prior therapies. Eligibility encompasses all MBC subtypes including pts with CNS metastases. Prior immune therapy is allowed if administered more than 21 days before the first cycle of Bria-IMT; treatments within 21 days preclude participation. Initial randomization will be 1:1:1 to the Bria-IMT regimen + CPI (combination), TPC, and the Bria-IMT regimen alone (monotherapy). There will be 100 sites across the US, Canada, and ex-NA for 404 total evaluable pts. The Bria-IMT regimen includes: Day -2 Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2, Day 0 20 million irradiated SV-BR-1-GM cells intradermally, and 0.1mcg peg α interferon intra-dermally (Day 2 or 3) into each Bria-IMT inoculation site. After the first 150 pts have enrolled, the monotherapy arm will be discontinued. Bria regimen + CPI arms treatment cycles occur q3w. CPI infusion is given every cycle between Day –3 to Day 3 TPC cycle details will be according to the site's SOC. Imaging assessment will be q6w x2 then q8w. The primary endpoint is overall survival with an interim analysis at 144 events targeting a hazard ratio of 0.6. Key secondary endpoints will include PFS, ORR, CBR, CNS event free survival, and TWiST (time without symptoms or toxicities). Safety analysis will be ongoing. Patient-reported outcomes will be incorporated to assess subjective treatment effects. Clinical trial information: NCT06072612 .">

        <tr id="e14531 Background: The treatment for patients with T-ALL/LBL who relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are currently restricted. CD7 is highly expressed on the surface of T-ALL/LBL T cells and CAR-T cell therapy provides a promising avenue towards remission. However, CD7-targeting immunotherapies may be compromised by T-cell fratricide. Furthermore, in addition to the long production time, high cost, and high risk of production failure, the biggest challenges of autologous CAR-T cell therapy are how to isolate a sufficient number of healthy T cells from malignant T cells. Thus, allogeneic CAR-T cells can overcome these hurdles. Methods: A novel non-gene-editing allogeneic CAR-T platform was developed on the base of intracellular retention of membrane proteins, and named ThisCART (TCR and/or HLA-I intracellular sequestered). CD7-directed ThisCART cells are readily produced with a single lentiviral vector, encoding both a CD7-targeting CAR, an anti-CD7and anti-CD3 single chain antibody with the KDEL peptide fused to its C-termini. The surface expression of CAR, TCRαβ/CD3 and CD7 was measured by flow cytometer. Specific tumor cytotoxicity was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the safety of donor derived ThisCART cells were tested in a xenogeneic GvHD model. Results: The manufacturing platform of CD7 ThisCART was able to achieve over 130-folds of ex vivo CAR-T expansion in all batches, with the purity of products (CAR-positive/CD7-negative/TCRαβ-negative) above 99%. In preclinical models, CD7 ThisCART did not induce GvHD, and exhibited superior antitumor function compared to Control T. CD7 ThisCART cells were readily produced to a quantity and quality supporting clinical investigation. Conclusions: CD7 ThisCART cells based on intracellular retention of TCRαβ/CD3 complex and CD7 demonstrated superior CD7-dependent cytotoxicity and no xenogeneic GvHD in murine models. With streamlined single-vector-based production and potent cytotoxicity and favored preclinical safety profile, CD7 ThisCART warrant clinical investigation.">

        <tr id="The identification and targeting of B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) through immunotherapeutic strategies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR T-cells), and T-cell engagers (TCE) have revolutionized the care of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). These treatment modalities have improved survival outcomes of relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) MM patients compared to previously established strategies and are moving into earlier lines of therapy (LOT). Despite their efficacy, the majority of patients eventually relapse, necessitating additional therapeutic targets for salvage. G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D (GPRC5D), Fc receptor-homolog 5 (FcRH5), and SLAMF7 are some examples of novel targets in development. This expanding armamentarium of immunotherapeutic agents will be crucial to address the unmet need for relapses following BCMA-targeting therapies, particularly antigen-negative relapses. The utilization of sequential T-cell redirective therapies including agents targeting different tumor-associated antigens and combination therapies appears feasible paves the way for effective chemotherapy-free regimes. Deliberate consideration of treatment timing, preserving T-cell health, overcoming antigenic loss, and comprehension of the complex tumor microenvironment would be key to maximizing therapeutic benefits and minimizing adverse effects. This review summarizes novel targets in development for myeloma beyond BCMA, presenting pivotal safety and efficacy data derived from clinical trials where available and the considerations vital for navigating this expanding landscape of immunotherapeutic options.">

        <tr id="Despite recent advances, the prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unsatisfactory due to disease recurrence and the development of resistance to both conventional and novel therapies. Engineered T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their cellular surface represent one of the most promising anticancer agents. CAR-T cells are increasingly used in patients with B cell malignancies, with remarkable clinical results despite some immune-related toxicities. However, at present, the role of CAR-T cells in myeloid neoplasms, including AML, is extremely limited, as specific molecular targets for immune cells are generally lacking on AML blasts. Besides the paucity of dispensable targets, as myeloid antigens are often co-expressed on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with potentially intolerable myeloablation, the AML microenvironment is hostile to T cell proliferation due to inhibitory soluble factors. In addition, the rapidly progressive nature of the disease further complicates the use of CAR-T in AML. This review discusses the current state of CAR-T cell therapy in AML, including the still scanty clinical evidence and the potential approaches to overcome its limitations, including genetic modifications and combinatorial strategies, to make CAR-T cell therapy an effective option for AML patients.">

        <tr id="e19000 Background: B-cell-Activating Factor-Receptor (BAFF-R), predominantly expressed on the surface of the mature B cells, including malignant B cells, serves as an attractive therapeutic target for the diseases where CD19 or CD20-targeted therapies encounter challenges, such as loss of therapeutic targets or development of resistance. No BAFF-R targeting agent has been approved yet for clinical use to date. ESG206, a recombinant humanized anti-BAFF-R monoclonal antibody modified by glycoengineering for enhanced ADCC effects, is being developed as a treatment for relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies. Preclinical investigations have successfully validated the antitumor effects of ESG206 across a spectrum of malignant B cell disease models, including lymphoma xenografts which were resistant to Rituximab, and Ibrutinib. This report provides preliminary clinical safety, PK, PD, and efficacy results from an FIH study of ESG206 in patients with R/R B-cell malignancies. Methods: This Phase I, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study enrolled patients with R/R B-cell malignancies resistant to standard therapy. Dose escalation utilized accelerated titration (1 mg/kg) and Bayesian Optimal Interval design (3, 6, and 9 mg/kg). ESG206 was administered intravenously every 2 weeks, with a 4-week cycle, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. DLT was assessed in the first 28 days. Safety was evaluated per CTCAE 5.0. Tumor assessments every 8 weeks, and peripheral CD20-positive B cell counts as a PD marker were evaluated. Results: As of Jan 30th, 2024, data cut-off date, 6 pts (3 follicular lymphoma (FL), 3 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)) were enrolled, with a median age of 56 years, 83.3% female; median 2 prior lines of therapy (range 1-3). No DLTs were observed up to 6 mg/kg Q2W. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included anemia (n=2), decreased white blood cell count (n=1), hyperlipidemia (n=1, grade 2), elevated bilirubin (n=1), diarrhea (n=1), infusion reactions (n=1, grade 2), upper respiratory infections (n=1, grade 2), etc. No grade≥3 TRAEs occurred. Among 6 evaluable patients, 1 FL patient (3 mg/kg Q2W) and 1 DLBCL patient (3 mg/kg Q2W) achieved partial response. After 2 cycles of treatment, there was a 39.5% size reduction in the brain lesions of an FL patient who had intracranial metastases in baseline, suggesting that ESG206 may have a therapeutic effect on brain metastases. A significant decrease in the peripheral CD20+B cells was observed at both 1 and 3 mg/kg Q2W dose levels. ESG206 exposure increased with dose escalation across the 1–3 mg/kg dose range. Conclusions: Preliminary data indicates ESG206 is well-tolerated with promising efficacy signals in R/R B-cell malignancies. These encouraging results warrant continued clinical evaluation as the Phase I study progresses. Clinical trial information: NCT05263739 .">

 Multiple therapies with immune mechanisms of action such as CAR T-cells and bispecific antibodies are now approved for relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (rrLBCL). The efficacy of these therapies is likely influenced by lymphoma microenvironment (LME) characteristics, but these have not been directly characterized in a comprehensive fashion. We therefore performed single-nucleus multiome (RNA + ATAC), bulk RNA, and WES of 119 biopsies from 114 patients to capture both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types. After stringent quality control, 970,239 cells remained. Non-B-cell lineages were classified into 76 transcriptionally-distinct cell types using unsupervised clustering. LME archetypes were defined by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of non-B cell types. Associations with CAR T-cell outcomes were validated using published Nanostring data from the ZUMA7 clinical trial. NMF clustering identified 5 cellular modules: lymph-node 1 [LN1] and lymph-node 2 [LN2] that are characterized by lymph-node structural cell types, antigen presenting cells and naïve and memory T-cells; T-effector/exhausted [TEX] characterized by high frequencies of effector and exhausted CD8 T-cells; and fibroblast/macrophage 1 [FMAC1] and 2 [FMAC2] that were characterized by high frequencies of macrophage subsets and fibroblast subsets including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The pairs of LN1 and LN2 modules, and FMAC1 and FMAC2 modules, were correlated and therefore considered collectively in tumor archetype construction, resulting in three major archetypes: LN (33% of tumors), TEX (25% of tumors) and FMAC (42% of tumors). Among these biopsies, 17 were obtained immediately prior to, and 13 were subsequent to CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Although numbers were limited, these cases suggested that the LN archetype was associated with greater benefit from CAR T cell therapy. We therefore leveraged our bulk RNA-sequencing data plus published Nanostring data from the ZUMA7 study of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in second line rrLBCL to develop a Naïve Bayes classifier for these archetypes. Evaluation of response data from ZUMA7 showed that the greatest benefit for axi-cel compared to chemotherapy was observed within the LN subtype (HR=0.18; P<0.0001), compared to the FMAC (HR=0.4; P<0.0001) and TEX (HR=0.71; P=0.23), with median PFS in the axi-cel arm of 30.16, 4.94, and 4.53 months respectively. Furthermore, LN subtype patients had significantly better outcomes compared to FMAC and TEX subtype patients in the axi-cel arm (HR=0.5, P=0.006) but not in the chemotherapy arm (HR=1.3; P=0.23). Therefore, accurate construction of the rrLBCL LME using direct cell measurements of both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells with single-cell genomics permits the identification of cell types, cell modules, and LME archetypes with important implications for LBCL biology, and may present an opportunity for LME-guided selection of patients most likely to benefit from cellular therapy.

        <tr id="Cytokines are small proteins that modulate the activity of the immune system. Because of their potent immunomodulatory properties, some recombinant cytokines have undergone clinical development and have gained marketing authorization for the therapy of certain forms of cancer. Recombinant cytokines are typically administered at ultralow doses, as many of them can cause substantial toxicity even at submilligram quantities. In an attempt to increase the therapeutic index, fusion proteins based on tumor-homing antibodies (also called "immunocytokines") have been considered, and some products in this class have reached late-stage clinical trials. While antibody-cytokine fusions, which preferentially localize in the neoplastic mass, can activate tumor-resident leukocytes and may be more efficacious than their nontargeted counterparts, such products typically conserve an intact cytokine activity, which may prevent escalation to curative doses. To further improve tolerability, several strategies have been conceived for the development of antibody-cytokine fusions with "activity-on-demand", acting on tumors but helping spare normal tissues from undesired toxicity. In this article, we have reviewed some of the most promising strategies, outlining their potential as well as possible limitations.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The last decade has seen dramatic changes in cancer treatment. Various methods of the immunotherapy of solid tumors, including treatment with targeted monoclonal antibodies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, bi- or trispecific immune cell enhancers, and antibody derivatives (e.g., antibody–drug conjugates), in addition to adoptive cell transfer or cell therapy, are being actively developed. A number of these approaches target tumor cells directly, while several other strategies aim to neutralize immunosuppressive elements in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and transform TME from immunologically “cold” to “hot”. Although many of these approaches have received clinical approval, each has inherent limitations that are considered in this review. Additionally, we discuss recent innovations in immunotherapy to improve clinical efficacy in solid tumors and strategies to overcome the limitations of various immunotherapy. Abstract In recent years, the arrival of the immunotherapy industry has introduced the possibility of providing transformative, durable, and potentially curative outcomes for various forms of malignancies. However, further research has shown that there are a number of issues that significantly reduce the effectiveness of immunotherapy, especially in solid tumors. First of all, these problems are related to the protective mechanisms of the tumor and its microenvironment. Currently, major efforts are focused on overcoming protective mechanisms by using different adoptive cell therapy variants and modifications of genetically engineered constructs. In addition, a complex workforce is required to develop and implement these treatments. To overcome these significant challenges, innovative strategies and approaches are necessary to engineer more powerful variations of immunotherapy with improved antitumor activity and decreased toxicity. In this review, we discuss recent innovations in immunotherapy aimed at improving clinical efficacy in solid tumors, as well as strategies to overcome the limitations of various immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Primary Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection which can manifest as infectious mononucleosis (IM) is commonly acquired during childhood. EBV primarily invades B cells leading to a lytic reaction; the control of the infection is handled by natural killer and T cells in immunocompetent individuals. The infection has a wide spectrum of clinical findings and can lead to serious complications in patients with certain underlying immunological dysfunctions. We retrospectively investigated peripheral white blood cell populations’ surface marker characteristics in IM using a comprehensive flow cytometry marker panel. Twenty-one cases of IM and seventeen EBV-seropositive cases without IM serving as controls were included. We observed novel alterations in lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte populations. In addition to increased activated cytotoxic T cells and low B cells, we demonstrated high T-large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) populations in IM cases. Furthermore, despite T cells’ increased HLA-DR expression, another activation marker, CD11b, was lower in T-LGL populations. Monocytes showed increased CD16 expression; CD64 was higher in neutrophils. Our findings point to monocyte and neutrophil activation which may account for acute clinical features and may contribute to the understanding of IM immunobiology. Furthermore, they may serve as a useful tool in investigating inherited and post-transplant conditions characterized by deficiencies in controlling EBV infection.">

        <tr id="Mosunetuzumab (Mosun) is a CD20xCD3 T‐cell engaging bispecific antibody that redirects T cells to eliminate malignant B cells. The approved step‐up dose regimen of 1/2/60/30 mg IV is designed to mitigate cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and maximize efficacy in early cycles. A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model was developed from 439 patients with relapsed/refractory B‐Cell Non‐Hodgkin lymphoma receiving Mosun IV monotherapy, including fixed dosing (0.05–2.8 mg IV every 3 weeks (q3w)) and Cycle 1 step‐up dosing groups (0.4/1/2.8–1/2/60/30 mg IV q3w). Prior to Mosun treatment, ~50% of patients had residual levels of anti‐CD20 drugs (e.g., rituximab or obinutuzumab) from prior treatment. CD20 receptor binding dynamics and rituximab/obinutuzumab PK were incorporated into the model to calculate the Mosun CD20 receptor occupancy percentage (RO%) over time. A two‐compartment model with time‐dependent clearance (CL) best described the data. The typical patient had an initial CL of 1.08 L/day, transitioning to a steady‐state CL of 0.584 L/day. Statistically relevant covariates on PK parameters included body weight, albumin, sex, tumor burden, and baseline anti‐CD20 drug concentration; no covariate was found to have a clinically relevant impact on exposure at the approved dose. Mosun CD20 RO% was highly variable, attributed to the large variability in residual baseline anti‐CD20 drug concentration (median = 10 μg/mL). The 60 mg loading doses increased Mosun CD20 RO% in Cycle 1, providing efficacious exposures in the presence of the competing anti‐CD20 drugs. PopPK model simulations, investigating Mosun dose delays, informed treatment resumption protocols to ensure CRS mitigation.">

 Intravesical therapies have been the mainstay of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (BC) management; however, their efficacy is limited by toxicities, recurrences, and supply shortages. Consequently, many patients are recommended cystectomy, which is fraught with high complication rates. Thus, bladder-sparing treatments present a major, unmet clinical need. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, wherein T cells are engineered to express an artificial receptor to a target, is an immunotherapeutic approach with efficacy in hematologic malignancies. Similar success in solid tumors has been hindered by a lack of suitable targets, reduced T cell infiltration/activity, and major toxicities, including on-target off-tumor effects and cytokine release syndromes. To overcome these limitations, locoregional delivery of CAR T cells is being investigated. Yet, to date, no studies have examined their potential as intravesical therapies. In this study, we used a computational pipeline using large-scale BC transcriptomics data to discover potential CAR targets which met strict criteria of high cell-surface expression on BC and minimal expression on normal tissue. We identified MUC16, a surface-bound mucinous glycoprotein, as a top candidate from this pipeline, which has more reduced pan-tissue expression than targets of precision-guided therapies in BC. Consistent with prior reports, MUC16 transcript and protein levels increase with grade and T stage and correlates with chemotherapeutic resistance. We also find MUC16 expression persists in recurrent tumors after BCG-therapy. To target MUC16, we designed second-generation CARs based on scFv derived from the antibody 3a5 (3a5-28z) and natural-ligands based on the high-affinity MUC16-mesothelin interaction (MSLN-28z) or its truncated binding domain (truncMSLN-28z) which were fused to CD28 co-stimulatory domains and CD3z chains of the T cell receptor. Using human BC lines with a broad range of MUC16 levels, we show MSLN-28z more effectively lyses MUC16+, but not MUC16−, cells than compared to 3a5-28z or truncMSLN-28z CAR T cells. Ablation of MUC16 by CRISPR/Cas9 or modification of MSLN-based CAR to lack signaling domains abolishes the cytotoxicity of MSLN-28z CAR T cells, demonstrating dependency on MUC16 engagement. Using multiplex assays and intracellular cytokine staining, we further demonstrate MSLN-28z CAR T cells have potent polyfunctionality through secretion of cytokines IL-2, IFN-g, and TNF-a by both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Last, in immunodeficient mice orthotopically xenografted with HT1376 cells, intravesical delivery of MSLN-28z CAR T cells enhances survival compared to CAR T cells delivered intravenously. This enhanced anti-tumor response correlates with reduced tumor weights and increased T cell infiltration. Notably, intravesically delivered CAR T cells are not detectable in peripheral circulation of tumor-bearing mice. Together, our findings substantiate MUC16 as a targetable antigen in BC and validate MSLN-based CAR T cells as a potential intravesical therapy.

        <tr id="One of the major challenges in the choice of the best therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients affected by hemophilia A (HA) is the definition of criteria predicting the formation of factor VIII (FVIII) neutralizing antibodies, called inhibitors. Both genetic and environmental elements influencing the immune response toward FVIII have been identified but still not all the factors causing the pathological rejection of FVIII have been identified. Since there is a connection between coagulation and inflammation, here we assessed the role played by the FVIII deficiency in shaping the humoral and cellular response toward an antigen other than FVIII itself. To this aim, we challenged both HA and wild-type (WT) mice with either FVIII or ovalbumin (OVA) and followed antigen-specific antibody level, immune cell population frequency and phenotype up to 9 weeks after the last antigen booster. The activation threshold was evaluated in vitro by stimulating the murine T cells with a decreasing dose of α-CD3. The humoral response to FVIII was similar between the two groups while both the in vivo and in vitro experiments highlighted an antigen-independent sensitivity of HA compared with WT T cells causing an increase in memory T-cell conversion and proliferation capability.">

 Although CAR-T19 therapy is widely used for relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas, approximately half of patients experience post CAR-T relapse. The mechanisms underlying this resistance remain largely unknown and efforts to overcome this limitation are hindered by the lack of suitable pre-clinical models for study. To address these unmet needs, we generated a novel genetically engineered mouse model with conditional expression of Ezh2Y641F and BCL2 in germinal center (GC) B cells. Ezh2/BCL2 mice developed follicular lymphoma (FL) which histologically and transcriptionally recapitulates human FL. Moreover, we established a cell line derived from an Ezh2/BCL2 mouse that developed transformed FL (tFL). Injection of the cell line named “tFL-P6” in immunocompetent C57BL6 recipients resulted in rapid disease progression that histologically and transcriptionally mimics human tFL. Treatment of tFL-P6 with EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i) didn’t affect proliferation and viability, however, the number of pretreated cells was significantly reduced when co-cultured with T cells. EZH2i pretreated tFL-P6 displayed extended interaction with T cells, as measured by live imaging. EZH2i reprogrammed tFL-P6 to restore T cell engagement genes such as ICOSL, ICAM1, OX40L, and integrins, as well as cytokines and chemokines involved in T cell recruitment, therefore enhancing immunogenicity. Notably, pretreated tFL-P6 cells were rejected by C57BL6 whereas they developed lethal disease in immunodeficient recipients. Pre-treatment of tFL-P6 as well as human DLBCL and PDX-derived cell lines significantly enhanced CAR-T19 cell killing effects in vitro. Administering CAR-T cells in mice engrafted with EZH2i-pretreated tFL-P6 significantly reduced the tumor burden and prolonged their survival (100% vs 30%, p<0.01). To assess the direct interactions between lymphoma cells and CAR-T cells in vivo, we performed intravital 2-photon imaging of popliteal lymph nodes using dTomato labeled CAR-T cells and GFP+ tFL-P6 cells. Pretreatment of tFL-P6 cells with EZH2i doubled the recruitment of CAR-T cells in the microenvironment and enhanced the duration of contact and surface engagement with CAR-T cells. To explore the impact of EZH2 inhibition on CAR-T cells, we manufactured CAR-T cells from splenic T cells of mice treated with EZH2i or vehicle for 14 days. Prior exposure to EZH2i didn’t affect proliferation and transduction during CAR-T production. Ex vivo assays with those CAR-T cells and tFL-P6 cells showed a superior killing effect and expansion of EZH2i-exposed CAR-T (p<0.001). Mice bearing tFL-P6 lymphomas displayed a longer survival when infused with EZH2i-pretreated CAR-T cells (p=0.06). Pretreatment with EZH2i resulted in an increased memory/effector ratio (p<0.01) and reduction of PD1+CD38+ exhausted CD8CAR-T cells (p<0.001). Overall, EZH2i improved CAR-T therapy by enhancing lymphoma cell immunogenicity and CAR-T cell functions. These results prompted the initiation of a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in R/R B cell lymphomas (NCT05934838).

        <tr id="Although adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells has achieved unprecedented response rates in patients with certain hematological malignancies, this therapeutic modality is still far from fulfilling its remarkable potential, especially in the context of solid cancers. Antigen escape variants, off-tumor destruction of healthy tissues expressing tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), poor CAR-T cell persistence, and the occurrence of functional exhaustion represent some of the most prominent hurdles that limit CAR-T cell ability to induce long-lasting remissions with a tolerable adverse effect profile. In this review, we summarize the main approaches that have been developed to face such bottlenecks, including the adapter CAR (AdCAR) system, Boolean-logic gating, epitope editing, the modulation of cell-intrinsic signaling pathways, and the incorporation of safety switches to precisely control CAR-T cell activation. We also discuss the most pressing issues pertaining to the selection of co-stimulatory domains, with a focus on strategies aimed at promoting CAR-T cell persistence and optimal antitumor functionality.">

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cell therapy represents a promising advancement in the field of oncology offering a novel approach to target and eliminate tumor cells with high specificity and reduced risk of immune-related adverse effects. This paper reviews the mechanism, potential targets, and recent advances in CAR-NK cell therapy for lung cancer, including the design and engineering of CAR-NK cells, preclinical studies, and the outcomes of early-phase clinical trials. We highlight the unique advantages of using NK cells, such as their innate ability to recognize and kill cancer cells and their reduced potential for inducing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) compared to CAR T-cell therapies. Results from recent studies demonstrate significant antitumor activity in lung cancer models with improved targeting and persistence of CAR-NK cells observed in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we discuss the challenges in optimizing CAR-NK cell therapies, including the potential resistance mechanisms. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future directions of CAR-NK cell research and its implications for lung cancer treatment emphasizing the importance of continued innovation and collaboration in the field.">

        <tr id="Objective Mechanisms underpinning clinical evolution to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from preceding antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positivity are poorly understood. This study aimed to understand blood immune cell transcriptional signatures associated with subclinical ANA positivity, and progression or non-progression to SLE. Methods Bulk RNA-sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated at baseline from 35 ANA positive (ANA+) subjects with non-diagnostic symptoms was analysed using differential gene expression, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, deconvolution of cell subsets and functional enrichment analyses. ANA+ subjects, including those progressing to classifiable SLE at 12 months (n=15) and those with stable subclinical ANA positivity (n=20), were compared with 15 healthy subjects and 18 patients with SLE. Results ANA+ subjects demonstrated extensive transcriptomic dysregulation compared with healthy controls with reduced CD4+naïve T-cells and resting NK cells, but higher activated dendritic cells. B-cell lymphopenia was evident in SLE but not ANA+ subjects. Two-thirds of dysregulated genes were common to ANA+ progressors and non-progressors. ANA+ progressors showed elevated modular interferon signature in which constituent genes were inducible by both type I interferon (IFN-I) and type II interferon (IFN-II) in vitro. Baseline downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex I components significantly associated with progression to SLE but did not directly correlate with IFN modular activity. Non-progressors demonstrated more diverse cytokine profiles. Conclusions ANA positivity, irrespective of clinical trajectory, is profoundly dysregulated and transcriptomically closer to SLE than to healthy immune function. Metabolic derangements and IFN-I activation occur early in the ANA+ preclinical phase and associated with diverging transcriptomic profiles which distinguish subsequent clinical evolution.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Relapse/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (r/r B-ALL) represents paediatric cancer with a challenging prognosis. CAR T-cell treatment, considered an advanced treatment, remains controversial due to high relapse rates and adverse events. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of CAR T-cell therapy for r/r B-ALL. Methods The literature search was performed on four databases. Efficacy parameters included minimal residual disease negative complete remission (MRD-CR) and relapse rate (RR). Safety parameters constituted cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Results Anti-CD22 showed superior efficacy with the highest MRD-CR event rate and lowest RR, compared to anti-CD19. Combining CAR T-cell therapy with haploidentical stem cell transplantation improved RR. Safety-wise, bispecific anti-CD19/22 had the lowest CRS rate, and anti-CD22 showed the fewest ICANS. Analysis of the costimulatory receptors showed that adding CD28ζ to anti-CD19 CAR T-cell demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing relapses with favorable safety profiles. Conclusion Choosing a more efficacious and safer CAR T-cell treatment is crucial for improving overall survival in acute leukaemia. Beyond the promising anti-CD22 CAR T-cell, exploring costimulatory domains and new CD targets could enhance treatment effectiveness for r/r B-ALL.">

treatments to treat malignancies, as it affects not just the product's efficacy as well as safety but also
its general availability to patients who require it. This article's primary goal is to provide a comprehensive
overview of CAR-T therapy, encompassing its historical evolution, mechanistic insights,
clinical applications, challenges, and future directions. By synthesizing existing literature and realworld
evidence, this review seeks to elucidate the significance of CAR-T therapy in the landscape of
cancer treatment and its potential to redefine the standard of care for patients with refractory or relapsed
malignancies. The methodology involved a comprehensive literature search conducted using
various databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries such as Clinical-
Trials.gov. The search strategy incorporated a combination of relevant keywords and Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) terms, including but not limited to "CAR-T therapy," "chimeric antigen receptor
T-cell therapy," "cancer immunotherapy," "clinical trials," "pharmaceutical companies," "regulatory
approvals," "pipeline molecules," and "cancer types." Boolean operators (AND, OR) were utilized to
refine the search and capture relevant articles and studies. In addition to database searches, manual
screening of reference lists from relevant review articles and primary studies was performed to identify
additional relevant publications. The inclusion criteria encompassed original research articles, clinical
trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and regulatory documents related to CAR-T cell therapy
and its applications in cancer treatment and the review included studies published in English between
January 2010 and March 2024. Exclusion criteria comprised studies not relevant to the scope
of the review, such as those focusing on non-CAR-T cell therapies or non-cancer-related topics. This
review underscores the transformative potential of CAR-T therapy in cancer treatment, highlighting
its efficacy, safety, and clinical relevance across various malignancies. By synthesizing findings from
preclinical studies, clinical trials, and real-world data from patients, CAR-T therapy has consistently
exhibited remarkable therapeutic outcomes. These include high response rates, durable remissions,
and significant improvements in survival outcomes among patients with refractory or relapsed cancers.

        <tr id="e14677 Background: HLAE is a non-classical MHC class I molecule complexed with the VMAPRTLFL nonapeptide, derived from the leader sequence of HLAG (HLAEpHLAG). HLAEpHLAG is overexpressed across a wide type of tumors prominently on Multiple Myeloma (MM). HLAEpHLAG complex is the ligand to CD94-NKG2A in the immune system which negatively regulates the activation of natural killer (NK) cells as well as NKG2A positive T cells. Harnessing of the HLAE-NKG2A axis by the cancer cells leads to evasion from the immune system attack resulting in cancer progression. Currently, several Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) target the NKG2A receptor which has a low specificity to cancer and high toxicity to the patient. Engineering a new ICI that targets the HLAEpHLAG complex can potentially yield improved outcomes in cancer therapy. Methods: Using the hybridoma system, a new mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) called 4D7 that targets the HLAEpHLAG complex was developed. mAb 4D7 affinity was assessed in vitro with recombinant proteins and a panel of cell lines that expressed zero to high levels of HLAE. The functional impacts of the mAb 4D7 was examined in a system where various MM cell lines were separately co-cultured with primary NK (pNK) cells. pNK were isolated from the peripheral blood of 5 healthy donors, and their activity was examined in the presence of mAb 4D7 by CD107a degranulation assay. Also, the functional impacts of the mAb 4D7 on allogenic pNK and MM blast cells, isolated from the bone marrow of 6 MM patients were assessed. Results: mAb 4D7 was determined to be an IgG-kappa isotype showing a high specific binding to recombinant HLAEpHLAG. Cell lines with overexpression of membranal HLAEpHLAG: RPMI8226, U266, 721.221 HLAE, and 721.221 HLAG showed positive staining with the mAb 4D7. While cell lines with low to zero expression of HLA-E like 721.221 WT showed low or negative staining with the mAb 4D7. The degranulation of NKG2A+ pNK subset cells against MM target cells increased in presence of mAb 4D7. However, adding mAb 4D7 to NKG2A -pNK subset cells co-cultured with MM target cells did not affect the pNK activity. Similar results were obtained when the target and effector cells were isolated from the bone marrow of active treatment-naive MM patients. Conclusions: MAb 4D7 demonstrates a remarkably high affinity for binding to the HLAEpHLAG complex, ensuring the safety of its application. The ability of 4D7 mAb to effectively block the HLAEpHLAG complex and counteract the inhibition signal in NK cells. mAb 4D7 is a promising monoclonal antibody with substantial potential to serve as an ICI for clinical use in MM patients.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy has been a popular treatment for tumors in recent years, and it has good efficacy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially B-lymphoblastic ALL. Generally, CAR-T therapy affects the tumor immune microenvironment and activates the immune response, so it may lead to the occurrence of inflammation and some other adverse effects, most of which are self-limiting symptoms. However, a small number of children will develop severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening in severe cases. Currently, the main means of treating or alleviating CRS is the application of monoclonal antibodies, glucocorticosteroids, boosting drugs, etc. Although these drugs can relieve symptoms, further effects need to be further discussed. The mechanism of CAR-T causing ALL is described in this paper, and the mechanism, advantages and disadvantages of various drugs, and their impact on tumor treatment are compared to analyze the better measures to deal with CRS, so as to provide ideas for further clinical practice.">

The standard treatment regimen for SLE includes the long-term use of corticosteroids and non-specific immunosuppressive agents, often limited by co-morbidities or related side effects. However, recent advances in disease pathogenesis clarifying the role of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, immune cells, and co-stimulation molecules have made a more practical, targeted approach possible, leading to personalized treatment strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge about SLE-targeted therapies in clinical practice.">

        <tr id="Glycosaminoglycans are often deprioritized as targets for synthetic immunotherapy due to the complexity of glyco-epitopes and limited options for obtaining specific subtype-binding. Solid tumors express proteoglycans that are modified with oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (CS), a modification normally restricted to the placenta. Here, we report the design and functionality of conditional chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells with selectivity to oncofetal CS. Following expression in T cells, the CAR could be ‘armed’ with recombinant VAR2CSA lectins (rVAR2) to target tumor cells expressing oncofetal CS. While un-armed CAR T cells remained inactive in the presence of target cells, VAR2-armed CAR T cells displayed robust activation and the ability to eliminate diverse tumor cell types in vitro. Cytotoxicity of the CAR T cells was proportional to the concentration of rVAR2 available to the CAR, offering a potential molecular handle to finetune CAR T cell activity. In vivo, armed CAR T cells rapidly targeted bladder tumors and increased survival of tumor-bearing mice. Thus, our work indicates that cancer-restricted glycosaminoglycans can be exploited as potential targets for CAR T cell therapy.">

        <tr id="177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan (Betalutin) is an anti-CD37 radioimmunoconjugate evaluated as single administration therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan treatment is well-tolerated and shows consistent activity in most of the patients evaluated so far. Herein, we investigated the activity of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan in a panel of 55 lymphoma cell lines of B and T cell origin. CD37-targeted radioimmunotherapy was more effective in CD37-positive B-cell lymphomas (n=46) than negative CD37 negative T-cell lymphomas (n=9). Focusing on DLBCL cell lines, mutations such as BCL2 or MYC translocations were not correlated to sensitivity. However, BCL2 expression was higher in resistant than sensitive GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and the addition of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax showed synergism when added to the radioimmunoconjugate. Finally, the pattern of activity of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan differed from what was achieved with a CD37-targeting antibody-drug conjugate or with R-CHOP, indicating the potential benefit of the beta-emitter payload. In conclusion, this systematic analysis of the responsiveness of lymphoma cell lines to CD37-targeting radioimmunotherapy consolidated 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan as a promising compound for the treatment of CD37 positive malignancies and identified candidate biomarkers and co-targets to detect and overcome cancer cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in treating advanced B-cell malignancies by targeting CD19, but antigen-negative relapses and immune responses triggered by murine-derived antibodies remain significant challenges, necessitating the development of novel humanized multitarget CAR-T therapies. Here, we engineered a second-generation 4-1BB-CD3ζ-based CAR construct incorporating humanized CD19 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and BAFFR single-variable domains on heavy chains (VHHs), also known as nanobodies. The resultant CAR-T cells, with different constructs, were functionally compared both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the optimal tandem and bicistronic (BI) structures retained respective antigen-binding abilities, and both demonstrated specific activation when stimulated with target cells. At the same time, BI CAR-T cells (BI CARs) exhibited stronger tumour-killing ability and better secretion of interleukin-2 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha than single-target CAR-T cells. Additionally, BI CARs showed less exhaustion phenotype upon repeated antigen stimulation and demonstrated more potent and persistent antitumor effects in mouse xenograft models. Overall, we developed a novel humanized CD19/BAFFR bicistronic CAR (BI CAR) based on a combination of scFv and VHH, which showed potent and sustained antitumor ability both in vitro and in vivo, including against tumours with CD19 or BAFFR deficiencies.">

        <tr id="2650 Background: REGN6569 is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is highly specific for glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor–related protein (GITR). GITR is expressed on several immune cell subtypes, notably regulatory T cells (Tregs), and activated natural killer (NK) cells. REGN6569 demonstrated greater in vitro antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against GITR-expressing Tregs, as compared to GITR-expressing CD8+ T cells. Mouse studies showed that REGN6569 + cemiplimab (anti-PD-1) combination treatment achieved longer-term tumor responses compared with either drug alone. Methods: This is a first-in-human study (NCT04465487) evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of REGN6569 administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) + cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W, in pts with advanced solid tumors for which immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies have not been approved or are not available. The study includes a dose-escalation part with 5 dose levels (DL1-DL5) for REGN6569 (“4+3” design), with an initial dose of REGN6569 monotherapy given as a safety lead-in followed by REGN6569 + cemiplimab in subsequent doses. Results: As of the data cutoff date Oct 20, 2023, the dose-escalation part has been completed. 29 pts (median age 58.0 years, 62.1% male) were treated with REGN6569 + cemiplimab, up to the 1200 mg dose level (DL5), across many solid tumor types. The most common tumor type was colorectal cancer (34.5%). One pt (40 mg DL2) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (Grade 3 hepatic failure); maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Twelve pts (41.4%) had a Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 16 pts (55.2%) had a treatment-related TEAE (any grade). The most frequent TEAEs (any grade) were arthralgia (24.1%), infusion-related reactions, and abdominal pain (20.7% each). There were no treatment-related deaths; 19 (65.5%) pts had disease progression leading to death. Two pts achieved ongoing partial responses by investigator assessment with REGN6569 + cemiplimab treatment: 1 pt with mucoepidermoid tumor of the parotid gland treated with 120 mg (DL3) REGN6569 and 1 pt with B3 thymoma treated with 400 mg (DL4) REGN6569, with duration of responses, 5.6 and 10.4 months, respectively. Full receptor occupancy on circulating Tregs was observed in all dose cohorts following REGN6569 treatment. Increased frequency (~10–50%) of proliferating NK cells in peripheral blood was observed post REGN6569 treatment across all dose cohorts. Conclusions: In this dose-escalation study, REGN6569 was administered up to 1200 mg (DL5) in combination with cemiplimab with one dose-limiting toxicity. The study has progressed to dose-expansion cohorts in anti–PD-1-resistant head and neck cancer, with pts treated with REGN6569 (DL5) + cemiplimab. Clinical trial information: NCT04465487 .">

        <tr id="TPS9602 Background: Current standard of care in newly diagnosed patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma (CM) include anti-PD1 as monotherapy or in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). However, most patients will eventually progress and the 5-year survival rate remains low, necessitating new therapies with novel mechanisms of action to combine with anti-PD1. T cell receptor (TCR) bispecifics have shown overall survival (OS) benefit with tebentafusp (gp100 ´ CD3) in a phase (Ph) 3 trial in metastatic uveal melanoma [1]. IMC-F106C is the first TCR bispecific protein targeting CD3 and PRAME (PRAME ´ CD3), redirecting T cells towards cancer cells presenting a PRAME peptide on the cell surface by HLA-A*02:01 proteins. PRAME is expressed in the vast majority of melanoma. In an ongoing Ph 1 study (NCT04262466), IMC-F106C monotherapy was well tolerated and demonstrated evidence of durable clinical activity in heavily pre-treated, advanced melanoma patients, including those who progressed on prior ICI and targeted therapy [2]. Two doses, 40 mcg and 160 mcg, were selected for further study based on exposure response modeling. Safety of combination TCR bispecifics with ICI has been demonstrated in the ongoing IMC-F106C Ph 1 study and in a prior study of tebentafusp + ICI [3]. Combining IMC-F106C with the anti-PD1 ICI nivolumab has the potential to improve progression free survival (PFS), OS, and response rate (RR). Methods: PRISM-MEL-301 is a randomized, global, open-label, Ph 3 study in previously untreated HLA-A*02:01+ patients with unresectable or metastatic non-uveal melanoma; up to 10% of patients can have a diagnosis of mucosal, acral, or other non-CM melanoma. The first 90 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive IMC-F106C 40 mcg + nivolumab (Arm A), IMC-F106C 160 mcg + nivolumab (Arm B), or a nivolumab regimen (Arm C) from which a final IMC-F106C dose (Arm A or B) will be selected. Subsequently, approximately 590 additional patients will be randomized to Arm (A or B) vs. control Arm C, either nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab + relatlimab, dependent on the country. Randomization will be stratified by 1) American Joint Committee on Cancer (8th Edition) M stage with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; M0 or M1 with normal LDH vs M1 with elevated LDH); 2) prior anti-PD[L]1 adjuvant therapy (yes vs no); and 3) BRAF V600 mutation status (positive vs negative). Primary endpoint is PFS per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include OS, ORR, and safety. Enrollment is ongoing globally.

        <tr id="7004 Background: A substantial proportion of patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) will not derive a long-term benefit from the existing anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. To enhance therapeutic efficacy, we have engineered huCART19-IL18, a 4th generation 4-1BB anti-CD19 construct, armored with the ability to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-18. Methods: This is a first-in-human trial using huCART19-IL18 for CD19+ B-cell malignancies (NCT04684563). Expedited 3-day manufacturing is utilized to limit T-cell exhaustion. To be eligible for the NHL cohort, pts must be R/R to prior anti-CD19 CAR T cells if indicated by FDA label. Dose levels (DL) between 3x106 and 3x108 of huCART19-IL18+ cells are administered as a single IV infusion following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Bridging therapy is optional. Responses are first assessed at 3 months (mo) using Lugano criteria. Results: As of January 20, 2024, 21 pts with CD19+ NHL were infused with huCART19-IL18. Characteristics include median age 64 yrs (47-74), 76% male, 9 (43%) DLBCL, 6 (29%) FL, 3 (14%) MCL, 2 (10%) tFL, 1 (5%) HGBCL. Median number of prior Rx was 7 (4-14) with 20 (95%) pts R/R to prior anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Manufacturing of DL5 (3x108) was not feasible due to inability to achieve the target dose in 4/6 (67%) pts assigned to DL5. 18 (86%) pts received bridging. 3 pts received DL1 (3x106), 4 pts DL2 (7x106), 1 pt non-defined dose (2.8x107), 6 pts DL3 (3x107), 5 pts DL4 (7x107), 2 pts DL5 (3x108). No study-related deaths occurred in 21 safety-evaluable pts. CRS occurred in 15 (71%) pts: G1 in 8 (38%), G2 in 4 (19%), G3 in 3 (14%). ICANS occurred in 3 (14%) pts: G1 in 2 (10%), G2 in 1 (5%). The most common G3 adverse events at least possibly related to huCART19-IL18 included fatigue (38%), hypotension (29%), and low fibrinogen (23%). 20 pts are efficacy evaluable with median (m) follow-up of 15 mo (3-31). The 3 mo ORR was 80% (90% CI: 60-93%), with CR 50% (90% CI: 30-70%) and PR 30% (90% CI: 14-51%). mDOR was 10 mo (5.5-NR). mPFS was 8.7 mo (90% CI 5-NR), and mOS was NR (90% CI 25 mo-NR). We detected continued persistence of huCART19-IL18 in pts with 24 mo follow-up. No correlation between cell dose and outcome was identified, but response rates and mean expansion (copies/µg gDNA) were higher in pts previously exposed to CD28 CAR than those who had prior 4-1BB CAR (Table). Conclusions: Treatment with huCART19-IL18 has an acceptable safety profile and produced durable remissions in heavily pre-treated pts with R/R NHL despite prior CAR T-cell therapy. The subtype of the preceding CAR product may influence the expansion and effectiveness of huCART19-IL18. Clinical trial information: NCT04684563 . [Table: see text]">

        <tr id="e19537 Background: Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) is a benign precursor of multiple myeloma (MM). Individuals with MGUS have an overall 1% risk per year of disease progression to active MM or other cancers, although risk varies depending on multiple factors. Natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and dendritic cells have been shown to be altered in MM. Immune profile analysis can help to understand the microenvironment for monoclonal plasma cells better and help identify early factors for progression of MGUS into MM. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of individuals from 2007-2023 who had a confirmed MGUS diagnosis and available flow-cytometry based immunophenotyping of peripheral blood. Demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), immunoglobulin subtype, date of diagnosis and progression, CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, CD19+ B-cells, memory B-cells, gamma delta T cells, NK cells, and exhausted/non-exhausted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were characterized. Descriptive statistics were expressed as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and tabulated frequencies for categorical variables. Pearson’s chi-square test of independence was used to explore the relationship between categorical race and diagnosis across categorical variables. Analysis of variance was utilized to assess the variation in continuous variables by race and diagnosis. The investigation of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) involved using univariate and multivariate Cox models across all pertinent variables. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated. A stepwise regression model was incorporated into the Cox multivariate model for a comprehensive analysis. All statistical tests were tested at alpha=0.05. Results: This retrospective study analyzed 151 patients, 84 (55.6%) being male. Average age was 55-77.8 years. The primary sub-diagnosis included IgG kappa at 30.5%, followed by IgG lambda at 29.8%. No significant associations were observed between MGUS subtype and comorbidities, race and Immunoglobulin subtype, Mayo risk status, and free light chain ratio (FLCR). After median follow-up of 666 days, median PFS was 8.07 years with a 95% CI of (4.45, 14.68), and median OS exceeded 12.71 years. The Univariate model for PFS identified the CCI Score (p=0.003, HR=1.25), FLCR (p=0.012, HR=1.024), and NK T-cells (%gated) (p=0.0211, HR=1.033) as significant factors. Only the CCI score was retained in the multivariate stepwise model. Univariate model for OS revealed associations with CCI (p<0.001, HR=1.50), NK T-cells (%gated) (p=0.007, HR=1.05), monoclonal protein (p=0.008, HR=2.80), Non-exhausted T-cells-CD4 (% of CD4+) (p=0.013, HR=0.96), and age (p=0.023, HR=1.09). Conclusions: In this single-center retrospective review, only CCI remained prognostically significant in the multivariate model. CCI and NK T-cells were prognostically significant for OS in the univariate analysis.">

        <tr id="Visceral leishmaniasis is a potentially devastating neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasites Leishmania donovani and L. infantum (chagasi). These parasites reside in tissue macrophages and survive by deploying a number of mechanisms aimed at subverting the host immune response. CD4+ T cells play an important role in controlling Leishmania parasites by providing help in the form of pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate microbiocidal pathways in infected macrophages. However, because these cytokines can also cause tissue damage if over-produced, regulatory immune responses develop, and the balance between pro-inflammatory and regulatory CD4+ T cells responses determines the outcomes of infection. Past studies have identified important roles for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ and TNF, as well as regulatory co-inhibitory receptors and the potent anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. More recently, other immunoregulatory molecules have been identified that play important roles in CD4+ T cell responses during VL. In this review, we will discuss recent findings about two of these molecules; the NK cell granule protein Nkg7 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGFβ, and describe how they impact CD4+ T cell functions and immune responses during visceral leishmaniasis.">

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has emerged as a highly
effective treatment for hematological tumors. However, the associated adverse reaction, Cytokine
Release Syndrome (CRS), poses a significant challenge. While numerous studies have investigated
CRS biomarkers during CAR-T cell therapy, the ability to predict CRS risk prior to treatment initiation
remains a crucial yet underexplored aspect.



The primary purpose of this study was to address the issue of limited data, explore an alternative
approach using public data to identify predictive markers for CRS risk assessment from
RNA-Seq in pre-treatment patients data, and comprehend the inducible mechanisms underlying
CRS.



We integrated information from two public databases, the FDA Adverse Event Reporting
System (FAERS) for adverse reaction reports of CAR-T cell therapy and the Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) for RNA-Seq data on corresponding hematological tumors. Candidate genes were screened
by correlation analysis between Reported Odds Ratio (ROR) values and RNA-Seq gene expression
levels, and then core factors were identified through stepwise analysis of pathway enrichment, cluster
analysis, and protein interactions.



Our analysis highlighted the correlation between CRS risk and pre-treatment T cell activation/
proliferation, identifying key genes (IFN-γ, IL1β, IL2, IL6, and IL10) as significant CRS indicators.



This study offers a unique perspective on predicting CRS risk before CAR-T cell therapy,
circumventing the challenges of scarce clinical data by leveraging analysis of public databases.
It elucidates the crucial role of T cell activation/proliferation dynamics in CRS. The analytical
methods and identified markers provide a reference for the research and clinical application of
CAR-T cell therapy.

 Approximatively 40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients exhibit primary resistance to standard therapy. Moreover, relapse is a common event in first-line responders. Overexpression of BCL-2 is a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy in several B-cell neoplasms, including DLBCL. While venetoclax, a specific BCL-2 inhibitor, has dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape of other B-cell malignancies, only 12% of DLBCL patients exhibit a complete response to venetoclax, with a mean progression-free survival of 1 month. In this scenario, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. We tested the possibility to overcome the resistance of DLBCL cells to venetoclax by rewiring their reactive oxygen species (ROS) set point, which is higher in cancer cells compared to their healthy counterparts. We employed a panel of 14 DLBCL cell lines of both germinal center B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC) derivation. Cell death, ROS accumulation, and NADPH levels were evaluated upon treatment of DLBCL cells with three inhibitors of NADPH production, the central electron donor required to maintain ROS scavengers in their reduced form. The synergism between venetoclax and inhibitors of NADPH production was assessed through isobologram analysis. RNA-Seq, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blot techniques were used to dissect the mechanism of cooperation between venetoclax and inhibition of NADPH production. The Zebrafish model was used for in vivo validation of the therapeutic approach. We observed that inhibiting NADPH production dramatically improves the response to venetoclax by more than 500-fold, while no toxic effects were observed in normal B-cells. By generating isogenic cell lines with differing sensitivity to venetoclax, we demonstrated that the resistance to this drug positively correlates with the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL. Moreover, RNA-seq and protein analyses indicated that the increase of ROS levels engages the integrated stress response (ISR). Pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing of key effectors of the ISR rescued DLBCL cells from cell death induced by our therapeutic strategy. We also confirmed the ROS-dependency of BCL-xL downregulation using both ROS scavengers and by pulsing cells with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Finally, in vivo studies confirmed the sensitization of DLBCL cells to venetoclax upon the inhibition of NADPH production. Taken together, these results provide the first proof-of-principle evidence for a ROS-based strategy to increase the therapeutic window of venetoclax in DLBCL, suggesting a viable therapeutic avenue to treat refractory patients.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy for hematological malignancies is a rapidly advancing field that has gained momentum in recent years, primarily encompassing chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and other modalities. However, its clinical efficacy remains limited, and drug resistance poses a significant challenge. Therefore, novel immunotherapeutic targets and agents need to be identified. Recently, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent RNA epitope modification, has emerged as a pivotal factor in various malignancies. Reportedly, m6A mutations influence the immunological microenvironment of hematological malignancies, leading to immune evasion and compromising the anti-tumor immune response in hematological malignancies. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the roles of the currently identified m6A modifications in various hematological malignancies, with a particular focus on their impact on the immune microenvironment. Additionally, we provide an overview of the research progress made in developing m6A-targeted drugs for hematological tumor therapy, to offer novel clinical insights.">

        <tr id="Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) is a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine that is highly effective in preventing the most severe outcomes of COVID-19 infection. Nucleoside-modified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccines induce effective stimulation of T follicular helper (TFH) cells, leading to a robust germinal center B cell response. Side effects from the BNT162b2 vaccination, including significant lymphadenopathy, have been reported previously. Here, we present a case of angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (AITL), a rare, peripheral T-cell lymphoma with RHOA-G17v-mutated gene developing in a patient following BNT162B2 vaccine with a plausible explanation. A 60-year-old Asian female received her first dose of Pfizer BNT162B2 mRNA vaccine in August 2021. Right after her vaccination, she developed right axillary lymphadenopathy. She received her second vaccine dose in September 2021. Thereafter, she developed lymph node (LN) enlargement in her neck and groin. She underwent left posterior cervical and left groin LN excisional biopsy in April 2022 due to persistent palpable lymphadenopathy. Biopsy results then demonstrated benign follicular hyperplasia. For progressive B symptoms, a right axillary LN biopsy was done, which demonstrated AITL, with molecular studies revealing mutation in TET-2, IDH-2, and RHOA-G17v genes. Progression of AITL following BNT162B2 mRNA vaccine is limited in literature. Our case demonstrates a plausible correlation between the diagnosis of AITL following mRNA vaccination due to the malignant transformation of the TFH cells in patients who have a predisposing mutation of RHOA-17v. Given the rarity of AITL and the heterogeneity of molecular findings, more studies are needed to establish such an association.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has transformed over the past several decades through enhanced supportive care, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), improved human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, and novel graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-prevention and treatment strategies. Most notably, the implementation of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has dramatically increased the safety and availability of this life-saving therapy. Given reductions in nonrelapse mortality (NRM) with these advances, the HCT community has placed even greater emphasis on developing ways to reduce relapse - the leading cause of death after HCT. When using RIC HCT, protection from relapse relies predominantly on graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactions. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), adoptive cellular therapy, checkpoint inhibition, and post-HCT maintenance strategies represent approaches under study that aim to augment or synergize with the GVL effects of HCT. Optimizing donor selection algorithms to leverage GVL represents another active area of research. Many of these strategies seek to harness the effects of T cells, which for decades were felt to be the primary mediators of GVL and the focus of investigation in relapse reduction. However, there is growing interest in capitalizing on the ability of natural killer (NK) cells to yield potent anti-tumor effects. A potential advantage of NK cell-based approaches over T cell-mediated is the potential to reduce NRM in addition to relapse. By decreasing infection, without increasing the risk of GVHD, NK cells may mitigate NRM, while still yielding relapse reduction through identification and clearance of cancer cells. Most T cell-focused relapse-prevention strategies must weigh the benefits of relapse reduction against the increased risk of NRM from GVHD. In contrast, NK cells have the potential to reduce both, potentially tipping the scales significantly in favor of survival. Here, we will review the role of NK cells in GVL, optimization of NK cell match or mismatch, and burgeoning areas of research in NK cell therapy such as adoptive transfer and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a form of adoptive cell therapy that has revolutionized the field of cancer immunotherapy. Owing to the unprecedented efficacy seen in the treatment of blood cancers, the FDA has now approved multiple CAR T cell products for the treatment of various hematologic malignancies. Despite the clinical success seen in hematologic malignancies, CAR T cell therapies have demonstrated only modest efficacy in the treatment of solid tumors. Thus, great efforts are underway to increase the treatment efficacy in solid tumors and further enhance the treatment of hematologic malignancies. However, irrespective of advancements in efficacy, there are still unmet needs for patients receiving CAR T cell therapies. CAR T cell therapies carry significant risks of potentially fatal toxicities, and few of these toxicities were predicted in the animal models used to advance these therapies to the clinic. Therefore, significant advancements are needed to help reduce the incidence and severity of these toxicities to ultimately enhance patient safety and quality of life. This review will provide a brief overview of some of the major toxicities associated with CAR T cell therapies and will discuss the various engineering strategies used to mitigate such toxicities in preclinical models and clinical studies.">

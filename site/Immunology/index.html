        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Persistent type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling compromises adaptive anti-HIV-1 T cell immunity and promotes viral reservoir persistence, yet its effects on innate lymphoid cells during chronic infection remain unclear. Through integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and functional validation in HIV-1-infected humanized mice with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and IFN-I signaling blockade, we reveal IFN-I-induced dysfunction of natural killer (NK) cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). Mechanistically, the IFN-I-CD9 axis drives NK cells toward a decidual NK cell-like phenotype, impairing their cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, IFNAR blockade rescues ILC3 functionality, which is critical for IL-17/IL-22-mediated antimicrobial defense and mucosal barrier maintenance. Our study delineates IFN-I-driven immunosuppression across innate lymphocyte compartments and proposes the targeted modulation of this pathway to enhance antiviral and mucosal immunity in HIV-1 management.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) orchestrates a profound disruption of immune balance within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. To better understand these complex immune dynamics, we used high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) profiling to comprehensively characterize the immune landscape of the BM across different stages of myeloma progression, including MGUS (n = 16), smoldering MM (SMM; n = 25), and active MM, both newly diagnosed (n = 43) and relapsed/refractory (n = 104). Our analysis revealed substantial immune remodeling during disease progression, characterized by adaptive immune suppression and extensive infiltration of innate immune populations. Transformation from MGUS to SMM was marked by significant alterations in central and effector memory T helper cells, effector cytotoxic T cells, and an enrichment of monocytic and neutrophil subsets. Active MM stages were further distinguished by increased expansion of myeloid and monocytic lineages, alongside a pronounced reduction in progenitor and transitional B cells. Correspondence analysis demonstrated that specific immune profiles were significantly associated with clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival and overall survival. This study highlights the potential of CyTOF-based molecular profiling to unravel the intricate immune dynamics of the BM microenvironment across MM disease stages, enhancing our understanding of MM pathogenesis and providing a foundation for identifying prognostic biomarkers and tailoring precision immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment option for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); however, the pronounced heterogeneity of the tumor immune microenvironment significantly hinders the prediction of therapeutic efficacy, with effective biomarkers also remaining limited. This study utilizes single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and transcriptome analysis to dissect the immune landscapes of TNBC, emphasizing CD8 effector T cells (CD8Teff) as potential predictors of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) treatment response. Immune profiling revealed that CD8Teff cells were predominantly enriched in "hot" tumors strongly correlating with improved progression-free and overall survival. Notably, the cytokine C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 13 (CXCL13) emerged as a key regulator, with its high expression marking an immune-active tumor microenvironment favorable to ICI efficacy. Comprehensive analysis uncovered critical interactions between CD8Teff cells and other immune and stromal components, supporting the formation of an immunologically active tumor microenvironment (TME) conducive to tumor control. Additionally, metabolic reprogramming of CD8Teff cells in responsive tumors highlighted pathways that may influence ICIs efficacy. CD8Teff cells significantly influence the TME and predict ICI success in TNBC, with CXCL13 as a pivotal modulator. A pathology-based artificial intelligence model for CD8Teff recognition was developed, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.823 in the training cohort and 0.805 in the validation cohort. This study provides an in-depth characterization of the TNBC immune microenvironment, identifying CD8Teff functionality, CXCL13 signaling, and immune-metabolic pathways as critical determinants of immunotherapy success. These findings support the development of personalized treatment strategies based on immune profiling to enhance therapeutic efficacy in TNBC.

        <tr id="Vδ1 γδ T cells are key players in innate and adaptive immunity, particularly at mucosal interfaces such as the gut. An increase in circulating Vδ1 cells has long been observed in people with HIV-1, but remains poorly understood. We performed a comprehensive characterization of Vδ1 T cells in blood and duodenal intra-epithelial lymphocytes, obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies of 15 people with HIV-1 on antiretroviral therapy and 15 HIV-seronegative controls, in a substudy of the ANRS EP61 GALT study (NCT02906137). We deciphered the phenotype, functional profile, single-cell transcriptome and repertoire of Vδ1 cells and unraveled their relationships with the possible triggers involved, in particular CMV and microbiota. We also assessed whether Vδ1 T cells may play a role in controlling the HIV-1 reservoir. Vδ1 T cells were mainly terminally differentiated effectors that clonally expanded in the blood with some trafficking with the gut of people with HIV-1. Most expressed CX3CR1 and displayed a highly cytotoxic profile, but low cytokine production, supported by a transcriptomic shift towards enhanced effector lymphocytes. This expansion was associated with CMV status and markers of occult replication, but also with changes in the duodenal and blood-translocated microbiota. Cytotoxic, but not IFN-γ-producing, Vδ1 T cells were negatively associated with cell-associated HIV-1 RNA in both the blood and duodenal compartments. The increase in Vδ1 T cells observed in people with HIV-1 has multiple triggers, particularly CMV and microbiota, and may in turn contribute to the control of the HIV-1 reservoir.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils have emerged as key players in tumor progression and are often associated with poor prognosis. Despite ongoing efforts to target neutrophil functions in cancer, therapeutic success has been limited. In this study, we addressed the possibility of blocking STAT3 signaling in neutrophils as a targeted therapeutic intervention in cancer. Conditional deletion of Stat3 in a neutrophil-specific manner (Ly6GcreStat3fl/fl mice) significantly impaired tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Neutrophils isolated from these mice exhibited a strong antitumoral phenotype, with increased MHCII, CD80/86 and ICAM-1 expression. Immune profiling of tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of these mice revealed significant enrichment of CD8+ T cells (granzymeBhi, perforinhi and IFN-γhi) with strong cytotoxic activity. To further translate these findings to human settings, we blocked STAT3 signaling in cancer patient neutrophils via the small molecule inhibitor LLL12 and assessed its effects on patient-derived tumor explants. In agreement with the in vivo mouse data, we observed the expansion and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in such explants. To test the therapeutic applicability of STAT3 targeting, we utilized myeloid cell-selective STAT3 antisense oligonucleotide (CpG-STAT3ASO) to target neutrophils in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Consistent with previous results, neutrophil-specific STAT3 knockdown impaired tumor growth and enhanced cytotoxic T cell activity in the tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of treated mice. These findings highlight STAT3 signaling as a deleterious pathway supporting the protumoral activity of neutrophils and suggest that neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition is a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy, providing novel insights into targeted therapeutic avenues.">

        <tr id="Aging significantly influences host immune responses to viral infections, including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV), which is associated with high mortality in elderly patients. Despite its high fatality rate and pandemic potential, effective therapies remain unavailable, and the age-dependent mechanisms underlying SFTSV pathogenesis are not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed a ferret model (an immunocompetent animal model that mimics human SFTSV infections) and performed multi-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing and histopathological analyses. Our results reveal that, upon SFTSV infection, aged ferrets experience extensive decrease of critical immune cells (particularly B and T cells) due to infection-induced cell death and excessive hemophagocytosis in hematopoietic organs, whereas young-adult ferrets rapidly clear the virus with minimal lymphocyte changes. Notably, aged ferrets display marked immune dysregulation, characterized by non-specific activation of T-bet ⁺ age-associated memory B cells (T-bet+ ABCs) and the proliferation of defective plasmablasts (MKI67 ⁺ PB1), which serve as major viral reservoirs and drive systemic viral dissemination. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that the MKI67 ⁺ PB1 subset dominates SFTSV⁺ cells in both aged ferrets and human fatal cases, exhibiting the highest per-cell viral UMI counts. Moreover, monocytes and macrophages in aged ferrets exhibit heightened inflammatory gene expression, contributing to the hyper-inflammatory state observed during infection. Collectively, these insights underscore the critical role of dysregulated memory B cell responses and hyper-inflammation in age-dependent SFTSV pathogenesis, highlighting potential targets for interventions in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) and glioblastoma (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors with limited treatment options. Macrophage phagocytosis is a complex, tightly regulated process governed by competing pro-phagocytic and anti-phagocytic signals. CD47-SIRPα signaling inhibits macrophage activity, while radiotherapy (RT) can enhance tumor immunogenicity. How RT and CD47 blockade together modulate macrophage “appetite” and activation states remains poorly understood, particularly in the context of glioma immune evasion and therapy resistance. Methods Human and mouse glioma cell lines were exposed to fractionated RT, anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, or both. Flow cytometry and ELISA quantified the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and expression of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In vitro, phagocytosis assays were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyze transcriptional changes in macrophage subsets that phagocytosed (“eaters”) or did not phagocytose (“non-eaters”) glioma cells. In vivo, efficacy of combination therapy was assessed using orthotopic xenograft and syngeneic mouse models of DMG and GBM. Results RT induced ICD in glioma cells, evidenced by dose-dependent increases in DAMPs such as phosphatidylserine, calreticulin, HSP70/90, and HMGB1. RT and anti-CD47 each promoted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, with a synergistic effect observed when combined. scRNA-seq of phagocytic macrophages revealed transcriptionally distinct subpopulations associated with each treatment, characterized by enrichment in inflammatory, metabolic, and antigen presentation pathways. In vivo, combination therapy significantly reduced tumor burden, extended survival, and polarized tumor-associated macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory (M1-like) phenotype. Distinct macrophage markers (CLEC7A, CD44, CD63) validated scRNA-seq findings in vivo. Conclusions This study highlights that macrophage fate is intimately linked to the molecular properties of what they phagocytose. Phagocytosis is not a singular, uniform process but a dynamic and context-dependent event that drives macrophage specialization and plasticity. By demonstrating that RT and anti-CD47 therapy shape distinct macrophage phenotypes through their effects on tumor immunogenicity, this study provides a framework for understanding how to harness and reprogram macrophage activity for therapeutic benefit. These findings underscore the potential of targeting macrophage plasticity as a strategy to enhance antitumor immunity and improve outcomes in malignant gliomas and other diseases.">

        <tr id="Comprehensive characterization of bovine immune cell populations is essential for improving animal welfare and disease resilience. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on over 29,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Angus cattle stratified by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), a proxy for the cellular immune response (Cell-IR). Unsupervised clustering identified major immune populations including CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Differential gene expression suggests that low Cell-IR cattle have in elevated NKT inflammatory response, while high Cell-IR cattle have increased CD8- γδ T cell and pro-inflammatory myeloid activity. Intercellular communication analysis using CellChat highlighted pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, particularly the IL-1β– IL-1R1 ligand-receptor interactions. This study provides a high-resolution atlas of Angus PBMCs and establishes a framework for linking immune cell composition with functional immune phenotypes in cattle.

        <tr id="CD8+ T play essential roles in antitumor immune responses. However, immunotherapy has limited clinical efficacy in many solid tumors. Here, we performed an epigenetic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in CD8+ T cells directly under cancer immunotherapy setting and found that Prdm12 is a transcriptional repressor implicated in nociceptive neuron development but uncharacterized within immunological contexts. Prdm12 deletion markedly enhanced in vivo tumor clearance of mouse CD8+ T cells and promoted activation, effector differentiation marker expression, and cytokine secretion in both murine and human CD8+ T cells in vitro. Mechanistically, Prdm12 deficiency augmented effector transcriptional programs while inhibiting exhaustion of CGRP-RAMP1 neuroimmune axis facilitation. Additionally, Prdm12 ablation remodeled the chromatin accessibility landscape, with H3K9me3 deposition at loci regulating T cell differentiation (Trib1 and Sgk1) and exhaustion (Rgs1 and Nr4a2). These results together reveal a negative regulatory mechanism for CD8+ T cells and advance our understanding of cancer immunotherapy by linking neurobiological signaling to immune regulation.">

DDR1 was consistently overexpressed in 21 cancer types, correlating with poor prognosis and reduced immune cell infiltration. Mechanistically, DDR1 promoted collagen remodeling, immune exclusion, and upregulated immunosuppressive pathways. Single-cell analysis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) revealed DDR1-high ductal cells associated with reduced cytotoxic T cell infiltration and increased regulatory T cell populations. Therapeutic blockade of DDR1 in an immunocompetent KPC mouse model of PDAC disrupted collagen architecture, enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration, and improved responses to chemotherapy, highlighting a direct link between DDR1 inhibition and immune reactivation. These findings establish DDR1 as a key mediator of collagen-driven immune resistance and a promising therapeutic target for overcoming immune exclusion, especially in PDAC and other collagen-rich solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) possess innate immunomodulatory properties, which can be significantly enhanced through co-culture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), making them attractive tools for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Methods Leveraging a multi-omics approach encompassing RNA sequencing, flow and mass cytometry, secretome analysis, completed by functional evaluations, we investigated the mechanisms underpinning PBMC conditioning of MSC in vitro and their benefits in an animal model of Myasthenia gravis. MSC derived from human adipose tissue were left untreated in resting state (rMSC), conditioned by PBMC (cMSC), or activated by the pro-inflammatory molecule interferon (IFN)-γ (γMSC), then compared for their gene expression profiles, phenotypes and functional capacities. Results RNA sequencing identified 244 differentially expressed genes in cMSC compared to rMSC, highlighting key immune mediators such as CCL2, CCL11, DPP4, ICAM1, IL6, PDCD1LG2, TNFRSF11B, TNIP1, TNIP3 and ZC3H12A and pinpointing genes involved in matrix remodeling, paracrine and autocrine communications. Comparatively, 2089 genes were differentially expressed between rMSC and γMSC, highlighting host defense, anti-viral response, NFκB signaling pathways modulated by IFN-γ. Flow and mass cytometry analyses revealed upregulation of the surface markers CD26, CD54, and CD273 and intracellular molecules IDO1 and PTGS2 in cMSC. In contrast, IFN-γ activation predominantly increased HLA-related markers while also enhancing the homogeneity of the populations. Together, these results underlined the treatment dependence of transcriptomic and phenotypic signatures. Secretome profiling identified 6 categories of modulated proteins, out of which 22 molecules potentially involved in PBMC conditioning and 40 implicated in cMSC-mediated immunomodulation. Functionally, cMSC induced modulation in PBMC subsets, raising the proportions of lymphocyte populations (CD4 Treg, CD8, B memory), underlining the multimodal effect of conditioning. Also, both a direct cell-cell contact and cMSC supernatants significantly suppressed activated T-cell proliferation in vitro. To confirm immunomodulation efficacy in vivo, cMSC were administrated to our humanized mouse model of Myasthenia Gravis and the treatment significantly halved disease severity from 2 weeks post-injection. Conclusions This integrative study establishes distinct conditioning signatures, suggests molecular mechanisms, and underscores the therapeutic potential of cMSC, offering a robust framework for advancing cell-based therapies in autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a major global health challenge due to its high incidence and mortality rates, emphasizing the critical need for innovative therapeutic strategies. IL-1R2, a member of the IL-1 receptor family, plays a pivotal role in both tumorigenesis and antitumor immunity. However, its precise role in tumor development and its impact on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy in CRC remain poorly understood. We examined tumor progression in wild-type and IL-1R2-deficient mice using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer model treated with combined ICIs therapy. Our findings revealed that IL-1R2 deficient mice exhibited a significant reduction in tumor burden, accompanied by alterations in the carcinogenic program and enhanced immunogenicity of tumor cells. Furthermore, the deletion of IL-1R2 resulted in an increased proportion of exhausted CD8+ T cells, a population commonly enriched for tumor antigen-specific T cells, suggesting an augmentation of tumor-specific immune responses. Moreover, IL-1R2 deletion upregulated genes linked to antigen presentation in dendritic cells, indicating enhanced activation of the adaptive immune system. Collectively, these findings position IL-1R2 as a promising therapeutic target for improving the efficacy of treatment strategies in CRC.

        <tr id="While human autopsy samples have provided insights into pulmonary immune mechanisms associated with severe viral respiratory diseases, the mechanisms that contribute to a clinically favorable resolution of viral respiratory infections remain unclear due to the lack of proper experimental systems. Using mice co-engrafted with a genetically matched human immune system and fetal lung xenograft (fLX), we mapped the immunological events defining successful resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues. Viral infection is rapidly cleared from fLX following a peak of viral replication, histopathological manifestations of lung disease and loss of AT2 program, as reported in human COVID-19 patients. Infection resolution is associated with the activation of a limited number of hematopoietic subsets, including inflammatory monocytes and CD3-expressing macrophage-like cells, which are highly enriched in viral RNA and dissipate upon infection resolution. Specific human fibroblast and endothelial subsets also elicit robust antiviral and monocyte chemotaxis signatures, respectively. Notably, systemic depletion of human CD4 + cells, but not CD3 + cells, significantly abrogates infection resolution in fLX and induces persistent infection, supporting the dominant role of peripheral CD4 + monocytes over T-cells in the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings unravel a comprehensive picture of the immunological events defining effective resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues, revealing markedly divergent immunological trajectories between resolving and fatal COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="Background: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is ominous in lung cancer patients. However, comprehensive studies of both innate and adaptive immune responses within the pleural tumor microenvironment remain limited. Methods: We collected samples from patients with heart failure and lung cancer-MPE. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we analyzed alternations in cancer cells, NK cells, DCs, and T cells. Key cytokines involving in cell-cell interactions were quantified using Luminex or ELISA, while HLA-E and aging markers were assessed via immunohistochemistry. Results: Our findings revealed that CD56⁺CD16⁺ and CD56⁻CD16⁻ NK cells exhibited reduced cytotoxicity, mainly through HLA-E-expressing senescent cancer cells interacting with NK cells inhibitory receptor, leading to NK cell dysfunction and reduced XCL2 expression, which might impair cDC1 recruitment. Consequently, aDC2 cells evolved into exhausted phenotype, resulting in inadequate T cell activation. In CD8 T cells, transcription factors such as FOXO1 contributed to diminished cytotoxicity. Despite presence of GZMA CD4 T cells, their cytotoxicity was suppressed in MPE. Th1-like and Th2-like regulatory T cells further inhibited CD4 T cell responses. Key molecules, CXCL16, BAG6, and IL-7, bridging innate and adaptive immunity conferred poor prognosis. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that senescent cancer cells promote immunoevasion through HLA-E, suppressing NK cell cytotoxicity, impairing DC function, and disrupting T cell activation. Cell-cell interaction and imbalanced Th1/Th2 contribute to microenvironmental remodeling, driving disease progression. These findings provide insights into the immunological landscape and therapeutic targets for intervention.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary PIAS1 is a protein that helps control how cells behave, including how they respond to signals that can lead to cancer. While it has been studied in cancer cells before, we wanted to know what it does in the cells around the tumor, the tumor microenvironment, where immune and other supporting cells live. We found that higher levels of PIAS1 in these surrounding cells were linked to better survival in patients with oral cancer. By studying individual cells from tumors, we saw that PIAS1 was often found in immune and support cells and seemed to help these cells fight cancer. When PIAS1 was missing, the cells showed signs of being more friendly to the tumor and less active in fighting it. Overall, PIAS1 appears to play an important role in helping the body’s own cells resist cancer and could be a useful target for future treatments.">

        <tr id="Multiple mechanisms of immunity must be coordinated to defend against a comprehensive range of pathogens; however, the mechanisms by which broad-spectrum antipathogens act remain largely elusive. Here, we employed systems biology approaches to understand the organization of human immune cells at the single-cell level, as well as their reorganization in response to K21, a silane derivative effective against viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. K21 induced pro-inflammatory pathways in M1 and M2c macrophages without altering cytokine secretion, decreased a specific subtype of M1 macrophages and CXCL4-induced M2-like macrophages, and improved mitochondrial health by enhancing mitochondrial recycling via mitophagy. Similar treatment of the in vivo model organism C. elegans induced mitophagy and extended lifespan, suggesting evolutionary conservation of mechanism. Our work demonstrates that a drug that remodels mitochondria and metabolism can shape the immune cell repertoire, which could aid the development of more effective antimicrobials and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Analyzing the antiviral response of natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes is essential to understanding vaccine protection in an immunized population facing SARS-CoV-2 variant breakthrough infections (BTIs). In this study, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections, we observed an increase in adaptive CD57+NKG2C+ NK cells and classical monocytes (CMs). Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that the transcriptomic profiles of IFN-induced IFIT3 and other IFN-stimulated genes exhibited marked upregulation in NK cells, defined as CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+IFIT3+ NK cells. Additionally, CM in the blood showed characteristics indicative of differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which further evidenced their potential antiviral functions. Our study indicates that a vaccinated population rapidly activates an antiviral innate immune response following a BTI, thus revealing a link to the control of viral replication during SARS-CoV-2 BTIs.">

        <tr id="Background and objective Melanoma exhibits profound biological complexity, driven by immune evasion, phenotypic plasticity, and resistance to therapy. While programmed cell death (PCD) shapes tumor–immune interactions, its mechanistic landscape in melanoma remains incompletely defined. This study aims to comprehensively characterize PCD-related signatures and their associations with tumor heterogeneity, prognosis, and immunotherapeutic outcomes. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing data from melanoma cohorts (cutaneous and acral subtypes) were used to assess PCD activity via AUCell-based scoring across major cell types. Cell-type–specific analyses examined heterogeneity, metabolic dependencies, and pathway correlations. Intercellular communication was analyzed using CellChat. Bulk RNA sequencing data were then integrated to identify PCD-related gene signatures, and machine learning models (LASSO, Ridge, XGBoost) were applied to develop a prognostic model. Immune infiltration, immunogenomic correlations, and immunotherapy responses were further evaluated using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, TMB, IPS, and external ICB-treated cohorts. Results Among all cell types, melanoma cells exhibited the highest PCD activation, with disulfidptosis, immunogenic cell death (ICD), and autosis being the most prominent. High PCD activity was linked to advanced clinical stage, lymphatic metastasis, and poor prognosis. Melanoma subpopulations with hyperactivated PCD displayed elevated copy number variation (CNV) burden, enhanced fibroblast/endothelial interactions, and invasive transcriptional profiles. A 15-gene prognostic signature was developed, effectively stratifying survival and immunotherapy response across multiple cohorts. Low-risk tumors demonstrated favorable immune infiltration (CD8+ T cells, M1 macrophages), higher tumor mutational burden (TMB), and greater immunogenicity, while high-risk tumors exhibited immune exclusion, cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) enrichment, and adverse mutations. Conclusion This study highlights the functional and clinical significance of PCD heterogeneity in melanoma and provides a validated prognostic model for patient stratification and therapeutic decision-making. These findings underscore the potential of targeting PCD dynamics as a novel approach in melanoma management.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic response demonstrated the effectiveness of adenovirus vector vaccines in inducing protective cellular and antibody responses. However, we still lack mechanistic understanding of the factors regulating immunity induced by this platform, especially innate pathways. We utilized a human tonsil organoid model to study the regulation of adaptive responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-ɑ was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-ɑ-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-ɑ and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells, including TFH. These data provide key insights into innate pathways regulating ChAdOx1-induced immunity and highlights the promise of this model for vaccine platform mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="To better understand the molecular mechanism that drives neuroinflammation, we analyzed the protein profiles of 27 brains from HIV with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART), including various stages of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and compared them to 9 HAND-negative controls. We found that most of the proteins that were increased—about 66.7%—were involved in immune response pathways. Of these, 23.3% were specifically related to type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, which remains active in the brain through both HIV-related and unrelated mechanisms. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on brain tissues collected during rapid autopsies from participants in the Last Gift cohort, we found that IFN-I signaling was especially strong in astrocytes, microglia (MG), and endothelial cells. In a mini-brain organoid model of acute HIV infection, IFN-I signaling was also highly active in astrocytes but less so in MG. Interestingly, IFN-I activation can happen without HIV being present—expression of human endogenous retrovirus-W1 (HERV-W1) Env can directly trigger this response in astrocytes, and it continues in glial cells even with effective ART. Together, our findings point to persistent IFN-I activation in glial and endothelial cells in the brain, which may contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive disorders in PWH on ART.">

        <tr id="Abstract Inflammation from the hematopoietic compartment is a critical driver of fibrosis and cytopenias in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). We previously demonstrated that tasquinimod ameliorates the MPN phenotype, reducing splenomegaly and normalizing fibrosis in a JAK2V617F‐driven preclinical model. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we now show that tasquinimod primarily targets the malignant JAK2V617F hematopoietic clone, particularly affecting megakaryocytes and monocytes. Tasquinimod downregulates pro‐proliferative pathways, MYC targets, and mTORC signaling, while increasing apoptosis in particularly in JAK2V617F mutant cells. Our data reveal that tasquinimod reverses TGFβ‐driven fibrotic reprogramming of megakaryocytes and monocytes. This reversal is crucial for mitigating the pro‐fibrotic interactions and signaling in the BM, thereby decreasing the activation of stromal cells. Coculture experiments confirm that direct interaction between JAK2V617F hematopoietic cells and mesenchymal stromal cells upregulates S100A8 in stromal cells, independent of TGFβ alone. In line, genetic ablation of S100A9 in the hematopoietic but not stromal compartment significantly improves the MPN phenotype and normalizes BM fibrosis. Our data highlight the hematopoietic origin of the inflammatory signals driving fibrosis. These insights pave the way for potential therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory signaling pathways in MPN to mitigate fibrosis and improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="CD45 plays a central role in immune signal regulation by controlling the spatial dynamics of phosphatase activity through steric segregation of its bulky rigid extracellular domain. To modulate CD45 activity, here we develop and characterize protein engineering approaches to induce multivalent clustering of CD45, effectively mimicking the endogenous local receptor sequestration during immune synapse formation. In doing so, we engineer a biologic that enables precise, tunable control over CD45 surface localization and activity. CD45 sequestration exhibited striking synergy when administered in combination with intratumorally anchored IL-12 therapy, markedly delaying tumor progression and extending survival in syngeneic murine melanoma and carcinoma models. Immune profiling revealed that CD8+ T cells are essential mediators of this synergistic antitumor response. Mechanistically, IL-12 initiates a wave of antigen generation and T cell priming, while CD45 sequestration subsequently enhances tumor-specific CD8+ T cell activation, expansion, and functional states within the tumor-draining lymph node. These findings suggest that CD45 sequestration lowers the activation threshold of T cells, broadens the tumor-reactive T cell repertoire, and therefore promotes more robust tumor-specific T cell responses. Altogether, we establish CD45 as a promising novel target for cancer immunotherapy, capable of potentiating strong anticancer immune responses.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial part of the innate immune system and serve as an important effector for killing tumor cells through direct cytolytic activity or immunomodulatory signaling to T cells and antigen presenting cells. NK cells are correlated with increased tumor control and better overall patient survival across various types of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite their promising potential for anti-tumor killing, NK cell function is often diminished within the tumor microenvironment. There are many factors that lead to decreased tumor-infiltrating NK cell killing, including immunoinhibitory factors from tumor cells and resident tissues, acquired immune tolerance, NK cell exhaustion, and the hypoxic state of the tumor microenvironment. Unleashing NK cell activity therefore has high potential to create a new class of immunotherapy that could combat both primary and acquired resistance to current checkpoint inhibitors. In this review we discuss mechanistic details of NK cell tumor killing, NK cell immunosuppression, and gaps in knowledge regarding highly complex microenvironment-specific effects on NK cell function. We also discuss the promise and limitations of emerging NK-cell based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Viral and bacterial lung infections place a significant burden on public health. Versican, an extracellular matrix (ECM) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, coordinates the innate immune response in multiple experimental models. Versican’s potential as an immunomodulatory molecule makes it a promising therapeutic target for controlling the host’s immune response to lung infection. However, versican’s contribution to lung inflammation, injury, and immune cell activity during influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a critical knowledge gap. To address our central hypothesis that mesenchymal-derived versican is pro-inflammatory and enhances the innate immune response to IAV infection, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse deficient in mesenchymal-derived versican (B6. Col1a2-CreERT+/−/Vcantm1.1Cwf, Col1a2/Vcan−/−). We report that mesenchymal-derived versican plays a critical role in neutrophil, monocyte, and dendritic cell migration into the lungs and airways early in IAV infection. Intriguingly, mesenchymal-derived versican deficiency had the most substantial negative impact on neutrophil emigration into the lungs. We found that neutrophils were less adhesive to the ECM of Col1a2/Vcan−/− mouse lung fibroblasts (mLFs), which had a significant decrease in versican compared to wild-type mLFs. Additionally, Col1a2/Vcan−/− mLFs treated with poly(I:C) in vitro have reduced cell-associated hyaluronan. These findings suggest that fibroblast-derived versican is necessary for adhesion to lung fibroblasts by neutrophils as they transit into the lung interstitium and airways from the pulmonary vasculature. Our findings demonstrate that mesenchymal-derived versican is a key regulator of the early host immune responses to IAV.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a global health crisis complicated by immune dysregulation and T cell exhaustion. CD39, an ectonucleotidase generating immunosuppressive adenosine, is implicated in cancer and chronic infections, yet its spatiotemporal role in TB pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Multiple publicly available datasets were utilized to evaluate CD39 across TB disease stages, diverse infectious diseases and anti-TB treatment. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated via ROC curves and combined signature analysis. Immune cell infiltration were analyzed using CIBERSORTx. Cytokine profiles and age-stratified associations were examined. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by GSEA. Single-cell analysis of non-human primate granulomas assessed CD39’s temporal dynamics, utilizing Monocle 3 for CD39+ T-cell trajectory analysis. Results CD39 was upregulated in active TB patients versus TB infection (TBI) and healthy controls (HC), correlating with older age, disease severity, and distinct expression patterns compared to other respiratory and systemic infections. CD39 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy over IFN-γ in distinguishing TB from TBI/HC and other respiratory diseases. Combining CD39 with TBX21 or GZMB further improved diagnostic specificity. High CD39 expression correlated with suppressed Th1 and elevated Th2/Th17/regulatory cytokines, alongside pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Age-stratified analysis revealed complex age-dependent associations of CD39 expression with various immune cell types. Single-cell analysis revealed declining CD39 transcriptional activity during prolonged infection despite expanded cellular distribution, linked to early T cell maturation followed by broader immunomodulatory shifts. Decreased CD39 expression with anti-TB treatment correlated with improved immune cell balance and resolved T cell exhaustion. Conclusion CD39 is a critical regulator of immune exhaustion and neutrophil-driven inflammation in TB, with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Targeting CD39 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for TB.">

To better understand the tumor microenvironment (TME), we analyze single-cell RNA-seq (~189 K cells) from 36 metastatic melanoma samples, defining 14 cell types, 55 subtypes, and 15 transcriptional hallmarks of malignant cells. Correlations between cell subtype proportions reveal six distinct clusters, with a mature dendritic cell subtype enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDC) linked to naive T and B cells. Importantly, mregDC abundance predicts progression-free survival (PFS) with ICIs and other therapies, especially when combined with the TCF7 + /– CD8 T cell ratio. Analysis of an independent cohort (n = 318) validates mregDC as a predictive biomarker for anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapies. Further characterization of mregDCs versus conventional dendritic cells (cDC1/cDC2) highlights their unique transcriptional, epigenetic (single-nucleus ATAC-seq data for cDCs from 14 matched samples), and interaction profiles, offering new insights for improving immunotherapy response and guiding future combination treatments.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The strong regulatory T cell (Treg) inhibitory activity and dysfunctional cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) represent major barriers to effective antitumor immunity, particularly in late-stage cancer. Multiple anti-OX40 (aOX40) agonistic antibodies have been developed but exhibit limited antitumor efficacy. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) effectivity expands CTLs but has severe side effects. Methods We construct an aOX40-mIL2-Fc bispecific antibody through Fab physical blocking and attenuated IL-2 with Rβ reducing N88D mutation. We also produced aOX40-Fc and IL-2/aOX40-Fc as a comparison using the 293F expression system. Single-cell and flow cytometry were used to analyze the change of T-cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Mouse tumor models were used to assess the antitumor efficacy of aOX40-mIL2-Fc by tumor growth and survival, and toxicity by body weight loss, inflammatory cytokine production, and natural killer (NK) cell proliferation in the blood. The tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned, and the average size was similar among various groups. Results aOX40-mIL2-Fc bispecific antibody-cytokine exhibited a synergistic therapeutic effect with limited toxicity, outperforming IL-2-Fc or aOX40 alone treatment, and conferring resistance to tumor rechallenge. On cellular mechanisms, aOX40-mIL2-Fc treatment showed great Treg depletion and increased both stem-like and effector functional terminal CD8+ T cells in the TME, while avoiding NK cells expansion in the periphery. Furthermore, this bispecific antibody remarkably improved the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapeutic effect. Conclusions Our study unveils a novel approach to IL-2 design that addresses several critical shortcomings of existing strategies and elucidates the cellular mechanisms underlying aOX40-mIL2-Fc therapy. Meanwhile, combining aOX40-mIL2-Fc with PD-L1 blockade represents a strategic approach to enhance tumor control and overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapies synergistically.">

        <tr id="While lymphoid progenitors have demonstrated unexpected plasticity in vivo, their differentiation into myeloid cells under in vitro conditions has been largely dismissed as an artifact or biologically irrelevant. Consequently, the functional properties of these cells remain poorly characterized. In this study, we show that cultured common lymphoid progenitors (cCLPs) differentiate into CD11b⁺CD115⁺ monocytic cells (cCLP-Ms) via IL-6-C/EBPβ signaling. Molecular and phenotypic analyses revealed that cCLP-Ms acquire essential features of myeloid cells, including innate immune sensor expression and phagocytic capacity, while retaining unique characteristics distinct from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), such as reduced MHC class II expression and TNF-α production. Functionally, cCLP-Ms exhibit immunoregulatory properties, effectively suppressing IgE-mediated cutaneous allergic inflammation upon adoptive transfer. These findings highlight the plasticity of lymphoid progenitors and establish a robust platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying myeloid differentiation. This system deepens our understanding of hematopoietic cell lineage flexibility and offers a foundation for exploring therapeutic applications in immune regulation and inflammation.">

        <tr id="Cancer therapies that induce immunogenic cell death such as necroptosis can arm the immune system to clear residual tumor cells. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) signaling can trigger necroptosis, orchestrating immune responses to solid tumors. Whether RIPK3 activity can be exploited for controlling B cell malignancies remains unclear. Here, we establish a strategy to manipulate RIPK3 activity in malignant B cells and promote immune-mediated tumor control. By controlling and visualizing RIPK3 signaling using intravital imaging, we established that RIPK3 activation promoted apoptosis and rapid macrophage engulfment but failed to induce necroptosis due to limited MLKL expression in B-lineage cells. RIPK3-induced cell death could be diverted toward necroptosis with type I IFN and caspase inhibition. Exploiting these findings, we showed that a combination therapy activating RIPK3 with SMAC mimetics while suppressing caspase activity and providing type I IFN resulted in immune-mediated control of B cell tumors. Hence, reprogramming RIPK3 activity represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity to target B cell malignancies.">

        <tr id="Although checkpoint immunotherapy has primarily focused on CD8⁺ T cells, emerging evidence highlights an important role for cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in mediating therapeutic responses. However, research on the functional properties of cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in the context of immunotherapy is still at an early stage and remains insufficiently defined. Utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets obtained from metastatic melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, we performed transcriptomic profiling of conventional CD4⁺ T cells, excluding proliferative and regulatory (FOXP3⁺) subsets, and compared responders and non-responders as distinct groups. Importantly, our analysis identified distinct clusters that discriminate between responders and non-responders, with cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells occupying a central position within these clusters. In responder-specific clusters, cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells exhibited features of early activation, whereas clusters specific to non-responders were characterized by an exhausted phenotype. Notably, non-responder-specific clusters were positioned proximally to Treg-like clusters, suggesting a potential transition from cytotoxic to regulatory CD4⁺ T cell states in non-responders. Our findings reinforce the emerging concept that cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells play a central role in mediating immunotherapy responses. These results provide a foundation for the development of predictive biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating CD4⁺ T cell differentiation.

        <tr id="Abstract CD4+ tissue‐resident memory T (TRM) cells are essential for immune protection in the lungs, providing rapid responses against respiratory pathogens. Unlike circulating memory T cells, CD4+ TRM cells persist in the tissue parenchyma and possibly inducible lymphoid tissues, where they facilitate pathogen clearance through cytokine production and interactions with local immune cells. While CD8+ TRM cells are well studied, the role of CD4+ TRM cells in immunity remains less defined and is the focus of this review. Distinct subsets, based on the effector TH1, TH2, TH17 and T follicular helper (TFH)‐like tissue‐resident helper (TRH) cells, contribute to antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and vaccine‐induced immunity. CD4+ TRM cells play a key role in infections, enhancing immune responses and supporting antibody production. However, they are also implicated in chronic inflammation, allergies and fibrosis. Given their importance, vaccines aiming to elicit lung‐resident CD4+ TRM cells, particularly via mucosal delivery, have shown promise in inducing long‐term protective immunity. Intranasal vaccination strategies, such as live‐attenuated influenza virus and tuberculosis vaccines, have successfully generated CD4+ TRM cells, highlighting their potential for respiratory pathogen control. In this review, we focus on CD4+ TRM cells, their differentiation, maintenance and role, especially in the lungs.">

        <tr id="Tumor immunosuppression remains a major barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy and is often driven by the immunoregulatory activities of innate immune cells, such as myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Myeloid populations—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—play pivotal roles in dampening anti-tumor immune responses and promoting tumor progression. Recent advances in our understanding of myeloid cell biology have unveiled new therapeutic opportunities to disrupt these immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with tumor inflammation. This review highlights key signaling pathways and surface molecules involved in myeloid-mediated immune suppression, including CSF1R, PI3Kγ, mTOR, Syk, MerTK/Axl, and immune checkpoints such as Trem2, LILRBs, VISTA, and CD40. We examine preclinical and clinical findings that support targeting these pathways to reprogram the TME and enhance anti-tumor immunity. By integrating insights from mechanistic studies and therapeutic development, this review underscores the potential of myeloid cell-targeting strategies as promising adjuncts to current cancer immunotherapies. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges in translating these approaches into durable clinical benefit.">

        <tr id="Background: Bone marrow serves as a source and reservoir of immune cells and plays a critical role in central nervous system diseases. Nociceptive neurons are widely distributed in the bone marrow, but their post-infarction changes and immunological functions remain largely unexplored. Methods: A mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and human skull bone marrow samples from stroke patients were analyzed. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling was manipulated via receptor knockout and targeted nanoparticle delivery. Immune responses were evaluated primarily through flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and single-cell RNA sequencing. Results: Activation of nociceptive neurons after cerebral infarction promoted myeloid-biased hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and increased infiltration of myeloid cells into brain tissue, resulting in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. This regulatory mechanism was mediated by CGRP, which enhanced the proliferation and mobilization of downstream myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), ultimately improving stroke outcomes. To overcome the hypotensive side effects of CGRP, we employed aged neutrophil membrane-coated nanoparticles for its targeted delivery to bone marrow, achieving sustained release and enhanced efficacy. Conclusion: Nociceptive neurons critically modulate post-stroke bone marrow immune responses by releasing CGRP and activating MDSC. Targeted CGRP delivery to bone marrow represents a promising strategy to suppress neuroinflammation and improve neurological recovery after cerebral infarction.">

        <tr id="Introduction Macrophages play fundamental roles in immune regulation and tissue homeostasis, serving as one of the primary cell types that orchestrate tissue repair after injury. MiR-210 is a hypoxia-inducible, small non-coding RNA involved in regulating metabolic adaptation and inflammatory responses during normal repair processes. However, its role in macrophage polarization is not fully understood. Here, we report the impact of miR-210 deletion on macrophage polarization towards a pro-reparatory phenotype. Methods Bone marrow-derived macrophages were obtained from miR-210 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice and polarized toward the pro-reparative M2 phenotype. The transcriptomic profile of these cells, as well as their phagocytic capacity, cell energy phenotype, and cytokine production were assessed to determine the impact of miR-210 on the macrophage polarization process into a M2-like phenotype. Results Compared with their WT counterparts, miR-210 KO M0 macrophages presented a reduced glycolytic activity and a diminished metabolic flexibility. However, miR-210 KO cells exhibited increased phagocytosis in both M0 and M2 states, potentially as an adaptive response to their metabolic limitations. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct clustering between the M0 and M2 states, along with several notable differences in the transcriptional patterns between the two genotypes. Analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated an increased pro-inflammatory state in resting miR-210 KO macrophages compared to WT control cells. These data were further confirmed by the higher levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1b secreted by miR-210 KO M0 macrophages compared to WT cells. Analysis of the biological processes activated during the polarization process towards the M2 phenotype revealed an incomplete polarization of miR-210 KO cells, which may be attributed, at least in part, to reduced activation of mitotic regulators, leading to slower cell cycle progression and diminished proliferation. Discussion Our data offers new insights into the role of miR-210 in promoting a macrophage shift toward the anti-inflammatory, pro-reparative M2 phenotype. The fine-tuned involvement of miR-210 in immune responses may have potential implications for chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and tissue repair.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Naïve T cells are maintained in a quiescent state prior to activation. As inappropriate T‐cell activation can lead to impaired immune tolerance and autoimmune diseases, the transition from quiescence to activation must be under strict regulation. Despite its importance, the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of the quiescent state remain incompletely understood. Methods and Results Through multi‐omics integration analysis, we reveal that INPP4B, a phosphatase of the phosphoinositide 3‐kinase pathway, is highly expressed specifically in T cells and is involved in suppressing T‐cell activation and maintaining quiescence. Our findings uncover that INPP4B forms a T‐cell‐specific chromatin interaction domain and exhibits high expression levels in quiescent T cells. Upon T‐cell activation, both the chromatin interaction and expression levels of INPP4B decrease. Functional studies further confirm that INPP4B suppresses T‐cell activation and effector functions. Additionally, we observe increased expression level of INPP4B in exhausted T cells within the tumour microenvironment. Conclusion These results highlight the importance of maintaining optimal levels of INPP4B for T‐cell function. Our findings suggest that INPP4B could be a potential target for enhancing the efficacy of T‐cell‐mediated immune responses against tumours. Key points A comprehensive multi‐omics analysis characterizes the expression patterns of INPP4B across immune populations. INPP4B exhibits a T‐cell‐specific expression domain and functions as a T cell activation suppressor. INPP4B is significantly upregulated in exhausted T cells within the tumour microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Background CD24 plays a crucial role not only in promoting tumor progression and metastasis but also in modulating macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity. However, its impact on the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the role of CD24a, the murine CD24 gene, in tumor progression and TME immune dynamics in a murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model. Methods Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 knockout technology was employed to generate CD24a knockout in the murine TNBC cell line 4T1. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the immune cell populations, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer cells, T cells, and macrophages, within tumors, spleens, and bone marrow in the orthotopic mouse 4T1 breast cancer model. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to detect the immune cells in tumor sections. High-speed confocal was used to perform three-dimensional (3D) mapping of immune cells in the 4T1 orthotopic tumors. Results Knocking out CD24a significantly reduced tumor growth kinetics and prolonged mouse survival in vivo. Flow cytometry and IF analysis of tumor samples revealed that CD24a loss significantly promoted the infiltration of M1 macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells into the TME while reducing the recruitment and expansion of granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSCs). In vitro coculture experiments showed that CD24a deficiency significantly enhanced macrophage‐mediated phagocytosis and CD8⁺ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, effects that were partially reversed by re‐expression of CD24a. Moreover, in vivo depletion of macrophages and CD8+ T cells reverted the delayed tumor growth caused by CD24a knockout, underscoring their critical role in tumor growth suppression associated with CD24a knockout. 3D mapping of immune cells in the TME confirmed the anti-tumor immune landscape in the CD24a knockout 4T1 tumors. Furthermore, in vitro analysis showed that CD24a loss upregulated macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression while suppressed levels of CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL10, chemokines known to recruit gMDSCs, further providing a molecular basis for enhanced macrophage recruitment and diminished gMDSC accumulation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that CD24a may regulate immune suppression within the TNBC TME. Targeting CD24a enhances macrophage- and CD8⁺ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and is associated with a shift in the TME toward a more immunogenic state, thereby suppressing tumor growth. These results may support CD24 as a promising immunotherapeutic target for TNBC.

However, its additional role in shaping immune responses via regulation of inflammatory and myeloid cell responses is not yet fully understood. This work further characterized the multifaceted role of BRD4 in anti-tumor immunity. NanoString gene expression analysis of EMT6 tumors treated with a BRD4 inhibitor identified a reduction in myeloid gene expression signatures. Additionally, BRD4 inhibition significantly reduced myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the spleens and tumors of mice in multiple tumor models and also decreased the release of tumor-derived MDSC growth and chemotactic factors. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRD4 in MDSC induced apoptosis and modulated expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins. A BRD4-myeloid specific knockout model suggested that the dominant mechanism of MDSC reduction after BRD4 inhibition was primarily through a direct effect on MDSC. BRD4 inhibition enhanced anti-PD-L1 therapy in the EMT6, 4T1, and LLC tumor models, and the efficacy of the combination treatment was dependent on CD8+ T cells and on BRD4 expression in the myeloid compartment. These results identify BRD4 as a regulator of MDSC survival and provide evidence to further investigate BRD4 inhibitors in combination with immune based therapies.">

        <tr id="By balancing immunity and tolerance, dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of immune responses. Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of these cells in connective tissue diseases. Conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) exhibit distinct contributions to disease progression. In systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, pDCs primarily drive pathogenesis via excessive type I interferon production, whereas in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cDCs play a major role in promoting autoreactive T cell activation. Emerging DC subsets, such as inflammatory DC3s and LAMP3+ DCs, have been implicated in RA synovitis. In vasculitis, tissue-resident vascular DCs appear to regulate localized inflammation. Despite advances in single-cell analysis, the functional roles of specific DC subsets remain underexplored in several autoimmune conditions. Understanding DC heterogeneity and function in disease-specific contexts may lead to novel therapeutic strategies targeting DC-mediated immune dysregulation.">

        <tr id="Background The immune-balancing role of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) is well-recognized in contexts of immune dysregulation. Within the anti-tumor context, Tα1 demonstrated to act as an immune-enhancer, with potential roles in immunotherapy-based treatments. However, Tα1 immunomodulatory potential on tumor cells is poorly understood. Additionally, Tα1 pleiotropic effects on immune cells require in-depth investigations to unravel its specific impact on different immune cell populations. Thus, we first aimed to investigate whether Tα1 treatments influenced the transcriptional immune profile of various cancer cell lines. Alongside, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, B, and natural killer cells from healthy donors (HDs) were treated individually with Tα1, to assess its direct effects on each immune cell population. Methods Cutaneous melanoma, glioblastoma, and pleural mesothelioma cell lines and HD immune cell subsets were treated with Tα1 for 48 hours. Total RNA was subsequently isolated, and gene expression profiles were analyzed by the nCounter® SPRINT Profiler. Genes with a log2ratio ≥0.58 and ≤−0.58 in Tα1-treated vs untreated cells were defined as differentially expressed (DEGs) and subsequently evaluated for the enrichment of Gene Ontology terms to identify biological processes potentially affected by Tα1 in tumor and immune cells. Results Tα1 minimally changed cancer cell DEGs and immune-related biological processes, suggesting a comprehensive lack of transcriptional immunomodulatory potential on the tumor counterpart. Conversely, Tα1 exhibited to directly affect the proliferation and/or transcription processes of each studied immune cell subset, with the greatest transcriptional impact observed for activated CD8+ T cells, crucial players in anti-tumor immunity. Conclusion Our findings question the tumor immunomodulatory properties of Tα1, simultaneously underscoring the importance of further investigating Tα1 influence on specific immune cell subsets in the periphery or within the tumor microenvironment of cancer patients. This would contribute to understand Tα1 potential in immunotherapy-based combination strategies, within the anti-tumor setting.">

        <tr id="Lupus nephritis (LN), a serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), involves complex immune dysregulation that leads to chronic renal inflammation and progressive tissue damage. Despite decades of use of standard immunosuppressive therapy, treatment responses remain variable, and many patients experience relapses or develop end-stage renal disease. This review synthesizes emerging insights into the immunopathogenesis of LN, drawing on studies from single-cell transcriptomics, signaling pathway analyses and renal tissue immunology. It examines the role of both innate and adaptive immune cells in mediating disease. The therapeutic landscape is rapidly evolving with novel biologics targeting B cell survival and cytokine signaling, small-molecule inhibitors modulating intracellular pathways, and promising developments in cell-based interventions. Notably, recent clinical case series have demonstrated that CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy can induce durable drug-free remission in LN, representing a transformative approach to immune modulation. These advances are further supported by the application of multi-omics platforms to refine biomarker-driven disease monitoring and personalized treatment. Integrating immunologic and technological innovations holds the potential to redefine therapeutic strategies in LN. Precision medicine approaches that leverage targeted therapies, immune resetting modalities, and biomarker-guided clinical decisions may significantly improve long-term renal outcomes and patient quality of life.">

        <tr id="Background HIV-1 controllers are a rare population of individuals that exhibit spontaneous control of HIV-1 infection without antiretroviral therapy. Understanding the mechanisms by which HIV-1 controllers maintain and eventually lose this ability would be highly valuable in HIV-1 cure or vaccine research. Previous work revealed the ability of CD8+ T cells isolated from HIV-1 controllers to suppress HIV-1 replication in matched CD4+ T cells and PBMCs ex vivo and suggested the loss of control may be tied to CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Results We explored whether CD8+ T cell exhaustion plays a role in the maintenance and loss of control by examining immune characteristics of HIV-1 persistent controllers and transient controllers who lost control within the duration of the study. Using flow cytometry, we analyzed exhaustion marker expression on CD8+ T cells from HIV-1 controllers and determined that they maintain a unique exhaustion profile as compared to people without HIV-1 and HIV-1 standard progressors. The low level of T cell exhaustion seen in HIV-1 controllers was reversed when these individuals lost control and showed increased viral loads. Combinatorial immune checkpoint blockade targeting exhaustion markers was able to restore ex vivo control in CD8+ T cells from former controllers. Conclusions These results suggest that CD8+ T cell exhaustion compromises the ability to control viral replication in HIV-1 controllers. The character of exhaustion in response to HIV-1 and therapy is distinct in HIV-1 persistent controllers, transient controllers and standard progressors.">

        <tr id="Background Ovarian cancer exhibits striking metastatic tropism for the omentum, where lipid-laden macrophages are key mediators that fuel disease progression. However, the mechanisms governing their formation and pro-metastatic functions remain poorly understood. As extracellular vesicles (EVs) have as critical regulators of tumor-stroma crosstalk in metastatic niches, we sought to define how ovarian cancer-derived EVs orchestrate macrophages and adipocytes, and their impact on omental metastasis, aiming to explore potential therapeutic interventions. Results Single-cell transcriptomics of ovarian cancer revealed a distinct lipid-laden macrophage population in omentum, whose abundance correlated with metastatic burden and poor survival. Proteomics revealed that EVs from highly metastatic ovarian cancer cells were enriched in lipid metabolism regulators. In vivo experiments demonstrated that these tumor-derived vesicles mediated macrophage reprogramming, driving the acquisition of a pro-metastatic phenotype. Quantitative lipidomic profiling and lipid staining approaches confirmed the progressive lipid-laden in EV-treated macrophages. Using a patient-derived omentum-macrophage co-culture system, we demonstrated that tumor-derived EVs stimulate lipid release from omental adipocytes, which macrophages subsequently internalize through CD36-dependent uptake to drive lipid accumulation. This metabolic reprogramming culminated in cellular senescence, as evidenced by classical biomarkers including SA-β-galactosidase activity, elevated p16-INK4A and p53 levels, and the development of a matrix metalloproteinase-enriched senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Immunohistochemistry of clinical specimens demonstrated overexpression of CD36 correlated with omental metastasis and poor survival in ovarian cancer. In vivo experiments demonstrated that CD36 inhibition and senolytic therapy attenuated omental metastasis. Conclusions This study unveils an EV-driven mechanism of adipose tropism in ovarian cancer metastasis, where EVs promote the formation of senescent lipid-laden macrophages via CD36-mediated lipid uptake, remodeling the metastatic niche. Targeting CD36 and senescent cells offers a promising therapeutic strategy against omental metastasis.

        <tr id="The tumour microenvironment (TME) is a complex and dynamic environment containing diverse cellular, stromal and soluble factors, that collectively influence cancer progression, immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Among the immune components of the TME, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells are key players, whose interactions, particularly their crosstalk, critically shape anti-tumour immunity. The macrophage–NK cell interplay can either promote or suppress immune responses depending on the context, representing both a challenge and a therapeutic opportunity. NK cells are key effectors capable of recognising and eliminating malignant cells without prior sensitisation, whereas macrophages exhibit remarkable plasticity, functioning as either promoters or suppressors of tumour immunity depending on their activation state. This review focuses on current strategies to harness macrophages in cancer therapy, including phenotype repolarisation, selective depletion, and disruption or enhancement of the macrophage-NK cell crosstalk to enhance NK cell-mediated tumour surveillance. Finally, we highlight emerging technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and proteomics, as powerful tools to elucidate the dynamic interplay between macrophages and NK cells and inform the next generation of immunotherapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the worst pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Studies have shown that severe COVID-19 patients have immune dysfunction. To characterize the dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq and scV(D)J-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from mild, moderate, and severe patients. We observed that as the severity of the disease increased, several CD8 + T cell subsets and Treg cells continued to decrease, while CD4 + T subsets, natural killer cells and plasma cells continued to increase. Several aberrantly expressed biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity were identified. For example, RPS26 was down-regulated, while the ZFP36, IL-32, and IgM genes were up-regulated with increasing disease severity. Functional analysis showed multiple immune-related pathways, such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-10 production pathways, were dysregulated. As the disease severity increased, intercellular interactions fluctuated. Particularly, naive CD8 + T cells regulated memory and activated CD8 + T cells, and the weakening in Treg cells’ regulation of other immune cells was especially obvious. The expression of the MIF signaling pathway, mediated by CD74 + CXCR4, was higher throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection and the intensity of immune cell-cell interactions mediated by TGF-β was enhanced from mild to severe. Subsequently, scV(D)J-seq analysis showed a decreasing trend in the number of clonotypes, repertoire diversity and clonotypes overlap of monoclonal B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) as the SARS-CoV-2 progresses. The CDR3 sequence length in COVID-19-specific clonotypes showed a bias towards being longer as the severity of COVID-19 increases. Our findings may provide new clues for understanding COVID-19 immunopathogenesis and help identify optimal biomarkers for new therapeutic strategies.

Endomyocardial biopsies from these patients also show GBP-associated inflammasome overexpression. While both factors are implicated in ICI-M pathophysiology, their interplay and cellular targets remain poorly characterized. Our aim was to elucidate how ICI-M-associated cytokines affect the viability and inflammatory responses of endothelial cells (ECs) and cardiomyocytes (CMs) using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived models. ECs and CMs were differentiated from the same hiPSC line derived from a healthy donor. Cells were exposed either to IFN-γ alone or to an inflammatory cytokine cocktail (CCL5, GZMB, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α). We assessed large-scale transcriptomic changes via microarray and evaluated inflammatory, apoptotic, and cell death pathways at cellular and molecular levels. hiPSC-ECs were highly sensitive to cytokine exposure, displaying significant mortality and marked transcriptomic changes in immunity- and inflammation-related pathways. In contrast, hiPSC-CM showed limited transcriptional changes and reduced susceptibility to cytokine-induced death. In both cell types, cytokine treatment upregulated key components of the inflammasome pathway, including regulators (GBP5, GBP6, P2X7, NLRC5), a core component (AIM2), and the effector GSDMD. Increased GBP5 expression and CASP-1 cleavage mirrored the findings found elsewhere in endomyocardial biopsies from ICI-M patients. This hiPSC-based model reveals a distinct cellular sensitivity to ICI-M-related inflammation, with endothelial cells showing heightened vulnerability. These results reposition endothelial dysfunction, rather than cardiomyocyte injury alone, as a central mechanism in ICI-induced myocarditis. Modulating endothelial inflammasome activation, particularly via AIM2 inhibition, could offer a novel strategy to mitigate cardiac toxicity while preserving antitumor efficacy.">

We first discuss the evolution of brain-immune concepts, from early notions of immune privilege to modern understandings of brain-border immune niches (meninges, choroid plexus, and perivascular spaces). These compartments serve as critical interfaces where peripheral immune cells interact with CNS-resident immune cells. We then analyze the roles of specific immune cell subsets (e.g., T/B cells, myeloid cells and microglia) in disease progression, highlighting their functional heterogeneity across different MS subtypes. Furthermore, we highlight emerging MS immunotherapies-including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T regimens, mesenchymal stem cell interventions, microbiome modulation, and nanodelivery systems, which strategically target mechanistic nodes spanning neuroimmune niche regulation, inflammatory cascade blockade, and CNS neurorestorative capacities.">

        <tr id="Both intrinsic and microenvironmental factors contribute to the genesis and progression of leukemia. Dendritic cells (DCs) are important members of the immunomicroenvironment. The immature DCs (imDCs) and regulatory DCs (DCregs) participate in the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that play adverse role in tumor progression. However, the characteristics of DCs in leukemia microenvironment have not been well established. Here, we identified a novel CD11c+MHCIIlo DC population (T-DC) accumulated in the mouse splenic T-ALL microenvironment. T-DCs exhibited an immature phenotype as they were characterized by low expression of MHCII molecules and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD86, CD83 and CD40. Database analysis revealed that low level expression of DC maturation-associated genes correlated with poor prognosis in leukemia patients. Furthermore, T-DCs promoted T-ALL progression contributed by their attenuated phagocytosis and CD4+ T cell activation potential. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that T-DCs expressed low level of genes related to maturation and antigen processing. T-DCs showed similar expression pattern with DCregs and expressed high levels of immunosuppressive genes. In addition, single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated the heterogeneity of T-DCs, showing that they are mainly compose of cDC1s, cDC2s and macrophage-like DCs. Therefore, our findings uncover the critical role of a novel imDC subset in promoting leukemia progression through the suppression of T-cell immunity. These results may have significant implications for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies aiming at reversing immune evasion in leukemia and improving patient outcomes.">

Anti-insulin germinal center B cells are uniquely able to present pathogenic insulin epitopes and drive anti-insulin T cells to adopt a T follicular helper fate. T cell expression of BCL6, a key transcriptional repressor in the germinal center response, is essential for spontaneous diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. However, the impact of T cells on pro-pathogenic anti-insulin B cell activity is still poorly understood. Here, we show that VH125SD.NOD mice with T cell loss of BCL6 still produce peripheral anti-insulin B cells yet are protected against diabetes (relative to Bcl6-sufficient controls). This protection was associated with reduced activation, proliferation, germinal center differentiation, and pancreatic infiltration of insulin-binding B cells. Minimally supervised analysis revealed insulin-binding B cells skew towards atypical memory B cell subsets specifically in pancreas and pancreatic lymph nodes, which was reduced by Bcl6ΔCD4 loss. Overall, this work suggests BCL6-expressing T cells are pivotal to license pathogenic insulin-binding B cells. Our findings support BCL6 inhibition as a promising T1D immunotherapy, even after insulin autoimmunity is established in the B cell repertoire.">

        <tr id="Gasdermin D (GSDMD), an effector molecule of cell pyroptosis, is known to be activated in various cells during inflammation. However, the patterns of GSDMD activation in immune regulatory cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) remain unclear. In this study, we found that neutrophils in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues exhibited reduced GSDMD transcription, as evidenced by a single-cell RNA sequencing result. Consistent with this, cleaved GSDMD expression is negatively correlated with S100A8 in CRC tissues. Additionally, CD15+CD14−LOX1+ cells (G-MDSCs) from the peripheral blood of CRC patients exhibited a significant reduction in GSDMD activation. Mice with ubiquitous GSDMD deficiency bred in a clean environment exhibited a notable increase in G-MDSCs. These GSDMD−/− MDSCs enhanced immunosuppressive activity by both inhibiting effector T-cell activity and promoting regulatory T-cell induction. This enhancement was also observed in GSDMDflox/flox-S100A8Cre mice, in which GSDMD was specifically deleted in MDSCs. The tumor-promoting effects in the GSDMD−/− and GSDMDflox/flox-S100A8Cre mice were abrogated following MDSC depletion, as shown by the use of an anti-DR5 antibody. In the absence of GSDMD, G-MDSCs showed reduced inflammasome activation and decreased production of IL-1β and IL-18. Furthermore, a significant reduction in interferon-related factor 8/7 (IRF8/7) was observed in GSDMD−/− G-MDSCs via bulk RNA sequencing analysis. After treatment with LPS/nigericin, these cells maintained mitochondrial integrity, thus impairing the mtDNA release and the downstream cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF8/7 signaling axis activation. Reduced IRF8/7 levels were responsible for increased differentiation of GSDMD−/− G-MDSCs. Finally, treatment with a GSDMD recombinant lentivirus injected into in situ tumors significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced G-MDSC levels, suggesting that a GSDMD-based vaccine could simultaneously exert anti-carcinoma and anti-MDSC effects.

        <tr id="Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance posing significant challenges to treatment. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA-seq deconvolution to analyze BRCA samples. Our analysis identified 15 major cell clusters, including neoplastic epithelial, immune, stromal, and endothelial populations. Notably, low-grade tumors showed enriched subtypes, such as CXCR4+ fibroblasts, IGKC+ myeloid cells, and CLU+ endothelial cells, with distinct spatial localization and immune-modulatory functions. These subtypes were paradoxically linked to reduced immunotherapy responsiveness, despite their association with favorable clinical features. High-grade tumors exhibited reprogrammed intercellular communication, with expanded MDK and Galectin signaling. Bulk RNA-seq deconvolution further supported the prognostic significance of low-grade-enriched subtypes. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment and provide new insights into immune evasion and therapeutic resistance in breast cancer.">

To explore the key mechanisms underlying WT progression and immune therapy, this study used CIBERSORT to analyze the immune cell infiltration of 120 WT patients. Combined with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, the heterogeneity of macrophages in WT and adjacent tissues was revealed, identifying a subpopulation of tissue-resident macrophages with specific expression of BCL2A1. Further validation through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) experiments confirmed the presence of BCL2A1⁺tissue-resident macrophages and elevated BCL2A1 expression is associated with advanced tumors and poor prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis suggests that BCL2A1⁺tissue-resident macrophages may promote WT progression through immune regulation and apoptosis pathways. This study is the first to identify the presence of a BCL2A1⁺tissue-resident macrophage subset in WT and reveal its critical role in tumor progression, potentially providing a novel target for personalized immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Memory CD8+ T cells sense inflammation and rapidly produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ) independent of cognate antigens. This innate-like property, called bystander activation, is involved in early host defense before the antigen-specific memory response. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this activation remain unknown. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor α (RORα) belongs to the nuclear receptor family and regulates gene transcription in ligand-dependent manner. Although RORα is highly expressed in memory CD8+ T cells, its functional relevance has not been investigated. Methods Primary and secondary memory T cells that are sufficient or deficient of RORα were induced by adoptive transfer of naïve OT-I T cells to recipient mice and subsequent infection with Listeria monocytogenes expressing ovalbumin (LM-OVA). RORα expression in memory T cells was examined by quantitative PCR. The target genes of RORα in memory T cells were explored by RNA-sequencing and verified by RORα overexpression in postactivated T cells. The impact of RORα-deficiency on bystander activation was assessed by stimulating memory T cells with inflammatory cytokines in vitro or injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into mice bearing memory T cells. Results RORα expression was remarkably elevated in secondary memory CD8+ T cells along with the enrichment of effector-like memory T cells. RORα primarily acted as a transcription factor in regulating the gene expression of the TL1A receptor. RORα deficiency abrogated the IFN-γ production by memory CD8+ T cells in response to IL-12 + TL1A in vitro and diminished the bystander response to LPS-induced inflammation in vivo. Conclusion This study revealed a regulatory mechanism of bystander activation. The findings also improve our understanding of how memory T cells increase their immediate protective capacity through repeated infections and vaccinations.">

        <tr id="C-C motif chemokine receptor-like 2 (CCRL2) is an atypical chemokine receptor (ACKR) that binds chemerin with high affinity but lacks classical G protein-coupled signaling. Instead, it functions as a non-signaling presenter of chemerin to CMKLR1-expressing cells, modulating antitumor immunity. CCRL2 is highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment and various human cancers, and its expression has been linked to delayed tumor growth in mouse models, primarily through the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis. While CCRL2’s role in immune surveillance is well established, its tumor cell-intrinsic functions remain less clear. Here, we investigated the impact of CCRL2 overexpression and knockout on tumor cell behavior in vitro. Although CCRL2 did not affect proliferation, migration, or clonogenicity in B16F0 melanoma and LLC cells, it significantly influenced spheroid morphology in B16F0 cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CCRL2 modulates innate immune signaling pathways, including TLR4 and IFN-γ/STAT1, with context-dependent downstream effects. These findings suggest that CCRL2 shapes tumor architecture by rewiring inflammatory signaling networks in a cell-intrinsic manner. Further studies in other cancer types and cell models are needed to determine whether CCRL2’s regulatory role is broadly conserved and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target in solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Immunosenescence, the age-related decline in immune function, profoundly impacts cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes by fostering a tumor-promoting microenvironment and impairing immune surveillance. This review delineates eleven molecular hallmarks of immunosenescence, including genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation, which collectively drive immune cell dysfunction and systemic immunosuppression. Aging reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) through recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP), and metabolic reprogramming, contributing to therapy resistance and poor prognosis in elderly patients. While immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) cells show promise, their efficacy in aging populations is limited by T cell exhaustion, myeloid bias, and altered intercellular communication. Emerging strategies—including senolytics, epigenetic modulators (e.g., histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor), and metabolic interventions (e.g., spermidine, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN))—highlight potential avenues to rejuvenate aged immunity. Single-cell multi-omics (single cell RNA-seq, single cell ATAC-seq) further unravel immune cell heterogeneity, revealing tissue-specific chromatin accessibility dynamics and novel targets like interleukin-34 (IL-34) for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. However, challenges persist in translating preclinical findings to clinical practice, necessitating age-tailored trials and biomarker-driven approaches. By integrating mechanistic insights with translational innovations, this review underscores the urgency of addressing immunosenescence to optimize cancer immunotherapy for aging populations, ultimately bridging the gap between aging biology and precision oncology.">

They remain a major global health burden, requiring deeper research into immune responses; specifically, adaptive immunity. This study aims to analyze T cellular subsets in chronic HBV and HCV infection and investigate their potential role in the immunopathogenesis of these conditions. Methods: For our study, we collected 123 blood samples taken from patients infected with HCV (n = 36) and HBV (n = 34) and healthy volunteers (n = 53). With the use of flow cytometry, we assessed levels of CD4+ and CD8+ minor T cell subpopulations (naïve, central, and effector memory cells (CM and EM), terminally differentiated EM (TEMRA), Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, Tc17.1). Results: Despite similar total CD4+ T cell frequencies across chronic HCV, HBV, and healthy groups, patients with hepatitis showed elevated TEMRA, EM, and CM subsets alongside depleted naïve Th cells and specific CM subpopulations compared to controls. Patients with chronic HCV and HBV showed elevated CD8+ T cell frequencies versus controls, with disease-specific shifts: reduced EM CTLs but increased TEMRA CTLs, Tc1/Tc17.1 depletion (notably Tc17.1 in HCV), and higher Tc2 levels. Conclusions: Viral clearance in HBV and HCV requires a delicate balance between immunity and viral activity. Despite similar T cell frequencies (CD3+/CD4+/CD8+), minor subsets revealed distinct patterns differentiating HCV, HBV, and healthy controls.">

        <tr id="Tumors frequently evade immune destruction by impairing cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses, highlighting the need for strategies that restore T-cell functionality. Here, we identify SLAMF7 (CD319) as a key enhancer of human CD8+ T-cell responses against tumors. SLAMF7 expression is induced by pro-inflammatory signals such as IL-12 and CD28 co-stimulation. Agonistic SLAMF7 signaling, in synergy with TCR activation, is able to strongly induce T-cell activation and clonal expansion, a finding consistently observed in CD8+ T cells from healthy adults as well as derived from blood and tumor-draining lymph nodes of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Moreover it drives a distinct differentiation programme characterized by elevated expression of key transcription factors Eomes and T-bet, leading to increased production of effector molecules such as Interferon γ, Granzyme B and Perforin. In contrast to CD28 costimulation, SLAMF7 activation also promotes serial killing potential via BTLA induction. In antigen-specific human models, SLAMF7 activation boosts CD8+ T-cell responses against the tumor-associated antigen NY-ESO-1, a key target in several cancers including HNSCC. Moreover, combining SLAMF7 activation with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade synergistically enhances cytokine release and cytotoxic potential, highlighting its potential to overcome immunosuppression and reinvigorate antitumor immunity.">

Several studies in mice and humans have demonstrated a key role for DCs in promoting T cell responses to cancer and augmenting the efficacy of T cell‐based immunotherapies. Like other innate immune cells, DCs express a wide repertoire of receptors endowing them with the ability to detect microbial presence and tissue damage. These functions contribute to cancer immunity and have been previously linked to the induction of anti‐tumour CD8+ T cells and enhanced responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Here, I review some of the principles of DC biology, highlighting their functional characteristics that dictate T cell responses to cancer and how these can be harnessed in the design of novel immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by sustained synovial inflammation and the gradual destruction of joint structures. Although conventional T cells have historically been viewed as central to RA pathogenesis, increasing attention has recently focused on unconventional T cell subsets, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and gamma delta T (γδ T) cells. Functioning as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, these cells contribute to RA immunopathogenesis by producing cytokines, exerting cytotoxic effects, and interacting with various immune and stromal cells. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the immunological characteristics and pathogenic roles of unconventional T cell subsets in RA. NKT, MAIT, and γδ T cells contribute to the amplification of inflammatory responses and joint tissue destruction through diverse mechanisms, exhibiting unique tissue tropism and functional plasticity. Recently, novel therapeutic strategies have been developed to target these subsets, including modulation of antigen presentation pathways, inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, and reprogramming of cellular functionalities. Advancements in single-cell omics and spatial immune profiling have facilitated the precise identification and characterization of pathogenic unconventional T cell subsets in the RA synovium, thereby paving the way for personalized immunotherapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Introduction Endothelial cells play a critical role in tumor-associated vasculature formation and immune modulation, and dysregulation of transcription factors (TFs) such as Meox1 has been associated with various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Meox1 has been implicated in promoting both tumor-promoting and immune-suppressing functions. Methods In this study, to systematically map TF dynamics across cancer and immune cells, we performed scRNA-seq on tumor tissues and used the SCENIC framework for regulon analysis, revealing cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks. We investigated the functional role of Meox1 in NSCLC by employing a siRNA-based knockdown approach to selectively reduce its expression. Results Our preliminary findings reveal that siRNA-mediated Meox1 knockdown significantly impairs the capacity of tube formation at the cellular level. Furthermore, we observed a marked reduction in tumor cell proliferation and an increase in CD8 expression, a marker of T-cell activity in an animal model system, indicating that Meox1 may also play a regulatory role in immune-mediated tumor suppression. Discussion Our findings not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer progression but also open new avenues for the development of targeted therapies aimed at restoring tumor-associated endothelial cell function and enhancing immune responses against cancer.">

        <tr id="This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge on immunotherapy resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a disease that accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases and remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved survival for a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC, over 70% of cases ultimately exhibit primary or acquired resistance, underscoring the urgent need to understand the underlying mechanisms. The review categorizes resistance into tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic processes and provides an in-depth mechanistic analysis of how factors such as tumor antigen loss, impaired antigen presentation, cGAS-STING pathway dysregulation, metabolic reprogramming in tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cell exhaustion, and microbiomes collectively contribute to immune escape. In parallel, the influence of the lung and gut microbiome on shaping immunotherapy responses is discussed, with emphasis on microbial dysbiosis, immunosuppressive metabolite production, and TME remodeling. Therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance are also discussed, including combination approaches involving chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and antiangiogenic agents, as well as epigenetic modulators (HDAC and BET inhibitors). Moreover, the review explores bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and small-molecule agents that enhance T cell function or disrupt immunosuppressive signaling networks. By integrating insights from preclinical models and clinical trials, the review underscores the necessity of biomarker-guided patient stratification, combination immunotherapy approaches, and interventions that restore tumor immunogenicity. It concludes that a multipronged therapeutic strategy, one that addresses both immune evasion and TME-induced suppression, holds the greatest promise for improving response durability and advancing personalized immunotherapy for NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies, characterized by a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and resistance to immunotherapy. Obesity, a modifiable risk factor that increases PDAC incidence, exacerbates this immune evasion through metabolic inflammation and adipokine-driven signaling. Recent studies have implicated CXC chemokines, particularly CXCL5, as central mediators in shaping the immune landscape of PDAC. In a pivotal study, Walsh et al delineated a novel mechanism wherein adipocyte-derived cytokines (interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor) induce tumor-derived CXCL5 expression, thereby promoting myeloid-driven immunosuppression in obese PDAC models. Their findings demonstrated that CXCL5 ablation enhances CD8+ T-cell infiltration yet paradoxically increases monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell accumulation and arginase-1 expression, underscoring the complexity of chemokine signaling. Notably, only combinatorial targeting of CXCL5 and programmed cell death protein-1 yields therapeutic benefit, emphasizing the necessity of multiaxis interventions. This commentary synthesizes the mechanistic insights and translational implications of these findings, highlighting CXCL5 as a pivotal node linking metabolic dysfunction to immune resistance and a promising target for combinatorial immunotherapy in PDAC.">

        <tr id="Abstract People living with HIV suffer multiple comorbid conditions related to chronic inflammation at increased rates compared to the general population, even when on effective antiretroviral therapy. In particular, current data indicate that the increased incidence and severity of neurocognitive impairment (NCI) are associated with unresolved neuroinflammation. Attempts to treat NCI in people living with HIV by reducing inflammation have thus far been unsuccessful, suggesting that a more mechanistic understanding of inflammatory processes in the CNS during HIV is necessary. Here, we use iPSC-derived microglia (iMg) and astrocytes (iAst) to model HIV infection in the CNS. We show that our iMg robustly express markers associated with microglial identity and are susceptible to HIV infection, but exhibit lower HIV replication rates and weaker immune response to HIV challenge compared to monocyte-derived macrophages. Coculture of iAst with iMg leads to a much stronger pro-inflammatory immune response, and, surprisingly, a robust increase in rates of HIV replication. Increased replication in iMg/iAst cocultures is associated with higher levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα, which is produced by iAst upon exposure to HIV-infected iMg. Addition of exogenous TNFα to iMg during HIV infection is also sufficient to increase rates of replication, and neutralization of TNFα via adalimumab/Humira treatment in iMg/iAst cocultures reduces replication. Blocking NF-kB signaling with iKK inhibitor Bay-11-7082 (Bay-11) demonstrates that increased HIV replication in iMg/iAst cocultures is due to increased NF-kB activity. Finally, we show that in HIV-infected iMg there is movement of lysosomes to the periphery of the cell membrane and release of lysosomal content into the extracellular space, suggesting that this dysregulated lysosomal flux could further contribute to the pro-inflammatory microenvironment. We propose that this altered lysosomal trafficking and increased cytokine production drives a pro-inflammatory phenotype in glia and represents a potential source of unresolved neuroinflammation in people living with HIV.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections globally, particularly affecting infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. While recent advances in prophylaxis, such as long-acting monoclonal antibodies and maternal immunization, offer promise for prevention, therapeutic options for active infection remain limited. Severe RSV disease is often driven not solely by viral replication but by dysregulated host immune responses, including excessive cytokine production, T helper type 2 (Th2) and T helper type 17 (Th17) cell polarization, and impaired interferon signaling. RSV has evolved sophisticated immune evasion strategies, such as inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, degradation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) via nonstructural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1/NS2), and interference with pattern recognition receptor signaling, particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. These mechanisms result in attenuated innate immune responses and defective adaptive immunity, contributing to viral persistence, immunopathology, and recurrent infections. Moreover, age-dependent vulnerabilities, such as immune immaturity in infants and immunosenescence in older adults, exacerbate disease severity. Excessive immune activation leads to bronchiolitis, airway remodeling, and long-term sequelae including wheezing and asthma. Emerging immunomodulatory therapies aim to restore immune balance, targeting cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-1 beta [IL-1β]), the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, or inflammasome activity. Host-directed therapies and direct-acting antivirals are also under investigation. A better understanding of RSV–host immune interactions is critical for optimizing therapeutic strategies and designing effective vaccines. This review synthesizes current knowledge on RSV immunopathogenesis and highlights immunomodulation as a promising frontier for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="HIV-1 evades immune responses by modulating plasma membrane receptors. Using a flow cytometry–based screening, we profiled 332 surface receptors on HIV-1–infected primary CD4+ T cells and identified 23 down-regulated receptors, including known targets such as CD4, MHCI, CCR7, and CD62L. CD96, an inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptor poorly studied in human CD4+ T cells, was markedly down-regulated. This modulation, mediated by the viral proteins Nef and Vpu, surpassed that of other NK-associated receptors such as CD155 and NTB-A and is conserved across lentiviruses. CD96Hi CD4+ T cells exhibited a proinflammatory TH1/TH17 phenotype characterized by IFN-γ and IL-17 secretion and displayed impaired migration in vivo. Furthermore, CD96 ligation enhanced IFN-γ release upon viral peptide stimulation and promoted the secretion of TH1/TH17-associated cytokines. Our findings suggest that CD96 regulates antiviral immune responses and maintains proinflammatory properties in CD4+ T cells. Thus, its down-regulation represents a previously unknown HIV-1 immune evasion strategy, with implications for exploiting CD96 as immunotherapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening complications that can arise following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). GVHD occurs when immune cells—primarily T cells—from the graft recognize host cells as foreign entities and initiate an immune response against host tissues. This immune reaction generally involves a diverse array of cytokines, including interleukins (ILs), which play a pivotal role in modulating the immune response, promoting inflammation, and sustaining immune tolerance. Members of the interleukin family are not only directly involved in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T cells but also regulate inflammatory responses and the migration of immune cells. Consequently, they significantly influence both the clinical manifestations and prognosis of GVHD. The objective of this study is to review recent advancements in research concerning interleukins and their role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. This study aims to elucidate how interleukins contribute to immune regulation, inflammatory responses, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, we will discuss their potential as therapeutic targets, with the intention of providing novel insights and strategies for the clinical management of GVHD.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
While highly efficacious for numerous cancers, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can cause unpredictable and potentially severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), underscoring the need to understand irAE biology.


METHODS
We used a multidimensional approach incorporating single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) profiling to characterize the peripheral immune landscape of patients receiving ICI therapy according to irAE development.


RESULTS
Analysis of 162 patients revealed that individuals who developed clinically significant irAEs exhibited a baseline proinflammatory, autoimmune-like state characterized by a significantly higher abundance of CD57+ T and natural killer (NK) T cells, plasmablasts, proliferating and activated CXCR3+ lymphocytes, CD8+ effector and terminal effector memory T cells, along with reduced NK cells and elevated plasma ANA levels. In irAE cases, we identified distinct baseline proinflammatory gene signatures, including markedly higher expression of IL1B and CXCL8 in monocytes and CXCR3, TNF, and IFNG in T/NK cells. TNF signaling was the most enriched pathway, while immunosuppressive genes SIGLEC7 and CXCR4 were downregulated. Following ICI initiation, these patients exhibited an enhanced shift toward an activated and inflammatory immune phenotype, including monocyte reprogramming characterized by upregulation of IL18 and elevated gene expression levels of CXCL10. Conversely, post-treatment levels of CXCL8 were decreased in irAE patients. Notably, in patients who did not develop clinically significant irAE, we identified increased baseline abundance of a TGFBIhigh myeloid cluster enriched in immunosuppressive markers such as STAB1. In addition, patients without irAE exhibited upregulation of TNF and AIRE, accompanied by distinct myeloid protumorigenic reprogramming.


CONCLUSIONS
A pre-existing activated, autoimmune-like proinflammatory state drives the development of irAE during ICI therapy through three key axes: increased plasmablast/ANA, heightened interferon-gamma/CXCL10/CXCR3 axis, and amplified TNF signaling. These findings may serve as potential peripheral immune biomarkers for predicting irAE and provide biological insights into the mechanisms governing and mitigating irAE.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a broad spectrum of physical and cognitive impairments. Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.">

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the T-cell-mediated chain of immunity and formation of TCR via TREC assessment in COVID-19 and long COVID (LC). For this study, we collected 231 blood samples taken from patients with acute COVID-19 (n = 71), convalescents (n = 51), people diagnosed with LC (n = 63), and healthy volunteers (n = 46). With flow cytometry, we assessed levels of CD4+ and CD8+ minor T cell subpopulations (i.e., naïve, central and effector memory cells (CM and EM), Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, Tc17.1, and subpopulations of effector cells (pE1, pE2, effector cells)). Additionally, we measured TREC levels. We found distinct changes in immune cell distribution—whilst distribution of major subpopulations of T cells was similar between cohorts, we noted that COVID-19 was associated with a decrease in naïve Th and CTLs, an increase in Th2/Tc2 lymphocyte polarization, an increase in CM cells, and a decrease in effector memory cells 1,3, and TEMRA cells. LC was associated with naïve CTL increase, polarization towards Th2 population, and a decrease in Tc1, Tc2, Em2, 3, 4 cells. We also noted TREC correlating with naïve cells subpopulations. Our findings suggest ongoing immune dysregulation, possibly driven by persistent antigen exposure or tissue migration of effector cells. The positive correlation between TREC levels and naïve T cells in LC patients points to residual thymic activity. The observed Th2/Th17 bias supports the hypothesis that LC involves autoimmune mechanisms, potentially driven by molecular mimicry or loss of immune tolerance.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) tumors present a major clinical challenge due to complex immune evasion mechanisms and generally poor responses to immunotherapy. Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a critical determinant of immunotherapy resistance. Immunosuppressive cell populations such as regulatory T cells, M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts, together with aberrant cytokine networks and mechanical stress in the tumor stroma, cooperate to exclude T-cell infiltration and induce T-cell exhaustion, thereby undermining the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, TIME-driven signaling pathway activation and epigenetic reprogramming further reinforce immune escape and therapeutic failure. Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies have greatly improved our understanding of these processes. Meanwhile, strategies including multi-target combination immunotherapies, epigenetic modulators, mRNA vaccines, and gut microbiota interventions are under active investigation to reverse resistance and remodel the TIME. This mini review summarizes the multifaceted mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in GI tumors and discusses the potential of emerging therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background and purpose The tumor microenvironment (TME) is widely acknowledged as a pivotal regulator of cancer progression. However, the dualistic role of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which serve as critical immune hubs within the TME, remains incompletely characterized, particularly with respect to their context-dependent capacity to either inhibit or facilitate tumor development. This review aims to synthesize current understanding of the complex interactions between stromal cells and TLSs, addressing existing gaps in mechanistic insight and exploring therapeutic avenues to exploit TLS plasticity. Key reviewed topics The current study critically reviews the mechanisms by which stromal components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells, contribute to TLS neogenesis through chemokine-mediated recruitment of lymphocytes. Furthermore, it highlights the dual functional roles of TLSs as sites of both anti-tumor immune activation and immunosuppression, notably via the enrichment of regulatory T cells. The clinical implications of mature TLS presence, particularly their association with improved patient prognosis and enhanced therapeutic responsiveness, are also analyzed. Main conclusions TLSs demonstrate a bifunctional nature, wherein their spatial organization and dynamic interactions with stromal elements dictate the balance between immune activation and tolerance within the TME. While mature TLSs are generally correlated with favorable clinical outcomes, their potential to foster immunosuppressive microenvironments necessitates the development of precision-targeted interventions. The interplay between stromal cells and TLSs represents a promising therapeutic axis for modulating the tumor immune milieu. Future perspectives Future research should prioritize strategies aimed at promoting TLS maturation, disrupting immunosuppressive niches, and integrating TLS-modulating agents with existing immunotherapeutic regimens to enhance clinical efficacy. Additionally, the identification of robust biomarkers reflective of TLS functional states and the rigorous validation of stromal-targeted therapies within combinatorial treatment frameworks are imperative for advancing translational applications.

        <tr id="Aging is associated with complex immune dysfunction that contributes to the onset and progression of the “geriatric giants”, including frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline, falls, and incontinence. Central to these conditions is immunosenescence, marked by thymic involution, the loss of naïve T cells, T-cell exhaustion, impaired B-cell class switch recombination, and increased autoreactivity. Concurrently, innate immunity deteriorates due to macrophage, neutrophil, and NK cell dysfunction, while chronic low-grade inflammation—or “inflammaging”—amplifies systemic decline. Key molecular pathways such as NF-κB, mTOR, and the NLRP3 inflammasome mediate immune aging, interacting with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic modifications. These processes not only impair infection control and vaccine responsiveness but also promote tissue degeneration and multimorbidity. This review explores emerging interventions—ranging from senolytics and immunonutrition to microbiome-targeted therapies and exercise—that may restore immune homeostasis and extend healthspan. Despite advances, challenges remain in translating immunological insights into clinical strategies tailored to older adults. Standardization in microbiome trials and safety optimization in senolytic therapies are critical next steps. Integrating geroscience into clinical care could help to mitigate the burden of aging-related diseases by targeting fundamental drivers of immune dysfunction.">

In this review, we explore how neutrophils respond to different cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immune cell therapy, and therapies using viruses or bacteria. We highlight how different therapeutic environments can drive neutrophils toward either the beneficial N1 or the harmful N2 state. Understanding what determines this polarization is key to improving outcomes. By understanding when neutrophils act in favor of or against treatment, scientists can design better strategies to fight cancer. This knowledge could lead to new therapies that guide neutrophils to support the immune system, reduce tumor spread, and improve the efficacy of current cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) represent a heterogeneous population of T cells that exhibit both effector and memory functionalities. They express specific gene signatures that enable them to occupy tissues without recirculating, thus providing a first response against reencountered pathogens or antigens. TRM have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including autoimmune disorders, infections, and cancers. This has prompted interest in targeting TRM as a potential therapeutic strategy. Epigenetic modifications, which frequently occur in immune cells across various disease states, play a significant role not only in tissue homeostasis but also in disease progression. Emerging evidence suggests that the epigenetic landscape of TRM is altered in pathogenic conditions, impacting their differentiation, maintenance, and function. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the epigenetic regulation of TRM, focusing on key areas such as chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Importantly, a deeper understanding of these epigenetic mechanisms will pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies, such as modulating TRM activity in autoimmune diseases, enhancing tissue-specific immunity through vaccines, or improving immunotherapeutic efficacy in cancer.">

        <tr id="TH17 cells play a critical role in inflammation, cancer development, and antitumor immunity in a context-dependent manner, but detailed mechanisms and their downstream signaling events remain poorly understood. Here, we describe that TH17 cytokines strongly inhibit expression of critical chemokines in epithelial tissues, which leads to blocking infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells into the colon, rendering resistance to DSS-induced colitis and colon cancer. We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of TH17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. Overall, our findings have identified a previously unrecognized critical gap between TH17 cytokines, epithelial chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration through a C/EBPβ-mediated pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are organized aggregates of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and stromal cells that form at sites of inflammation, providing adaptive immune responses outside of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). Found in various pathological conditions—including chronic infections, cancer, organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and allergy—the presence of TLSs is linked to potentiation of local immunity. TLSs can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on context, and have been implicated as prognostic for disease severity and therapy response. Architecturally, TLSs resemble SLOs with distinct T and B cell areas supported by fibroblasts that secrete chemokines and cytokines that support immune cells. These structures must be created de novo in non‐lymphoid tissues; thus, the steps for TLS formation mimic, but do not completely copy, those of SLO formation. The accumulation of immune cells in tissues in inflammatory settings can initiate remodeling of tissue fibroblasts, leading to TLS formation; this process is common across tissues, although there are tissue‐ and disease‐specific pathways that impact TLS formation in certain contexts. This review will explore the immune‐stromal crosstalk in kidney, lung, and skin TLSs across a range of disease settings, highlighting shared as well as tissue‐specific mechanisms for TLS formation.">

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), microglia, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) constitute the major immunosuppressive axis, promoting tumor progression through cytokine secretion (IL-10, TGF-β), metabolic reprogramming, and inhibition of cytotoxic immunity. These innate immune cells not only facilitate immune evasion but also impair adaptive T-cell responses, limiting the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Emerging evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting innate immunity via TAM repolarization, MDSC depletion, and NK cell activation to reshape the immunosuppressive TME. This review summarizes the pivotal role of innate immunity in GBM pathogenesis and explores novel combinatorial strategies that integrate innate immune modulation with checkpoint blockade, oncolytic virotherapy, and metabolic interventions to overcome therapeutic resistance in this lethal malignancy.">

 Radiation therapy (RT) can trigger type I interferon (IFN-I) responses and anti-tumor immunity in various can- cers. However, glioblastoma inevitably recurs, suggesting RT does not generate a long-lasting immune response. This may be due to a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and/or RT-induced immune evasion. Our ﬁndings show that RT promotes fatty acid synthase (FASN)-mediated lipid synthesis, a metabolic program that reportedly suppresses IFN-I in viral immunity. We hypothesized that FASN induction similarly inhibits IFN-I in irradiated glioblastoma, limiting antitumor immunity. We aim to determine whether FASN blockade restores IFN-I signaling, enhances immune inﬁltration, and improves RT and immunotherapy eﬃcacy.



 Murine glioblastoma cells were subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated FASN knockout or treated with FASN in- hibitors (FASNi), then irradiated (6Gy) and analyzed 24h post-RT using RNA sequencing, LEGENDplex, and ELISA. In vivo, glioblastoma-bearing mice received FASNi (days 9-30), anti-PD-1 (twice weekly, days 15-24), and fractionated RT (5×6Gy, days 10-14). Survival was monitored (n=7/group), and tumor immune inﬁltration was assessed at day 20 using ﬂow cytometry and multiplex imaging. Long-term survivors (>100 days) were rechal- lenged in the contralateral hemisphere. In some experiments, mice received anti-CD8 or anti-IFNAR antibodies.



 Transcriptome analysis identiﬁed IFN-I signaling as the most enriched pathway in irradiated FASN-knockout cells, conﬁrmed by increased IFN-I protein levels. In vivo, RT+FASNi inﬂamed glioblastoma tumors, enhancing CD11c and CD8 T-cell inﬁltration. Remarkably, adding anti-PD-1 to RT+FASNi further improved survival, with 86% of mice tumor-free at 100 days vs. 43% in other RT-treated groups. Rechallenged RT+FASNi+anti-PD-1 survivors did not develop a tumor when compared to naïve animals, demonstrating immunological memory. CD8 depletion or IFNAR blockade abrogated this effect, highlighting the critical role of IFN-I and CD8



 FASN inhibition restores IFN-I responses in irradiated glioblastoma, enhancing immune inﬁltration and im- munotherapy eﬃcacy. These ﬁndings highlight FASN as a key target to shift glioblastoma from immunosup- pressive to immunoresponsive.

Microbead-sorted Treg subsets from CBIA patients underwent 32-cytokine panel secretome analysis. Peripheral blood (PB) Tregs from seven CBIA and six RA patients were similarly analyzed. Findings were correlated with the modified Clinical Disease Activity Index (mCDAI) in CBIA patients.Unsupervised clustering revealed two atypical immune-activating Treg cell clusters common to both CBIA and RA patients, in which an immunoactivating (featuring ICOS+CD134+CD137+) cluster was distinct to CBIA patients. This immunoactivating cluster was found to have a positive correlation to the mCDAI in CBIA patients. In single-cell secreting proteomics of SF-derived Treg cells in CBIA patients, we found that clusters distinct to the immunoactivating cell group featured inflammatory cytokine secretion of mainly MCP1 and MCP4, which was validated by peripheral CBIA secreting proteomics (vs. RA, which preferentially secreted CCL11/CXCL10). Other non-immunoactivating cells mainly secreted immune-modulatory cytokines of IL-10, IL-4, and TGFB1. Consistently, the MCP1/MCP4+ polysecreting cluster proportion was also positively correlated with mCDAI.At the single-cell proteomic level, an atypical, MCP1/MCP4+ polysecreting immunoactivating Treg cell type is found to have a strong relation to clinical disease activity of CBIA.">

However, recent advancements in single-cell analysis and molecular biology have revealed their remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity, particularly within the context of tumors. This review explores the development and diversity of neutrophils under both physiological and pathological conditions, with a particular focus on their roles in cancer. The discussion encompasses the emergence of distinct neutrophil subtypes, particularly senescent neutrophils, within tumors and their context-dependent functions in tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis, and recurrence. The plasticity of these cells, driven by intrinsic factors and the tumor microenvironment, allows them to be reprogrammed between pro-tumor and anti-tumor phenotypes. This process is influenced by cytokines, metabolic reprogramming, and interactions with other immune cells. The potential of targeting and engineering neutrophil as a therapeutic avenue for cancer treatment is further underscored, including the use of senolytic agents, metabolic inhibitors, and reprogramming strategies. Finally, future research directions are proposed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying neutrophil heterogeneity and plasticity, with the aim of developing novel therapeutic approaches to modulate neutrophil function in cancer.">

This study identified two novel NK cell subpopulations that could not be detected by conventional scRNA-seq pipelines or traditional flow cytometry. These subpopulations exhibit distinct gene expression profiles linked to the heterogeneity of immune responsiveness and stress adaptation in NK cells. In SV/HLHS patients, one cluster showed a significant upregulation of androgen response and downregulation of heme metabolism compared to healthy controls. Our study offers new insights into the fine-tuning of immune modulation that could help mitigate complications in SV/HLHS. It suggests that while NK cells in SV/HLHS adapt to support survival in a challenging physiological environment, these adaptations may compromise their ability to effectively respond to additional stresses, such as infections and inflammation.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer, with poor survival rates in advanced stages due to late diagnosis, tumor heterogeneity, and therapy resistance. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in HCC has a crucial role in tumor progression, characterized by a complex interaction of immune cells, stromal components, and immunosuppressive signaling pathways. Chronic inflammation driven by viral infections, metabolic dysfunction, and alcohol consumption triggers an immunosuppressive TME, promoting immune evasion and tumor growth. Immune cell populations, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, and tumor-associated macrophages, contribute to immunosuppression, while cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells exert anti-tumor effects. Recent advances in immunotherapy, mainly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed death-ligand 1 and programmed cell death protein 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, have revolutionized HCC treatment, though response rates remain limited. Combined therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, and ICIs improve patient outcomes. This review discusses the immunological mechanisms contributing to HCC progression, the role of immune cell subsets in tumor evasion, and therapeutic interventions, from conventional treatments to advanced immunotherapies. Ongoing clinical trials, barriers to effective treatment, and future directions to enhance HCC management and patient survival will also be overviewed.">

Conventional PD-1 inhibitors yield an ORR of only 38%. As an emerging class of immunotherapeutic agents, oncolytic viruses (OV) induce ICD, promoting the release of DAMPs and activating innate immune pathways such as cGAS-STING, thereby transforming “cold” tumors into “hot” phenotypes and eliciting robust anti-tumor responses. Mechanistically, OV therapy increases the proportion of CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) in lymph nodes from 5% to 25% and enhances DC–tumor synapse formation by 300%, facilitating efficient cross-presentation of tumor antigens and T-cell priming. Clinically, T-VEC combined with pembrolizumab achieves a 48.6% ORR with grade ≥3 AEs occurring in <20% of patients—superior to either monotherapy or conventional chemoradiotherapy. Nonetheless, OV therapy faces challenges including tumor heterogeneity, core mechanistic limitations, viral shedding risks, and regulatory hurdles. Over the next 5–10 years, single-cell RNA sequencing is expected to unravel molecular heterogeneity in melanoma, while CRISPR/Cas systems may enable the design of tailored OV to overcome resistance. Additional strategies such as serotype switching, JAK/STAT inhibition, and arming OV with hyaluronidase or STING agonists are under investigation to overcome immune and stromal barriers. Integration of artificial intelligence with biomarkers—such as neutralizing antibody titers, ISG expression, and STING methylation—may further enable personalized OV-based therapies.

        <tr id="Background Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs) are pivotal in tumor immunotherapy, including the action of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. However, fully harnessing the therapeutic potential of TdLNs to improve clinical outcomes remains a significant challenge. Methods A PD-1 antagonist peptide-conjugated nanoliposome (LPs) was developed to improve lymph node targeting and therapeutic efficacy. The biodistribution, lymph node accumulation, and safety of LPs were assessed using imaging, histological, and systemic analyses. Immunodeficient mouse models and lymphadenectomy were employed to confirm the mechanistic reliance on adaptive immunity and TdLNs. Bulk RNA sequencing and multicolor flow cytometry were used to investigate TdLNs function and assess CD8+ T cell immune responses in TdLNs and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Results LPs demonstrated optimal physicochemical properties, including ideal size, serum stability, and precise TdLNs accumulation, peaking at 3 h post-administration. In two immunocompetent HCC models, LPs treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth while remodeling the TME—enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration and reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Transcriptomic analysis of TdLNs revealed significant upregulation of lipid storage/metabolism pathways and immune activation signatures. Immune profiling validated LPs-mediated expansion of precursor-exhausted and tissue-resident memory-like CD8+ T cell subsets in both TdLNs and tumors, accompanied by reduced exhaustion markers. Crucially, the therapeutic efficacy was completely abrogated in immunodeficient mice and following surgical lymphadenectomy, confirming the essential role of adaptive immunity and functional TdLNs in LPs' mechanism of action. Conclusions Targeting PD-1 on T cells within TdLNs effectively boosts anti-tumor immunity. The modified LPs offer a potent strategy to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

        <tr id="T cells are integral to the immune response, with distinct subsets exhibiting specialized functions, a phenomenon well-characterized in helper CD4+ T cells. Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have facilitated the identification of numerous novel CD8 T cell subsets, each characterized by unique functional properties. As cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the primary focus has been on the cytotoxic capabilities and antigen specificity of these subsets. A recently identified subset, Granzyme k (Gzmk)+ CD8 T cells, has been closely associated with inflammatory diseases, independent of their cytotoxic function. Unlike other granzymes, granzyme K predominantly induces proinflammatory responses in tissues or cells rather than mediating cytotoxicity. This review synthesizes current evidence regarding the regulation, functional roles, and underlying mechanisms of Gzmk+ CD8 T cells in inflammatory conditions. Elucidating these processes may reveal potential therapeutic targets for treating inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-MPNs) are clonal hematologic malignancies characterized not only by driver mutations such as JAK2V617F, CALR, and MPL but also by a profoundly dysregulated immune microenvironment. Chronic inflammation and immune remodeling sustain malignant hematopoiesis and contribute to disease progression from essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) to overt myelofibrosis (MF). Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines—including IL-2, IFN-α, IL-23, and TNF-α—drive abnormal T cell polarization, favoring a pathogenic Th17 phenotype. Lymphocyte subset analysis reveals a predominance of exhausted PD-1+ T cells, reflecting impaired immune surveillance. Concurrently, alterations in neutrophil apoptosis lead to persistent inflammation and stromal activation. GRO-α (CXCL1) is elevated in ET but reduced in MF, suggesting a subtype-specific role in disease biology. Fibrosis-promoting factors such as TGF-β and IL-13 mediate bone marrow remodeling and megakaryocyte expansion, while VEGF and other angiogenic factors enhance vascular niche alterations, particularly in PV. These immunopathologic features underscore novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. In addition to JAK inhibition, targeted strategies such as CXCR1/2 antagonists, anti-TGF-β agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 blockade) may offer disease-modifying potential. Understanding the interplay between cytokine signaling and immune cell dysfunction is crucial for developing precision immunotherapies in MPNs.">

Given their ability to recognize and directly kill targets possessing missing or altered self-proteins and to induce indirect killing via recruitment of adaptive immunity, they are in a unique position to modulate host immunologic responses. These complex immune sentinels typically circulate in the peripheral blood and/or reside in lymphoid tissues. As the largest organ, human skin functions in front line immunological defense, though it has not historically been categorized as lymphoid tissue. Whether tissue-resident ILC populations originally derive from conventional circulating NK cells, or whether they interface as developmentally distinct entities with phenotypic overlap within particular inflammatory contexts remains a subject of ongoing investigation. This review seeks to consolidate the currently available literature regarding NK cell and ILC skin homing and innate immune function in healthy vs. lesional human skin (including infection, inflammatory/autoimmune conditions, and cutaneous malignancy). Importantly, we elucidate significant gaps in the understanding of the complex role for NK cells in skin homeostasis and pathology, and posit unique opportunities the accessibility of this secondary lymphoid organ provides for translational studies to improve our understanding of cutaneous immunity.">

        <tr id="Two key players in the immune system, dendritic cells (DCs) and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), interact in a crucial way to fight infectious diseases. DCs play a key role in recognizing pathogens, and ILCs respond to cytokines released by DCs. This response triggers the production of specific effector cytokines that help control pathogens and maintain the body’s barrier integrity. DCs have various receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), that detect microbial components and trigger immune responses. Likewise, ILCs act as essential initial responders in the immune system in viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. Successfully managing diseases caused by pathogens mainly depends on the combined actions of DCs and ILCs, which work to suppress and eliminate pathogens. DCs also play a crucial role in activating innate and adaptive immune cell subsets, including ILCs. Furthermore, the use of DCs in developing vaccines and immunotherapy for cancers, along with the dedication of many researchers to improve immune responses through DCs, has increased interest in the potential of DC therapies for treating and preventing infectious diseases. This review examines approaches that may enhance DC vaccines and boost anti-infection immune responses by fostering better interactions of DCs with ILCs.">

        <tr id="Understanding the roles of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a promising strategy to identify novel targets to counteract the immunosuppressive barriers protecting multiple myeloma (MM). Neutrophils are a new cancer research focus due to their potential to reduce the efficacy of immune-based therapies. This study aimed to deepen understanding of neutrophil function in MM by analyzing freshly isolated myeloid cells from paired focal lesions (FL) and bone marrow (BM) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunofluorescence imaging, and functional assays. We describe three distinct CXCR2+ mature neutrophil subsets: TREM1+CD10+, RETN+LCN2+, and TNFAIP3+CXCL8+, each exhibiting unique phenotypes within the TME. Notably, the TREM1+CD10+ subset was highly prevalent, particularly in FL, demonstrating potent immunosuppressive effects on T cells. This subset's gene signature was correlated with shorter overall survival (OS) in a large MM patient dataset, underscoring its clinical significance. Targeted inhibition of neutrophil activity through CXCR2 blockade, alone or combined with standard anti-MM therapies, significantly reduced tumor burden, improving OS in preclinical MM models. These insights into neutrophil-mediated immunosuppression in MM provide valuable knowledge regarding mechanisms driving immune evasion and reveal new therapeutic approaches to enhance the efficacy of MM treatment.">

        <tr id="Summary Unfolded protein response (UPR) is an evolutionally conserved adaptive mechanism that promotes protein homeostasis under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. UPR signaling has numerous functions in metabolism, cancer, immunology, and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies also showed that UPR signaling has important roles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell biology. However, whether UPR signaling regulates hematopoietic lineage fate decision remains elusive. Here, we found that FcγR - MPP3 generates erythroid lineage and Jak2 V617F mutation leads to overproduction of erythroid cells by expanding FcγR - MPP3. We showed that UPR signaling increases myeloid cell production through promoting FcγR - MPP3 transition to granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) producing FcγR + MPP3. Under a disease condition, UPR signaling cooperates with Jak2 V617F mutation and exacerbates disease phenotype as increasing red blood cells in a mouse model of polycythemia vera (PV). Activation of UPR signaling also increased myeloid output in healthy donor bone marrow MPP cells while skewing the output towards erythroid lineage in PV patient bone marrow MPP cells. Together, our results identify a novel function of UPR signaling in hematopoietic lineage specification and provide critical insights into targeting UPR signaling in hematological malignancies. Highlights UPR signaling promotes myeloid cell production. UPR signaling collaborates with Jak2 V617F mutation and increases red blood cell production.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Obesity is a rapidly growing public health crisis associated simultaneously with increased metabolic disease and humoral immune suppression to vaccination or infection. Inflammatory CD11c+T-bet+ B cells (ABCs) increase in spleen and adipose tissue during obesity and exacerbate metabolic dysfunction via antibodies. We now find that during obesity Tbet+ B cells also expand in the liver but not omentum or mesenteric fat. Obese mice also develop increased splenic CXCR5+ TFH and hepatic CXCR5− TPH cells which serve as likely partners for antigen-experienced MHC-II+ ABCs. We also observed that antibodies in obese mice, previously found to contribute to metabolic disease, largely circulate as inflammatory autoantigen-bound immune complexes. Perhaps most striking was our observation that obese mice lacking T-bet in B cells develop increased autoantibody titers and expanded splenic germinal center (GC) B and T helper cells. T-bet+ B cell-deficient mice make a similarly enhanced GC, TFH, TPH response to haptenated-protein vaccination with a corresponding increase in antibody affinity, although there is no additive effect of obesity. These results are consistent with GC inhibition by expanded ABCs demonstrated by others to occur during autoimmunity, suggesting a broadly universal mechanism which may also explain reduced humoral immunity and poor clinical outcomes following infection in patients with obesity and other forms of chronic inflammation.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with immune dysfunction, but how disease-intrinsic mechanisms in treatment-naive patients influence the coordination of adaptive responses to novel antigens remains unclear. Here, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell immunity in 38 treatment-naive CLL patients and 13 healthy controls (HCs) following vaccination. Despite significantly reduced total immunoglobulin levels compared to HCs, 94.7% of CLL patients developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, and 89.5% mounted IgA responses, with serum titers comparable to those of HCs. Virus-specific T cell responses, measured by IFN-γ release following antigen stimulation, were detected in 78.9% of patients. CLL patients had significantly more circulating CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells than HCs. These expansions correlated with B cell abundance, which, in untreated CLL, predominantly reflects malignant B cells. Notably, Tfh cell frequencies and absolute counts were highest in patients lacking a SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response, indicating a decoupling between Tfh expansion and functional antiviral immunity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that while SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses are largely preserved in treatment-naive CLL patients, disease-driven alterations in T cell composition may compromise the coordination and quality of antigen-specific T cell-mediated immunity.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND: Endothelial cells (ECs) play pivotal roles in maintaining cardiac blood supply and regulating inflammation by acting as gatekeepers for immune cell activity. This study unveils a novel immunomodulatory function of cardiac ECs following myocardial infarction. METHODS: We used single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to identify EC states after acute myocardial infarction in mice. Subsequently, we mimicked the cytokine environment that was predicted to induce EC activation in cell culture studies and confirmed the results in an endothelial-specific deletion mouse model. RESULTS: Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis identified a transient myeloid CD45+CD11b+Cdh5+ immunomodulatory EC phenotype (IMEC) emerging between days 1 and 3 after myocardial infarction. IMECs derived from Cdh5+ tissue resident cells as shown by bone marrow transplantation and lineage tracing experiment. Ligand-receptor interaction predictions indicated a cytokine-mediated activation of IMECs, which we validated through in vitro experiments in cultured ECs. Notably, while cytokine treatment with IL-1β and TGF-β (transforming growth factor β) induced mesenchymal gene expression, the addition of IFN-γ (interferon γ) facilitated the transition into the immunomodulatory phenotype. IMECs exhibited an upregulation of MHC-II (major histocompatibility complex class II) genes, along with the expression of RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor-1) and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-12. IMECs induced T-cell activation through paracrine signaling and were colocalized with T cells in vivo. Inhibition of endothelial-specific IFN-γ-signaling in mice by IFN-γ receptor 1 deletion improved the recovery after myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide insight into the role of ECs regulating adaptive immune responses following myocardial infarction, offering potential insights into therapeutic interventions for postinfarction immunomodulation.">

        <tr id="Background Splenic immunomodulation triggered by ultrasound shows a significant anti-inflammatory effect against various inflammatory diseases, whose mechanism is mainly attributable to the activation of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). However, the potential role and underlying mechanism of splenic ultrasound stimulation in cancer management have been rarely reported and superficially defined. Methods Following optimization of ultrasonic parameters, this study evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of splenic sonication across multiple tumor models (eg, orthotopic H22 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), orthotopic Hepa1-6 HCC, and subcutaneous 4T1 breast cancer), and applied flow cytometry to quantify dynamic alterations in immune cell populations. Furthermore, in orthotopic H22 HCC models, this study employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting, RNA sequencing, splenic nerve blockade via absolute ethanol ablation, and in vitro Ca²⁺ flux assays to delineate the mechanisms underlying ultrasound-mediated splenic anti-tumor immunity. Results This study first assessed the therapeutic effect of focused ultrasound precisely targeting the spleen (FUS sti. spleen) on various tumors at specific ultrasonic doses. It fully demonstrated that FUS directly stimulated splenic immune cell proliferation and activation (especially NK and CD8 T cells) rather than CAP excitation to modulate splenic immune function. Particularly, NK cells are much more indispensable and important in responding to FUS stimulation for cancer suppression than CD8 T cells. RNA sequencing of NK and CD8 T cells, as well as in vitro experiments revealed that FUS firstly regulated calcium-related signaling pathways to further modulate others, such as PI3K-AKT, Rap1, and Hippo pathways to promote immune cell proliferation, migration and activation to suppress cancer cell deterioration. Particularly, FUS sti. spleen and FUS intervention on the tumor synergistically induced the best tumor suppression than each of the two taken individually. Conclusion FUS sti. spleen facilitated immunocyte proliferation and activation through altering calcium-dependent signaling rather than CAP excitation to modulate anti-tumor immunity, indicating substantial clinical translation potential.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Tuberculosis (TB) treatment is challenged by a long duration, poor adherence, and the high risk of drug‐induced liver injury (DILI). T‐cell immunity is essential for anti‐mycobacterial defense, but current immune‐monitoring methods poorly reflect disease severity and treatment response. Correlations of immune subpopulations with TB severity, DILI, and treatment prognosis remain poorly understood. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from confirmed TB patients (n = 40). Multiparameter flow cytometry analysis was used to assess previously defined TB‐associated T‐cell phenotypes based on the co‐expression of cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules following stimulation with two Mycobacterium tuberculosis peptides: culture filtrate protein 10 and early secreted antigenic target 6. Patients were subgrouped by disease severity, DILI, and treatment regimen (16‐week short course vs. 24‐week standard). Results Specific subsets (14/124) were found to be associated with disease severity. Notably, six of 14 subsets were positive for programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1), indicating its potential role in disease progression. DILI was associated with three interleukin (IL)‐21+ subsets (naïve CD4+, memory CD8+, and interferon [IFN]‐γ− CD4+ T cells) and IL‐17+ memory CD8+ T cells, along with PD‐L1+TIM‐3+CD4+ T cells (all p < 0.05). The 16‐week and 24‐week treatment groups showed a significant difference in IFN‐γ+ naïve CD8+ T cells at week 16 (p = 0.013), but not at treatment completion (p = 0.393), despite the different durations. Conclusions This study identifies specific T‐cell phenotypes associated with TB severity, DILI, and treatment dynamics, highlighting potential immune markers for disease monitoring and DILI prediction.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Increasing evidence underscores the pivotal yet paradoxical roles of innate immune cells and their associated cytokines in orchestrating the dynamic landscape of the breast tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Innate immune effectors, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and natural killer (NK) cells, exert dual functions by either initiating robust antitumor responses or facilitating immune evasion, metastatic dissemination, and therapeutic resistance. For instance, MDSCs suppress T and NK cell activity via STAT3/NF-κB signaling and modulate the cytokine milieu through IL-10 and TGF-β. Similarly, M2-polarized TAMs promote angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance via IL-10/STAT3/Bcl-2 pathways. In contrast, NK cells and CD103+ DCs mediate tumor cell cytolysis and prime antigen-specific immunity, though their activity is frequently compromised in advanced disease. Moreover, key cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, TNF-α, TGF-β, and CCL2/5, demonstrate subtype-specific and context-dependent effects, acting as both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing agents through complex signaling networks. This review highlights the dualistic nature of innate immune components in breast cancer, discusses their prognostic and therapeutic implications, and proposes novel intervention strategies, such as TAM repolarization, and cytokine modulation, to reprogram the TIME and restore effective immune surveillance, particularly in aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Microorganisms are ubiquitous in the human body, including within tumor tissues. Recent studies have demonstrated that intratumoral microbiota serve as critical regulators of the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting the progression of solid tumors (e.g., gastric, lung, and breast cancers). These microbes modulate immune factors (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α), thereby influencing the activation and infiltration of immune cells, including T cells and macrophage. Additionally, by reshaping the immune landscape, intratumoral microbiota can dysregulate immune checkpoint expression, ultimately affecting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the origins of intratumoral microbiota, their heterogeneity across cancer types, and their intricate roles in modulating immune responses and tumor metastasis. We further discuss innovative therapeutic strategies leveraging the intratumoral microbiota, including engineered bacteria, oncolytic viruses, and nanoparticles, and address existing challenges and potential future research directions. A deeper understanding of these microbial‒host interactions may open new avenues for precise microbiota-based cancer diagnostics and personalized immunotherapeutic strategies.">

Notable advancements in patient survival have been achieved due to the clinical application of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) and bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs). However, the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the bone marrow hinders the effectiveness of these novel immunotherapies, consequently restricting their efficacy. Hence, it is imperative to clarify the exact mechanisms to devise strategies aimed at improving the efficacy of immunotherapy. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of recent research concerning the different T cell subtypes in the immune evasion mechanisms of MM. The review emphasizes the imbalance between the immune surveillance and the immune suppression, and highlight recent studies about unconventional T cells, the metabolic control of immune reactions, and novel therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing immune evasion mechanisms that promote the progression of MM.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion is one of the hallmarks of cancers, including glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of primary brain tumors. Multiple mechanisms are employed by tumor cells and its microenvironment to evade immune detection and foster tumor growth and progression. The secretion of immunosuppressive molecules such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), the expression of checkpoint proteins such programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and the recruitment of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to suppressed immune cell activity, favoring unchecked tumor growth. The FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1) has shown context/tissue-dependent effects in cancers of different tissue origins, with either oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles. Our laboratory has reported FAT1 to have an oncogenic function in glioblastoma. In addition, FAT1 promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment in glioblastoma, reducing T-cell and monocyte infiltration while increasing immunosuppressive cells such as MDSCs. It also upregulates pro-inflammatory mediators [cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)], fostering tumor-promoting signaling. This dual role in immune evasion and pro-tumorigenic inflammatory processes makes FAT1 a key driver of glioblastoma progression. This highlights the potential of FAT1 as a compelling therapeutic target. This article provides a concise overview of immune tolerance mechanisms in glioblastoma, and the crucial role of FAT1 in promoting immune tolerance and tumor advancement. In addition, this review highlights currently available immunotherapies in clinical use or undergoing trials, and the potential of FAT1 as a promising target for combinatorial therapeutic interventions.

Furthermore, a strong correlation between metabolic profiles and immune cell fate, activation, and function has been repeatedly delineated in immunometabolism. Consequently, targeting the metabolic networks, referred to as metabolic checkpoints, to reprogram immune cell phenotypes and bolster antitumor immunity holds significant promise for clinical translation.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Macrophages are heterogeneous immune cells with diverse subtypes and tissue‐specific distributions, displaying dynamic polarization states that critically govern their immunomodulatory functions and responses to environmental cues. As key regulators of innate and adaptive immunity, they originate from either embryonic progenitors or bone marrow‐derived monocytes and exhibit remarkable plasticity in response to microenvironmental cues. Tissue‐resident macrophages (e.g., Langerhans cells, Kupffer cells, microglia) display unique organ‐specific functions, while inflammatory stimuli drive their polarization into proinflammatory (M1) or anti‐inflammatory (M2) phenotypes along a functional continuum. This review systematically examines macrophage subtypes, their anatomical distribution, and the signaling pathways (e.g., NF‐κB, STATs, PPARγ) underlying polarization shifts in acute and chronic inflammation. We highlight how polarization imbalances contribute to pathologies including neuroinflammation, liver fibrosis, and impaired tissue repair, particularly in aging contexts. Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting macrophage plasticity, such as cytokine modulation, metabolic reprogramming, and subtype‐specific interventions. By integrating recent advances in macrophage biology, this work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding their dual roles in immune regulation and tissue homeostasis, offering insights for treating inflammatory and age‐related diseases through macrophage‐centered immunomodulation.">

As the immune system is increasingly recognized as a key player in cancer control, we investigate a specific type of immune cell—natural killer (NK) cells. We analyzed NK cells from blood samples of STS patients and healthy individuals. NK cells from STS patients were less functional, showing reduced degranulation and lower production of IFNγ, both essential for killing cancer cells. We also found alterations in key surface markers, which may explain their impaired function. Among these, CD27 and NKp44 were notably different between patients and healthy individuals and showed strong potential to distinguish between these groups. Higher CD27 levels were associated with NK cells that are less effective at killing cancer cells. Overall, our findings suggest that NK cells from STS patients may have a reduced capacity to fight cancer.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that drives resistance to therapy. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), including microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, promote tumor growth and immune evasion, especially in their M2-like form. This systematic review analyzed 30 studies on TAM-targeted therapies in GBM. These approaches include blocking TAM recruitment, boosting their phagocytic activity, and reprogramming TAMs. Combination strategies with immune checkpoint inhibitors, nanoparticles, and oncolytic viruses showed enhanced anti-tumor effects in preclinical models. However, clinical success is limited by TAM plasticity, poor drug delivery across the blood–brain barrier, and immunosuppressive treatments. Future therapies should focus on patient-specific approaches using detailed TME profiling and advanced delivery systems to improve treatment response and overcome current limitations.">

We discuss novel therapeutic approaches aimed at disrupting these processes and examine the potential of combining metabolic interventions with immune-based strategies—such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), epigenetic modulators, bispecific antibodies, and CAR-T/CAR-NK cell therapies—which may help overcome resistance and enhance anti-tumor responses. Several agents are currently under investigation for their ability to modulate immune cell metabolism and restore effective immune surveillance. Altogether, targeting metabolic vulnerabilities within both tumor and immune compartments offers a promising, multifaceted strategy to improve clinical outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has fundamentally reshaped oncology by harnessing the immune system to eliminate malignant cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 have achieved durable remissions in select cancers, yet most patients exhibit resistance due to tumor heterogeneity, immunometabolic rewiring, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To address these limitations, next-generation immunotherapies have emerged, targeting multiple layers of immune regulation. These include co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory checkpoint modulators, bispecific antibodies, adoptive cell therapies, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, cytokine-based strategies, and synthetic immunomodulators that activate innate sensors. Nanotechnology and in vivo immune engineering further enhance specificity, reduce toxicity, and broaden applicability. Combination immunotherapy has become central to overcoming resistance, with rational regimens integrating ICIs, cytokines, vaccines, and targeted agents. Biomarker-guided strategies, leveraging tumor mutational burden, immune cell infiltration, and multi-omic profiling, are enabling personalized approaches. However, immune-related adverse events and variability in therapeutic responses necessitate predictive biomarkers and improved patient stratification. Emerging frontiers include microbiome-targeted interventions, chronotherapy, and AI-driven modeling of tumor–immune dynamics. Equally critical is ensuring global equity through inclusive trial design, diverse biomarker validation, and expanded access to cutting-edge therapies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of multimodal immunotherapeutic strategies, their mechanistic basis, and clinical integration. By unifying innovation in immunology, synthetic biology, and systems medicine, next-generation cancer immunotherapy is poised to transition from a transformative intervention to a curative paradigm across malignancies.">

        <tr id="Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous illness influenced by intricate tumor-immune interactions and characterized by a dismal prognosis. Macrophage-mediated immunological signaling facilitates tumor proliferation and may associate inflammation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of CRC with negative outcomes. Notwithstanding therapeutic advancements, resistance to treatment remains a significant obstacle. scRNA-seq offers comprehensive insights into the immune signaling network and immunological dynamics inside the CRC’s TME. Methods We integrated scRNA-seq data from GEO with extensive RNA-seq data from TCGA to elucidate immunological signaling and dynamic cellular variation in the TME of CRC. The analyses encompassed quality control via Seurat, InferCNV, Monocle, CellChat, and SCENIC, differential gene expression, inference of copy number variation (CNV), pseudo time trajectories, and intercellular communication. Prognostic modeling was conducted using Cox regression and LASSO. Immune infiltration and drug sensitivity were evaluated by CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, xCell, TIDE, and pRRophetic. Functional validation encompassed siRNA knockdown, qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and cellular assessment in CRC cell lines. Results We discovered four categories of tumor cells exhibiting variations in cell cycle, stemness, and differentiation. The MKI67 + subpopulation exhibited a heightened dynamic cell state and engaged with macrophages via the MIF-(CD74+CD44) axis to facilitate immunological signaling. HMGA1 is a crucial transcription factor in this fraction, and its knockdown impedes CRC cell proliferation, motility, and invasion. The cancer model utilizing the MKI67 + TCs subpopulation (MTRS) successfully classified patient survival and linked with immune infiltration patterns and medication responses. Enrichment analysis revealed tumor-promoting and immunological signaling networks. Correlation scores suggest that this subpopulation may be linked to inflammation and immunosuppression inside the TME. Conclusion Our research indicates that the C2 MKI67 + TCs subpopulation is a key driver of immune signal transduction in CRC TME, which may induce inflammatory responses through interaction with macrophages, thereby leading to adverse consequences such as cardiac dysfunction. HMGA1 represents a viable target for immunotherapy, and our cancer model derived from this subpopulation offers prognostic significance and direction for immunotherapeutic treatments.">

        <tr id="The severity of certain viral infectious diseases varies across the age; we hypothesize that these variations could be related to the variation of immune responses to viral immune complexes (ICs) among the age. This study aimed to investigate monocyte activation in response to ICs in children, adults, and elderly individuals. An experimental in vitro model was established using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. Monocyte activation markers (CD169, CD38, HLA-DR), the negative co-stimulatory molecule (PD-L1), and cytokine production were measured under basal conditions and upon stimulation with human adenovirus 5-IgG immune complex (Ad5-ICs), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes from children and adults displayed similar activation profiles in response to ICs and IFN-α stimulation, characterized by increased expression of CD169 and PD-L1. In contrast, monocytes from elderly individuals exhibited weak or no overexpression of CD169 and PD-L1 coupled with a diminished PBMC cytokine response. Notably, cells from elderly participants produced high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the absence of stimulation. Multiple comparisons confirmed reduced monocyte activation and PBMC cytokine responses in the elderly compared to adults and children. Although children exhibited a significant response to ICs, their secretion of IFN-α, IP-10, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-2 was lower than that observed in adults. Our findings suggest that elderly individuals have poor and dysregulated responses to ICs, likely due to immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. Adults exhibit a robust and balanced response to ICs, while children display a moderate response, possibly influenced by ‘trained immunity’ resulting from frequent early-life exposures to pathogens. These insights highlight the importance of further research to develop age-specific therapeutic strategies to modulate immune function during viral IC exposure.">

        <tr id="Reprogramming autoreactive CD4+ effector T (Teff) cells into immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells represents a promising strategy for treating established autoimmune diseases. However, the stability and function of such reprogrammed Tregs under inflammatory conditions remain unclear. Here, we show that demethylation of core Treg identity genes in Teff cells yields lineage-stable Effector T cell Reprogrammed Tregs (ER-Tregs). A single adoptive transfer of ER-Tregs not only prevents autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice when given before disease onset but also arrests its progression when administered after onset. Compared to Foxp3-overexpressing Teff cells, induced Tregs from naïve precursors, and endogenous Tregs, ER-Tregs provide superior protection against autoimmune neuroinflammation. This enhanced efficacy stems from their inherited autoantigen specificity and selectively preserved effector-cell transcriptional programs, which together bolster their fitness in inflammatory environments and enhance their suppressive capacity. Our results establish epigenetic reprogramming of autoreactive Teff cells as an effective approach to generate potent, stable Tregs for the treatment of refractory autoimmune conditions.">

        <tr id="Cell death pathways play contrasting roles in physiological processes such as responses to viral infections and vaccinations, potentially exerting either detrimental or beneficial effects. On one hand, uncontrolled cell death accompanied by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) can lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage. On the other hand, when properly regulated, these processes help establish an immunocompetent environment by activating innate immunity, which in turn stimulate antiviral immune responses. These mechanisms have emerged as promising targets for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics, immunotherapies, and vaccines. Recent advances have elucidated key aspects of cell death and DAMP pathways, highlighting their association with upstream viral sensors, their capacity to regulate immune responses, and their potential as therapeutic targets in the context of respiratory viral infections such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of cell death and DAMP pathways, focusing on their roles in antiviral immunity and pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, and vaccine immunogenicity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are associated with enhanced tumor progression and reduced therapy response rates. Therefore, overcoming the Treg‐mediated immunosuppressive barrier within the tumor to enhance antitumor immune responses is of central interest to advance cancer immunotherapy. To date, no tools exist that can be exploited to dampen Treg function and differentiation in vivo. Here, we show for the first time that the antibiotic thiostrepton exerts a potent inhibitory effect on Tregs. Mechanistically, thiostrepton disrupts Treg differentiation, reduces the expression of Treg activation markers, and inhibits Treg suppressive functions. Accordingly, using an MC38 tumor model, we demonstrate that thiostrepton treatment reduces the number of intratumoral Foxp3+ Treg cells and prevents tumor growth. These effects are conserved in human T cells, as thiostrepton also inhibits the differentiation of human Tregs. Our findings highlight thiostrepton as a promising Treg‐targeting immunomodulatory compound with the potential to enhance antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant clonal proliferative disease originating from hematopoietic stem cells. While treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) effectively eliminates the majority of leukemia cells in patients, residual leukemia cells can still be detected in those achieving deep molecular remission, ultimately leading to drug resistance or relapse. But the exact mechanism is unclear. In recent years, the immune microenvironment has been a hot research topic in hematologic malignancies. CML patients exhibit abnormalities in antitumor immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which possess immune-suppressing functions, inhibit the proliferation and activation of CD4+/CD8+ T cells, Tregs, B cells, and NK cells, and play a central role in the antitumor immune response in a wide range of cancers. Abnormalities in numbers and functions of MDSCs are exhibited in CML patients, which affect the immune status of CML patients through multiple mechanisms. This review summarizes the biological properties of MDSCs, their alterations in CML patients, their roles and specific mechanisms in the development of CML, and how these mechanisms can be leveraged to develop new therapeutic strategies, aiming to provide novel insights and approaches for the treatment of CML.">

We aim to highlight how different components in this environment, including fibroblasts, suppressive immune cells, and genetic changes like TP53 mutations, contribute to disease progression. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can develop more effective therapies that target not just the cancer cells, but also the supportive environment around them.

M2-like TAMs promote immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis, while M1-like TAMs enhance antitumor immunity. Combining TAM-targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors is also emerging as a potential strategy to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. This review outlines TAM-mediated immunosuppression mechanisms, including the secretion of VEGF, TGF-β, and immune checkpoint molecules like PD-L1. We also summarize the current strategies targeting TAMs, such as blocking the CD47/SIRPα axis, using CD40 agonists, and PI3Kγ inhibitors, which have shown promise in preclinical studies. Overall, this review underscores TAMs as pivotal therapeutic targets and proposes future directions to optimize combinatorial immunotherapy for enhanced clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.">

While studies have focused on innate immune cell influence on adaptive immune cell functions, few have explored interactions between innate immune cells, which modulate the unique PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are responsible for clearance of neutrophil-mediated inflammation in physiologic immune responses; however, these cells co-exist in PDAC. We sought to determine how neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), neutrophil release of decondensed chromatin and intracellular contents, affect monocyte/macrophage populations in the PDAC TME. Utilizing samples from patients with PDAC, we demonstrate elevated monocyte chemokine CCL2 in plasma and elevated NET CitH3 and pan-macrophage marker CD68 in the PDAC TME via fluorescent immunohistochemistry. To determine how NETs impacted macrophage populations in the PDAC TME, we depleted NETs with DNase I and with genetic knockout of the PAD4 enzyme and found an elevation in pan-macrophage marker F4/80. The depletion led to increased T cell stimulatory signal CD80 while the pro-tumor macrophage marker CD206 was decreased. We further demonstrate that macrophages in the NET-deficient PDAC TME may be recruited through the CCL2/CCR2 axis, in which CCL2 can be released from tumor cells and macrophages in the presence of IFN-. Taken together, our findings reveal that inhibition of NETs can prime the innate immune response toward an anti-tumor phenotype.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous myeloid clonal disorders derived from hematopoietic stem cells. The incidence of MDS (1.51/100,000 in China, 4-5/100,000 in Europe and America) is higher than any subtype of leukemia. In recent years, the imbalance of immune regulation and tumor microenvironmental disorders have received increasing attention in the pathogenesis of MDS. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing protein 3 (TIM-3) is an important inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule, widely expressed in T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages and other immune cells. Numerous studies have confirmed that TIM-3 is aberrantly expressed in a variety of solid and hematologic tumors and plays an important role in regulating tumor escape and immune depletion. In this paper, we focus on reviewing the relevant studies of TIM-3 in MDS and summarize the findings of our team in this field. We also discuss the potential application of TIM-3 in the diagnosis and treatment of MDS in conjunction with the latest clinical trials. Blocking TIM-3 has both ‘tumor cell-targeted inhibition’ and ‘immune function remodeling’ dual roles in MDS disease progression, which provides new therapeutic strategies and hope for MDS patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Natural killer (NK) cells are pivotal effectors in innate antitumor immunity by mediating cytotoxicity, secreting cytokines, or expressing cell membrane receptors, which facilitate interactions with other immune cells. The cytotoxic activity and immune function of NK cells are governed by dynamic receptor–ligand interactions, cytokine networks, and metabolic–epigenetic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent years, NK cell‐based therapies are emerging as a promising clinical approach for antitumor treatment, owing to their rapid response, unique recognition mechanisms, potent cytotoxic capabilities, and memory‐like characteristics, along with their low risk of posttreatment adverse effects and cost effectiveness. However, immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming driven by TME subvert NK cell surveillance, impairing its antitumor function. This review comprehensively details molecular mechanisms underpinning NK cell dysfunction, including dysregulated activating/inhibitory receptor signaling, metabolic reprogramming, and epigenetic silencing of effector genes. We further synthesize advances in clinical strategies to restore NK cytotoxicity including ex vivo expansion for adoptive transfer, chimeric antigen receptor‐NK engineering, TME‐remodeling agents, immune checkpoint blockade, cytokine‐based therapies, and NK cell engagers targeting tumor antigens. By bridging mechanistic insights with translational applications, this work provides a framework for rationally designed NK cell‐based immunotherapies to overcome resistance across solid and hematologic malignancies.">

        <tr id="Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is an inflammatory arthritis of the spine and joints associated with intestinal inflammation, in which it is hypothesized that innate immune exposure to entero-invasive species is followed by self/bacterial peptide presentation. However, the mechanisms underlying loss of tolerance to gut bacteria in genetically at-risk individuals are unclear. Curdlan (β-1,3-glucan, dectin-1 ligand)-treated ZAP-70W163C (SKG) mice develop autoimmune arthritis and ileitis associated with Gram-negative faecal dysbiosis. Using gnotobiotic mice, we show that curdlan-treated SKG mice mono-associated with Parabacteroides goldsteinii or Lactobacillus murinus developed ileitis, arthritis and enthesitis, while BALB/c mice were tolerant. Gnotobiotic SKG ileum upregulated Il23a and ER stress genes and lost goblet cells. Whereas bacterial DNA co-localised with neutrophils and inflammatory macrophages in SKG lamina propria, peri-articular bone marrow, entheses and spleen, in BALB/c bacterial DNA co-localised with resident macrophages in lamina propria and spleen. Human psoriatic-arthritis synovial tissue also contained cell-associated peri-vascular bacterial DNA. Curdlan-treated SKG spleen/bone marrow macrophages transferred severe arthritis and expanded Th17 cells in naïve SKG recipients, while BALB/c or germ free-SKG macrophages transferred mild arthritis and regulated Th17 cells. Thus, bacterial DNA and myeloid cells in the gut and their subsequent traffic regulate or enforce T cell pathogenicity in SpA.">

First identified in the early 1990s, Tregs are now well recognized for their role in suppressing excessive immune reactions and promoting tolerance to the body’s tissues. Among the broader Treg population, Tissue regulatory T cells (Tissue Tregs) are distinct as they do more than suppress immunity; they actively contribute to tissue repair and regeneration. Studies in both mice and humans have highlighted the important role of in aiding tissue repair and maintaining tissue integrity. Recent research reveals that Tregs participate in wound healing and tissue regeneration across various organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys, muscles, lungs, bones, and central nervous system. These discoveries emphasize the wide-ranging and significant influence of Tregs in fostering recovery and healing in different tissues throughout the body. These cells are characterized by their ability to produce a variety of growth factors, cytokines, and signaling molecules that support the repair and regeneration of damaged tissues. In this review, we present an overview of the emerging understanding of Treg-mediated repair processes in damaged tissues and organs.">

Some unique features, such as rapid MHC-independent recognition of antigens, performing heterogeneous anti-tumor activities, and being less susceptible to tumor-induced suppression, suggest promising roles of ILTCs in cancer immunology. On the other hand, these cells exhibit a dualistic nature in cancer, which includes both pro-tumor and anti-tumor effects, highlighting the importance of the complex regulatory environment of their functioning and activation. The functions and evolution of ILTC are greatly influenced by microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNA molecules that mediate post-transcriptional regulation. Considering the kind of ILTCs, miRNA, and cancer type, this interaction resembles both a tumor promoter and suppressor. ILTC functions and evolution are closely associated with microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNA molecules that play posttranscriptional regulatory roles. Depending on the type of ILTCs, miRNA, and cancer, this interaction resembles both a Tumor promoter and a tumor Suppressor. This review addresses the complicated relationship between ILTCs and different miRNAs, such as miR-155, let-7 s, and miR-181a, expressed in tumor cells, ILTCs, or packed in tumor-derived exosomes. We will underscore the synergetic effects of the expression of miRNA in tumor and immune cells, influencing ILTC’s function and cancer progression. We emphasized the recent and innovative therapeutic approaches, novel delivery systems, and CAR-T cell-based strategy, and the therapeutic potential of modifying the expression of miRNA to regulate the miRNA expression to modulate ILTC activity and improve cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) in brain tumors contain two types of macrophages: tumor‐associated microglia and infiltrating macrophages. This study explored whether these two populations have the same role in brain tumor progression. In an in vitro coculture model using the astrocytoma cells ALTS1C1 with either the microglial cell line BV2 or the peripheral macrophage cell line RAW264.7, only BV2, not RAW264.7, gathers ALTS1C1 into tumor cell clusters. These BV2‐associated clusters limited ALTS1C1 proliferation but not BV2 cell growth. The in vivo studies show that the survival time of mice co‐inoculated with ALTS1C1 and BV2 was prolonged from 30.4 ± 3.1 days to more than 77 days in immune‐competent mice but not in immune‐compromised mice. Examining the tumor microenvironment (TME) by immunohistochemical staining revealed that the co‐inoculation of BV2 increased the CD8 T cells' infiltration and the expression of Granzyme B. Mice bearing with BV2‐containing ALTS1C1 tumor exhibited a reduced level of circulating myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and an elevated level of CD8 T cells in peripheral blood compared to the ALTS1C1 tumor‐bearing group. This study suggests tumor‐associated microglia restrict brain tumor development by limiting tumor cell proliferation and inducing T‐cell‐associated antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestina (GI) tumors are a major contributor to global cancer-related illness and death, marked by their rapid growth, late detection, and resistance to standard treatments. NK cells, key cytotoxic components of the innate immune system, show promise in immunotherapy due to their ability to target tumor cells without requiring antigen presentation. Nonetheless, their effectiveness against gastrointestinal tumors is constrained by issues such as insufficient tumor penetration, brief survival in the body, and suppression by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Meanwhile, nanotechnology has transformed cancer treatment by offering methods for precise drug delivery, immune system modulation, and improved bioavailability. Combining NK cells with specially designed nanoparticles (NPs) has created a powerful system with amplified cooperative anti-tumor effects, improving the targeting of tumors, activation of NK cells, and their endurance, while also allowing for control over the tumor immune microenvironment in both space and time. This thorough review investigates the complex interaction between the immunobiology of NK cells and the design of nanomaterials, specifically in the context of gastrointestinal tumors. Key areas of focus include nanoparticle-assisted engineering of NK cells, cytokine delivery, biomimetic disguise, reprogramming of the TME, and targeting of tumors specifically. We critically assess preclinical and emerging clinical evidence that supports the effectiveness of these combined therapies, analyze related safety and translational challenges, and suggest forward-looking approaches involving gene editing, innovative stimulus-responsive systems, and AI-assisted therapeutic personalization. In conclusion, this review presents the combined NK-NP approach as a promising new frontier in the advancement of personalized, immune-guided treatments for gastrointestinal cancers.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer characterized by rapid proliferation and infiltration of immune cells into tumor microenvironment (TME). The treatment of TNBC still remains challenging due to the lack of expression of effective molecular targets pertaining to the tumor cell itself. In TNBC standard of care, therapies such as chemotherapy, together with recently introduced immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors, often do not result in durable clinical response. Therefore, better understanding of complex interactions between tumor cells, immune cells, and stromal cells mediated by multiple cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and metabolites in TME is crucial for understanding the mechanisms that underlie tumor cell immune evasion strategies. The aim of this review is to give comprehensive overview of immune cell network and their interactions with cells in TME and possibilities for therapeutic targeting of TME in TNBC. We discuss cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as an important recently characterized player in TNBC with respect to their role in interactions with immune cells and their impact on tumor invasion. Based on the recently accumulated knowledge, therapies targeting immune suppressive mechanisms and CAF-related tumor-promoting mechanisms in TME hold great potential for clinical evaluation in TNBC.">

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Small extracellular vesicles (sEV) are a class of natural vesicles rich in heterogeneous cargos with the great advantage of non‐invasive detection; these vesicles exhibit complex intercellular crosstalk and mediate important biological functions. However, the potential value of plasma sEV in clinical prognosis prediction of triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) and their biological functions have not been well elucidated. In this study, we isolated sEV from non‐metastatic and metastatic TNBC plasma samples. We found that the expression of reticulin 4 (RTN4) in metastatic patients was significantly higher than that in non‐metastatic patients. At the same time, clinical data showed that RTN4 was associated with poor prognosis and advanced‐stage TNBC patients. Subsequently, in vivo and in vitro assays showed that compared to RTN4Low sEV, RTN4high sEV significantly promoted tumour cell migration, invasion, epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lung metastasis, and upregulated the expression of PD‐L1 in tumour tissues and inhibited CD8+T cell infiltration. Regarding mechanism research, we found that RTN4 within sEV drives tumour EMT and PD‐L1 expression by activating the NF‐κB signalling pathway. Further, through the combined treatment experiment of anti‐PD‐1 and anti‐RTN4, it was found that the combination of the two drugs was significantly superior to monotherapy in inhibiting tumour metastasis, EMT, and promoting CD8+T cell infiltration. Our results highlight the molecular mechanism of sEV protein RTN4 in tumour progression and immune system regulation, indicating that RTN4 targeting and anti‐PD‐1 combined therapy have clinical potential. sEV protein RTN4 is a potential new prognostic marker for non‐invasive detection of TNBC and a new target for TNBC treatment.">

Regulatory B cells (Bregs), characterized by IL-10 production, play an important role in the tumor immunity; however, the function of Bregs in PM remains unclear. We investigated the frequency and effects of Bregs on other immune cells in the PM using clinical specimens and mouse models of PM. In the peripheral blood and ascites, Breg frequency was significantly higher in patients with GC with PM than in those without PM. In clinical PM samples, Breg frequency was an independent prognostic factor. In the mouse PM model, peritoneal tumors showed higher Breg infiltration than subcutaneous tumors. In the PTEN-deficient PM model, activation of Bregs promoted ascites and peritoneal tumor growth, decreased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and increased the infiltration of M2 macrophages. In contrast, treatment with wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, suppressed Breg infiltration, resulting in decreased M2 macrophage infiltration and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration. Bregs are indicated to be involved in immunosuppression of PM and are promising targets for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy against PM.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AR-NHL), a leading malignancy among people living with HIV (PLWH), may not receive standard intensive curative therapies as the general population due to immune deficiency concerns, even in the combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and immunochemotherapy era. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of T-cell subsets landscapes is urgently needed to grasp the complex and dynamic role of the immune system in AR-NHL patients’ survival. Materials and methods This longitudinal cohort study enrolled 31 de novo adult AR-NHL patients and 52 HIV-negative NHL controls. Multi-color flow cytometry profiled peripheral blood immunophenotypes at baseline and during immunochemotherapy. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses evaluated associations between baseline risk factors and clinical outcomes. Results AR-NHL patients exhibited comparable 1-year overall survival (71.0% vs. 74.8%) and progression-free survival (60.4% vs. 64.6%) to HIV-negative NHL individuals. Baseline β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and EBER positivity were higher in AR-NHL. AR-NHL revealed persistent immune senescence during immunochemotherapy, including reduced CD4+ T cells, lower CD4/CD8 ratio, decreased Tregs, naïve CD45RA+, and memory CD45RO + CD4+ T cells, alongside elevated Tregs/CD4, CD8+, CD8 + CD28+, and CD8 + CD28− T cells, highlighting the complex HIV-driven immune compromise. Multivariate analysis identified baseline circulating CD8 + CD28− T cells as an independent predictor of inferior prognosis in AR-NHL, correlated with aggressive disease markers such as elevated β2-MG, hypoproteinemia, decreased CD4/CD8 ratio, high International Prognostic Index score, and EBER positivity. Conclusions AR-NHL patients warrant standard full-dose cancer therapy to improve prognosis despite immunocompromised and immunosenescence phenotypes. CD8 + CD28− T cells serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for AR-NHL, potentially associated with chronic immune activation and viral exposure. Our data suggest that characterizing T-cell subsets may enhance understanding of immune dynamics in AR-NHL, providing a foundation for exploring personalized approaches to infection prophylaxis.">

        <tr id="Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains a formidable malignancy with persistently poor clinical outcomes. Recent research has underscored the pivotal role of the innate immune system, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a key component of the myeloid lineage, in orchestrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and shaping disease progression. As professional phagocytes of the innate immune system, macrophages not only mediate pathogen recognition and inflammatory responses but also undergo functional polarization in response to local cues. In OSCC, dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, marked by the overrepresentation of species such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis—acts as a chronic inflammatory trigger that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune evasion, and tumor growth. These pathogenic bacteria actively engage innate immune signaling pathways such as TLRs and CSF-1R, skewing macrophages toward an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. M2-like TAMs then contribute to tumor progression by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), promoting angiogenesis, and expressing immune checkpoint ligands such as PD-L1. This review summarizes current knowledge on the bidirectional crosstalk between dysbiotic microbiota and innate immune macrophages in OSCC, highlighting key receptor-mediated pathways and their implications for immune suppression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Targeting microbiota modulation or innate immune reprogramming represents a promising strategy for restoring anti-tumor immunity and enhancing therapeutic efficacy in OSCC.">

        <tr id="Introduction Sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated immune response to infection, has a high global mortality rate. Tregs play dual roles in sepsis pathogenesis, with their expansion linked to immunosuppression. This study explores Treg dynamics and the novel role of CD82 in sepsis. Methods Peripheral blood from sepsis patients was analyzed using scRNA-seq. Machine learning (SVM, LASSO, random forest) integrated scRNA-seq data with three GEO datasets (n=380) to identify biomarkers. CD82 expression in Tregs was validated via flow cytometry and RT-qPCR in CLP mouse model. Anti-CD25 antibody depleted Tregs in mice. Results The scRNA-seq revealed neutrophil expansion and T/NK cell reduction in sepsis. Tregs were enriched and exhibited CD82 upregulation. A seven-gene diagnostic signature (CD82, CD52, EVI2B, IL32, RCAN3, AQP3, NAP1L1) achieved high accuracy (AUCs up to 99.9%). Treg-depleted CLP mice showed reduced CD82 expression, elevated IL-6 and neutrophils, and worsened inflammation, implicating CD82 in immune modulation. Discussion CD82 may mediate Treg hyperactivation during sepsis, balancing the immune response and suppression. The gene signature shows diagnostic potential, but CD82’s mechanistic role needs further investigation. Therapeutic targeting of CD82 could improve sepsis management.">

        <tr id="Cell culture-based influenza vaccines exhibit comparable safety and immunogenicity to traditional egg-based vaccines. However, improving viral yield remains a key challenge in optimizing cell culture-based production systems. Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, the predominant cell line for influenza vaccine production, inherently activate interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral defenses that restrict viral replication. To overcome this limitation, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to generate an IFN alpha/beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1)-knockout (KO) adherent MDCK cell line. Viral titer analysis demonstrated significant enhancements in the yield of multiple vaccine strains (H1N1, H3N2, and type B) in IFNAR1-KO cells compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Transcriptomic profiling revealed marked downregulation of key interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)—including OAS, MX2, and ISG15—within the IFNAR1-KO cells, indicating a persistent suppression of antiviral responses that established a more permissive microenvironment for influenza virus replication. Collectively, the engineered IFNAR1-KO cell line provides a valuable tool for influenza virus research and a promising strategy for optimizing large-scale MDCK cell cultures to enhance vaccine production efficiency.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Occurance of cancer and its outcomes are heavily influenced by its surroundings, known as the tumor microenvironment (TME). One key player in this environment is a type of cell called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). These cells are very active and influence how cancer behaves by interacting with the immune system. CAFs modulate tumor infiltrating immune cells and send out chemical signals for their immunosuppressive actions, rendering them weaken for attaking tumor. They also change the structure around the tumor, helping it grow, spread, and resist treatment. CAFs can even turn off immune cells by increasing immune “checkpoints” that block their function. Because of their major role in helping cancer thrive, understanding CAFs and how they communicate with immune cells is essential for improving cancer treatments, especially immunotherapy. This review highlights the latest knowledge about how CAFs shape an environment that protects tumors and resist tumor cell death.">

        <tr id="Influenza causes 3–5 million severe cases globally each year, with severe viral pneumonia often requiring hospitalization for over four weeks. While the inflammatory response to influenza infection helps control viral replication, excessive inflammation is a key driver of disease severity and mortality. Excessive pulmonary lymphocytes, particularly IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes, contribute significantly to pulmonary inflammation at the late-stage of H1N1 viral infection. Cyclosporin A, a potent T-cell inhibitor, mitigates influenza A virus-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. However, the therapeutic role of lymphocyte suppression in cyclosporin A-mediated attenuation of H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the viral titer was 0 in all the homogenized lung tissues of mice on Day-21 post a sublethal H1N1 viral infection. H1N1 viral infection caused worsened general condition and pulmonary inflammation with the infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils on Day-21 post-infection. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of H1N1 virus-infected mice showed a 16-fold higher lymphocyte count compared to neutrophils. H1N1 viral infection significantly elevated both IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations and IFN-γ levels in mouse lungs. H1N1 viral infection additionally expanded IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations in both spleen and peripheral blood. Cyclosporin A treatment significantly mitigated H1N1 viral infection-induced worsened general condition, pulmonary lymphocytic inflammation, increases of pulmonary IFN-γ concentrations and IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes in the lung, spleen and blood of mice on Day-21 post-infection. Together, lymphocytes may contribute significantly to H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation. Cyclosporin A may alleviate H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation through decreasing IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes.

        <tr id="Background Elite controllers can spontaneously control HIV-1 infection without antiretroviral treatment but remain at risk of developing non-AIDS-related conditions. The adaptive immune system is key in mediating spontaneous viral control; however, the innate immune response remains understudied. We assessed the quality of the innate immune responses by evaluating the phenotype and function of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in South African adults living with HIV (PWH). Methodology A total of 73 black South Africans were included in this study. Of these, 55 were living with HIV and included 16 individuals with spontaneous viral control (PWHEC), 20 HIV progressors (PWHPROG), and 19 individuals suppressed on ART (PWHART). Eighteen individuals without HIV infection (PWOHHIV-) served as the control group. Monocyte subsets, T cell and monocyte activation and the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) by monocytes, myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells were analyzed using multicolour flow cytometry following stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR)4 (LPS), TLR7/8 (CL097), and TLR9 (CpG-ODN2216) ligands. Plasma biomarkers, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and D-dimer were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Our findings show a reduced expression of CD86 on monocytes of PWHEC (p=0.04) compared to PWOHHIV-. A reduced frequency of the classical monocyte (CD14+CD16) subset in PWHEC (p=0.02) and PWHPROG (p=0.05) compared to PWOHHIV-. TNF-α and IL-1β production was lower in monocytes and mDCs of PWHEC compared to PWOHHIV- post-stimulation with TLR4, and TLR7/8 (all p<0.05). Increased sCD14 levels in PWHEC compared to PWOHHIV- (p=0.01) indicate persistent immune activation, whereas increased D-dimer levels in PWHPROG compared to PWHART (p=0.01) and PWHEC (p=0.04) suggest higher inflammation in PWHPROG. Conclusion PWHEC exhibits similar immune responses as other PWH including PWHPROG, their innate immune profiles are characterized by lower levels of monocyte activation, reduced levels of classical monocytes, reduced capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and elevated biomarkers associated with unfavourable disease outcomes. These findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring and potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate chronic inflammation in PWHEC. Furthermore, it expands our understanding of complex innate immune cell responses in PWHEC.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in coordinating immune responses by linking innate and adaptive immunity through their exceptional antigen-presenting capabilities. Recent studies reveal that metabolic reprogramming—especially pathways involving acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)—critically influences DC function in both physiological and pathological contexts. This review consolidates current knowledge on how environmental factors, tumor-derived signals, and intrinsic metabolic pathways collectively regulate DC development, subset differentiation, and functional adaptability. Acetyl-CoA emerges as a dual-function metabolite, serving not only as an energy carrier but also as an epigenetic regulator that controls DC fate via lipid biosynthesis, mitochondrial metabolism, and chromatin modification. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), DCs may experience immune suppression polarization and insufficient T cell activation due to disrupted acetyl-CoA related metabolic pathways. While existing DC-based therapies remain constrained by TME-induced metabolic limitations, emerging approaches that restore acetyl-CoA related metabolic pathways balance show enhanced antitumor efficacy. The review further examines distinct metabolic adaptations among DC subsets and their relevance to autoimmune diseases, infectious immunity, and transplant outcomes. By integrating current research on targeting DC metabolic targets, we outline strategies for developing immunotherapies that target DC metabolic flexibility. Remaining hurdles include tailoring interventions to specific subsets, refining metabolic manipulation techniques, and addressing TME heterogeneity through combination therapies. These findings position acetyl-CoA as a key therapeutic target for recalibrating immunometabolism circuits, with significant implications for DC-focused cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with limited responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies in most patients. Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a crucial role in immunotherapy outcomes. Among various metabolic abnormalities in the TIME, dysregulated lipid metabolism has emerged as a critical determinant of immune cell fate, differentiation, and function. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the current understanding of the immune landscape in GC, focusing on how altered lipid metabolism reshapes immune cell populations—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. We highlight key metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation(FAO), cholesterol homeostasis, and lipid uptake that impact immune cell activity, contributing to immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Importantly, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism, including inhibitors of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and discuss their synergistic potential when combined with ICB therapies. In conclusion, lipid metabolic reprogramming represents a promising yet underexplored axis in modulating antitumor immunity in GC. Integrating metabolic intervention with immunotherapy holds potential to overcome current treatment limitations and improve clinical outcomes. Future studies incorporating spatial omics and single-cell profiling will be essential to elucidate cell-type specific metabolic dependencies and foster translational breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, whose progression is intimately linked to the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Exosomes, once considered mere cellular waste, have emerged as pivotal mediators of intercellular communication within the TME, actively participating in the multistep development of HCC. These nanoscale vesicles play crucial roles in the initiation of precancerous lesions and, by transporting drug resistance-related molecules such as proteins and non-coding RNAs, facilitate the acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapies by tumor cells. Moreover, exosomes contribute to the establishment of pre-metastatic niches by remodeling distant organ microenvironments—inducing hypoxia, metabolic reprogramming, and angiogenesis—which collectively create favorable conditions for tumor cell colonization. They also modulate immune responses by inducing T-cell exhaustion, promoting macrophage polarization, and disrupting normal stromal cell functions, thereby constructing an immunosuppressive microenvironment that enables tumor immune evasion. Given their inherent biocompatibility and targeting capabilities, engineered exosomes have shown promise in cancer therapy, serving as carriers for therapeutic molecules and enabling precise drug delivery through surface modifications. Despite significant advancements, challenges remain in elucidating the in vivo regulatory mechanisms of exosomes, standardizing their isolation and purification processes, and evaluating their clinical efficacy. This review examines the multifaceted roles of exosomes in HCC, aiming to bridge mechanistic insights with precision diagnostics and pave new avenues for liver cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the most common co-infection among people living with HIV (PLWH), aggravates the associated morbidity and mortality in these individuals; however, the immune-modulatory role of Mtb in the pathogenesis of HIV infection remains incompletely understood. Methods: We investigated the role of Mtb infection in regulating adaptive immune responses with reference to the expression of five immune checkpoint molecules (ICMs) in co-infected individuals in a cross-sectional study conducted on treatment-naïve human cohorts from North India, including PLWH, people with Mtb infection, people with HIV-Mtb co-infection, and healthy volunteers as controls. Results: The data revealed a significantly increased gene expression of TIM-3 (p = 0.0058), LAG-3 (p < 0.0001), PD-1 (p = 0.0090), and CTLA-4 (p = 0.0008). It also revealed a higher frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells surface-expressing TIM-3+, CTLA-4+, LAG-3+. Finally, it showed cells co-expressing two ICMs together (p < 0.05) in individuals with HIV–Mtb co-infection as compared to HIV mono-infected ones. Interestingly, the frequency of these cells correlated inversely with the absolute CD4+ T-cell count and positively with the plasma viral load (p < 0.05), indicating direct association with HIV disease progression. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Mtb co-infection exacerbates immune exhaustion in co-infected individuals. Targeting ICMs with pharmacological immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) offers a promising approach for better clinical management of co-infected individuals.">

        <tr id="Background The hematopoietic ecosystem comprises both cellular components such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and immune cells as well as non-cellular components including iron. Systemic iron overload, which leads to serious complications and affects both patients’ quality of life and overall survival, is a common clinical challenge in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We previously elucidated the direct effects of iron overload on AML cells. It’s worth noting that iron overload remodels the hematopoietic ecosystem. However, whether and how remodeled leukemic microenvironment with overloaded iron regulates normal HSCs and immune cells, especially leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs), in AML have not been elucidated. Methods The MLL-AF9-induced AML (MA9) cells were originated from c-kit+ BM cells enriched from C57BL/6J mice that infected with MSCV-MLL-AF9-GFP retrovirus. The MA9 AML mouse model was established by transplantation of MA9 cells into C57BL/6 mice. MA9 mice were i.p. administered with iron dextran every other day for a total of 6 times to established the iron overload MLL-AF9-induced AML mouse model (MA9/FE). HSC maintenance and differentiation was assessed by flow cytometry, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, colony forming and competitive transplantation assays. LAM activation and function was analyzed by RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry and coculture assay. Intravenous clodronate liposome administration was employed to reduce LAMs in AML. Results Iron overload skewed myeloid differentiation of normal HSCs. Furthermore, iron overload affected LAMs in the AML microenvironment by promoting LAM polarization toward an M2 phenotype. Functionally, iron overload decreased the phagocytic function of LAMs against leukemia cells and inhibited LAM-induced T cell activation by acquiring a tolerogenic phenotype with aberrant immune checkpoints. Moreover, depletion of LAMs attenuated iron overload caused acceleration of AML progression. Conclusions Collectively, this study reveals the significance of iron overload in remodeling hematopoietic ecosystem and affecting HSC and LAM function in AML, providing new insights into the multifaceted role of iron overload in leukemia.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Neutrophils, constituting a predominant subset of innate immune cells in mammalian systems, play pivotal roles in pathogenic clearance and homeostatic maintenance. In the progressive development of cancer, neutrophils exert dual roles in both anticancer and procancer processes through their heterogeneity. In recent years, research into the role of neutrophils in cancer and various nontumor diseases has been continuously deepening. However, current research in this area remains incomplete. This review comprehensively summarizes the tissue homing dynamics, lifespan regulation, and physiological functions of neutrophils, starting from their development and heterogeneity. Furthermore, we delineate the dual regulatory functions of neutrophils in carcinogenesis, encompassing both tumor‐suppressive mechanisms and protumor mechanisms. This section further synthesizes recent advancements in neutrophil‐targeted therapeutic platforms and biomimetic delivery systems, while critically evaluating persistent methodological and translational challenges in clinical applications. In addition, we systematically analyze the role of neutrophils in non‐neoplastic diseases and list several typical diseases, including infectious diseases. Finally, we also discuss current controversies and research perspectives on neutrophils. It is hoped that this review will deepen insights into the role of neutrophils in homeostasis and disease, while exploring their potential in disease treatment.">

        <tr id="Endometriosis (EMs) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by dysregulated innate immunity, particularly impaired cytotoxic function of natural killer (NK) cells. As pivotal effectors of the innate immune response, NK cells fail to eliminate ectopic endometrial lesions due to aberrant receptor–ligand interactions, elevated levels of immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-10), and dysfunction of adhesion molecules. This compromised immune surveillance facilitates the survival and implantation of ectopic lesions, contributing to the hallmark symptoms of pain and infertility. Recent immunotherapeutic strategies, including NK cell checkpoint blockade (anti-NKG2A, anti-PD-1), IL-2-based activation, and adoptive NK cell transfer—seek to restore NK cell cytotoxicity and reestablish immune homeostasis. This review summarizes current advances in understanding NK cell dysfunction in EMs, emphasizing its central role in immune evasion and the therapeutic promise of targeting innate immune pathways.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). CD4+ CD25+hi Tregs, which normally suppress immune responses, exhibit impaired function in MS. Treg-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry immunoregulatory proteins and miRNAs that modulate T-cell activity. However, EVs from MS patients show reduced suppressive capacity, suggesting their dysfunction contributes to MS pathogenesis. This highlights EVs' potential role in MS development and therapy. Methods: Tregs were differentiated from naïve T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donor, then transduced with B2M-shRNA lentivirus to generate HLA class I-knockdown Tregs. Extracellular vesicles—including natural vesicles, cytochalasin B-induced artificial vesicles, and ultrasound-induced artificial vesicles—were isolated from Tregs and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), flow cytometry, and Western blot. Their effects on healthy donor and MS patient PBMCs were evaluated via flow cytometry and ELISA (IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ). Results: Ultrasonication yielded a higher number оf vesicles enriched with key immunosuppressive proteins, including PD-1 and Tim-3, compared to cytochalasin B. Functional assays demonstrated the ability оf ultrasonication-induced AVs to suppress inflammatory markers, such as IFNγ, and modulate the cytokine profile in both healthy and MS-derived PBMCs. Conclusion: Developing effective MS therapies remains challenging. While cellular therapies face limitations like Treg dysfunction and CNS delivery issues, allogeneic EVs offer a promising alternative due to their scalability, low immunogenicity, and blood-brain barrier penetration. We developed Treg-derived artificial vesicles (TrAVs) that maintain immunosuppressive properties and modulate PBMC responses, suggesting therapeutic potential for MS. Further research is needed to optimize production and validate efficacy in disease models.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous condition, arising from a disrupted immune response to infection that can progress to organ failure and carries a high risk of death. In recent years, growing attention has been paid to the role of epigenetic mechanisms—including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and RNA methylation—in shaping immune activity during sepsis. These processes affect immune functions such as macrophage polarization, cytokine release, and the exhaustion of immune cells, and they help explain the shift from an initial phase of overwhelming inflammation to a later state of immune suppression. Epigenetic alterations also contribute to tissue-specific damage, notably in the lungs, kidneys, and heart, and have been linked to disease severity and clinical prognosis. Advances in transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling have made it possible to distinguish molecular subtypes of septic patients, each with distinct immune features and varied responses to treatments such as corticosteroids and metabolic therapies. Emerging biomarkers—like AQP5 methylation, histone lactylation (H3K18la), and m6A RNA methylation—are opening new options for patient classification and more tailored therapeutic strategies. This review examines the current understanding of how epigenetic regulation contributes to the pathophysiology of sepsis and considers its implications for developing more individualized approaches to care.">

        <tr id="Immune organoids have emerged as a ground-breaking platform in immunology, offering a physiologically relevant and controllable environment to model human immune responses and evaluate immunotherapeutic strategies. Derived from stem cells or primary tissues, these three-dimensional constructs recapitulate key aspects of lymphoid tissue architecture, cellular diversity, and functional dynamics, providing a more accurate alternative to traditional two-dimensional cultures and animal models. Their ability to mimic complex immune microenvironments has positioned immune organoids at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy development, autoimmune disease modeling, and personalized medicine. This narrative review highlights the advances in immune organoid technology, with a focus on their applications in testing immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, and cancer vaccines. It also explores how immune organoids facilitate the study of autoimmune disease pathogenesis with insights into their molecular basis and support in high-throughput drug screening. Despite their transformative potential, immune organoids face significant challenges, including the replication of systemic immune interactions, standardization of fabrication protocols, scalability limitations, biological heterogeneity, and the absence of vascularization, which restricts organoid size and maturation. Future directions emphasize the integration of immune organoids with multi-organ systems to better replicate systemic physiology, the development of advanced biomaterials that closely mimic lymphoid extracellular matrices, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize organoid production and data analysis, and the rigorous clinical validation of organoid-derived findings. Continued innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential to overcome existing barriers, enabling the widespread adoption of immune organoids as indispensable tools for advancing immunotherapy, vaccine development, and precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening disease caused by a dysfunctional host response to infection. During sepsis, inflammation-related immunosuppression is the critical factor causing secondary infection and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The regulatory mechanisms underlying regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation and function, which significantly contribute to septic immunosuppression, require further clarification. In this study, we found that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) participated in the development of sepsis-induced immunosuppression by enhancing Treg differentiation and function via direct interaction with CD4+ T cells. Briefly, NETs anchored enolase 1 (ENO1) on the membrane of CD4+ T cells through its key protein myeloperoxidase (MPO) and subsequently recruited interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 (IFITM2). IFITM2 acted as a DNA receptor that sensed NETs-DNA and activated intracellular RAS-associated protein 1B (RAP1B) and its downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway to promote Treg differentiation and function. ENO1 inhibition significantly attenuated NETs-induced Treg differentiation and alleviated sepsis in mice. Overall, we demonstrated the role of NETs in sepsis-induced immunosuppression by enhancing Treg differentiation, identified ENO1 as an anchor of NETs-MPO, and elucidated the downstream molecular mechanism by which IFITM2-RAP1B-ERK regulated Treg differentiation. These findings improve our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of sepsis and provide potential therapeutic targets for sepsis-induced immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="Effective strategies to reinvigorate the immune system are needed to improve outcomes in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Targeting Src family kinases with dasatinib (Dasa) can elicit immunomodulatory effects in some cancer types. Here, we explored the potential of combining Dasa with immune checkpoint blockade in SCLC. While the SCLC models were refractory to anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA4 monotherapy, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 combination immunotherapy (ITc) induced a significant antitumor response. Further, the Dasa+ITc combination was superior to ITc or Dasa alone. Dasa+ITc activity was mediated by CD4+ T cells, MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells (APCs), and natural killer (NK) cells, as depletion of these populations impeded the combination treatment antitumor efficacy. Increased tumor infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK cells, M1-like macrophages, and CD11c+ APCs and a reduction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages were found in Dasa+ITc-treated mice. Dasa increased CCL5 in NK cells and reduced Treg cell conversion from CD4+ lymphocytes. Dasa+ITc therapy elicited robust antitumor efficacy in 3D co-cultures of immune and SCLC cells. In vivo experiments showed that CCL5 was necessary for the Dasa+ITc response. In SCLC immunotherapy-treated patients, a gene signature including CD4, CIITA, and tumor mutational burden predicted good prognosis. On-treatment CCL5 plasma levels were increased only in patients with long progression-free survival, and pre-treatment secretomics identified cytokines related to myeloid cells significantly associated with poor prognosis. In summary, combining Dasa with immunotherapy represents a strategy to treat SCLC, with CCL5 as a cytokine that could serve to monitor response.">

        <tr id="Background Metabolic adaptations can sustain the pro-neoplastic functions exerted by macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), aggressive and incurable sarcomas that develop either sporadically or in the context of the genetic syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 1, are highly infiltrated by macrophages, whose contribution to MPNST growth remains poorly characterized. Here, we analyze the role played by the molecular chaperone TRAP1, a regulator of mitochondrial metabolic pathways, in shaping the pro-tumoral activity of macrophages associated to MPNST cells. Methods We have studied the phenotypic changes elicited by a MPNST cell-conditioned medium in macrophages with or without TRAP1, and their subsequent ability to support MPNST cell growth and migration and endothelial cell angiogenesis. Results The presence of TRAP1 is required in both naive and M2-like macrophages for eliciting phenotypic changes that lead to the acquisition of pro-neoplastic features. TRAP1-expressing macrophages become able to sustain MPNST cell growth and migration and to exert pro-angiogenic properties on endothelial cells through accumulation of the metabolite succinate and the ensuing activation of a HIF-1α-dependent transcriptional program. Conclusions Our data provide evidence of a molecular crosstalk between MPNST cellular components, in which soluble factors released by cancer cells drive phenotypic changes in macrophages that in turn enhance pro-tumoral biological routines in both MPNST and endothelial cells. TRAP1-dependent metabolic rewiring in macrophages is mandatory for sustaining this interplay, as a TRAP1-succinate-HIF-1α signaling axis orchestrates their acquisition of tumor-promoting features.

        <tr id="Introduction Cannabidiol (CBD) is widely used as a natural alternative supplementary treatment for side effects and symptom relief in many diseases. Although the benefits and risks of using CBDs are still largely unknown, consumption has grown constantly. Methods Primary human neutrophils were isolated and exposed to CBD. Neutrophil functions such as oxidative burst, cytokine and chemokine production, bacterial killing, NET formation, and expression of cell surface markers were assessed. Conditioned media (CM) from cells treated with or without CBD were collected, and their impact on cancer cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis was examined. Furthermore, Neutrophil/T-cells co-culture was conducted to determine their effects on T-cell proliferation and activation. Results We show that CBD induces human primary neutrophils to polarize into an N2-like cancer-promoting phenotype. CBD-exposed neutrophils exhibit reduced oxidative burst, reduce bacterial killing, and altered the production of cytokine and chemokine arrays like N2-polarized cells. CBD-treated cells also rapidly display a landscape of surface markers compatible with the described setup, known for N2-polarized cells, and promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and boost the expression of PD-L1 in cancer cells. Furthermore, CBD-stimulated neutrophils suppressed T-cell proliferation, suggesting that this signalling pathway may be involved in regulating T-cell antitumor immunity and immunotherapy. Discussion Our study highlights a potential risk of CBD use in cancer patients and underscores the need for further investigation into its immunological effects and signalling mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Cellular immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in oncology, revolutionizing cancer treatment paradigms. Since the groundbreaking development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Yamanaka in 2008, significant progress has been made in generating various iPSCs-derived immunocytes, including T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells. These engineered immune cells offer unprecedented opportunities for personalized cancer therapy as they can be derived from patients’ own cells to minimize immune rejection. In addition, various new techniques are being used for the induction and amplification of iPSCs-derived immunocytes, such as small-molecule techniques, 3D culture systems, nanotechnology, and animal models for the in vivo amplification of immunocytes. Of course, challenges remain in improving immunocyte characteristics. Targeting efficiency needs enhancement to better distinguish tumor cells from healthy tissue, while biological activity must be optimized for sustained antitumor effects. Safety concerns, particularly regarding potential off-target effects and cytokine release syndrome, require further investigation. The immunosuppressive nature of tumor microenvironment also poses significant hurdles for solid tumor treatment. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring the therapeutic potential of iPSCs-derived immunocytes, with researchers investigating combination therapies and genetic modifications to overcome current limitations.">

        <tr id="Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, necessitating the development of effective anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Dendritic cells (DCs), as professional antigen-presenting cells, are key regulators of immune responses. In this study, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of LSI312A, a novel compound derived from medicinal plant analogues, on DC function and inflammatory signaling pathways. LSI312A exhibited no cytotoxicity in DC2.4 cells at concentrations up to 20 μM. LSI312A significantly reduced antigen uptake and impaired the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, particularly MHC class II and CD40, upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Moreover, LSI312A markedly suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, and decreased nitric oxide (NO) production by downregulating iNOS expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Mechanistically, LSI312A inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-κB, a central regulator of inflammatory responses, while promoting Nrf2 nuclear translocation, an essential factor in antioxidant signaling. Furthermore, LSI312A effectively suppressed the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, contributing to its anti-inflammatory effects. These results suggest that LSI312A modulates key inflammatory pathways and DC-mediated immune responses, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic candidate for inflammation-related diseases.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for maintaining immune balance by controlling the activation and expansion of other immune cells. Conventional suppression assays often rely on co-culturing purified cell populations, which limits multiplexed phenotyping and physiological relevance. This protocol describes a high-dimensional, single-cell assay for profiling Treg-mediated suppression within a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) system. Tregs are first isolated by cell sorting and then reintroduced into autologous PBMCs at defined ratios. A 52-marker mass cytometry (CyTOF) panel is used to quantify cell division and phenotypic responses across multiple immune subsets. This approach allows for integrated analysis of Treg function with broad compatibility for patient profiling and drug evaluation. Key features • Quantifies Treg-mediated suppression in autologous PBMCs at single-cell resolution. • Enables high-dimensional phenotyping and proliferation tracking across multiple immune subsets using a 52-marker CyTOF panel. • Maintains physiological relevance by assessing suppression in a complex PBMC environment. • Compatible with patient-derived samples and drug perturbation experiments for translational immunology applications">

        <tr id="The anti-tumor role of the immune system has long been associated with interferon-γ-mediated activation of immune cells and their ability to recognize and eliminate transformed cells. Fundamental principles of tumor immunoediting describe a dynamic interplay between the immune system and neoplastic cells, wherein immune pressure can paradoxically shape tumor evolution. Within this context, macrophages, natural killer cells, and T lymphocytes are central effectors of anti-tumor immunity. Traditionally, macrophages exhibiting M1 phenotype are characterized by high cytotoxic potential and considered important contributors to tumor eradication. In contrast, M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages are associated with immune suppression and tumor progression. However, recent evidence challenges this binary paradigm. It is increasingly evident that M1 macrophages, while initially exerting anti-tumor effects, can also promote tumor progression by applying sustained cytotoxic pressure that selects for more malignant and immune-resistant tumor clones. This phenomenon represents an unexpected and overlooked contribution of cytotoxic macrophages to tumor progression. In this review, we examine the complex, context-dependent function of M1 macrophages and reassess current strategies aimed at enhancing their cytotoxicity. While such approaches may offer short-term benefits, they risk driving clonal selection of aggressive, immune-evasive tumor cells. Therefore, we propose a paradigm shift: instead of promoting M1 polarization alone, therapeutic strategies should consider the broader consequences of macrophage–tumor interactions. A nuanced understanding of macrophage plasticity and tumor dynamics is essential for designing effective immunotherapies. Recognizing the paradoxical role of M1 macrophages is critical to avoiding unintended support of tumor evolution and improving treatment outcomes.">

Although prior studies implicate NK cell exhaustion within the TME related to ferroptosis, the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. This study demonstrates that upon infiltrating the ovarian cancer TME, NK cells activate an integrated stress response (ISR) centered on ATF3. This ATF3-mediated ISR suppresses NRF2 expression, compromising their ability to counteract oxidative stress and ultimately triggering ferroptosis. Critically, we show that co-treatment with the ISR inhibitor ISRIB and NK cells not only prevents NK cell ferroptosis but also synergizes to enhance tumor cell killing. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms driving NK cell exhaustion within the TME and identify ISR inhibition as a promising therapeutic target and intervention strategy for developing NK cell-based therapies against ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma represents the most common principal malignant bone tumor that predominantly appears among teenagers and children. While multimodal treatment methods have greatly evolved with time, survival for recurrent or metastatic disease remains low due to the resistance that accumulates during treatment. Increasing evidence identifies the tumor microenvironment (TME), in particular cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as playing an important role in imposing immune suppression, enhancing tumor aggressiveness, and mediating resistance toward immunotherapy and chemotherapy. This article gives an overview of the derivation, phenotypic heterogeneity, and mechanisms of action of CAFs during osteosarcoma, such as facilitating immune escape, survival signaling, drug efflux, regulation of genes through exosomes, and inhibiting ferroptosis. Furthermore, we present existing and new treatment methods that are centered on CAFs, such as suppression of the paracrine pathway (e.g., IL-6/STAT3, TGF-β), depletion of CAFs lineages by targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and conversion toward tumor-restraining CAFs. Other methods that are gaining popularity are targeting CAFs-releasing exosomes and metabolic liabilities. By shedding light on CAFs-based methods for imposing resistance and trying targeted treatments, this review offers insights into novel therapeutic combinations that can overcome treatment barriers and improve survival outcomes in osteosarcoma regimens.">

        <tr id="Granulomas play a crucial role in the pathology of tuberculosis, but the immune environment governing their formation remains largely unknown. To explore the dynamic changes in the immune microenvironment during the formation of tuberculous granulomas, we infected adult zebrafish with Mycobacterium marinum and then examined uninfected and infected kidneys, as well as large and small granulomas in the kidneys. Using single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we identified two major macrophage subpopulations in the hematopoietic tissue (kidney) of zebrafish under uninfected physiological conditions: monocyte derived and tissue-resident macrophages. Interestingly, the infection induced the emergence of epithelioid cells and a previously undescribed grna.2+ macrophage subpopulation. Depletion of grna.2+ macrophages with the nitroreductase-metronidazole ablation system resulted in shortened zebrafish survival after infection, increased bacterial load, and more granulomas, especially necrotic granulomas. Depletion of grna.2+ macrophages also produced a denser granuloma structure with fewer T cells. RNA-seq and flow cytometry analysis revealed that depletion of grna.2+ macrophages led to upregulated inflammatory signaling pathways, including tnfα and il1β, and increased macrophage lytic cell death. Similarly, in samples from tuberculosis patients, we also identified GRN-positive macrophages, which exhibit similar anti-inflammatory functions. This subset of grna.2+ macrophages present in developing granulomas can suppress excessive inflammatory responses to alleviate macrophage lytic death, reduce tissue damage, promote T cell infiltration and ultimately help control mycobacterial growth in vivo.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), derived from circulating monocytes recruited to tumor sites via chemotactic signals such as C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), are pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Functionally polarized into distinct subtypes, TAMs play dual roles: proinflammatory M1-type TAMs enhance antitumor immunity through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, whereas M2-type TAMs promote tumor progression by facilitating angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. This polarization is dynamically regulated by different cytokines, various signaling pathways, and metabolic cues within the TME. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that M2-like TAMs predominantly infiltrate hypoxic and stromal regions, where they secrete factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to remodel the extracellular matrix and suppress immune responses via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and arginase-1 upregulation. Crucially, TAMs interact extensively with immune cells; M2-TAMs secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TGF-β to inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes while expanding regulatory T (Treg) cells and impairing natural killer (NK) cell function via altered antigen presentation. Conversely, M1-TAMs synergize with dendritic cells to enhance T-cell priming. Therapeutically, targeting TAMs offers promising strategies, including colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors, CCL2 antagonists, and nanoparticle-mediated repolarization of M2-TAMs toward the M1 phenotype. Emerging genetic approaches, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) editing, aim to disrupt protumorigenic pathways in TAMs. Additionally, TAM-related biomarkers (e.g., CD206 and CD163) are being evaluated for their prognostic and predictive utility in immunotherapies. Despite progress, challenges persist owing to TAM plasticity and TME heterogeneity across cancers. This review synthesizes TAM biology, immune crosstalk, and therapeutic advancements, providing a foundation for novel oncology strategies aimed at reprogramming TAMs to overcome treatment resistance and improve clinical outcomes.">

However, direct studies of these viruses in humans are limited by ethical constraints, technical challenges, and their strict species specificity. To overcome these barriers, researchers have developed surrogate models, with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) emerging as a tractable and widely utilized system. MHV68 shares key genetic and biological features with EBV and KSHV, providing critical insights into GHV pathogenesis, including viral latency, reactivation, immune evasion, and virus‐host interactions. This review summarizes current cellular and animal models for GHV research, highlighting the advantages and limitations of MHV68 as a model for studying human GHVs. We explore mechanisms of viral gene function, immune modulation, and host responses, and discuss how these models have advanced our understanding of GHV‐associated diseases. Improved model systems will be essential for guiding future experimental approaches and developing targeted therapies for GHV‐driven malignancies and other related disorders.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and the most common malignant myeloid disorder in adults. Extensive research has elucidated the broad spectrum of biological mechanisms contributing to the development of AML and specifically characterized a variety of genetic alterations initiating and defining the disease. However, the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AML remains relatively unexplored; indeed, studies on the contribution of inflammatory signaling to disease initiation in myeloid malignancies have only recently gained attention, marking an emerging area of research. AML has the highest incidence in the elderly, where inflammation plays an even greater role. A granular understanding of inflammatory processes driving leukemogenesis thus promises to guide therapeutic strategies for a patient population where outcomes remain dismal. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of the current knowledge on the role of inflammatory signaling in AML pathogenesis. It discusses the role of inflammation from premalignant states through malignant transformation, dissecting phenotypic, correlative studies from mechanistic evidence. We thereby highlight questions requiring further research to exploit the translational potential of therapies targeting inflammatory signaling and to address challenges with current immune‐modulating treatments. A particular focus is placed on assessing the role of inflammation in the interplay with genetic events as established factors in disease initiation and progression to clarify the current understanding of inflammatory signaling in AML pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Despite recent progress within the field of immuno-oncology, immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment, defective antigen presentation, and low levels of tumor-specific T cells are key limitations of current cancer immunotherapies. CD40-targeting immunotherapies hold promises for addressing these limitations across solid tumors. Here, we describe ATOR-4066, a bispecific antibody that targets CD40 and CEACAM5 developed for immunotherapy of cancer using the Neo-X-Prime platform. ATOR-4066 showed potent CEACAM5-dependent activation in vitro with ability to activate intratumoral immune cells from patient derived material. In vivo, ATOR-4066 induced superior anti-tumor activity compared to CD40 mAb in MC38-CEA tumors and cured mice with well-established tumors with a heterogeneous CEACAM5 expression. Using RNA sequencing, flow cytometry and cytokine analysis, we show that ATOR-4066 promotes immune cell trafficking to tumors and activates both myeloid cells and T cells within the tumor microenvironment, with limited immune activation in the periphery. ATOR-4066 initially induces a T cell-independent anti-tumor response, yet a functional T cell response is critical for long-term tumor control and immunity directed to tumor antigens other than CEACAM5. Finally, we demonstrate that ATOR-4066 synergizes with PD-1 blockade in vitro. In conclusion, these data provide mechanistic evidence for the proposed mode of action and support further development of ATOR-4066 in CEACAM5 expressing cancers.">

Bacterial pneumonia poses a substantial global health burden, yet the immunological mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis and resolution are incompletely understood.


METHODS
We generated a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of peripheral blood immune cells from 100 individuals: 39 with severe bacterial pneumonia, 31 with mild disease, and 30 healthy controls. Integrating scRNA-seq with clinical and molecular data revealed profound remodeling of the peripheral immune landscape across disease severities.


MAIN RESULTS
Severe pneumonia was characterized by lymphopenia and monocytosis, accompanied by distinct shifts in T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell subset composition. Classical monocytes emerged as central orchestrators of the cytokine storm observed in severe cases, displaying elevated expression of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., S100A8/9/12) and enhanced TLR4-MYD88 signaling. Exhaustion of innate-like CD8+ T cells, marked by upregulation of canonical inhibitory receptors, was a hallmark of severe disease. In contrast, mild pneumonia exhibited robust CD8+ T effector and helper memory cell activation, along with effective humoral immunity, evidenced by plasma cell expansion and coordinated Tfh-B cell interactions. B cells in mild cases showed enhanced antigen recognition, BCR signaling, and co-stimulatory gene expression, whereas those in severe cases displayed signs of dysfunction. Myeloid cell alterations in severe pneumonia included increased monocytic MDSCs and non-classical monocytes, contributing to immunosuppression and complement overactivation, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
This high-resolution atlas of peripheral immune responses in bacterial pneumonia identifies key cellular and molecular drivers of disease severity, providing potential therapeutic targets for immunomodulation and improved outcomes.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (Tumor Microenvironment, TME) is a core regulatory factor in the occurrence, development, and treatment resistance of tumors. Macrophages, as key immune cell components in the TME, have a profound impact on the tumor process (Visser and Joyce in Cancer Cell 41:374–403, 2023). This review aims to systematically elucidate the characteristics and functional differences of macrophage polarization into M1 and M2 phenotypes within the TME. Additionally, it endeavors to dissect the regulatory mechanisms by which metabolic products, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components secreted by tumor cells modulate macrophage polarization (Wang et al. in Mol Cancer 23:268, 2024). Moreover, the metabolic reprogramming of tumorassociated macrophage (TAM) is a core mechanism for their functional shift, and intervening in metabolic pathways holds promise for reprogramming TAMs to inhibit tumor progression (Jin et al. in Nat Cancer 6:239–252, 2025). Within the TME, macrophages can be polarized into classically activated M1 and alternatively activated M2 types (Ge and Wu in Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi 26:228–237, 2023). Accumulating evidence indicates that classically activated M1 macrophages orchestrate anti-tumor immunity by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), which collectively activate cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, induce tumor cell apoptosis, and enhance immune surveillance (Luo et al. in Front Immunol 15:1352946, 2024). In contrast, M2 macrophages are induced in the TME and promote tumor angiogenesis, immune evasion, tumor cell proliferation, and metastasis by secreting factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) (Wang et al. in NPJ Precis Oncol 8:31, 2024). Therefore, in-depth research on the mechanisms of macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment provides an important basis for developing new tumor immunotherapy strategies and has significant clinical translational value.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs), identified by CD103 expression, play key roles in infection and cancer and often correlate with improved survival in the latter. Their characterization in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is of interest due to its viral etiology.


METHODS
NPC tumors from patients treated at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (PMCC; 2000-2017) were examined for CD103+, CD8+ T cells, and PD-L1 abundance, correlated with survival, and underwent NanoString transcriptomic analysis. Additional cohorts from Hong Kong and Singapore were assessed for CD103+ intra-tumoral immune cell (ITIC) abundance.


RESULTS
Of the 141 PMCC patients, 29% (n = 30/103) of NPC tumors had high CD103+ ITIC (defined as ≥ 30%) linked with TRM gene expression, immune checkpoints, and upregulated pathways in T-cell activation. Abundance of CD103+ ITIC was not associated with improved survival (PMCC: HR = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.4-2.1) across all cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite similarities to other virally driven tumors, CD103+ ITIC abundance was not prognostic in NPC, highlighting the need for better characterization of TRMs subpopulations.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is a significant challenge in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), necessitating the urgent development of strategies to mitigate its effects. Methods The application of bioinformatics methods to predict the expression level of CD24 in HCC and its relationship with the occurrence and development of HCC. Gene-engineered mice and flow cytometry were used to study the immune cell populations regulated by CD24. Cell metabolism analysis, western blotting, and lactate content measurement were employed to assess the impact of CD24 on lactate secretion by HCC cells. Additionally, cell counting kit 8 and colony formation assays were conducted to evaluate the effect of CD24 on the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib. The integration of RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, cell chemotaxis experiments, and ELISA established a robust framework for understanding CD24-mediated neutrophils immune infiltration. Results In this study, we found that CD24 can recruit neutrophils to infiltrate HCC tissues to form tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and polarize TANs to a protumor phenotype by promoting lactate secretion by HCC cells, thus promoting the progression of HCC. In addition, targeting CD24 can enhance the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib by reducing the accumulation of TANs. Conclusions Our results reveal the molecular mechanism by which CD24 promotes HCC progression through recruitment of neutrophils infiltrates, raising new insights into the role of targeting CD24 in driving HCC immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the severe progression of an infection with Plasmodium falciparum, causing detrimental damage to brain tissue and is the most frequent cause of Plasmodium falciparum mortality. The critical role of brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the pathophysiology of CM having been revealed, our investigation focuses on the role of NR2F6, an established immune checkpoint, as a candidate driver of CM pathology. We employed an experimental mouse model of CM based on Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection to compare the relative susceptibility of Nr2f6-knock-out and wild-type C57BL6/N mice. As a remarkable result, Nr2f6 deficiency confers a significant survival benefit. In terms of mechanism, we detected less severe endotheliopathy and, hence, less damage to the blood–brain barrier (BBB), accompanied by decreased sequestered parasites and less cytotoxic T-lymphocytes within the brain, manifesting in a better disease outcome. We present evidence that NR2F6 deficiency renders mice more resistant to experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), confirming a causal and non-redundant role for NR2F6 in the progression of ECM disease. Consequently, pharmacological inhibitors of the NR2F6 pathway could be of use to bolster BBB integrity and protect against CM.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a common and potentially severe complication of cancer immunotherapy, including CAR T‐cell therapies, bispecific T‐cell engagers, and less commonly immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although extensive research has established guidelines for managing CRS in hematological malignancies, there is a growing need to address CRS in the context of solid organ tumors due to differences in tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy indications, and patient population. This review aims to provide an overview of CRS in solid tumors, outlining its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and current management strategies. The complexities of CRS in solid tumors arise from challenges such as the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment and the overlap of tumor‐associated antigens with healthy tissues, potentially increasing the risk of severe on‐target off‐tumor toxicities. The review emphasizes early detection and grading of CRS as essential for patient safety and effective intervention. Management of CRS involves supportive care for mild cases, whereas severe presentations often require targeted therapies like tocilizumab, corticosteroids, and escalation to the intensive care unit for organ support. The decision to rechallenge or withhold immunotherapy requires careful consideration of patient‐specific goals and risks. Emerging treatments such as other cytokine inhibitors, plasma exchange, and suicide gene systems are promising avenues for mitigating severe CRS. Future research focuses on refining risk stratification tools, novel therapeutic agents, and evaluating long‐term outcomes. A deeper understanding of CRS in solid tumors will enable more personalized treatment approaches, enhancing the safety and efficacy of immunotherapies for this patient population.">

        <tr id="VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is an autoinflammatory disorder caused by acquired somatic UBA1 mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, affecting peripheral myeloid and natural killer (NK) cells. Given the high rate of severe infections observed in VEXAS patients, we hypothesized that NK cell dysfunction contributes to this increased susceptibility. We conducted a comprehensive immune characterization of peripheral NK cells in patients with VEXAS (n=40), patients with autoinflammatory diseases without UBA1 mutations (n=22), and elderly gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n=16). Multiparameter phenotyping was performed using CyTOF, scRNAseq, whole blood stimulation assays and in vitro NK cell cytotoxic assay. Peripheral NK cells in VEXAS were quantitatively and qualitatively impaired. Mass cytometry revealed reduced frequencies of mature cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells and an expansion of the CD56high CD16dim subset. NK cells exhibited features of exhaustion, including increased PD-1 expression, and reduced levels of cytotoxic markers such as NKp46 and CD8α. scRNAseq analysis showed decreased signatures of cytotoxicity and IL-2 and IFN-γ production, alongside increased inflammatory signatures. Whole blood stimulation assays confirmed impaired IL-2, IFN-γ, and granzyme B production following TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/TLR8 agonist stimulation. Extended NK phenotyping by flow cytometry confirmed reduced activating receptors' expression and impaired IFN-γ production in VEXAS. Moreover, in vitro UBA1 inhibitors impaired NK cell cytotoxic capacity and promote cell death. Finally, reduced NK cell frequencies were independently associated with an increased risk of severe infections. These findings suggest that NK cell dysfunction in VEXAS syndrome contributes to increased susceptibility to severe infections.">

        <tr id="In the ever-evolving landscape of cancer therapy, while cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy aim to eradicate malignant cells, they also inadvertently trigger cellular senescence in both cancerous and microenvironmental tissues. Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) can act as a barrier against tumor growth by halting cell proliferation in the short term, but the long-term persistence of therapy-induced senescent (TISnt) cells may pose a significant challenge in cancer management. Their distinct characteristics, like senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), metabolic dysregulation, and immune evasion, make them exhibit remarkable heterogeneity to orchestrate the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in therapy resistance. However, how these TISnt cells functioning differently in cancer progression, and the intricate mechanisms by which they remodel the senescence-associated immunosuppressive microenvironment present challenges for improving anticancer therapy. Therefore, this review summarizes the heterogeneous TISnt cell phenotypes contributing to an accumulated senescent state, outlines their multidimensional interactions in the senescent microenvironment, and discusses current senescence-targeting strategies. Building on the current understanding of TIS, we propose potential avenues for improving TIS-targeting methodologies in the context of head and neck cancer, a representative heterogeneous malignancy, which can substantially enhance the efficacy of the “one-two punch” sequential treatment approach for head and neck cancer.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The highly metastatic triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) relies on the tumour microenvironment (TME) to maintain phenotypic heterogeneity and progression. Extracellular vesicles from hypoxic TNBC (EVh) have been previously shown to facilitate tumoural invasion; however, their function in the TME remains unclear. We used a novel method to investigate the TME in vitro called multicellular circulating co‐culture, to characterise how EVh interferes with tumoural and endothelial cells, fibroblasts, monocytes and macrophages. EVh promoted monocyte differentiation to M2‐like macrophages and inhibited macrophage‐derived phagocytosis in endothelial and tumoural cells. The protection of endothelial, tumoural and stromal cellular integrity by EVh increased pro‐tumoural and pro‐angiogenic signalling, collagen matrix synthesis and showed a potential differentiation to cancer‐associated fibroblasts. Our findings highlight the critical role of EVh in protecting tumour cells, indicating its cooperation towards a protective TME, which was demonstrated by the multicellular circulating co‐culture and conventional co‐culture protocols. These findings lead to an adequate system with potential for investigating other tumour‐related processes, including circulating tumour cells and metastasis.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections. This leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells some of which remain within the lung and contribute to enhanced pathogen control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells also display long-term changes following infection. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection finding that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes linked to communication with T cells. MHCI and MHCII proteins continue to be expressed at higher levels in both differentiated epithelial cells and progenitor populations and several differentially expressed genes are downstream of the transcription factor, SpiB, a known orchestrator of antigen presentation. Lung epithelial cells from influenza-infected mice display functional changes, more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells display characteristics of immune memory which could affect outcomes that are protective in the context of infection or pathogenic in chronic inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Persistent antigen exposure during chronic viral infection and tumor development drives CD8 T cells into an exhausted, hypofunctional state. Understanding the molecular pathways that enforce T-cell exhaustion is critical for improving current immunotherapies. Previously, we have shown the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) regulates CD8 T-cell function through LPA receptor 5 (LPAR5) signaling, including demonstrating that Lpar5-/- CD8 T cells exhibit enhanced tumor clearance in murine models of melanoma. Importantly, significantly elevated levels of LPA have been identified in individuals with different cancers and persistent viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus. To investigate the role of Lpar5 in the differentiation and maintenance of exhausted CD8 T cells, we utilized the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection model. In response to infection with LCMV Clone 13, but not Armstrong, one-quarter of Lpar5-/- animals succumbed to infection, and this was accompanied by an increased frequency of LCMV-specific Lpar5-/- CD8 T cells maintained in a less terminally exhausted state. Using P14 transgenic mice, we demonstrate that Lpar5 acts in a cell-intrinsic and temporal manner to regulate CD8 T-cell accumulation and exhaustion programming during Clone 13 infection. The enhanced accumulation of Lpar5-/- P14 cells during the acute phase of Clone 13 infection appears to be regulated by Lpar5-mediated changes in T-cell survival and not through trafficking or proliferation. RNA sequencing analyses and surface phenotyping show that Lpar5 likely regulates CD8 T-cell exhaustion through modulation of NK receptor expression, including the CD94/NKG2A inhibitory axis.">

        <tr id="Adoptive transfer of NK cells can induce complete remissions in 30-50% of patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoma. While blood chimerism occurs, attaining functional homing to the site of tumor without exhaustion has been elusive. During chronic infections and tumorigenesis, exposure to activating stimuli weakens the effector activity of NK cells. Despite this knowledge, there is little known about the mechanisms that govern this dysregulation and whether these disparate activating stimuli use distinct pathways to downregulate effector immunity. In this study, we reveal that chronic NK cell activating receptor (NKAR) stimulation and chronic IL-15 exposure impart distinct modes of dysregulation, with NKAR stimulation inducing a tissue resident-like state that resembles that of tumor-infiltrating NK cells in cancer patients. Using loss- and gain-of-function studies, we identify the transcription factor KLF2 as a master regulator of the NK cell response to chronic activation and provide evidence that KLF2 overexpression promotes NK cell cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and chemotaxis, and inhibits the development of dysfunctional, tissue resident-like features. Using KLF2 reporter mice, we show that in certain tissues, tissue resident NK cells are predominantly KLF2-negative while circulating NK cells in these tissues are overwhelmingly KLF2+. Lastly, using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we demonstrate that conditional KLF2 deficiency in NK cells leads to altered homing and the acquisition of tissue resident-like features in vivo. Together, these findings highlight the profound changes NK cells undergo during prolonged activation and advance our understanding of how some NK cell therapies fail during malignant relapse.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunity response following vaccination and infection toward the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant remains limited in chronic liver disease (CLD) population. This study aims to investigate humoral and cell-mediate immunity to Omicron BA.4/5 among CLD patients with/without breakthrough infections (BI). This longitudinal study characterized immune responses to Omicron infection across three CLD patient groups: vaccinated without BI (group 1, n = 10), vaccinated with BI (group 2, n = 43), and unvaccinated infected (group 3, n = 7). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies/T-cell responses and lymphocyte phenotypes were quantified by ELISA and flow cytometry. Logistic regression identified immunological correlates of BI event, viral clearance and liver disease progression. Dynamic immunity changes after infection analyzed using Spearman’s correlation. Patients in group 2 exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wildtype (WT) and Omicron BA.4.5, anti-RBD IgG, and total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to groups 1 and 3. Comparable T cell responses were observed between two vaccinated groups, stronger than unvaccinated individuals. Hybrid immune (vaccination plus infection) elicited stronger NAbs-WT, total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, anti-RBD IgG, MBCs, and Omicron-specific IFN-γ+/IL-4+CD4+T cells compared to primary Omicron infection. Besides, severe liver disease was not only a risk factor for BI, but also impaired Omicron-specific IFN-γ+CD8+T, CD38+CD4+T, and CD45RA+CD8+T cells responses after infection. Importantly, IgG+/IgM+MBCs and NAbs showed positive associations with central memory (CD45RA−CD62L+CD4/8) or naive (CD45RA+CD62L+CD4) T cells. Low levels of CD45RA+CD62L+CD8+T cells and resting MBCs were identified as the independent risk factors for viral clearance and disease progression, respectively. BI predominantly stimulates humoral immunity without enhancing cellular responses. Weaker immune response induced by primary Omicron infection underscores the need for additional vaccinations in vaccine-naïve CLD patients. The positive correlations between humoral/cellular immunity and memory/activated T cells reveal their coordinated role in adaptive immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. These findings emphasize the importance of regular immune monitoring and timely interventions to optimize protection for CLD patients against emerging Omicron subvariants.">

        <tr id="Tumor driven immune suppression poses a significant impediment to the success of immunotherapy in ovarian cancer. Among the various mechanisms contributing to immune suppression, intracellular communication facilitated by tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) within the tumor microenvironment emerges as a pivotal factor influencing tumor growth. Here, it is demonstrated that extracellular vesicle-packaged eIF4E from tumor cells alters protein translation in macrophages, contributing to antitumor immune response. Mechanistically, tumor derived EV-packaged eIF4E significantly enhances the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), driving the synthesis and secretion of cholesterol. This, in turn, activates macrophages and causes immunosuppression through the X-box binding protein 1 and Programmed death-ligand 1 (XBP1/PD-L1) axis. Strikingly, both genetic and pharmacological depletion of HMGCR in macrophages effectively restores their antitumor activity. Clinically, elevated HMGCR expression in tumor-associated macrophages is associated with poor survival outcomes in ovarian cancer patients. The pivotal role of eIF4E is underscored here as a key signaling mediator, facilitating the communication between tumor and immune cells via EVs to promote immune suppression and suggesting HMGCR as a potential therapeutic target for tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a leading cause of limb disability due to ischemia caused by atherosclerotic plaques. Cell-based therapies using endothelial cells (ECs) have shown promise in promoting angiogenesis for PAD, but challenges remain in obtaining sufficient ECs from human tissues. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potential solution, though immune rejection issues arise due to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches. The depletion of HLA class I and II through gene editing aims to broadly avoid lymphocyte recognition and can be achieved by inactivating β2-microglobulin (B2M) and class II transactivator (CIITA). However, B2M inactivation can lead to a ‘missing self’ killing response by NK cells and macrophages. To overcome this, we proposed universal iPSCs by knocking out B2M and CIITA and over-expressing CD24 to reduce immune rejection. Methods Universal iPSCs were tested for their pluripotency and ability to differentiate into ECs. The stimulation of universal iPSC-derived endothelial cells (U-ECs) to T and NK cells was evaluated by activation marker using flow cytometry. We generated a humanized mouse model by intravenously injecting CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells isolated from umbilical cord blood into NSG mice. Finally, we induced a humanized PAD mouse model by removing the femoral artery of the left hindlimb. Then we injected U-ECs, demonstrating the therapeutic efficacy of U-ECs. Results We generated hypoimmunogenic universal iPSC by knocking out B2M and CIITA, along with over-expressing CD24, and confirmed that their pluripotency was maintained. We demonstrated that U-ECs exhibit functional endothelial properties and reduced immunogenicity, effectively mitigating immune recognition from both adaptive and innate immune responses. U-ECs survived in significantly greater numbers after transplantation and elicited a weaker immune response in humanized mice. Then we induced hindlimb ischemia in humanized mice to establish a humanized PAD model. U-ECs induced effective angiogenic capabilities, leading to significant blood flow restoration in ischemic limbs. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of creating hypoimmunogenic iPSCs and their derivatives that can reduce immune response and function effectively in vivo.

        <tr id="Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, plays a pivotal and multifaceted role in tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance by transducing extracellular mechanical stimuli—such as matrix stiffness and fluid shear stress—into intracellular calcium influx. In tumor cells, Piezo1 promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by activating oncogenic signaling and contributes to an immunosuppressive TME through regulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. In the immune compartment, Piezo1 integrates mechanical cues with metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming to orchestrate the functions of T cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells. Notably, Piezo1 deficiency impairs TH9 cell differentiation, diminishes T cell cytotoxicity, and enhances the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, Piezo1 expression correlates with distinct tumor immune phenotypes, such as “cold tumors,” and with responses to immunotherapy, making it a promising predictive biomarker for treatment efficacy. Given its dual regulatory roles in tumor biology and immune modulation, targeting Piezo1—such as through combination with programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade—offers a potential strategy to reverse immunosuppression and enhance antitumor immunity. This review summarizes emerging insights into Piezo1’s role in cancer progression and immune regulation and highlights its translational potential as a novel target in cancer immunotherapy.">

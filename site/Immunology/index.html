        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) orchestrates a profound disruption of immune balance within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. To better understand these complex immune dynamics, we used high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) profiling to comprehensively characterize the immune landscape of the BM across different stages of myeloma progression, including MGUS (n = 16), smoldering MM (SMM; n = 25), and active MM, both newly diagnosed (n = 43) and relapsed/refractory (n = 104). Our analysis revealed substantial immune remodeling during disease progression, characterized by adaptive immune suppression and extensive infiltration of innate immune populations. Transformation from MGUS to SMM was marked by significant alterations in central and effector memory T helper cells, effector cytotoxic T cells, and an enrichment of monocytic and neutrophil subsets. Active MM stages were further distinguished by increased expansion of myeloid and monocytic lineages, alongside a pronounced reduction in progenitor and transitional B cells. Correspondence analysis demonstrated that specific immune profiles were significantly associated with clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival and overall survival. This study highlights the potential of CyTOF-based molecular profiling to unravel the intricate immune dynamics of the BM microenvironment across MM disease stages, enhancing our understanding of MM pathogenesis and providing a foundation for identifying prognostic biomarkers and tailoring precision immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Vδ1 γδ T cells are key players in innate and adaptive immunity, particularly at mucosal interfaces such as the gut. An increase in circulating Vδ1 cells has long been observed in people with HIV-1, but remains poorly understood. We performed a comprehensive characterization of Vδ1 T cells in blood and duodenal intra-epithelial lymphocytes, obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies of 15 people with HIV-1 on antiretroviral therapy and 15 HIV-seronegative controls, in a substudy of the ANRS EP61 GALT study (NCT02906137). We deciphered the phenotype, functional profile, single-cell transcriptome and repertoire of Vδ1 cells and unraveled their relationships with the possible triggers involved, in particular CMV and microbiota. We also assessed whether Vδ1 T cells may play a role in controlling the HIV-1 reservoir. Vδ1 T cells were mainly terminally differentiated effectors that clonally expanded in the blood with some trafficking with the gut of people with HIV-1. Most expressed CX3CR1 and displayed a highly cytotoxic profile, but low cytokine production, supported by a transcriptomic shift towards enhanced effector lymphocytes. This expansion was associated with CMV status and markers of occult replication, but also with changes in the duodenal and blood-translocated microbiota.

        <tr id="Neutrophils have emerged as key players in tumor progression and are often associated with poor prognosis. Despite ongoing efforts to target neutrophil functions in cancer, therapeutic success has been limited. In this study, we addressed the possibility of blocking STAT3 signaling in neutrophils as a targeted therapeutic intervention in cancer. Conditional deletion of Stat3 in a neutrophil-specific manner (Ly6GcreStat3fl/fl mice) significantly impaired tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Neutrophils isolated from these mice exhibited a strong antitumoral phenotype, with increased MHCII, CD80/86 and ICAM-1 expression. Immune profiling of tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of these mice revealed significant enrichment of CD8+ T cells (granzymeBhi, perforinhi and IFN-γhi) with strong cytotoxic activity. To further translate these findings to human settings, we blocked STAT3 signaling in cancer patient neutrophils via the small molecule inhibitor LLL12 and assessed its effects on patient-derived tumor explants. In agreement with the in vivo mouse data, we observed the expansion and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in such explants. To test the therapeutic applicability of STAT3 targeting, we utilized myeloid cell-selective STAT3 antisense oligonucleotide (CpG-STAT3ASO) to target neutrophils in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Consistent with previous results, neutrophil-specific STAT3 knockdown impaired tumor growth and enhanced cytotoxic T cell activity in the tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of treated mice. These findings highlight STAT3 signaling as a deleterious pathway supporting the protumoral activity of neutrophils and suggest that neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition is a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy, providing novel insights into targeted therapeutic avenues.">

        <tr id="Aging significantly influences host immune responses to viral infections, including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV), which is associated with high mortality in elderly patients. Despite its high fatality rate and pandemic potential, effective therapies remain unavailable, and the age-dependent mechanisms underlying SFTSV pathogenesis are not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed a ferret model (an immunocompetent animal model that mimics human SFTSV infections) and performed multi-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing and histopathological analyses. Our results reveal that, upon SFTSV infection, aged ferrets experience extensive decrease of critical immune cells (particularly B and T cells) due to infection-induced cell death and excessive hemophagocytosis in hematopoietic organs, whereas young-adult ferrets rapidly clear the virus with minimal lymphocyte changes. Notably, aged ferrets display marked immune dysregulation, characterized by non-specific activation of T-bet ⁺ age-associated memory B cells (T-bet+ ABCs) and the proliferation of defective plasmablasts (MKI67 ⁺ PB1), which serve as major viral reservoirs and drive systemic viral dissemination. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that the MKI67 ⁺ PB1 subset dominates SFTSV⁺ cells in both aged ferrets and human fatal cases, exhibiting the highest per-cell viral UMI counts. Moreover, monocytes and macrophages in aged ferrets exhibit heightened inflammatory gene expression, contributing to the hyper-inflammatory state observed during infection. Collectively, these insights underscore the critical role of dysregulated memory B cell responses and hyper-inflammation in age-dependent SFTSV pathogenesis, highlighting potential targets for interventions in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immune-based agents, especially Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI), are standard of care therapy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC); however, a significant number of patient tumors fail to respond, or develop resistance. While target expression, mutation burden and oncogenic pathways impact responses, an established mechanism contributing to ICI therapy failure is evasion of T-cell responses via downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Conversely, natural killer (NK) cells effector function is enhanced in the absence of HLA, making NK cellular therapies an attractive option for ICI resistant tumors. Challenges for current NK cell therapies include failure to adequately infiltrate solid tumors and long-term persistence, which may be overcome by deploying NK-derived extracellular vesicles (NKEVs) as a personalized novel adoptive cellular therapeutic with cytotoxic effects. Methods In a human NSCLC cohort (n=10), we used single cell RNAseq and antibody labeling (CITEseq) to examine the immune cell landscape in peripheral immune cells (PBMCs) and tumors. NKEVs retrieved from patient NK cells were characterized with proteomics and bulk RNAseq, and EV functionality was assessed using primary tumor organoids. Results We identified circulating NK cell subsets, describing differences in cell composition, gene expression and signaling, related to time point, NSCLC subtype (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell), composition and tumor grade. Next, we examined the functional capabilities of patient NKEVs in organoid structures derived from primary tumor cells, finding that exposure to patient NKEVs resulted in a 40-45% decrease in organoid viability, and significantly lowered the cisplatin dose required to elicit cytotoxicity. In Nivolumab treated PBMC co-culture experiments, NKEV addition favorably shifted the organoid infiltrating immune population to significantly fewer CD4+ T cells and more CD56+ NK cells. Finally, we used the multi-omic characterization of NKEV molecular cargo to identify RNA transcripts and proteins associated with cytotoxic and immune recruiting functions. Conclusions This work demonstrated that NKEVs can be successfully harvested from patient derived, expanded NK cells, and highlights their heterogeneous cargo, and anti-tumor properties in combination with standard-of-care therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) and glioblastoma (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors with limited treatment options. Macrophage phagocytosis is a complex, tightly regulated process governed by competing pro-phagocytic and anti-phagocytic signals. CD47-SIRPα signaling inhibits macrophage activity, while radiotherapy (RT) can enhance tumor immunogenicity. How RT and CD47 blockade together modulate macrophage “appetite” and activation states remains poorly understood, particularly in the context of glioma immune evasion and therapy resistance. Methods Human and mouse glioma cell lines were exposed to fractionated RT, anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, or both. Flow cytometry and ELISA quantified the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and expression of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In vitro, phagocytosis assays were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyze transcriptional changes in macrophage subsets that phagocytosed (“eaters”) or did not phagocytose (“non-eaters”) glioma cells. In vivo, efficacy of combination therapy was assessed using orthotopic xenograft and syngeneic mouse models of DMG and GBM. Results RT induced ICD in glioma cells, evidenced by dose-dependent increases in DAMPs such as phosphatidylserine, calreticulin, HSP70/90, and HMGB1. RT and anti-CD47 each promoted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, with a synergistic effect observed when combined. scRNA-seq of phagocytic macrophages revealed transcriptionally distinct subpopulations associated with each treatment, characterized by enrichment in inflammatory, metabolic, and antigen presentation pathways. In vivo, combination therapy significantly reduced tumor burden, extended survival, and polarized tumor-associated macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory (M1-like) phenotype. Distinct macrophage markers (CLEC7A, CD44, CD63) validated scRNA-seq findings in vivo. Conclusions This study highlights that macrophage fate is intimately linked to the molecular properties of what they phagocytose. Phagocytosis is not a singular, uniform process but a dynamic and context-dependent event that drives macrophage specialization and plasticity. By demonstrating that RT and anti-CD47 therapy shape distinct macrophage phenotypes through their effects on tumor immunogenicity, this study provides a framework for understanding how to harness and reprogram macrophage activity for therapeutic benefit. These findings underscore the potential of targeting macrophage plasticity as a strategy to enhance antitumor immunity and improve outcomes in malignant gliomas and other diseases.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) occurs as the third most common cancer with high mortality across the world. Understanding the intratumoral immune cell heterogeneity and their responses to various therapies is crucial for enhancing patient outcomes. This study aimed to characterise and evaluate the immune microenvironment landscapes of CRC shaped by different therapies including CD73 inhibitor, PD‐1 blockade and photothermal therapy (PTT). Our investigation revealed that three therapies could commonly modulate the down‐regulation of Treg, M2 macrophage and Ptprj+ G4 granulocyte, up‐regulation of effector/memory T cell, M1 macorphage and Hilpda+ G1 granulocyte. Moreover, we identified the uniquely dis‐regulated cell types and pathway activities response to each therapy, such as CD73 inhibitor enriched more Cd8+ memory and central memory (CM) cell, PD‐1 blockade with more Cd8+ CTL and Cxcl3+ G2 granulocyte, and PTT with more Cd8+ effector memory and Rethlg+ G3 granulocyte cell. These responses disordered the glycolysis, angiogenesis, phagocytosis functions and cellular communication to reshape the CRC tumour immune microenvironment. We provide the detail insights into the intratumoral immunomodulation preferences of CRC mice treated with CD73 inhibitor, PD‐1 blockade and PTT therapies, which might contribute to the ongoing development of more effective anticancer strategies.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T play essential roles in antitumor immune responses. However, immunotherapy has limited clinical efficacy in many solid tumors. Here, we performed an epigenetic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in CD8+ T cells directly under cancer immunotherapy setting and found that Prdm12 is a transcriptional repressor implicated in nociceptive neuron development but uncharacterized within immunological contexts. Prdm12 deletion markedly enhanced in vivo tumor clearance of mouse CD8+ T cells and promoted activation, effector differentiation marker expression, and cytokine secretion in both murine and human CD8+ T cells in vitro. Mechanistically, Prdm12 deficiency augmented effector transcriptional programs while inhibiting exhaustion of CGRP-RAMP1 neuroimmune axis facilitation. Additionally, Prdm12 ablation remodeled the chromatin accessibility landscape, with H3K9me3 deposition at loci regulating T cell differentiation (Trib1 and Sgk1) and exhaustion (Rgs1 and Nr4a2). These results together reveal a negative regulatory mechanism for CD8+ T cells and advance our understanding of cancer immunotherapy by linking neurobiological signaling to immune regulation.">

        <tr id="Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a collagen-binding receptor tyrosine kinase, plays a key role in extracellular matrix remodeling, tumor progression, and immune evasion. However, DDR1’s comprehensive role across diverse cancers and its therapeutic potential in immune-resistant tumors remain poorly defined. We performed a pan-cancer analysis integrating bulk transcriptomic datasets, single-cell RNA sequencing, and pathway enrichment to evaluate DDR1 expression, genetic alterations, and its associations with immune cell infiltration and clinical outcomes. DDR1 was consistently overexpressed in 21 cancer types, correlating with poor prognosis and reduced immune cell infiltration. Mechanistically, DDR1 promoted collagen remodeling, immune exclusion, and upregulated immunosuppressive pathways. Single-cell analysis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) revealed DDR1-high ductal cells associated with reduced cytotoxic T cell infiltration and increased regulatory T cell populations. Therapeutic blockade of DDR1 in an immunocompetent KPC mouse model of PDAC disrupted collagen architecture, enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration, and improved responses to chemotherapy, highlighting a direct link between DDR1 inhibition and immune reactivation. These findings establish DDR1 as a key mediator of collagen-driven immune resistance and a promising therapeutic target for overcoming immune exclusion, especially in PDAC and other collagen-rich solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a major global health challenge due to its high incidence and mortality rates, emphasizing the critical need for innovative therapeutic strategies. IL-1R2, a member of the IL-1 receptor family, plays a pivotal role in both tumorigenesis and antitumor immunity. However, its precise role in tumor development and its impact on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy in CRC remain poorly understood. We examined tumor progression in wild-type and IL-1R2-deficient mice using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer model treated with combined ICIs therapy. Our findings revealed that IL-1R2 deficient mice exhibited a significant reduction in tumor burden, accompanied by alterations in the carcinogenic program and enhanced immunogenicity of tumor cells. Furthermore, the deletion of IL-1R2 resulted in an increased proportion of exhausted CD8+ T cells, a population commonly enriched for tumor antigen-specific T cells, suggesting an augmentation of tumor-specific immune responses. Moreover, IL-1R2 deletion upregulated genes linked to antigen presentation in dendritic cells, indicating enhanced activation of the adaptive immune system. Collectively, these findings position IL-1R2 as a promising therapeutic target for improving the efficacy of treatment strategies in CRC.

        <tr id="While human autopsy samples have provided insights into pulmonary immune mechanisms associated with severe viral respiratory diseases, the mechanisms that contribute to a clinically favorable resolution of viral respiratory infections remain unclear due to the lack of proper experimental systems. Using mice co-engrafted with a genetically matched human immune system and fetal lung xenograft (fLX), we mapped the immunological events defining successful resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues. Viral infection is rapidly cleared from fLX following a peak of viral replication, histopathological manifestations of lung disease and loss of AT2 program, as reported in human COVID-19 patients. Infection resolution is associated with the activation of a limited number of hematopoietic subsets, including inflammatory monocytes and CD3-expressing macrophage-like cells, which are highly enriched in viral RNA and dissipate upon infection resolution. Specific human fibroblast and endothelial subsets also elicit robust antiviral and monocyte chemotaxis signatures, respectively. Notably, systemic depletion of human CD4 + cells, but not CD3 + cells, significantly abrogates infection resolution in fLX and induces persistent infection, supporting the dominant role of peripheral CD4 + monocytes over T-cells in the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings unravel a comprehensive picture of the immunological events defining effective resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues, revealing markedly divergent immunological trajectories between resolving and fatal COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are aggressive cancers with a relatively low response rate to immunotherapy. Anti-tumor immune responses rely on cytotoxic T and NK cells infiltrating the tumor microenvironment to eliminate cancer cells. However, tumors activate multiple mechanisms to evade these responses. Tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles, also known as exosomes, reshape the tumor microenvironment by impairing cytotoxic T and NK cell function, promoting immune escape and metastasis. Transcriptomic analysis of healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to exosomes from HPV-negative HNSCC patient primary cancer cells revealed reduced cytotoxic cells and suppressed immune responses including cytotoxicity, chemokine production, and NK and T cell functions. Bead-based multiplex immunoassay showed that HNSCC-derived exosomes inhibited the release of effector cytokines (IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ) and cytotoxic molecules from activated CD8+ T cells. While ion channels regulate Ca2+-dependent cytotoxicity and cytokine production and release, their role in exosome-mediated immune suppression is unexplored. We found that tumor-derived exosomes selectively inhibit KCa3.1 channel activity in CD8+ T cells by downregulating calmodulin, ultimately impairing Ca2+ signaling and IFN-γ release. This study identifies a novel mechanism of exosome-mediated immunosuppression, positioning KCa3.1 as a promising therapeutic target to enhance immune surveillance and immunotherapy response in HNSCC.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary PIAS1 is a protein that helps control how cells behave, including how they respond to signals that can lead to cancer. While it has been studied in cancer cells before, we wanted to know what it does in the cells around the tumor, the tumor microenvironment, where immune and other supporting cells live. We found that higher levels of PIAS1 in these surrounding cells were linked to better survival in patients with oral cancer. By studying individual cells from tumors, we saw that PIAS1 was often found in immune and support cells and seemed to help these cells fight cancer. When PIAS1 was missing, the cells showed signs of being more friendly to the tumor and less active in fighting it. Overall, PIAS1 appears to play an important role in helping the body’s own cells resist cancer and could be a useful target for future treatments.">

In this study, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from vaccinated individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections, we observed an increase in adaptive CD57+NKG2C+ NK cells and classical monocytes (CMs). Single-cell sequencing analysis showed that the transcriptomic profiles of IFN-induced IFIT3 and other IFN-stimulated genes exhibited marked upregulation in NK cells, defined as CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+IFIT3+ NK cells. Additionally, CM in the blood showed characteristics indicative of differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which further evidenced their potential antiviral functions. Our study indicates that a vaccinated population rapidly activates an antiviral innate immune response following a BTI, thus revealing a link to the control of viral replication during SARS-CoV-2 BTIs.">

        <tr id="Transcriptional Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is a hallmark of aggressive cancers, yet how transcriptional ITH programs drive tumor metastasis and immune evasion in upper aerodigestive squamous cell carcinoma (UASCC) remains unclear. Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of UASCC cells and patient tumors, we uncovered a hybrid epithelial mesenchymal transition (hEMT) ITH program linked to metastatic dissemination. The transcription factor ETS1 was identified as a master regulator of the hEMT program, directly activating pro-metastatic genes and promoting distant spread in vivo. Unexpectedly, ETS1 also orchestrated an immune-cold tumor microenvironment by transcriptionally activating both STAT1 and PD-L1 (CD274) genes, suppressing T lymphocyte infiltration, and elevating immune checkpoint molecules. Clinically, ETS1-high tumors strongly correlated with poor survival and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade across multiple cohorts. Leveraging drug screens, we discovered that ETS1-high cancers are vulnerable to HSP90 inhibitors (e.g., Alvespimycin), which suppress ETS1 by disrupting HIF1A-mediated transcriptional activation. Together, our work reveals ETS1 as a dual driver of tumor distal metastasis and immune evasion in UASCC, while nominating HSP90 inhibition as a tailored treatment strategy for ETS1-driven tumors. These findings provide a roadmap for targeting aggressive ITH subsets and overcoming immunotherapy resistance.">

        <tr id="Background and objective Melanoma exhibits profound biological complexity, driven by immune evasion, phenotypic plasticity, and resistance to therapy. While programmed cell death (PCD) shapes tumor–immune interactions, its mechanistic landscape in melanoma remains incompletely defined. This study aims to comprehensively characterize PCD-related signatures and their associations with tumor heterogeneity, prognosis, and immunotherapeutic outcomes. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing data from melanoma cohorts (cutaneous and acral subtypes) were used to assess PCD activity via AUCell-based scoring across major cell types. Cell-type–specific analyses examined heterogeneity, metabolic dependencies, and pathway correlations. Intercellular communication was analyzed using CellChat. Bulk RNA sequencing data were then integrated to identify PCD-related gene signatures, and machine learning models (LASSO, Ridge, XGBoost) were applied to develop a prognostic model. Immune infiltration, immunogenomic correlations, and immunotherapy responses were further evaluated using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, TMB, IPS, and external ICB-treated cohorts. Results Among all cell types, melanoma cells exhibited the highest PCD activation, with disulfidptosis, immunogenic cell death (ICD), and autosis being the most prominent. High PCD activity was linked to advanced clinical stage, lymphatic metastasis, and poor prognosis. Melanoma subpopulations with hyperactivated PCD displayed elevated copy number variation (CNV) burden, enhanced fibroblast/endothelial interactions, and invasive transcriptional profiles. A 15-gene prognostic signature was developed, effectively stratifying survival and immunotherapy response across multiple cohorts. Low-risk tumors demonstrated favorable immune infiltration (CD8+ T cells, M1 macrophages), higher tumor mutational burden (TMB), and greater immunogenicity, while high-risk tumors exhibited immune exclusion, cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) enrichment, and adverse mutations. Conclusion This study highlights the functional and clinical significance of PCD heterogeneity in melanoma and provides a validated prognostic model for patient stratification and therapeutic decision-making. These findings underscore the potential of targeting PCD dynamics as a novel approach in melanoma management.">

        <tr id="T cell dysfunction enables tumor immune evasion, understanding its mechanism is crucial for improving immunotherapy. Here we show, by RNA-sequencing analysis of human colon adenocarcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer tissues, that expression of Adipocyte Enhancer-Binding Protein 1 (AEBP1) positively correlates with T cell dysfunction and indicative of unfavorable patient outcomes. Subsequent single-cell RNA sequencing identifies cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) as the primary AEBP1 source. Fibroblast-specific AEBP1 deletion in mice enhances T cell cytotoxicity and suppresses tumor growth. Mechanistically, autocrine AEBP1 binds CKAP4 on CAFs, activating AKT/PD-L1 signaling to drive T cell dysfunction. By molecular-docking-based virtual screening we identify Chem-0199, a drug that disrupts the interaction between AEBP1 and CKAP4, thereby enhancing antitumor immunity. Both genetic and pharmacological AEBP1 inhibition synergize with immune checkpoint blockade in syngeneic models. Our study establishes AEBP1 as a key regulator of CAF-mediated T cell dysfunction and a therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="To better understand the molecular mechanism that drives neuroinflammation, we analyzed the protein profiles of 27 brains from HIV with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART), including various stages of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), and compared them to 9 HAND-negative controls. We found that most of the proteins that were increased—about 66.7%—were involved in immune response pathways. Of these, 23.3% were specifically related to type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, which remains active in the brain through both HIV-related and unrelated mechanisms. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on brain tissues collected during rapid autopsies from participants in the Last Gift cohort, we found that IFN-I signaling was especially strong in astrocytes, microglia (MG), and endothelial cells. In a mini-brain organoid model of acute HIV infection, IFN-I signaling was also highly active in astrocytes but less so in MG. Interestingly, IFN-I activation can happen without HIV being present—expression of human endogenous retrovirus-W1 (HERV-W1) Env can directly trigger this response in astrocytes, and it continues in glial cells even with effective ART. Together, our findings point to persistent IFN-I activation in glial and endothelial cells in the brain, which may contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive disorders in PWH on ART.">

        <tr id="Abstract Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells actively reprogram their tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote drug resistance and tumor progression. Tumor cell survival critically depends on heterotypic communication with benign cells in the microenvironment, particularly bone marrow‐derived stromal cells (BMSCs). Our three‐dimensional (3D) approach allows us to investigate spatially defined, mutual direct cell–cell interactions between CLL B cells, autologous T cells, and BMSCs, forming complex scaffold‐like structures reminiscent of in vivo conditions. Here, we observe that CLL B cells localized in the core regions of 3D structures upregulate the AP‐1 transcription factor complex, which confers significant protection against therapy‐induced cell death. Additionally, regulatory T cells (Treg) and follicular T helper cells (TfH) are more abundant in the core regions. CLL B cells, in turn, induce contact‐mediated reprogramming of BMSCs, resulting in a novel, distinct BMSC population with inflammation, bone immune evasion, and cancer‐associated fibroblast‐like features. Our findings reveal critical mechanisms by which CLL cells exploit the TME to drive pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance using realistic 3D setups, highlighting the potential of targeting AP‐1 and the stromal compartment in future treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="CD45 plays a central role in immune signal regulation by controlling the spatial dynamics of phosphatase activity through steric segregation of its bulky rigid extracellular domain. To modulate CD45 activity, here we develop and characterize protein engineering approaches to induce multivalent clustering of CD45, effectively mimicking the endogenous local receptor sequestration during immune synapse formation. In doing so, we engineer a biologic that enables precise, tunable control over CD45 surface localization and activity. CD45 sequestration exhibited striking synergy when administered in combination with intratumorally anchored IL-12 therapy, markedly delaying tumor progression and extending survival in syngeneic murine melanoma and carcinoma models. Immune profiling revealed that CD8+ T cells are essential mediators of this synergistic antitumor response. Mechanistically, IL-12 initiates a wave of antigen generation and T cell priming, while CD45 sequestration subsequently enhances tumor-specific CD8+ T cell activation, expansion, and functional states within the tumor-draining lymph node. These findings suggest that CD45 sequestration lowers the activation threshold of T cells, broadens the tumor-reactive T cell repertoire, and therefore promotes more robust tumor-specific T cell responses. Altogether, we establish CD45 as a promising novel target for cancer immunotherapy, capable of potentiating strong anticancer immune responses.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are a crucial part of the innate immune system and serve as an important effector for killing tumor cells through direct cytolytic activity or immunomodulatory signaling to T cells and antigen presenting cells. NK cells are correlated with increased tumor control and better overall patient survival across various types of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite their promising potential for anti-tumor killing, NK cell function is often diminished within the tumor microenvironment. There are many factors that lead to decreased tumor-infiltrating NK cell killing, including immunoinhibitory factors from tumor cells and resident tissues, acquired immune tolerance, NK cell exhaustion, and the hypoxic state of the tumor microenvironment. Unleashing NK cell activity therefore has high potential to create a new class of immunotherapy that could combat both primary and acquired resistance to current checkpoint inhibitors. In this review we discuss mechanistic details of NK cell tumor killing, NK cell immunosuppression, and gaps in knowledge regarding highly complex microenvironment-specific effects on NK cell function. We also discuss the promise and limitations of emerging NK-cell based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains a significant public health burden. One of the most personalized treatments uses a patient’s own tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and TIL activity is also essential for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) effectiveness. Responses to immunotherapies vary due to immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and limited antigen presentation. In this study, we computationally examine cell-cell signaling and transcriptional activity using single-cell RNA sequencing of lung cancer treated by inhibiting methyltransferase EZH2. We show that EZH2 inhibition shifts the TME to immunogenic signaling patterns conducive to increased T cell response, including antigen presentation and homing. T cells also showed more stem-like phenotypes. Transcriptional activity was quieter with EZH2 inhibition but revealed better interferon response, altered myeloid and B cell differentiation, and apoptotic markers. Importantly, inferred EZH2 activity showed it could perform non-methyltransferase duties vital for T cell differentiation. These results indicate that EZH2 inhibition could improve immunotherapies for lung cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a global health crisis complicated by immune dysregulation and T cell exhaustion. CD39, an ectonucleotidase generating immunosuppressive adenosine, is implicated in cancer and chronic infections, yet its spatiotemporal role in TB pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Multiple publicly available datasets were utilized to evaluate CD39 across TB disease stages, diverse infectious diseases and anti-TB treatment. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated via ROC curves and combined signature analysis. Immune cell infiltration were analyzed using CIBERSORTx. Cytokine profiles and age-stratified associations were examined. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by GSEA. Single-cell analysis of non-human primate granulomas assessed CD39’s temporal dynamics, utilizing Monocle 3 for CD39+ T-cell trajectory analysis. Results CD39 was upregulated in active TB patients versus TB infection (TBI) and healthy controls (HC), correlating with older age, disease severity, and distinct expression patterns compared to other respiratory and systemic infections. CD39 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy over IFN-γ in distinguishing TB from TBI/HC and other respiratory diseases. Combining CD39 with TBX21 or GZMB further improved diagnostic specificity. High CD39 expression correlated with suppressed Th1 and elevated Th2/Th17/regulatory cytokines, alongside pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Age-stratified analysis revealed complex age-dependent associations of CD39 expression with various immune cell types. Single-cell analysis revealed declining CD39 transcriptional activity during prolonged infection despite expanded cellular distribution, linked to early T cell maturation followed by broader immunomodulatory shifts. Decreased CD39 expression with anti-TB treatment correlated with improved immune cell balance and resolved T cell exhaustion. Conclusion CD39 is a critical regulator of immune exhaustion and neutrophil-driven inflammation in TB, with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Targeting CD39 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for TB.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neonates have increased vulnerability to life-threatening infections due to the distinct immune landscape. Interleukin (IL)-27 is a key component of this immune profile that we have previously shown to be elevated in both newborn humans and mice. IL-27 continues to increase in the serum and tissues consistent with poor outcomes during gram-negative neonatal bacterial sepsis. Presently, we dissected the IL-27 producer profile at a single-cell level using IL-27p28eGFP reporter mice in our previously established model of neonatal sepsis with luciferase-expressing K1-encapsulated Escherichia coli. Whole animal imaging regionally highlighted the spleen, liver, and lungs as key infection sites by bacterial luminescence. Flow cytometry showed that IL-27 producers increased significantly in the liver with infection and were predominantly F4/80+ and CD11b+ with subpopulations that emerged expressing additional markers. This information paired with single-cell RNA sequencing further identified the most robust populations as monocytes, monocyte-derived cells, and Kupffer cells followed by smaller populations of dendritic cells and neutrophils. The transcriptome demonstrated a diverse range of functionality amongst populations that included differential expression of genes implicated in bactericidal, metabolic, and inflammatory changes. Collectively, the transcriptome of IL-27 producers from the livers of infected animals suggests an uncoordinated mix of inflammatory and suppressive activity that may contribute to immune dysregulation characteristic of sepsis. Together, this work provides previously undescribed insight into the details of IL-27 producers during early-life infection. This further provides essential information needed to support IL-27 as a therapeutic target for neonatal bacterial sepsis.">

        <tr id="Cancer therapies that induce immunogenic cell death such as necroptosis can arm the immune system to clear residual tumor cells. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) signaling can trigger necroptosis, orchestrating immune responses to solid tumors. Whether RIPK3 activity can be exploited for controlling B cell malignancies remains unclear. Here, we establish a strategy to manipulate RIPK3 activity in malignant B cells and promote immune-mediated tumor control. By controlling and visualizing RIPK3 signaling using intravital imaging, we established that RIPK3 activation promoted apoptosis and rapid macrophage engulfment but failed to induce necroptosis due to limited MLKL expression in B-lineage cells. RIPK3-induced cell death could be diverted toward necroptosis with type I IFN and caspase inhibition. Exploiting these findings, we showed that a combination therapy activating RIPK3 with SMAC mimetics while suppressing caspase activity and providing type I IFN resulted in immune-mediated control of B cell tumors. Hence, reprogramming RIPK3 activity represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity to target B cell malignancies.">

        <tr id="Although checkpoint immunotherapy has primarily focused on CD8⁺ T cells, emerging evidence highlights an important role for cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in mediating therapeutic responses. However, research on the functional properties of cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in the context of immunotherapy is still at an early stage and remains insufficiently defined. Utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets obtained from metastatic melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, we performed transcriptomic profiling of conventional CD4⁺ T cells, excluding proliferative and regulatory (FOXP3⁺) subsets, and compared responders and non-responders as distinct groups. Importantly, our analysis identified distinct clusters that discriminate between responders and non-responders, with cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells occupying a central position within these clusters. In responder-specific clusters, cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells exhibited features of early activation, whereas clusters specific to non-responders were characterized by an exhausted phenotype. Notably, non-responder-specific clusters were positioned proximally to Treg-like clusters, suggesting a potential transition from cytotoxic to regulatory CD4⁺ T cell states in non-responders. Our findings reinforce the emerging concept that cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells play a central role in mediating immunotherapy responses. These results provide a foundation for the development of predictive biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating CD4⁺ T cell differentiation.

        <tr id="Abstract CD4+ tissue‐resident memory T (TRM) cells are essential for immune protection in the lungs, providing rapid responses against respiratory pathogens. Unlike circulating memory T cells, CD4+ TRM cells persist in the tissue parenchyma and possibly inducible lymphoid tissues, where they facilitate pathogen clearance through cytokine production and interactions with local immune cells. While CD8+ TRM cells are well studied, the role of CD4+ TRM cells in immunity remains less defined and is the focus of this review. Distinct subsets, based on the effector TH1, TH2, TH17 and T follicular helper (TFH)‐like tissue‐resident helper (TRH) cells, contribute to antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and vaccine‐induced immunity. CD4+ TRM cells play a key role in infections, enhancing immune responses and supporting antibody production. However, they are also implicated in chronic inflammation, allergies and fibrosis. Given their importance, vaccines aiming to elicit lung‐resident CD4+ TRM cells, particularly via mucosal delivery, have shown promise in inducing long‐term protective immunity. Intranasal vaccination strategies, such as live‐attenuated influenza virus and tuberculosis vaccines, have successfully generated CD4+ TRM cells, highlighting their potential for respiratory pathogen control. In this review, we focus on CD4+ TRM cells, their differentiation, maintenance and role, especially in the lungs.">

        <tr id="Tumor immunosuppression remains a major barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy and is often driven by the immunoregulatory activities of innate immune cells, such as myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Myeloid populations—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—play pivotal roles in dampening anti-tumor immune responses and promoting tumor progression. Recent advances in our understanding of myeloid cell biology have unveiled new therapeutic opportunities to disrupt these immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with tumor inflammation. This review highlights key signaling pathways and surface molecules involved in myeloid-mediated immune suppression, including CSF1R, PI3Kγ, mTOR, Syk, MerTK/Axl, and immune checkpoints such as Trem2, LILRBs, VISTA, and CD40. We examine preclinical and clinical findings that support targeting these pathways to reprogram the TME and enhance anti-tumor immunity. By integrating insights from mechanistic studies and therapeutic development, this review underscores the potential of myeloid cell-targeting strategies as promising adjuncts to current cancer immunotherapies. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges in translating these approaches into durable clinical benefit.">

        <tr id="Background CD24 plays a crucial role not only in promoting tumor progression and metastasis but also in modulating macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity. However, its impact on the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the role of CD24a, the murine CD24 gene, in tumor progression and TME immune dynamics in a murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model. Methods Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 knockout technology was employed to generate CD24a knockout in the murine TNBC cell line 4T1. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the immune cell populations, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer cells, T cells, and macrophages, within tumors, spleens, and bone marrow in the orthotopic mouse 4T1 breast cancer model. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to detect the immune cells in tumor sections. High-speed confocal was used to perform three-dimensional (3D) mapping of immune cells in the 4T1 orthotopic tumors. Results Knocking out CD24a significantly reduced tumor growth kinetics and prolonged mouse survival in vivo. Flow cytometry and IF analysis of tumor samples revealed that CD24a loss significantly promoted the infiltration of M1 macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells into the TME while reducing the recruitment and expansion of granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSCs). In vitro coculture experiments showed that CD24a deficiency significantly enhanced macrophage‐mediated phagocytosis and CD8⁺ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, effects that were partially reversed by re‐expression of CD24a. Moreover, in vivo depletion of macrophages and CD8+ T cells reverted the delayed tumor growth caused by CD24a knockout, underscoring their critical role in tumor growth suppression associated with CD24a knockout. 3D mapping of immune cells in the TME confirmed the anti-tumor immune landscape in the CD24a knockout 4T1 tumors. Furthermore, in vitro analysis showed that CD24a loss upregulated macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression while suppressed levels of CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL10, chemokines known to recruit gMDSCs, further providing a molecular basis for enhanced macrophage recruitment and diminished gMDSC accumulation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that CD24a may regulate immune suppression within the TNBC TME. Targeting CD24a enhances macrophage- and CD8⁺ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and is associated with a shift in the TME toward a more immunogenic state, thereby suppressing tumor growth. These results may support CD24 as a promising immunotherapeutic target for TNBC.

Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of these cells in connective tissue diseases. Conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) exhibit distinct contributions to disease progression. In systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, pDCs primarily drive pathogenesis via excessive type I interferon production, whereas in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cDCs play a major role in promoting autoreactive T cell activation. Emerging DC subsets, such as inflammatory DC3s and LAMP3+ DCs, have been implicated in RA synovitis. In vasculitis, tissue-resident vascular DCs appear to regulate localized inflammation.

Despite decades of use of standard immunosuppressive therapy, treatment responses remain variable, and many patients experience relapses or develop end-stage renal disease. This review synthesizes emerging insights into the immunopathogenesis of LN, drawing on studies from single-cell transcriptomics, signaling pathway analyses and renal tissue immunology. It examines the role of both innate and adaptive immune cells in mediating disease. The therapeutic landscape is rapidly evolving with novel biologics targeting B cell survival and cytokine signaling, small-molecule inhibitors modulating intracellular pathways, and promising developments in cell-based interventions. Notably, recent clinical case series have demonstrated that CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy can induce durable drug-free remission in LN, representing a transformative approach to immune modulation. These advances are further supported by the application of multi-omics platforms to refine biomarker-driven disease monitoring and personalized treatment. Integrating immunologic and technological innovations holds the potential to redefine therapeutic strategies in LN. Precision medicine approaches that leverage targeted therapies, immune resetting modalities, and biomarker-guided clinical decisions may significantly improve long-term renal outcomes and patient quality of life.">

Understanding the mechanisms by which HIV-1 controllers maintain and eventually lose this ability would be highly valuable in HIV-1 cure or vaccine research. Previous work revealed the ability of CD8+ T cells isolated from HIV-1 controllers to suppress HIV-1 replication in matched CD4+ T cells and PBMCs ex vivo and suggested the loss of control may be tied to CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Results We explored whether CD8+ T cell exhaustion plays a role in the maintenance and loss of control by examining immune characteristics of HIV-1 persistent controllers and transient controllers who lost control within the duration of the study. Using flow cytometry, we analyzed exhaustion marker expression on CD8+ T cells from HIV-1 controllers and determined that they maintain a unique exhaustion profile as compared to people without HIV-1 and HIV-1 standard progressors. The low level of T cell exhaustion seen in HIV-1 controllers was reversed when these individuals lost control and showed increased viral loads. Combinatorial immune checkpoint blockade targeting exhaustion markers was able to restore ex vivo control in CD8+ T cells from former controllers. Conclusions These results suggest that CD8+ T cell exhaustion compromises the ability to control viral replication in HIV-1 controllers. The character of exhaustion in response to HIV-1 and therapy is distinct in HIV-1 persistent controllers, transient controllers and standard progressors.">

The macrophage–NK cell interplay can either promote or suppress immune responses depending on the context, representing both a challenge and a therapeutic opportunity. NK cells are key effectors capable of recognising and eliminating malignant cells without prior sensitisation, whereas macrophages exhibit remarkable plasticity, functioning as either promoters or suppressors of tumour immunity depending on their activation state.

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) significantly contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and targeted inhibition of MDSCs is a potential therapeutic strategy against cancer. Here, we identify macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as a critical regulator of MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression in breast cancer. The present study demonstrates that MARCO is expressed on MDSCs, and breast tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) enriched with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promote MDSC differentiation and amplify immunosuppressive activity by up-regulating MARCO. Genetic ablation of MARCO in a murine breast cancer model attenuated tumor growth, accompanied by reduced monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) and total tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), along with enhanced infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Furthermore, we developed a specific MARCO down-regulation-promoting monoclonal antibody that impeded TDE-induced MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression. In vivo, MARCO down-regulating antibody suppressed tumor growth and reprogrammed the TME by diminishing immunosuppressive MDSCs and TAMs and revitalizing CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Strikingly, combining the MARCO down-regulating antibody with PD-1 blockade synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. This work establishes MARCO as a key regulator of MDSC-mediated immunosuppression and presents a compelling case for the inclusion of MARCO as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.">

These compartments serve as critical interfaces where peripheral immune cells interact with CNS-resident immune cells. We then analyze the roles of specific immune cell subsets (e.g., T/B cells, myeloid cells and microglia) in disease progression, highlighting their functional heterogeneity across different MS subtypes.

        <tr id="Background Influenza viruses with pandemic potential and possible burden of post-viral sequelae are a global concern. To prepare for future pandemics and the development of improved vaccines, it is vital to identify the immunological changes underlying influenza disease severity. Methods We combined unsupervised high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry with gene expression analyses, plasma CXCL13 measurements, and antigen-specific immune cell assays to characterize the immune profiles of hospitalized patients with severe and moderate seasonal influenza disease during active infection and at 6-month follow-up. We used age-matched healthy donors as controls. Results Severe disease was associated with a distinct immune profile, including lower frequencies of ICOS+ mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and CXCR5+ memory B and CD4+CXCR5+CD95+ICOS+ and CD8+CXCR3+CD95+PD-1+TIGIT+ memory T cells, as well as lower CD4 gene expression. Higher frequencies of CD16+CD161+ NK cells, CD169+ monocytes, CD123+/− dendritic cells, and CD38high plasma cells and high CXCL13 plasma levels were also associated with severe disease. Alterations in immune cell subpopulations persisted at convalescence for the severely ill patients only. Conclusions Our results indicated a reduction in regulatory MAIT cells and memory T and B cells and an increase in the inhibitory subpopulations of monocytes and NK cells in severe influenza that persisted at convalescence. These immune cell alterations were associated with higher age and the presence of several underlying conditions that may contribute to frailty. This study illustrates the power and sensitivity of high-dimensional single-cell analyses in identifying potential cellular biomarkers for disease severity after influenza infection.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance posing significant challenges to treatment. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA-seq deconvolution to analyze BRCA samples. Our analysis identified 15 major cell clusters, including neoplastic epithelial, immune, stromal, and endothelial populations. Notably, low-grade tumors showed enriched subtypes, such as CXCR4+ fibroblasts, IGKC+ myeloid cells, and CLU+ endothelial cells, with distinct spatial localization and immune-modulatory functions. These subtypes were paradoxically linked to reduced immunotherapy responsiveness, despite their association with favorable clinical features. High-grade tumors exhibited reprogrammed intercellular communication, with expanded MDK and Galectin signaling. Bulk RNA-seq deconvolution further supported the prognostic significance of low-grade-enriched subtypes. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment and provide new insights into immune evasion and therapeutic resistance in breast cancer.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection induces a hyperinflammatory response to promote inflammatory injury in multiple tissues. However, the relative mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we first confirmed that PRV infection could trigger pyroptosis to cause lung injury, evidenced by the increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in lung tissue of infected piglets and mice. Subsequently, we observed that PRV-induced lung lesions and mortality were improved in Gsdmd−/− mice rather than in Ripk3−/− mice. The number of NK cells was markedly higher in Gsdmd−/− mice than in WT mice. Based on this finding, refilling NK cells could significantly alleviate the replication of PRV in the lungs of mice and alleviate lung injury caused by PRV infection, whereas depletion of NK cells aggravated PRV infection and led to severe lung lesions. Notably, gasdermin D (GSDMD) deficiency could reduce the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) positive macrophages and the depletion of NK cells induced by PRV infection to alleviate the pathogenicity of PRV, while TNF-α neutralizing antibody could also reduce the PRV-induced NK cell depletion to alleviate the pathogenicity of PRV. Ultimately, we found that necrosulfonamide (NSA) showed a good protective effect on PRV-infected mice and had good anti-PRV activity in vivo. Collectively, our findings illuminate a new regulatory mechanism by which PRV infection induces NK cell depletion to weaken the antiviral ability of the host to promote virus replication and activate GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in lung tissue, leading to severer lung injury, and NSA is expected to be a candidate agent for the prevention and control of PRV infection. IMPORTANCE Necroptosis and pyroptosis are the most common regulated necrotic cell death pathways in various pathogenic infection-induced tissue damage. Herein, we found that gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis is a critical cell death pathway in pseudorabies virus (PRV)-induced lung inflammatory injury rather than receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-mediated necroptosis. PRV infection induces NK cell depletion to weaken the antiviral ability of the host to promote viral replication. GSDMD deficiency can reduce the depletion of NK cells induced by PRV infection by reducing the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-positive macrophages, thereby attenuating lung tissue lesions in PRV-infected mice. Whereas the use of necrosulfonamide (NSA) showed a good protective effect on PRV-infected mice. This study reveals that PRV infection can excessively activate macrophages to secrete more TNF-α to induce NK cell depletion to facilitate PRV infection and aggravate viral pathogenicity, and clarifies the roles of GSDMD in modulating macrophage activity and NK cell death, and also provides an effective inhibitor for use against PRV infection.">

        <tr id="C-C motif chemokine receptor-like 2 (CCRL2) is an atypical chemokine receptor (ACKR) that binds chemerin with high affinity but lacks classical G protein-coupled signaling. Instead, it functions as a non-signaling presenter of chemerin to CMKLR1-expressing cells, modulating antitumor immunity. CCRL2 is highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment and various human cancers, and its expression has been linked to delayed tumor growth in mouse models, primarily through the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis. While CCRL2’s role in immune surveillance is well established, its tumor cell-intrinsic functions remain less clear. Here, we investigated the impact of CCRL2 overexpression and knockout on tumor cell behavior in vitro. Although CCRL2 did not affect proliferation, migration, or clonogenicity in B16F0 melanoma and LLC cells, it significantly influenced spheroid morphology in B16F0 cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CCRL2 modulates innate immune signaling pathways, including TLR4 and IFN-γ/STAT1, with context-dependent downstream effects. These findings suggest that CCRL2 shapes tumor architecture by rewiring inflammatory signaling networks in a cell-intrinsic manner. Further studies in other cancer types and cell models are needed to determine whether CCRL2’s regulatory role is broadly conserved and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target in solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Epithelial cells at barrier sites are emerging as active participants in innate immune memory, yet the underlying metabolic and epigenetic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized form of trained immunity in oral epithelial cells that enhances protection against fungal infection. Using a mouse model, we show that mucosal exposure to Candida albicans confers sustained protective memory that is independent of adaptive immunity and myeloid cells. Mechanistically, mucosal memory is driven by proline catabolism via proline dehydrogenase (Prodh) in epithelial cells, which sustains mitochondrial function, epigenetic remodeling, and promotes cytokine production upon secondary challenge. Unlike classical trained immunity in immune cells, epithelial memory is independent of glycolysis but partially sustained by fatty acid oxidation via carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT1). These findings uncover a distinct metabolic-epigenetic axis that underlines long-term epithelial memory in the oral mucosa and reveal novel non-hematopoietic mechanisms of mucosal defense against fungal pathogens.">

        <tr id="Immunosenescence, the age-related decline in immune function, profoundly impacts cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes by fostering a tumor-promoting microenvironment and impairing immune surveillance. This review delineates eleven molecular hallmarks of immunosenescence, including genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation, which collectively drive immune cell dysfunction and systemic immunosuppression. Aging reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) through recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP), and metabolic reprogramming, contributing to therapy resistance and poor prognosis in elderly patients. While immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) cells show promise, their efficacy in aging populations is limited by T cell exhaustion, myeloid bias, and altered intercellular communication. Emerging strategies—including senolytics, epigenetic modulators (e.g., histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor), and metabolic interventions (e.g., spermidine, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN))—highlight potential avenues to rejuvenate aged immunity. Single-cell multi-omics (single cell RNA-seq, single cell ATAC-seq) further unravel immune cell heterogeneity, revealing tissue-specific chromatin accessibility dynamics and novel targets like interleukin-34 (IL-34) for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. However, challenges persist in translating preclinical findings to clinical practice, necessitating age-tailored trials and biomarker-driven approaches. By integrating mechanistic insights with translational innovations, this review underscores the urgency of addressing immunosenescence to optimize cancer immunotherapy for aging populations, ultimately bridging the gap between aging biology and precision oncology.">

They remain a major global health burden, requiring deeper research into immune responses; specifically, adaptive immunity. This study aims to analyze T cellular subsets in chronic HBV and HCV infection and investigate their potential role in the immunopathogenesis of these conditions. Methods: For our study, we collected 123 blood samples taken from patients infected with HCV (n = 36) and HBV (n = 34) and healthy volunteers (n = 53). With the use of flow cytometry, we assessed levels of CD4+ and CD8+ minor T cell subpopulations (naïve, central, and effector memory cells (CM and EM), terminally differentiated EM (TEMRA), Th1, Th2, Th17, Tfh, Tc1, Tc2, Tc17, Tc17.1). Results: Despite similar total CD4+ T cell frequencies across chronic HCV, HBV, and healthy groups, patients with hepatitis showed elevated TEMRA, EM, and CM subsets alongside depleted naïve Th cells and specific CM subpopulations compared to controls. Patients with chronic HCV and HBV showed elevated CD8+ T cell frequencies versus controls, with disease-specific shifts: reduced EM CTLs but increased TEMRA CTLs, Tc1/Tc17.1 depletion (notably Tc17.1 in HCV), and higher Tc2 levels. Conclusions: Viral clearance in HBV and HCV requires a delicate balance between immunity and viral activity. Despite similar T cell frequencies (CD3+/CD4+/CD8+), minor subsets revealed distinct patterns differentiating HCV, HBV, and healthy controls.">

        <tr id="Tumors frequently evade immune destruction by impairing cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses, highlighting the need for strategies that restore T-cell functionality. Here, we identify SLAMF7 (CD319) as a key enhancer of human CD8+ T-cell responses against tumors. SLAMF7 expression is induced by pro-inflammatory signals such as IL-12 and CD28 co-stimulation. Agonistic SLAMF7 signaling, in synergy with TCR activation, is able to strongly induce T-cell activation and clonal expansion, a finding consistently observed in CD8+ T cells from healthy adults as well as derived from blood and tumor-draining lymph nodes of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Moreover it drives a distinct differentiation programme characterized by elevated expression of key transcription factors Eomes and T-bet, leading to increased production of effector molecules such as Interferon γ, Granzyme B and Perforin. In contrast to CD28 costimulation, SLAMF7 activation also promotes serial killing potential via BTLA induction. In antigen-specific human models, SLAMF7 activation boosts CD8+ T-cell responses against the tumor-associated antigen NY-ESO-1, a key target in several cancers including HNSCC. Moreover, combining SLAMF7 activation with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade synergistically enhances cytokine release and cytotoxic potential, highlighting its potential to overcome immunosuppression and reinvigorate antitumor immunity.">

These functions contribute to cancer immunity and have been previously linked to the induction of anti‐tumour CD8+ T cells and enhanced responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by sustained synovial inflammation and the gradual destruction of joint structures. Although conventional T cells have historically been viewed as central to RA pathogenesis, increasing attention has recently focused on unconventional T cell subsets, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and gamma delta T (γδ T) cells. Functioning as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, these cells contribute to RA immunopathogenesis by producing cytokines, exerting cytotoxic effects, and interacting with various immune and stromal cells. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the immunological characteristics and pathogenic roles of unconventional T cell subsets in RA. NKT, MAIT, and γδ T cells contribute to the amplification of inflammatory responses and joint tissue destruction through diverse mechanisms, exhibiting unique tissue tropism and functional plasticity. Recently, novel therapeutic strategies have been developed to target these subsets, including modulation of antigen presentation pathways, inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, and reprogramming of cellular functionalities. Advancements in single-cell omics and spatial immune profiling have facilitated the precise identification and characterization of pathogenic unconventional T cell subsets in the RA synovium, thereby paving the way for personalized immunotherapeutic approaches.">

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), STING, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and natural killer receptors (NKRs) are expressed by CD8+ T cells, where they influence various cellular responses. Primarily serving as noncanonical costimulatory signals, TLRs can modulate T cell activation, differentiation, metabolic fitness, and memory formation. RLRs and STING can promote T cell expansion and cytokine production. Both activating and inhibitory NKRs can also alter T cell cytotoxicity and differentiation. As demonstrated in recent advancements, the capacity of these signaling cascades to enhance T cell responses offers promising therapeutic opportunities in cancer. Clinical strategies are being developed to selectively harness each of these pathways, such as TLR and STING agonists to bolster antitumor responses, and NKR-based approaches to amplify cytotoxic function. Additionally, adoptive T cell therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, are incorporating these innate signaling components to overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression, enhance functional longevity, and improve therapeutic efficacy.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment that importantly contributes to treatment resistance. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), which comprise approximately 50% of the cellular population within the GBM microenvironment, represent a major subset of tumor-associated macrophages. These cells drive tumor progression by promoting angiogenesis, immune evasion, and the phenotypic transformation of tumor cells. MDM infiltration is mediated by specific signaling pathways and regulated by the disruption of the blood–brain barrier and tumor-associated hypoxia. Recent technological advances have uncovered substantial heterogeneity among macrophages, including hypoxia-induced, lipid-metabolizing, phagocytic, and interferon-activated subtypes. This functional diversity is shaped by tumor-specific genetic alterations and metabolic reprogramming. Therapeutic approaches focusing on MDMs include inhibiting their recruitment, enhancing phagocytic activity, employing genetically engineered macrophage, and modulating metabolic pathways. While preclinical studies suggest that these approaches may improve efficacy when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, the dynamic spatiotemporal heterogeneity and adaptability of macrophages within the tumor microenvironment remain substantial therapeutic challenges. Future development in combination therapies, integrating single-cell multi-omics, spatial metabolic profiling, and targeted interventions, will be critical to precisely modulate MDMs, overcome immune tolerance, and improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neutrophils, traditionally viewed as first-line defenders in innate immunity, are increasingly recognized for their dualistic roles in cancer. In breast cancer, a distinct subset known as N2 neutrophils exhibits pro-tumorigenic activity, facilitating angiogenesis, immune suppression, and metastasis. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the molecular mechanisms underlying N2 polarization—focusing on key pathways such as TGF-β, STAT3/6, and hypoxia-mediated signaling—and their implications in breast cancer progression. We further explore how N2 neutrophils interact with other immune cells within the tumor microenvironment to promote an immunosuppressive milieu. A unique contribution of this review lies in its integration of emerging single-cell and flow cytometry data to underscore neutrophil plasticity and subtype-specific differences in neutrophil activity across breast cancer variants. Therapeutic strategies targeting N2 neutrophils are critically examined, including small-molecule inhibitors, cytokine blockade, and neutrophil-targeted nanomedicine. However, major challenges persist—most notably the difficulty in selectively depleting or reprogramming N2 neutrophils without compromising essential antimicrobial functions. Additionally, the lack of validated N2-specific markers in clinical samples limits translational progress. Addressing these gaps is crucial for the development of safe, effective immunomodulatory therapies in breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) positive cancers have a tumor environment that induces antigen-presenting cells to increase IL-23 expression. Unclear is if HPV16 E6/E7 oncoproteins expressed in these cancers play a role in upregulating interleukin (IL)-23 in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and how this cytokine impacts the antitumor cytotoxic T-cell response in HPV16+ cancer. Methods CD8 T-cells targeting HPV16+ cancer cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mice bearing HPV16+ C3.43 tumors that were therapeutically vaccinated against HPV16 E6/E7 and incubated with IL-23. These T-cells were then co-incubated with HPV16+ target cells in a cytotoxicity assay to assess their cytolytic capacity. Additionally, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeled T-cells were used to track the effect of IL-23 on their proliferation. The effect of IL-23 neutralization on vaccine-induced antitumor immunity during tumor progression was studied in vivo to assess its potential as either a standalone treatment or combined with a vaccine targeting HPV16 E6/E7. HPV16− tumors were engineered to express E6/E7 to find out if these oncoproteins upregulate IL-23. To understand how HPV oncoproteins in the TME affect transcriptional regulation of IL-23 producing cells, we used single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)+RNA sequencing. Results Inside macrophages residing in the HPV+ TME, transcription factor enrichment and linkage analysis identified KLF2 as a potential regulator of Il23a. Overexpression of KLF2 in macrophages upregulates IL-23 production. CD8 T-cells that recognize HPV16+ cells incubated with IL-23 are inhibited in both their killing and proliferative capacities. IL-23 neutralization increased the presence of HPV-specific cytotoxic CD8 T-cells inside the HPV16+TME in an IL-17 independent manner. Combination of IL-23 neutralization followed by HPV16 E6/E7 vaccination increases survival by amplifying the anti-tumor immune response. Conclusion This study finds that the presence of HPV oncoproteins in tumor cells increases KLF2 expression in tumor-associated macrophages in vivo. It also shows that KLF2 upregulates IL-23 production in M2 macrophages, resulting in increased IL-23 levels in the TME. In addition, it is shown that elevated levels of IL-23 suppress the antitumor immune response and that IL-23 neutralization synergizes with therapeutic vaccination against HPV oncoproteins.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains one of the most formidable infectious diseases globally. The immune system orchestrates a complex response including, but not limited to, T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) to control and eliminate Mtb. While these cells are well-recognized for their roles in anti-tumor immunity, their contributions to the defense against Mtb are equally critical. This review delves into the specific mechanisms by which these immune cells release cytotoxic enzymes and effector molecules, offering new insights into their pivotal roles in Mtb clearance.

        <tr id="This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge on immunotherapy resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a disease that accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases and remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved survival for a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC, over 70% of cases ultimately exhibit primary or acquired resistance, underscoring the urgent need to understand the underlying mechanisms. The review categorizes resistance into tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic processes and provides an in-depth mechanistic analysis of how factors such as tumor antigen loss, impaired antigen presentation, cGAS-STING pathway dysregulation, metabolic reprogramming in tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cell exhaustion, and microbiomes collectively contribute to immune escape. In parallel, the influence of the lung and gut microbiome on shaping immunotherapy responses is discussed, with emphasis on microbial dysbiosis, immunosuppressive metabolite production, and TME remodeling. Therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance are also discussed, including combination approaches involving chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and antiangiogenic agents, as well as epigenetic modulators (HDAC and BET inhibitors). Moreover, the review explores bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and small-molecule agents that enhance T cell function or disrupt immunosuppressive signaling networks. By integrating insights from preclinical models and clinical trials, the review underscores the necessity of biomarker-guided patient stratification, combination immunotherapy approaches, and interventions that restore tumor immunogenicity. It concludes that a multipronged therapeutic strategy, one that addresses both immune evasion and TME-induced suppression, holds the greatest promise for improving response durability and advancing personalized immunotherapy for NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections globally, particularly affecting infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. While recent advances in prophylaxis, such as long-acting monoclonal antibodies and maternal immunization, offer promise for prevention, therapeutic options for active infection remain limited. Severe RSV disease is often driven not solely by viral replication but by dysregulated host immune responses, including excessive cytokine production, T helper type 2 (Th2) and T helper type 17 (Th17) cell polarization, and impaired interferon signaling. RSV has evolved sophisticated immune evasion strategies, such as inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, degradation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) via nonstructural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1/NS2), and interference with pattern recognition receptor signaling, particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. These mechanisms result in attenuated innate immune responses and defective adaptive immunity, contributing to viral persistence, immunopathology, and recurrent infections. Moreover, age-dependent vulnerabilities, such as immune immaturity in infants and immunosenescence in older adults, exacerbate disease severity. Excessive immune activation leads to bronchiolitis, airway remodeling, and long-term sequelae including wheezing and asthma. Emerging immunomodulatory therapies aim to restore immune balance, targeting cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-1 beta [IL-1β]), the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, or inflammasome activity. Host-directed therapies and direct-acting antivirals are also under investigation. A better understanding of RSV–host immune interactions is critical for optimizing therapeutic strategies and designing effective vaccines. This review synthesizes current knowledge on RSV immunopathogenesis and highlights immunomodulation as a promising frontier for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="HIV-1 evades immune responses by modulating plasma membrane receptors. Using a flow cytometry–based screening, we profiled 332 surface receptors on HIV-1–infected primary CD4+ T cells and identified 23 down-regulated receptors, including known targets such as CD4, MHCI, CCR7, and CD62L. CD96, an inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptor poorly studied in human CD4+ T cells, was markedly down-regulated. This modulation, mediated by the viral proteins Nef and Vpu, surpassed that of other NK-associated receptors such as CD155 and NTB-A and is conserved across lentiviruses. CD96Hi CD4+ T cells exhibited a proinflammatory TH1/TH17 phenotype characterized by IFN-γ and IL-17 secretion and displayed impaired migration in vivo. Furthermore, CD96 ligation enhanced IFN-γ release upon viral peptide stimulation and promoted the secretion of TH1/TH17-associated cytokines. Our findings suggest that CD96 regulates antiviral immune responses and maintains proinflammatory properties in CD4+ T cells. Thus, its down-regulation represents a previously unknown HIV-1 immune evasion strategy, with implications for exploiting CD96 as immunotherapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening complications that can arise following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). GVHD occurs when immune cells—primarily T cells—from the graft recognize host cells as foreign entities and initiate an immune response against host tissues. This immune reaction generally involves a diverse array of cytokines, including interleukins (ILs), which play a pivotal role in modulating the immune response, promoting inflammation, and sustaining immune tolerance. Members of the interleukin family are not only directly involved in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T cells but also regulate inflammatory responses and the migration of immune cells. Consequently, they significantly influence both the clinical manifestations and prognosis of GVHD. The objective of this study is to review recent advancements in research concerning interleukins and their role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. This study aims to elucidate how interleukins contribute to immune regulation, inflammatory responses, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, we will discuss their potential as therapeutic targets, with the intention of providing novel insights and strategies for the clinical management of GVHD.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
While highly efficacious for numerous cancers, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can cause unpredictable and potentially severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), underscoring the need to understand irAE biology.


METHODS
We used a multidimensional approach incorporating single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) profiling to characterize the peripheral immune landscape of patients receiving ICI therapy according to irAE development.


RESULTS
Analysis of 162 patients revealed that individuals who developed clinically significant irAEs exhibited a baseline proinflammatory, autoimmune-like state characterized by a significantly higher abundance of CD57+ T and natural killer (NK) T cells, plasmablasts, proliferating and activated CXCR3+ lymphocytes, CD8+ effector and terminal effector memory T cells, along with reduced NK cells and elevated plasma ANA levels. In irAE cases, we identified distinct baseline proinflammatory gene signatures, including markedly higher expression of IL1B and CXCL8 in monocytes and CXCR3, TNF, and IFNG in T/NK cells. TNF signaling was the most enriched pathway, while immunosuppressive genes SIGLEC7 and CXCR4 were downregulated. Following ICI initiation, these patients exhibited an enhanced shift toward an activated and inflammatory immune phenotype, including monocyte reprogramming characterized by upregulation of IL18 and elevated gene expression levels of CXCL10. Conversely, post-treatment levels of CXCL8 were decreased in irAE patients. Notably, in patients who did not develop clinically significant irAE, we identified increased baseline abundance of a TGFBIhigh myeloid cluster enriched in immunosuppressive markers such as STAB1. In addition, patients without irAE exhibited upregulation of TNF and AIRE, accompanied by distinct myeloid protumorigenic reprogramming.


CONCLUSIONS
A pre-existing activated, autoimmune-like proinflammatory state drives the development of irAE during ICI therapy through three key axes: increased plasmablast/ANA, heightened interferon-gamma/CXCL10/CXCR3 axis, and amplified TNF signaling. These findings may serve as potential peripheral immune biomarkers for predicting irAE and provide biological insights into the mechanisms governing and mitigating irAE.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a broad spectrum of physical and cognitive impairments. Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) tumors present a major clinical challenge due to complex immune evasion mechanisms and generally poor responses to immunotherapy. Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a critical determinant of immunotherapy resistance. Immunosuppressive cell populations such as regulatory T cells, M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts, together with aberrant cytokine networks and mechanical stress in the tumor stroma, cooperate to exclude T-cell infiltration and induce T-cell exhaustion, thereby undermining the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, TIME-driven signaling pathway activation and epigenetic reprogramming further reinforce immune escape and therapeutic failure. Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies have greatly improved our understanding of these processes. Meanwhile, strategies including multi-target combination immunotherapies, epigenetic modulators, mRNA vaccines, and gut microbiota interventions are under active investigation to reverse resistance and remodel the TIME. This mini review summarizes the multifaceted mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in GI tumors and discusses the potential of emerging therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell best known for fighting infections, but recent studies show they also play complex roles in cancer. Within tumors, neutrophils can adopt opposing identities: the “N1” type combats cancer by killing tumor cells and stimulating immune activity, while the “N2” type does the opposite—supporting tumor growth, blocking immune responses, and aiding disease progression. In this review, we explore how neutrophils respond to different cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immune cell therapy, and therapies using viruses or bacteria. We highlight how different therapeutic environments can drive neutrophils toward either the beneficial N1 or the harmful N2 state. Understanding what determines this polarization is key to improving outcomes. By understanding when neutrophils act in favor of or against treatment, scientists can design better strategies to fight cancer. This knowledge could lead to new therapies that guide neutrophils to support the immune system, reduce tumor spread, and improve the efficacy of current cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Purpose The heterogeneity of immune cells is a critical manifestation of gastric cancer (GC) heterogeneity and significantly contributes to immune therapy resistance. Although previous studies have focused on the roles of specific myeloid cells and exhausted CD8+ T cells in immune resistance, the immune cell interaction network and its spatiotemporal distribution in GC immune resistance remain underexplored. Methods This study integrated multiple GC single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, bulk-RNA sequencing, and single-cell immunotherapy datasets of our cohort (NFHGC Cohort). Methods such as single-cell subpopulation identification, transcriptomic analysis, spatial colocalization, cell communication network analysis and tissue immunofluorescence of gastric cancer were employed to investigate immune cell interactions and their molecular mechanisms in immune resistance. Results By leveraging a comprehensive approach that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA-seq profiles, we identified 20 immune subsets with potential prognostic and therapeutic implications. Our findings suggest a stromal immunosuppressive network orchestrated by Macro_SPP1/C1QC macrophages and CD8_Tex_C1 T cells, which may form a barrier impeding antitumor immunity. Macrophage-derived MIF signaling appears to drive immunosuppression via the MIF-CD74/CXCR4/CD44 axis. Based on these observations, we developed a preliminary TME classification system using a gene signature derived from barrier-associated immune cell markers and unsupervised clustering. Conclusions Our study identified a potential stromal immunosuppressive barrier in gastric cancer, driven by Macro_SPP1/C1QC macrophages and CD8_Tex_C1 T cells, which may contribute to immune dysfunction and therapy resistance. Molecular subtyping based on this barrier’s presence could inform personalized immune therapy strategies.">

        <tr id="TH17 cells play a critical role in inflammation, cancer development, and antitumor immunity in a context-dependent manner, but detailed mechanisms and their downstream signaling events remain poorly understood. Here, we describe that TH17 cytokines strongly inhibit expression of critical chemokines in epithelial tissues, which leads to blocking infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells into the colon, rendering resistance to DSS-induced colitis and colon cancer. We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of TH17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. Overall, our findings have identified a previously unrecognized critical gap between TH17 cytokines, epithelial chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration through a C/EBPβ-mediated pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are organized aggregates of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and stromal cells that form at sites of inflammation, providing adaptive immune responses outside of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). Found in various pathological conditions—including chronic infections, cancer, organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and allergy—the presence of TLSs is linked to potentiation of local immunity. TLSs can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on context, and have been implicated as prognostic for disease severity and therapy response. Architecturally, TLSs resemble SLOs with distinct T and B cell areas supported by fibroblasts that secrete chemokines and cytokines that support immune cells. These structures must be created de novo in non‐lymphoid tissues; thus, the steps for TLS formation mimic, but do not completely copy, those of SLO formation. The accumulation of immune cells in tissues in inflammatory settings can initiate remodeling of tissue fibroblasts, leading to TLS formation; this process is common across tissues, although there are tissue‐ and disease‐specific pathways that impact TLS formation in certain contexts. This review will explore the immune‐stromal crosstalk in kidney, lung, and skin TLSs across a range of disease settings, highlighting shared as well as tissue‐specific mechanisms for TLS formation.">

        <tr id="Lifileucel, a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) cell therapy approved for advanced melanoma, demonstrates promise for treating other solid tumors, including endometrial cancer (EC). The current study evaluates the feasibility of manufacturing TILs from EC tumors using Iovance’s proprietary 22-day Gen2 manufacturing process. Key parameters, including TIL yield, viability, immune phenotype, T-cell receptor clonality, and cytotoxic activity, were assessed. Of the 11 EC tumor samples processed at research scale, 10 (91%) successfully generated >1 × 109 viable TIL cells, with a median yield of 1.1 × 1010 cells and a median viability of 82.8%. Of the four EC tumor samples processed at full scale, all achieved the pre-specified TVC and viability targets. Putative tumor-reactive T-cell clones were maintained throughout the manufacturing process. Functional reactivity was evidenced by the upregulation of 4-1BB in CD8+ T cells, OX40 in CD4+ T cells, and increased production of IFN-γ and TNF-α upon autologous tumor stimulation. Furthermore, antitumor activity was confirmed using an in vitro autologous tumor organoid killing assay. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of ex vivo TIL expansion from EC tumors. This study provides a rationale for the initiation of the phase II clinical trial IOV-END-201 (NCT06481592) to evaluate lifileucel in patients with advanced EC.">

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), microglia, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) constitute the major immunosuppressive axis, promoting tumor progression through cytokine secretion (IL-10, TGF-β), metabolic reprogramming, and inhibition of cytotoxic immunity. These innate immune cells not only facilitate immune evasion but also impair adaptive T-cell responses, limiting the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Emerging evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting innate immunity via TAM repolarization, MDSC depletion, and NK cell activation to reshape the immunosuppressive TME.

 Radiation therapy (RT) can trigger type I interferon (IFN-I) responses and anti-tumor immunity in various can- cers. However, glioblastoma inevitably recurs, suggesting RT does not generate a long-lasting immune response. This may be due to a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and/or RT-induced immune evasion. Our ﬁndings show that RT promotes fatty acid synthase (FASN)-mediated lipid synthesis, a metabolic program that reportedly suppresses IFN-I in viral immunity. We hypothesized that FASN induction similarly inhibits IFN-I in irradiated glioblastoma, limiting antitumor immunity. We aim to determine whether FASN blockade restores IFN-I signaling, enhances immune inﬁltration, and improves RT and immunotherapy eﬃcacy.



 Murine glioblastoma cells were subjected to CRISPR/Cas9-mediated FASN knockout or treated with FASN in- hibitors (FASNi), then irradiated (6Gy) and analyzed 24h post-RT using RNA sequencing, LEGENDplex, and ELISA. In vivo, glioblastoma-bearing mice received FASNi (days 9-30), anti-PD-1 (twice weekly, days 15-24), and fractionated RT (5×6Gy, days 10-14). Survival was monitored (n=7/group), and tumor immune inﬁltration was assessed at day 20 using ﬂow cytometry and multiplex imaging. Long-term survivors (>100 days) were rechal- lenged in the contralateral hemisphere. In some experiments, mice received anti-CD8 or anti-IFNAR antibodies.



 Transcriptome analysis identiﬁed IFN-I signaling as the most enriched pathway in irradiated FASN-knockout cells, conﬁrmed by increased IFN-I protein levels. In vivo, RT+FASNi inﬂamed glioblastoma tumors, enhancing CD11c and CD8 T-cell inﬁltration. Remarkably, adding anti-PD-1 to RT+FASNi further improved survival, with 86% of mice tumor-free at 100 days vs. 43% in other RT-treated groups. Rechallenged RT+FASNi+anti-PD-1 survivors did not develop a tumor when compared to naïve animals, demonstrating immunological memory. CD8 depletion or IFNAR blockade abrogated this effect, highlighting the critical role of IFN-I and CD8



 FASN inhibition restores IFN-I responses in irradiated glioblastoma, enhancing immune inﬁltration and im- munotherapy eﬃcacy. These ﬁndings highlight FASN as a key target to shift glioblastoma from immunosup- pressive to immunoresponsive.

Although many studies have focused on the role of NK cells in tumor therapy, the heterogeneity of NK cells complicates the investigation of the complex mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell sequencing technology, with its high-resolution capability, reveals the gene expression profiles of individual NK cells, highlighting their heterogeneity and providing more accurate information for NK cell therapy. This article begins by addressing the mechanisms underlying the formation of NK cell heterogeneity, emphasizing the significance of differentiation, development, and tissue residency in establishing this heterogeneity. It also summarizes the advances in the study of NK cell heterogeneity under physiological conditions and in tumor environments using single-cell sequencing technology. Finally, it analyzes the dynamic changes of NK cells within the tumor microenvironment under various therapeutic approaches to explore drug effects and resistance mechanisms, as well as to optimize therapeutic options. Investigating the mechanisms of tumor progression and drug intervention at the single-cell level will provide new perspectives for personalized treatment strategies centered around NK cells.">

This study identified two novel NK cell subpopulations that could not be detected by conventional scRNA-seq pipelines or traditional flow cytometry. These subpopulations exhibit distinct gene expression profiles linked to the heterogeneity of immune responsiveness and stress adaptation in NK cells. In SV/HLHS patients, one cluster showed a significant upregulation of androgen response and downregulation of heme metabolism compared to healthy controls. Our study offers new insights into the fine-tuning of immune modulation that could help mitigate complications in SV/HLHS. It suggests that while NK cells in SV/HLHS adapt to support survival in a challenging physiological environment, these adaptations may compromise their ability to effectively respond to additional stresses, such as infections and inflammation.">

        <tr id="Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignant monoclonal gammopathy characterized by the proliferation of plasma cells (PC) in the bone marrow (BM). The tight cross-talk between the BM microenvironment and PC is the hallmark of MM. The BM microenvironment comprises a cellular compartment, consisting of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. The first includes myeloid cells, T- and B-lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and osteoclasts (OCs). In contrast, non-hematopoietic cell types include BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), osteoblasts, adipocytes and endothelial cells. Besides the cellular compartment, there is a non-cellular compartment that includes extracellular matrix, growth factors, chemokines, and several cytokines. All these members play distinctive but interacting roles in the progression of MM and the drug response. MM remains an incurable disease, but in the last years immunotherapy has emerged as an important tool in the treatment of MM. The involvement of the BM microenvironment is a relevant barrier in the response to immunotherapy and in generating resistance. In this review, we provide an overview of the BM microenvironment perturbation in MM patients and how it can determine the possible resistance to immunotherapy, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-drug conjugates, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T), and bispecific T-cell engagers (BsAbs).">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer, with poor survival rates in advanced stages due to late diagnosis, tumor heterogeneity, and therapy resistance. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in HCC has a crucial role in tumor progression, characterized by a complex interaction of immune cells, stromal components, and immunosuppressive signaling pathways. Chronic inflammation driven by viral infections, metabolic dysfunction, and alcohol consumption triggers an immunosuppressive TME, promoting immune evasion and tumor growth. Immune cell populations, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, and tumor-associated macrophages, contribute to immunosuppression, while cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells exert anti-tumor effects. Recent advances in immunotherapy, mainly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed death-ligand 1 and programmed cell death protein 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, have revolutionized HCC treatment, though response rates remain limited. Combined therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, and ICIs improve patient outcomes. This review discusses the immunological mechanisms contributing to HCC progression, the role of immune cell subsets in tumor evasion, and therapeutic interventions, from conventional treatments to advanced immunotherapies. Ongoing clinical trials, barriers to effective treatment, and future directions to enhance HCC management and patient survival will also be overviewed.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) exhibits complex dynamics among immune, stromal, and malignant cells that drive immune escape (IE) mechanisms and influence clinical outcomes. Through single-cell RNA sequencing and high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA), we identified a crucial IE-related gene module most strongly associated with KIRC progression. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering delineated two distinct IE patterns, with pattern one demonstrating prolonged patient survival. Employing advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms, we identified Cathepsin S (CTSS) as the most pivotal tumor suppressor, with elevated CTSS expression consistently predicting improved survival across multiple independent cohorts. Functional analyses revealed significant enrichment of CTSS in immune-regulatory pathways, including B/T cell activation and inflammatory activity. Mutation profiling uncovered distinct genomic alterations in 5q35.3 among CTSS-high tumors, while drug response prediction identified eight potential therapeutic agents (e.g., Navitoclax, Ibrutinib) exhibiting enhanced efficacy in these patients. Notably, CTSS expression strongly correlated with immune cell infiltration and established immunotherapy biomarkers, supporting its dual role as both a prognostic indicator and predictor of immune response. This study provides mechanistic insights into IE in KIRC and positions CTSS as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for precision immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphoid-derived cells that play a critical role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. Given their ability to recognize and directly kill targets possessing missing or altered self-proteins and to induce indirect killing via recruitment of adaptive immunity, they are in a unique position to modulate host immunologic responses. These complex immune sentinels typically circulate in the peripheral blood and/or reside in lymphoid tissues. As the largest organ, human skin functions in front line immunological defense, though it has not historically been categorized as lymphoid tissue. Whether tissue-resident ILC populations originally derive from conventional circulating NK cells, or whether they interface as developmentally distinct entities with phenotypic overlap within particular inflammatory contexts remains a subject of ongoing investigation. This review seeks to consolidate the currently available literature regarding NK cell and ILC skin homing and innate immune function in healthy vs. lesional human skin (including infection, inflammatory/autoimmune conditions, and cutaneous malignancy). Importantly, we elucidate significant gaps in the understanding of the complex role for NK cells in skin homeostasis and pathology, and posit unique opportunities the accessibility of this secondary lymphoid organ provides for translational studies to improve our understanding of cutaneous immunity.">

        <tr id="Two key players in the immune system, dendritic cells (DCs) and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), interact in a crucial way to fight infectious diseases. DCs play a key role in recognizing pathogens, and ILCs respond to cytokines released by DCs. This response triggers the production of specific effector cytokines that help control pathogens and maintain the body’s barrier integrity. DCs have various receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), that detect microbial components and trigger immune responses. Likewise, ILCs act as essential initial responders in the immune system in viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. Successfully managing diseases caused by pathogens mainly depends on the combined actions of DCs and ILCs, which work to suppress and eliminate pathogens. DCs also play a crucial role in activating innate and adaptive immune cell subsets, including ILCs. Furthermore, the use of DCs in developing vaccines and immunotherapy for cancers, along with the dedication of many researchers to improve immune responses through DCs, has increased interest in the potential of DC therapies for treating and preventing infectious diseases. This review examines approaches that may enhance DC vaccines and boost anti-infection immune responses by fostering better interactions of DCs with ILCs.">

        <tr id="Prolonged or broad-spectrum antibiotic courses are associated with intestinal dysbiosis and cytopenias, and depletion of hematopoietic progenitor populations following antibiotics is associated with loss of peripheral immune cells, leading to increased susceptibility to systemic infections. We evaluated the bone marrow hematopoietic compartment in a murine model of antibiotic exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a substantial and previously unrecognized depletion of bone marrow B cells at all stages of development in antibiotic-treated mice, further confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. Depletion of the microbiota was associated with rapid changes in the peripheral B cell compartment, yet fecal microbiota transfer did not rescue both peripheral and bone marrow B cells to a greater degree than natural recovery from antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic-mediated loss of B cell progenitors was secondary to enhanced apoptosis and occurred independent of disrupted systemic type I and II interferon signaling, previously implicated in the maintenance of other hematopoietic compartments. Instead, the depletion of pro-survival MYC signaling was implicated in the depletion of circulating lymphocytes and bone marrow B cell progenitor populations during antibiotic treatment. Further, in vitro exposure of bone marrow cells to antibiotics demonstrated significantly decreased viability of B cells. We conclude that both microbiota depletion and cytotoxic effects of prolonged broad spectrum antibiotic treatment disrupt cytokine and cell survival signaling critical for B cell progenitor maintenance. These results contribute to our understanding of the compartment-specific mechanisms by which the microbiota maintains the hematopoietic system and suggest critical pathways for maintenance of bone marrow progenitors during prolonged antibiotic treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The hyporesponsiveness of tumor-infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells to tumor cells contributes to immune escape of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), representing a major challenge in current immunotherapy. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Methods We first examined myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT) expression in RCC cell lines and clinical specimens, and analyzed its correlation with CD8+ T-cell exhaustion markers. To investigate the immunoregulatory role of MIAT, we evaluated its effects on CD8+ T-cell function using T-cell co-culture systems and humanized-peripheral blood mononuclear cells RCC patient-derived xenograft models. To determine the direct effects of MIAT on tumor cells, we assessed RCC cell malignant phenotypes following MIAT knockdown both in vitro and in immunodeficient nude mouse orthotopic xenograft models. Mechanistically, we employed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromatin isolation by RNA purification followed by mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to identify the molecular interactions between MIAT, transcription factors, and target genes. Results MIAT was highly expressed in RCC cells and positively correlated with CD8+ T-cell exhaustion status. MIAT knockdown significantly enhanced CD8+ T-cell function with increased perforin and interferon-γ production, while reducing the expression of exhaustion markers programmed cell death protein 1 and T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains. Mechanistically, MIAT was predominantly localized in the nucleus and formed a trimeric complex with transcription factor ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) and janus kinase 3 (JAK3) promoter, thereby upregulating JAK3 expression and activating the JAK3/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Importantly, ectopic expression of JAK3 largely abolished both the tumor-suppressive effects and enhanced T-cell function induced by MIAT depletion. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that the MIAT/JAK3/STAT3 pathway plays a critical role in malignant progression and immune escape of RCC through regulating CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for RCC immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Understanding the roles of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a promising strategy to identify novel targets to counteract the immunosuppressive barriers protecting multiple myeloma (MM). Neutrophils are a new cancer research focus due to their potential to reduce the efficacy of immune-based therapies. This study aimed to deepen understanding of neutrophil function in MM by analyzing freshly isolated myeloid cells from paired focal lesions (FL) and bone marrow (BM) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunofluorescence imaging, and functional assays. We describe three distinct CXCR2+ mature neutrophil subsets: TREM1+CD10+, RETN+LCN2+, and TNFAIP3+CXCL8+, each exhibiting unique phenotypes within the TME. Notably, the TREM1+CD10+ subset was highly prevalent, particularly in FL, demonstrating potent immunosuppressive effects on T cells. This subset's gene signature was correlated with shorter overall survival (OS) in a large MM patient dataset, underscoring its clinical significance. Targeted inhibition of neutrophil activity through CXCR2 blockade, alone or combined with standard anti-MM therapies, significantly reduced tumor burden, improving OS in preclinical MM models. These insights into neutrophil-mediated immunosuppression in MM provide valuable knowledge regarding mechanisms driving immune evasion and reveal new therapeutic approaches to enhance the efficacy of MM treatment.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with immune dysfunction, but how disease-intrinsic mechanisms in treatment-naive patients influence the coordination of adaptive responses to novel antigens remains unclear. Here, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell immunity in 38 treatment-naive CLL patients and 13 healthy controls (HCs) following vaccination. Despite significantly reduced total immunoglobulin levels compared to HCs, 94.7% of CLL patients developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, and 89.5% mounted IgA responses, with serum titers comparable to those of HCs. Virus-specific T cell responses, measured by IFN-γ release following antigen stimulation, were detected in 78.9% of patients. CLL patients had significantly more circulating CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells than HCs. These expansions correlated with B cell abundance, which, in untreated CLL, predominantly reflects malignant B cells. Notably, Tfh cell frequencies and absolute counts were highest in patients lacking a SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response, indicating a decoupling between Tfh expansion and functional antiviral immunity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that while SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses are largely preserved in treatment-naive CLL patients, disease-driven alterations in T cell composition may compromise the coordination and quality of antigen-specific T cell-mediated immunity.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that is often resistant to conventional therapies. The present narrative review discusses on the role of T cell metabolic reprogramming in the AML tumor microenvironment (TME), which markedly impacts the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The TME of AML, influenced by factors such as high lactic acid (LA) levels, hypoxia and nutrient competition, hampers T cell functions such as glycolysis, lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, leading to impaired T cell proliferation and antitumor response. Metabolic waste products, including LA and adenosine, further contribute to the immunosuppressive environment. T cell exhaustion, induced by nutrient deprivation and metabolic dysregulation, serves a key role in the failure of immune responses. Moreover, strategies to modulate T cell metabolism, such as targeting glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, show promise in enhancing immunotherapy outcomes. The current review also highlights emerging technologies, such as single-cell metabolomics and CRISPR screening, which are critical for identifying metabolic targets and advancing personalized therapies. Despite challenges in translating these findings to clinical settings, understanding T cell metabolism in the AML TME offers new therapeutic avenues for improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary In this study, we investigated the utilization of supercharged NK cells to treat melanoma in humanized mice. Humanized mice were developed by implanting human fetal tissues into immunocompromised mice; the immune cells of humanized mice closely resemble those of humans, with minimal differences.

The findings revealed the potential of supercharged NK cell-based therapies in treating melanoma and enhancing the immune system to establish long-term immunity in cancer patients. The study demonstrated that administering supercharged NK cells resulted in heightened NK cell proportions, increased cytokine release, and enhanced cytotoxic capabilities of immune cells in peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells, the spleen, and bone marrow of mice with tumors in comparison to the untreated group. Moreover, tumor-bearing mice treated with supercharged NK cells exhibited increased IFN-γ secretion and enhanced cytotoxicity of immune cells in various tissues, surpassing the levels observed in the untreated group. This research sheds light on the promising prospects of supercharged NK cell-based interventions for melanoma treatment, showcasing advancements in immune response amplification and strategies to combat tumors.">

Increasing evidence underscores the pivotal yet paradoxical roles of innate immune cells and their associated cytokines in orchestrating the dynamic landscape of the breast tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Innate immune effectors, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and natural killer (NK) cells, exert dual functions by either initiating robust antitumor responses or facilitating immune evasion, metastatic dissemination, and therapeutic resistance. For instance, MDSCs suppress T and NK cell activity via STAT3/NF-κB signaling and modulate the cytokine milieu through IL-10 and TGF-β. Similarly, M2-polarized TAMs promote angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance via IL-10/STAT3/Bcl-2 pathways. In contrast, NK cells and CD103+ DCs mediate tumor cell cytolysis and prime antigen-specific immunity, though their activity is frequently compromised in advanced disease. Moreover, key cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, TNF-α, TGF-β, and CCL2/5, demonstrate subtype-specific and context-dependent effects, acting as both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing agents through complex signaling networks. This review highlights the dualistic nature of innate immune components in breast cancer, discusses their prognostic and therapeutic implications, and proposes novel intervention strategies, such as TAM repolarization, and cytokine modulation, to reprogram the TIME and restore effective immune surveillance, particularly in aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Introduction We previously established a feeder-free cell therapy platform for the ex vivo generation of lymphoid-primed progenitors using immobilized Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4). In vivo studies demonstrated that adoptive transfer of these progenitors accelerates T cell reconstitution following thymic engraftment. Method To further explore the full therapeutic potential of this cell product, we performed a comprehensive molecular and phenotypic characterization using single cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry analysis. Results Our analysis revealed the presence of distinct cell subsets within the cellular product characterized mainly by commitment to lymphoid lineages. Using integrated transcriptomic analyses to compare these ex vivo-generated progenitors to in vivo human thymocytes, we revealed strong similarities with early stages of T cell development, underscoring the physiological relevance of our system. We also delineated two distinct developmental trajectories within the CD7+ progenitor population: a T cell-oriented path, marked by CD5 upregulation, and an innate lymphoid cell (ILC)-oriented branch, identified by CD161 expression and an ILC-like gene signature. Despite these lineage predispositions, both subsets demonstrated plasticity, retaining the ability to differentiate into both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in vitro. Additionally, in our experimental setting, we observed that BCL11B, a transcription factor essential for T cell commitment, regulates negatively myeloid cell differentiation while preserving the potential for NK cell development. Conclusion These findings underscore the versatility of DLL4-based lymphoid progenitors in generating either T cells or ILCs in response to environmental cues. This research paves the way for innovative cell therapy approaches to treat immune deficiencies and cancer- and age-related immune dysfunctions.">

        <tr id="Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with only modest improvements in survival despite advances in conventional therapies. Cell-based immunotherapy, which utilizes ex vivo expanded or genetically modified immune cells, has emerged as a promising therapeutic alternative. Approaches such as natural killer (NK) cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines, cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells have shown encouraging potential in preclinical and early clinical studies. However, their clinical efficacy in NSCLC is significantly constrained by multiple factors, including the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), intratumoral antigenic heterogeneity, and limited persistence and expansion of adoptively transferred cells. To address these barriers, advances in cellular engineering, rational combinatorial regimens, and refined patient selection strategies are actively being explored. This review provides a critical overview of the current landscape of cell-based therapies in NSCLC, focusing on recent breakthroughs, persistent limitations, and evolving strategies to enhance therapeutic outcomes. By contextualizing these developments, we aim to clarify the translational potential of cellular immunotherapy and its role in redefining the treatment paradigm for NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion is one of the hallmarks of cancers, including glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of primary brain tumors. Multiple mechanisms are employed by tumor cells and its microenvironment to evade immune detection and foster tumor growth and progression. The secretion of immunosuppressive molecules such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), the expression of checkpoint proteins such programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and the recruitment of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to suppressed immune cell activity, favoring unchecked tumor growth. The FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1) has shown context/tissue-dependent effects in cancers of different tissue origins, with either oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles. Our laboratory has reported FAT1 to have an oncogenic function in glioblastoma. In addition, FAT1 promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment in glioblastoma, reducing T-cell and monocyte infiltration while increasing immunosuppressive cells such as MDSCs. It also upregulates pro-inflammatory mediators [cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)], fostering tumor-promoting signaling. This dual role in immune evasion and pro-tumorigenic inflammatory processes makes FAT1 a key driver of glioblastoma progression. This highlights the potential of FAT1 as a compelling therapeutic target. This article provides a concise overview of immune tolerance mechanisms in glioblastoma, and the crucial role of FAT1 in promoting immune tolerance and tumor advancement. In addition, this review highlights currently available immunotherapies in clinical use or undergoing trials, and the potential of FAT1 as a promising target for combinatorial therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a therapeutic approach that involves the isolation, modification, and expansion of immune cells ex vivo, followed by their reinfusion into the patient to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. Various forms of ACT have demonstrated promising clinical outcomes across multiple types of cancer. For example, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, and T-cell receptor-engineered T cell (TCR-T) therapy have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. However, the clinical application of ACT remains constrained by limited efficacy and potentially life-threatening toxicities. Diminished efficacy may result from an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, poor trafficking and infiltration, exhaustion of infused cells, tumor heterogeneity, and antigen escape. To address these challenges, combination strategies have been developed with the goals of enhancing efficacy and managing adverse effects. Conventional treatments and non-ACT forms of immunotherapy have been incorporated into these combination approaches. Biomarkers play an essential role in optimizing ACT strategies and addressing associated complexities. They can aid in candidate selection, assess the quality of ACT products, monitor long-term therapeutic efficacy, manage toxicity, and guide combination regimens. This review briefly outlines six ACT modalities and their common limitations, summarizes current combination strategies, explores potential future regimens, and offers an overview of biomarkers relevant to ACT. These insights provide valuable guidance for the development and clinical implementation of more effective ACT-based therapies, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes.">

Furthermore, a strong correlation between metabolic profiles and immune cell fate, activation, and function has been repeatedly delineated in immunometabolism. Consequently, targeting the metabolic networks, referred to as metabolic checkpoints, to reprogram immune cell phenotypes and bolster antitumor immunity holds significant promise for clinical translation.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Macrophages are heterogeneous immune cells with diverse subtypes and tissue‐specific distributions, displaying dynamic polarization states that critically govern their immunomodulatory functions and responses to environmental cues. As key regulators of innate and adaptive immunity, they originate from either embryonic progenitors or bone marrow‐derived monocytes and exhibit remarkable plasticity in response to microenvironmental cues. Tissue‐resident macrophages (e.g., Langerhans cells, Kupffer cells, microglia) display unique organ‐specific functions, while inflammatory stimuli drive their polarization into proinflammatory (M1) or anti‐inflammatory (M2) phenotypes along a functional continuum. This review systematically examines macrophage subtypes, their anatomical distribution, and the signaling pathways (e.g., NF‐κB, STATs, PPARγ) underlying polarization shifts in acute and chronic inflammation. We highlight how polarization imbalances contribute to pathologies including neuroinflammation, liver fibrosis, and impaired tissue repair, particularly in aging contexts. Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting macrophage plasticity, such as cytokine modulation, metabolic reprogramming, and subtype‐specific interventions. By integrating recent advances in macrophage biology, this work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding their dual roles in immune regulation and tissue homeostasis, offering insights for treating inflammatory and age‐related diseases through macrophage‐centered immunomodulation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells engage in reciprocal interactions to trigger an efficient innate immune response while governing downstream adaptive immunity. Here, we used an ex vivo autologous human primary immune cell coculture system of DCs and NK cells to examine their impact on naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell (CD3+CD45RA+CD197+) activation in response to influenza A viral (IAV) infection. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we observed that culturing T cells with both DCs and NK cells enhanced CD69 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, increased CD25 on CD4+ T cells, and promoted CD8+ T cell proliferation, compared with cultures with only NK cells or DCs. When DCs were exposed to the pandemic A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) strain or the A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) strain, subsequent coculture with NK cells reduced the frequency of CD4+CD69+ and CD8+CD69+ naïve T cells. Notably, H3N2, but not H1N1, exposure also reduced CD4+CD25+ T cell frequencies. The IAV-mediated curtailment of T cell activation was dependent on viral replication because exposure to DCs with irradiated the H1N1 strain followed increased the frequency of CD4+CD69+, CD8+CD69+, CD4+CD25+, and CD8+CD25+ T cells, while irradiation of H3N2 increased the frequency of CD4+CD69+, CD8+CD69+ and proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These findings demonstrate that IAV can partially subvert DC-NK cell crosstalk to impair naïve T cell activation in a strain-dependent manner. This knowledge may guide the design of next-generation influenza vaccines to elicit robust cellular immune responses.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that drives resistance to therapy. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), including microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, promote tumor growth and immune evasion, especially in their M2-like form. This systematic review analyzed 30 studies on TAM-targeted therapies in GBM. These approaches include blocking TAM recruitment, boosting their phagocytic activity, and reprogramming TAMs. Combination strategies with immune checkpoint inhibitors, nanoparticles, and oncolytic viruses showed enhanced anti-tumor effects in preclinical models. However, clinical success is limited by TAM plasticity, poor drug delivery across the blood–brain barrier, and immunosuppressive treatments. Future therapies should focus on patient-specific approaches using detailed TME profiling and advanced delivery systems to improve treatment response and overcome current limitations.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has fundamentally reshaped oncology by harnessing the immune system to eliminate malignant cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 have achieved durable remissions in select cancers, yet most patients exhibit resistance due to tumor heterogeneity, immunometabolic rewiring, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To address these limitations, next-generation immunotherapies have emerged, targeting multiple layers of immune regulation. These include co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory checkpoint modulators, bispecific antibodies, adoptive cell therapies, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, cytokine-based strategies, and synthetic immunomodulators that activate innate sensors. Nanotechnology and in vivo immune engineering further enhance specificity, reduce toxicity, and broaden applicability. Combination immunotherapy has become central to overcoming resistance, with rational regimens integrating ICIs, cytokines, vaccines, and targeted agents. Biomarker-guided strategies, leveraging tumor mutational burden, immune cell infiltration, and multi-omic profiling, are enabling personalized approaches. However, immune-related adverse events and variability in therapeutic responses necessitate predictive biomarkers and improved patient stratification. Emerging frontiers include microbiome-targeted interventions, chronotherapy, and AI-driven modeling of tumor–immune dynamics. Equally critical is ensuring global equity through inclusive trial design, diverse biomarker validation, and expanded access to cutting-edge therapies.

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a critical global health concern, particularly in regions with high endemicity of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for advanced HCC. Despite encouraging results, primary and acquired resistance to ICIs continues to pose significant challenges in clinical practice. Recent research has identified tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as key contributors to immune evasion and ICI resistance in HCC, primarily through polarization to the M2 phenotype. M2-polarized TAMs secrete a range of immunosuppressive cytokines that inhibit T cell activation and promote tumor progression through processes such as angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These mechanisms compromise the efficacy of ICIs and facilitate tumor expansion and metastasis. This review summarizes the role of TAM-related signaling pathways in driving immune evasion and ICI resistance in HCC, with particular emphasis on the contribution of TAM surface receptors and chemokines in immune suppression. Additionally, the review highlights emerging insights into TAM metabolic reprogramming and transcriptional regulation, which have been closely linked to ICI resistance. Furthermore, we explore promising therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs and their associated signaling pathways to enhance ICI efficacy in HCC. Integrating these novel approaches could potentially overcome TAM-driven immune evasion and ICI resistance, boosting the efficacy of immunotherapy and improving patient prognosis in HCC.">

        <tr id="Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous illness influenced by intricate tumor-immune interactions and characterized by a dismal prognosis. Macrophage-mediated immunological signaling facilitates tumor proliferation and may associate inflammation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of CRC with negative outcomes. Notwithstanding therapeutic advancements, resistance to treatment remains a significant obstacle. scRNA-seq offers comprehensive insights into the immune signaling network and immunological dynamics inside the CRC’s TME. Methods We integrated scRNA-seq data from GEO with extensive RNA-seq data from TCGA to elucidate immunological signaling and dynamic cellular variation in the TME of CRC. The analyses encompassed quality control via Seurat, InferCNV, Monocle, CellChat, and SCENIC, differential gene expression, inference of copy number variation (CNV), pseudo time trajectories, and intercellular communication. Prognostic modeling was conducted using Cox regression and LASSO. Immune infiltration and drug sensitivity were evaluated by CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, xCell, TIDE, and pRRophetic. Functional validation encompassed siRNA knockdown, qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and cellular assessment in CRC cell lines. Results We discovered four categories of tumor cells exhibiting variations in cell cycle, stemness, and differentiation. The MKI67 + subpopulation exhibited a heightened dynamic cell state and engaged with macrophages via the MIF-(CD74+CD44) axis to facilitate immunological signaling. HMGA1 is a crucial transcription factor in this fraction, and its knockdown impedes CRC cell proliferation, motility, and invasion. The cancer model utilizing the MKI67 + TCs subpopulation (MTRS) successfully classified patient survival and linked with immune infiltration patterns and medication responses. Enrichment analysis revealed tumor-promoting and immunological signaling networks. Correlation scores suggest that this subpopulation may be linked to inflammation and immunosuppression inside the TME. Conclusion Our research indicates that the C2 MKI67 + TCs subpopulation is a key driver of immune signal transduction in CRC TME, which may induce inflammatory responses through interaction with macrophages, thereby leading to adverse consequences such as cardiac dysfunction. HMGA1 represents a viable target for immunotherapy, and our cancer model derived from this subpopulation offers prognostic significance and direction for immunotherapeutic treatments.">

        <tr id="The severity of certain viral infectious diseases varies across the age; we hypothesize that these variations could be related to the variation of immune responses to viral immune complexes (ICs) among the age. This study aimed to investigate monocyte activation in response to ICs in children, adults, and elderly individuals. An experimental in vitro model was established using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. Monocyte activation markers (CD169, CD38, HLA-DR), the negative co-stimulatory molecule (PD-L1), and cytokine production were measured under basal conditions and upon stimulation with human adenovirus 5-IgG immune complex (Ad5-ICs), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes from children and adults displayed similar activation profiles in response to ICs and IFN-α stimulation, characterized by increased expression of CD169 and PD-L1. In contrast, monocytes from elderly individuals exhibited weak or no overexpression of CD169 and PD-L1 coupled with a diminished PBMC cytokine response. Notably, cells from elderly participants produced high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the absence of stimulation. Multiple comparisons confirmed reduced monocyte activation and PBMC cytokine responses in the elderly compared to adults and children. Although children exhibited a significant response to ICs, their secretion of IFN-α, IP-10, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-2 was lower than that observed in adults. Our findings suggest that elderly individuals have poor and dysregulated responses to ICs, likely due to immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. Adults exhibit a robust and balanced response to ICs, while children display a moderate response, possibly influenced by ‘trained immunity’ resulting from frequent early-life exposures to pathogens. These insights highlight the importance of further research to develop age-specific therapeutic strategies to modulate immune function during viral IC exposure.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy represents a transformative strategy in modern oncology, utilizing the body’s immune system to recognize and eliminate malignant cells with precision. Unlike traditional therapies, which often directly target the tumor, immunotherapy enhances the immune system’s inherent ability to differentiate between healthy and cancerous cells. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly those targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways, has marked a significant breakthrough in this field. However, the therapeutic landscape is still challenged by issues such as the development of resistance mechanisms, heterogeneity in patient responses, and the limited efficacy of current ICIs across all tumor types. Given these challenges, there is a critical need to identify and validate new immune targets that can synergize with existing therapies or function independently to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest research efforts focused on uncovering novel immune targets. By expanding the repertoire of immune targets, these discoveries aim to enhance the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy, offering hope for more personalized and resilient treatment options. The integration of these novel targets into clinical practice could not only extend the benefits of immunotherapy to a broader spectrum of cancers but also mitigate some of the current limitations, paving the way for more durable and effective therapeutic strategies in the fight against cancer.">

        <tr id="Reprogramming autoreactive CD4+ effector T (Teff) cells into immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells represents a promising strategy for treating established autoimmune diseases. However, the stability and function of such reprogrammed Tregs under inflammatory conditions remain unclear. Here, we show that demethylation of core Treg identity genes in Teff cells yields lineage-stable Effector T cell Reprogrammed Tregs (ER-Tregs). A single adoptive transfer of ER-Tregs not only prevents autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice when given before disease onset but also arrests its progression when administered after onset. Compared to Foxp3-overexpressing Teff cells, induced Tregs from naïve precursors, and endogenous Tregs, ER-Tregs provide superior protection against autoimmune neuroinflammation. This enhanced efficacy stems from their inherited autoantigen specificity and selectively preserved effector-cell transcriptional programs, which together bolster their fitness in inflammatory environments and enhance their suppressive capacity. Our results establish epigenetic reprogramming of autoreactive Teff cells as an effective approach to generate potent, stable Tregs for the treatment of refractory autoimmune conditions.">

TAMs exhibit functional heterogeneity, polarizing into pro-tumor (M2-like) and anti-tumor (M1-like) phenotypes under different microenvironmental cues. M2-like TAMs promote immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis, while M1-like TAMs enhance antitumor immunity. Combining TAM-targeted therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors is also emerging as a potential strategy to enhance immunotherapy efficacy. This review outlines TAM-mediated immunosuppression mechanisms, including the secretion of VEGF, TGF-β, and immune checkpoint molecules like PD-L1. We also summarize the current strategies targeting TAMs, such as blocking the CD47/SIRPα axis, using CD40 agonists, and PI3Kγ inhibitors, which have shown promise in preclinical studies. Overall, this review underscores TAMs as pivotal therapeutic targets and proposes future directions to optimize combinatorial immunotherapy for enhanced clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal survival rate due to limited effective therapies. While studies have focused on innate immune cell influence on adaptive immune cell functions, few have explored interactions between innate immune cells, which modulate the unique PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are responsible for clearance of neutrophil-mediated inflammation in physiologic immune responses; however, these cells co-exist in PDAC. We sought to determine how neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), neutrophil release of decondensed chromatin and intracellular contents, affect monocyte/macrophage populations in the PDAC TME. Utilizing samples from patients with PDAC, we demonstrate elevated monocyte chemokine CCL2 in plasma and elevated NET CitH3 and pan-macrophage marker CD68 in the PDAC TME via fluorescent immunohistochemistry. To determine how NETs impacted macrophage populations in the PDAC TME, we depleted NETs with DNase I and with genetic knockout of the PAD4 enzyme and found an elevation in pan-macrophage marker F4/80. The depletion led to increased T cell stimulatory signal CD80 while the pro-tumor macrophage marker CD206 was decreased. We further demonstrate that macrophages in the NET-deficient PDAC TME may be recruited through the CCL2/CCR2 axis, in which CCL2 can be released from tumor cells and macrophages in the presence of IFN-. Taken together, our findings reveal that inhibition of NETs can prime the innate immune response toward an anti-tumor phenotype.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for over 80% of lung cancer cases and is often diagnosed at advanced stages. Resistance to immunotherapy in NSCLC involves genetic mutations, tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics, treatment history, and age-related factors. Despite increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), resistance mechanisms remain poorly understood. Key genetic alterations associated with resistance include STK11, KEAP1, and EGFR mutations, particularly with low tumor mutational burden (TMB). The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, characterized by regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, can hinder ICI efficacy. Metabolic alterations and deficient antigen presentation contribute to resistance. Prior treatments can alter the tumor microenvironment, affecting subsequent immunotherapy responses. Age-related factors, including immunosenescence, influence resistance, with older patients having higher TMB and more immunogenic microenvironments. Strategies to overcome resistance include combination therapies, biomarker-driven approaches, and targeting novel pathways. Combining ICIs with chemotherapy or radiation can enhance antitumor responses. Biomarker approaches, such as TMB and PD-L1 expression assessment, help tailor therapies. Exploring novel targets like RIG-I and STING pathways may provide additional solutions. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing personalized strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance in NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Inflammation is a self-defense mechanism that controls the homeostasis of an organism, and its alteration by persistent noxious stimuli could lead to an imbalance in the regulation of inflammatory responses mediated by innate and adaptive immunity. During chronic inflammation, sustained exposure of myeloid cells to the various inflammatory signals derived from inflamed tissue could lead to the generation of myeloid cells with an immunosuppressive state, called myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which can exert protective or deleterious functions depending on the nature of signals and the specific inflammatory conditions created by different pathophysiological contexts. Initially identified in various tumor models and cancer patient samples, these cells have long been recognized as negative regulators of anti-tumor immunity. Consequently, researchers have focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying their potent immunosuppressive activity. As a key component of the signal transducing processes, protein kinases play a central role in regulating the signal transduction mechanisms of many cellular activities, including differentiation and immunosuppression. Over the past decade, at least a dozen kinases, including mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TAM RTKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and others, have emerged as key contributors to the generation and differentiation of MDSCs. Here, we discuss the recent findings on these kinases that directly contribute to the immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: This review discusses the resistance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of malignant melanoma that disrupt the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In this review, we focus on the roles of immune cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), macrophages, dendritic cells, and other signaling pathways. We explore the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in the TME and tumor intrinsic resistance mechanisms, such as β-catenin, which has future implications for the usage of ICIs in patients with therapy-resistant tumors. Methods: A total of 1052 studies were extracted from the PubMed database searching for keywords and phrases that included [melanoma AND immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance]. After a title/abstract and full-text review, 101 studies were identified that fit the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), M2 macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are significant in remodeling the TME to promote melanoma growth. Melanoma resistance to ICIs is complex and involves TME alterations, tumor intrinsic factors, and immune evasion. Key components of resistance include reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration, decreased host immune response, and immunosuppressive cytokines. Conclusions: Predictive biomarkers and specific models are the future of individualized melanoma management and show great promise in their approach to targeted therapy production. Tumor profiling can be utilized to help predict the efficacy of ICIs, and specific biomarkers predicting therapy responses are instrumental in moving towards personalized and more efficacious medicine. As more melanoma resistance emerges, alternative and combinatorial therapy based on knowledge of existing resistance mechanisms will be needed.">

        <tr id="Innate immune cells constitute the majority of the tumor microenvironment (TME), where they mediate both natural anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy responses. While single-cell T- and B-cell receptor sequencing has provided fundamental insights into the clonal dynamics of human adaptive immunity, the lack of appropriate tools has precluded similar analysis of innate immune cells. Here, we describe a method that leverages somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to reconstruct clonal lineage relationships between single cells across cell types in native human tissues. We jointly sequenced single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin and mtDNA to profile n=124,958 cells from matched tumor, non-involved lung tissue (NILT), and peripheral blood of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, as well as n=93,757 cells from matched tumor and peripheral blood of ovarian cancer patients. Single-cell concomitant profiling of lineage and cell states of thousands of immune cells resolved clonality across cell types, tissue sites, and malignancies. Clonal tracing of innate immune cells demonstrates that TME-resident myeloid subsets, including macrophages and type 3 dendritic cells (DC3), are clonally linked to both circulating and tissue-infiltrating monocytes. Further, we identify distinct DC-biased and macrophage-biased myeloid clones, enriched in the tumor and NILT, respectively, and find that their circulating monocyte precursors exhibit distinct epigenetic profiles, suggesting that myeloid differentiation fate may be predetermined before TME infiltration. These results delineate the clonal pathways of intratumoral myeloid cell recruitment and differentiation in human cancer and suggest that remodeling of the tumor myeloid compartment may be peripherally programmed.">

        <tr id="Cellular and molecular heterogeneity contributes to the insufficient immunogenicity of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a lethal malignancy characterized by post-resection relapse, ultimately leading to limited immune cell infiltration. Here, we report a strategy to boost tumor immunity by activating the endogenous cGAS-STING signaling pathway through in-situ manipulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), thereby augmenting the immune responsiveness of GBM. Under white light irradiation, the synthetic butterfly-shaped photosensitizer B-TTPy disrupts the mitochondrial ETC by producing excessive reactive oxygen species. Synergistically, inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 amplifies ETC dysfunction, thus enhancing the cytotoxicity of B-TTPy against tumor cells. Our results demonstrate that the in-house-customized Mitochondrial Electron Alteration Nanoparticles in Glioblastoma (MEANING) efficiently activate innate and adaptive immune response by recruiting antigen-presenting cells and cytotoxic T cells to the surgical margin. Moreover, biodegradable hydrogel-medicated surgical cavity treatment with MEANING can reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and eliminate residual GBM cells. In sum, our findings establish a local immune activation approach for GBM, to prevent postoperative tumor recurrence and identify ETC blockade as a promising therapeutic strategy for low-immunogenic tumors.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical for maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing effector T cell responses. However, in chronic inflammatory diseases such as spondyloarthritis (SpA) and psoriasis (PsO), Tregs can lose their stability and acquire pro-inflammatory characteristics, a phenomenon known as Treg plasticity. Under inflammatory conditions, Tregs may downregulate FoxP3, upregulate RORγt, and produce cytokines such as IL-17 and IFN-γ, thus losing their suppressive function and contributing to disease progression. In SpA, altered numbers and impaired Treg function have been identified in peripheral blood and synovial fluid. Specific subsets, such as CD161+ Tregs with Th17-like features, suggest that inflammatory cytokines and signals like STAT3 activation and ICOS engagement promote pathogenic reprogramming. Genetic factors, including HLA-B27, may further predispose Tregs to instability. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses have provided evidence of shared TCR repertoires between Tregs and effector T cells, reinforcing the concept of lineage plasticity. Similarly, in PsO, skin-resident Tregs exposed to IL-23, IL-6, and IL-21 can acquire a Th17-like phenotype, producing IL-17A and exacerbating local inflammation. Environmental factors such as hypoxia also contribute to destabilizing Treg identity. The persistence of pathogenic Tregs, even following therapy blockade of IL-17 or IL-23, highlights the challenge of achieving long-term disease remission.">

        <tr id="Endometrial carcinoma (EC) represents one of the most prevalent malignancies within the female reproductive system. The frequency of its occurrence is on the rise annually, and patients diagnosed at advanced stages face a less favorable prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the significant influence of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) on the initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance of endometrial cancer. The TME encompasses various components such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). These elements contribute to an immunosuppressive milieu by secreting cytokines, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and engaging immune checkpoint pathways like PD-1/PD-L1, thereby supporting tumor immune evasion and resistance to treatment. This review synthesizes current understanding of the EC-TME, focusing on the distinct roles and interactions of its key constituents within the context of EC biology. Furthermore, we explore the rationale and progress for novel therapeutic strategies targeting the TME, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, combination therapies, and nano delivery systems leveraging EVs, aiming to provide insights for improving EC patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is defined by a myeloid-enriched microenvironment and has shown remarkable resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (e.g., PD-1 and CTLA-4). Here, we sought to define the role of myeloid immunosuppression in immune resistance in PDA. We report that depletion of CSF1R+ myeloid cells in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy triggers T cell infiltration into PDA but causes compensatory remodeling of the myeloid compartment with limited tumor control. Unexpectedly, combined therapy against multiple myeloid targets including CSF1R, CCR2/5 and CXCR2 was insufficient to overcome treatment resistance. High-dimensional single cell analyses performed on T cell infiltrates in human and mouse PDA revealed upregulation of multiple immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4. Combinatorial blockade of PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4 along with chemotherapy and anti-CSF1R was necessary to trigger activation of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and led to deep, durable, and complete tumor responses, with each immune checkpoint blockade agent contributing to efficacy. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive approach targeting both negative regulatory signals controlling T cell function and the myeloid compartment will be fundamental to unveiling the potential of immunotherapy in PDA.">

Regulatory B cells (Bregs), characterized by IL-10 production, play an important role in the tumor immunity; however, the function of Bregs in PM remains unclear. We investigated the frequency and effects of Bregs on other immune cells in the PM using clinical specimens and mouse models of PM. In the peripheral blood and ascites, Breg frequency was significantly higher in patients with GC with PM than in those without PM. In clinical PM samples, Breg frequency was an independent prognostic factor. In the mouse PM model, peritoneal tumors showed higher Breg infiltration than subcutaneous tumors. In the PTEN-deficient PM model, activation of Bregs promoted ascites and peritoneal tumor growth, decreased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and increased the infiltration of M2 macrophages. In contrast, treatment with wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, suppressed Breg infiltration, resulting in decreased M2 macrophage infiltration and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration. Bregs are indicated to be involved in immunosuppression of PM and are promising targets for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy against PM.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AR-NHL), a leading malignancy among people living with HIV (PLWH), may not receive standard intensive curative therapies as the general population due to immune deficiency concerns, even in the combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) and immunochemotherapy era. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of T-cell subsets landscapes is urgently needed to grasp the complex and dynamic role of the immune system in AR-NHL patients’ survival. Materials and methods This longitudinal cohort study enrolled 31 de novo adult AR-NHL patients and 52 HIV-negative NHL controls. Multi-color flow cytometry profiled peripheral blood immunophenotypes at baseline and during immunochemotherapy. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses evaluated associations between baseline risk factors and clinical outcomes. Results AR-NHL patients exhibited comparable 1-year overall survival (71.0% vs. 74.8%) and progression-free survival (60.4% vs. 64.6%) to HIV-negative NHL individuals. Baseline β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and EBER positivity were higher in AR-NHL. AR-NHL revealed persistent immune senescence during immunochemotherapy, including reduced CD4+ T cells, lower CD4/CD8 ratio, decreased Tregs, naïve CD45RA+, and memory CD45RO + CD4+ T cells, alongside elevated Tregs/CD4, CD8+, CD8 + CD28+, and CD8 + CD28− T cells, highlighting the complex HIV-driven immune compromise. Multivariate analysis identified baseline circulating CD8 + CD28− T cells as an independent predictor of inferior prognosis in AR-NHL, correlated with aggressive disease markers such as elevated β2-MG, hypoproteinemia, decreased CD4/CD8 ratio, high International Prognostic Index score, and EBER positivity. Conclusions AR-NHL patients warrant standard full-dose cancer therapy to improve prognosis despite immunocompromised and immunosenescence phenotypes. CD8 + CD28− T cells serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for AR-NHL, potentially associated with chronic immune activation and viral exposure. Our data suggest that characterizing T-cell subsets may enhance understanding of immune dynamics in AR-NHL, providing a foundation for exploring personalized approaches to infection prophylaxis.">

        <tr id="Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains a formidable malignancy with persistently poor clinical outcomes. Recent research has underscored the pivotal role of the innate immune system, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a key component of the myeloid lineage, in orchestrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and shaping disease progression. As professional phagocytes of the innate immune system, macrophages not only mediate pathogen recognition and inflammatory responses but also undergo functional polarization in response to local cues. In OSCC, dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, marked by the overrepresentation of species such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis—acts as a chronic inflammatory trigger that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune evasion, and tumor growth. These pathogenic bacteria actively engage innate immune signaling pathways such as TLRs and CSF-1R, skewing macrophages toward an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. M2-like TAMs then contribute to tumor progression by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), promoting angiogenesis, and expressing immune checkpoint ligands such as PD-L1. This review summarizes current knowledge on the bidirectional crosstalk between dysbiotic microbiota and innate immune macrophages in OSCC, highlighting key receptor-mediated pathways and their implications for immune suppression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Targeting microbiota modulation or innate immune reprogramming represents a promising strategy for restoring anti-tumor immunity and enhancing therapeutic efficacy in OSCC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toll‐like receptors (TLRs), which are critical components of innate immunity, play a significant role in immune responses and deepen our understanding of TLRs. TLRs are a group of transmembrane proteins with similar structures distributed on the cell membrane and endosomes. They trigger downstream acute or chronic inflammatory responses by recognizing different types of pathogen‐associated molecular patterns and damage‐associated molecular patterns. TLRs play pivotal regulatory roles in various tumor types. Over the past few decades, research on TLRs has become increasingly popular, and these molecules can not only directly recognize tumor components as potential targets to activate antitumor immune responses but also act as accomplices to tumor progression and even as driver genes in certain tumor types. Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying their dual functions remain poorly understood, creating a gap in current research. Here, we summarize the latest advancements in TLR signaling pathways and their application in tumor therapy in recent years, and highlight the development prospects and potential of TLRs in tumor therapy. Moreover, this review underscores the critical regulatory roles of TLRs across various tumor types and explores their prospects in oncology, offering valuable insights for developing targeted therapies and improving cancer outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a complex and life-threatening disease process related to a systemic response to severe infection. Due to the challenges of treating patients with sepsis, new therapies are being investigated, including cell-based approaches. Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are immune privileged cells with immunomodulatory properties. Thus, we proposed that TSCs may be beneficial in experimental models of sepsis to regulate the immune response and curtail organ injury. Methods Sepsis was induced by experimental models in mice; cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lung infection with Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae. TSCs were isolated from the chorionic villi of human (h) term placentas, and from mouse (m) placentas using anti-CD117 MicroBeads, and were administered intravenously 6 h after CLP or S. pneumoniae infection. We assessed mortality, bacterial clearance, organ injury, inflammatory response, and production of cytokines and chemokines. Results CD117+ hTSCs did not express human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I or II, and were clonogenic and self-renewing. CLP led to severe mortality by 7 days, and administration of either hTSCs or mTSCs resulted in markedly improved survival compared with control cells or vehicle. hTSCs promoted bacterial clearance and decreased organ injury in the liver, kidney, spleen, and bowel. The elevated innate immune response in the peritoneum, predominantly neutrophils, was attenuated by hTSCs. In addition, neutrophil infiltration into the spleen was less in mice receiving hTSCs, which corresponded with reduced plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. When assessing the lung response to S. pneumoniae infection, administration of hTSCs resulted in fewer bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, and less lung edema and injury. Neutrophils, which were markedly increased in BALF, were diminished and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs was decreased by hTSCs. BALF pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were mitigated by hTSCs to levels of Sham mice, and systemic injury to the liver and spleen was attenuated. Conclusions CD117+ hTSCs are immune privileged cells that when given after the onset of experimental models of infection/sepsis resulted in improved outcomes due to enhanced bacterial clearance, resolving inflammation, and less organ injury. These data support hTSCs as a potential cell-based therapy for sepsis. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13287-025-04479-z.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder marked by persistent synovial inflammation, progressive joint destruction, and systemic complications. Despite significant progress in targeted therapies, major clinical challenges persist, including heterogeneous treatment responses and therapeutic resistance. This review aims to critically evaluate emerging immunomodulatory strategies—focusing on immune checkpoints, microRNAs (miRNAs), and cell-based therapies—as potential diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Methods: This non-systematic literature review involved a comprehensive analysis of recent studies to investigate emerging immunomodulatory strategies in RA. Special attention was given to immune checkpoint pathways—cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4); programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1; and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS)—as well as cell-based therapies. Additionally, miRNA-based interventions were examined for their diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Results: Immune checkpoint modulation has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in attenuating inflammatory responses and restoring immune tolerance. Concurrently, miRNAs have emerged as both biomarkers and therapeutic agents, with exosome-based delivery systems enhancing their function. Cell-based therapies have shown robust immunoregulatory effects with acceptable safety profiles. Notably, integrative strategies that combine checkpoint inhibitors, cell-based interventions, and miRNA delivery exhibit synergistic effects and offer a promising avenue for personalised treatment, when guided by molecular and transcriptomic profiling. The majority of these approaches remain at the preclinical or early translational stage. Conclusions: Targeted immunomodulation is poised to transform RA management. The integration of cell therapies, checkpoint inhibition, and miRNA manipulation with omics technologies holds promise for enhancing therapeutic precision and safety. Advancing towards personalised immunotherapy will necessitate a multidisciplinary and patient-centred effort.">

        <tr id="Influenza causes 3–5 million severe cases globally each year, with severe viral pneumonia often requiring hospitalization for over four weeks. While the inflammatory response to influenza infection helps control viral replication, excessive inflammation is a key driver of disease severity and mortality. Excessive pulmonary lymphocytes, particularly IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes, contribute significantly to pulmonary inflammation at the late-stage of H1N1 viral infection. Cyclosporin A, a potent T-cell inhibitor, mitigates influenza A virus-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. However, the therapeutic role of lymphocyte suppression in cyclosporin A-mediated attenuation of H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the viral titer was 0 in all the homogenized lung tissues of mice on Day-21 post a sublethal H1N1 viral infection. H1N1 viral infection caused worsened general condition and pulmonary inflammation with the infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils on Day-21 post-infection. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of H1N1 virus-infected mice showed a 16-fold higher lymphocyte count compared to neutrophils. H1N1 viral infection significantly elevated both IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations and IFN-γ levels in mouse lungs. H1N1 viral infection additionally expanded IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations in both spleen and peripheral blood. Cyclosporin A treatment significantly mitigated H1N1 viral infection-induced worsened general condition, pulmonary lymphocytic inflammation, increases of pulmonary IFN-γ concentrations and IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes in the lung, spleen and blood of mice on Day-21 post-infection. Together, lymphocytes may contribute significantly to H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation. Cyclosporin A may alleviate H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation through decreasing IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes.

        <tr id="Background Elite controllers can spontaneously control HIV-1 infection without antiretroviral treatment but remain at risk of developing non-AIDS-related conditions. The adaptive immune system is key in mediating spontaneous viral control; however, the innate immune response remains understudied. We assessed the quality of the innate immune responses by evaluating the phenotype and function of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in South African adults living with HIV (PWH). Methodology A total of 73 black South Africans were included in this study. Of these, 55 were living with HIV and included 16 individuals with spontaneous viral control (PWHEC), 20 HIV progressors (PWHPROG), and 19 individuals suppressed on ART (PWHART). Eighteen individuals without HIV infection (PWOHHIV-) served as the control group. Monocyte subsets, T cell and monocyte activation and the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) by monocytes, myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells were analyzed using multicolour flow cytometry following stimulation with toll-like receptor (TLR)4 (LPS), TLR7/8 (CL097), and TLR9 (CpG-ODN2216) ligands. Plasma biomarkers, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and D-dimer were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Our findings show a reduced expression of CD86 on monocytes of PWHEC (p=0.04) compared to PWOHHIV-. A reduced frequency of the classical monocyte (CD14+CD16) subset in PWHEC (p=0.02) and PWHPROG (p=0.05) compared to PWOHHIV-. TNF-α and IL-1β production was lower in monocytes and mDCs of PWHEC compared to PWOHHIV- post-stimulation with TLR4, and TLR7/8 (all p<0.05). Increased sCD14 levels in PWHEC compared to PWOHHIV- (p=0.01) indicate persistent immune activation, whereas increased D-dimer levels in PWHPROG compared to PWHART (p=0.01) and PWHEC (p=0.04) suggest higher inflammation in PWHPROG. Conclusion PWHEC exhibits similar immune responses as other PWH including PWHPROG, their innate immune profiles are characterized by lower levels of monocyte activation, reduced levels of classical monocytes, reduced capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and elevated biomarkers associated with unfavourable disease outcomes. These findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring and potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate chronic inflammation in PWHEC. Furthermore, it expands our understanding of complex innate immune cell responses in PWHEC.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary CAR cell therapy is a cutting-edge treatment that uses genetically modified immune cells to fight cancer. Originally developed using a patient’s own T cells, this approach showed great success in treating blood cancers. Now, scientists are expanding the approach to use other immune cells like natural killer cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Each type of cell offers unique benefits. NK cells may be safer, and macrophages can move into solid tumors more easily. Researchers are also exploring ways to use donor cells or even change cells directly inside the body, which could make the treatment faster and easier to use. Despite its promise, CAR therapy still faces challenges like high cost, safety concerns, and how to manufacture it on a large scale. With ongoing research, scientists hope to improve CAR therapies so more patients with hard-to-treat cancers, especially solid tumors (e.g., breast, lung, pancreatic cancers) can benefit in the future.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in coordinating immune responses by linking innate and adaptive immunity through their exceptional antigen-presenting capabilities. Recent studies reveal that metabolic reprogramming—especially pathways involving acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)—critically influences DC function in both physiological and pathological contexts. This review consolidates current knowledge on how environmental factors, tumor-derived signals, and intrinsic metabolic pathways collectively regulate DC development, subset differentiation, and functional adaptability. Acetyl-CoA emerges as a dual-function metabolite, serving not only as an energy carrier but also as an epigenetic regulator that controls DC fate via lipid biosynthesis, mitochondrial metabolism, and chromatin modification. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), DCs may experience immune suppression polarization and insufficient T cell activation due to disrupted acetyl-CoA related metabolic pathways. While existing DC-based therapies remain constrained by TME-induced metabolic limitations, emerging approaches that restore acetyl-CoA related metabolic pathways balance show enhanced antitumor efficacy. The review further examines distinct metabolic adaptations among DC subsets and their relevance to autoimmune diseases, infectious immunity, and transplant outcomes. By integrating current research on targeting DC metabolic targets, we outline strategies for developing immunotherapies that target DC metabolic flexibility. Remaining hurdles include tailoring interventions to specific subsets, refining metabolic manipulation techniques, and addressing TME heterogeneity through combination therapies. These findings position acetyl-CoA as a key therapeutic target for recalibrating immunometabolism circuits, with significant implications for DC-focused cancer treatment.">

We assess CAR therapies targeting CSC-specific antigens, including CD133 and GD2, in preclinical and clinical contexts, emphasizing their effectiveness against glioblastoma, breast cancer, and other malignancies. Nevertheless, challenges such as marker specificity and suppression by the tumor microenvironment (TME) persist.

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with limited responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies in most patients. Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a crucial role in immunotherapy outcomes. Among various metabolic abnormalities in the TIME, dysregulated lipid metabolism has emerged as a critical determinant of immune cell fate, differentiation, and function. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the current understanding of the immune landscape in GC, focusing on how altered lipid metabolism reshapes immune cell populations—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. We highlight key metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation(FAO), cholesterol homeostasis, and lipid uptake that impact immune cell activity, contributing to immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Importantly, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism, including inhibitors of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and discuss their synergistic potential when combined with ICB therapies. In conclusion, lipid metabolic reprogramming represents a promising yet underexplored axis in modulating antitumor immunity in GC. Integrating metabolic intervention with immunotherapy holds potential to overcome current treatment limitations and improve clinical outcomes. Future studies incorporating spatial omics and single-cell profiling will be essential to elucidate cell-type specific metabolic dependencies and foster translational breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, whose progression is intimately linked to the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Exosomes, once considered mere cellular waste, have emerged as pivotal mediators of intercellular communication within the TME, actively participating in the multistep development of HCC. These nanoscale vesicles play crucial roles in the initiation of precancerous lesions and, by transporting drug resistance-related molecules such as proteins and non-coding RNAs, facilitate the acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapies by tumor cells. Moreover, exosomes contribute to the establishment of pre-metastatic niches by remodeling distant organ microenvironments—inducing hypoxia, metabolic reprogramming, and angiogenesis—which collectively create favorable conditions for tumor cell colonization. They also modulate immune responses by inducing T-cell exhaustion, promoting macrophage polarization, and disrupting normal stromal cell functions, thereby constructing an immunosuppressive microenvironment that enables tumor immune evasion. Given their inherent biocompatibility and targeting capabilities, engineered exosomes have shown promise in cancer therapy, serving as carriers for therapeutic molecules and enabling precise drug delivery through surface modifications. Despite significant advancements, challenges remain in elucidating the in vivo regulatory mechanisms of exosomes, standardizing their isolation and purification processes, and evaluating their clinical efficacy. This review examines the multifaceted roles of exosomes in HCC, aiming to bridge mechanistic insights with precision diagnostics and pave new avenues for liver cancer treatment.">

We characterized the Anopheles gambiae fat body and associated cells, examining their responses to blood feeding, bacterial infection, and immune priming following Plasmodium berghei infection, at single-cell resolution. We analyzed 97,650 nuclei from the female mosquito's abdominal body wall and identified seven major cell types. Fat body trophocytes were the most abundant (~85% of cells), while sessile hemocytes represented 7.4% of cells. Trophocytes consisted of five subpopulations, including basal (T1, T2), metabolic-enriched (T3), immune-responsive (T4), and a vitellogenic population (T5) exclusive to blood-fed females. T4 trophocytes exhibited constitutive expression of immune genes, while multiple cell types, including other trophocytes, hemocytes, and epidermal epithelial cells, responded to a systemic bacterial challenge. Oenocytes (1.1% of cells) induced the expression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lipids in response to immune priming. Blood feeding triggered massive transcriptomic changes, with a strong induction of vitellogenin and multiple genes involved in DNA replication, consistent with trophocyte endoreplication and metabolic reprogramming. Interestingly, vitellogenin mRNA was expressed only in the first layer of trophocytes facing the hemolymph and had an apical subcellular localization. These findings provide a high-resolution atlas of fat body and associated cells, revealing specialized roles in immunity and reproduction and offering insights into how mosquitoes coordinate metabolic and immune functions at the cellular level.">

        <tr id="Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are critical components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), playing a pivotal role in tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. This review explores the dual roles of CAFs in regulating tumor cell senescence and cell death, elucidating their mechanisms in inducing cellular senescence, shaping an immunosuppressive milieu, and modulating cell death pathways. CAFs promote tumor progression by secreting pro-inflammatory factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, while also contributing to metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, thereby influencing anti-cancer treatment efficacy. Studies indicate that the heterogeneity and plasticity of CAFs determine their distinct functions across various tumor types. Consequently, precision-targeted therapeutic strategies against CAFs, including the elimination of senescent CAFs, inhibition of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and disruption of CAF-mediated cell death evasion mechanisms, have emerged as promising directions in cancer research. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of CAFs functions and their potential as therapeutic targets, offering valuable insights into the development of novel anti-cancer strategies.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women, with complex mechanisms driving its initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy. In recent years, the tumor microenvironment (TME) has gained attention for its critical role in shaping tumor behavior, where small extracellular vesicles (small EVs) have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication. These vesicles carry a diverse cargo of proteins, lipids, DNA, and various non-coding RNAs—such as miR-21, miR-155, and miR-1246—mirroring the molecular status of their originating cells. This review highlights the roles of small EVs in immune modulation, stromal remodelling, and metastatic niche formation, emphasizing their contribution to therapy resistance and immune evasion. We discuss recent updates on EV biogenesis, characterisation and isolation techniques, such as ultracentrifugation, immunoaffinity and microfluidic systems. We also critically evaluate their potential for clinical application and how well they conform to the MISEV2023 guidelines. Furthermore, we examine small EVs as diagnostic tools in liquid biopsies and compare them with conventional methods such as mammography and tissue biopsies. We also discuss organotropism mediated by small EV cargo (e.g., integrins α6β4, αvβ5) and the diagnostic potential of protein and lipid signatures (e.g., PD-L1, CD63, and exosomal lipidomics). Therapeutically, we explore engineered small EVs for drug delivery, gene modulation, and immune activation, addressing challenges of targeting efficiency, in vivo stability, immunogenicity, and clinical scalability. The review discusses ongoing clinical trials involving small EVs in BC and highlights key translational gaps between preclinical advances and clinical implementation. Finally, we explores how integrating artificial intelligence, single-cell transcriptomics, and multi-omics approaches can help overcome major challenges such as small EV heterogeneity and tracking limitations. Crucially, this integration enables a more tailored understanding of each patient’s tumor biology, reducing therapeutic failures by guiding more personalized and effective treatment strategies. Overall, small EVs represent a transformative tool in precision oncology, contingent on resolving key challenges in their clinical translation.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the tumor microenvironment (TME), interacting with cancer cells and other components to promote tumor growth. Given the influence of TAMs on tumor progression and resistance to therapy, regulating the activity of these macrophages is crucial for improving cancer treatment outcomes. TAMs often exhibit immunosuppressive phenotypes (commonly referred to as M2-like macrophages), which suppress immune responses and contribute to drug resistance. Therefore, inhibiting immunosuppressive polarization offers a promising strategy to impede tumor growth. This study revealed retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ), a nuclear receptor, as a key regulator of immunosuppressive polarization in THP-1 macrophages. Indeed, the inhibition of RARγ, either by a small molecule or gene silencing, significantly reduced the expression of immunosuppressive macrophage markers. In a three-dimensional tumor spheroid model, immunosuppressive macrophages enhanced the proliferation of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, which was significantly hindered by RARγ inhibition. These findings suggest that targeting RARγ reprograms immunosuppressive macrophages and mitigates the tumor-promoting effects of TAMs, highlighting RARγ as a promising therapeutic target for developing novel anti-cancer strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). CD4+ CD25+hi Tregs, which normally suppress immune responses, exhibit impaired function in MS. Treg-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry immunoregulatory proteins and miRNAs that modulate T-cell activity. However, EVs from MS patients show reduced suppressive capacity, suggesting their dysfunction contributes to MS pathogenesis. This highlights EVs' potential role in MS development and therapy. Methods: Tregs were differentiated from naïve T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donor, then transduced with B2M-shRNA lentivirus to generate HLA class I-knockdown Tregs. Extracellular vesicles—including natural vesicles, cytochalasin B-induced artificial vesicles, and ultrasound-induced artificial vesicles—were isolated from Tregs and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), flow cytometry, and Western blot. Their effects on healthy donor and MS patient PBMCs were evaluated via flow cytometry and ELISA (IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ). Results: Ultrasonication yielded a higher number оf vesicles enriched with key immunosuppressive proteins, including PD-1 and Tim-3, compared to cytochalasin B. Functional assays demonstrated the ability оf ultrasonication-induced AVs to suppress inflammatory markers, such as IFNγ, and modulate the cytokine profile in both healthy and MS-derived PBMCs. Conclusion: Developing effective MS therapies remains challenging. While cellular therapies face limitations like Treg dysfunction and CNS delivery issues, allogeneic EVs offer a promising alternative due to their scalability, low immunogenicity, and blood-brain barrier penetration. We developed Treg-derived artificial vesicles (TrAVs) that maintain immunosuppressive properties and modulate PBMC responses, suggesting therapeutic potential for MS. Further research is needed to optimize production and validate efficacy in disease models.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous condition, arising from a disrupted immune response to infection that can progress to organ failure and carries a high risk of death. In recent years, growing attention has been paid to the role of epigenetic mechanisms—including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and RNA methylation—in shaping immune activity during sepsis. These processes affect immune functions such as macrophage polarization, cytokine release, and the exhaustion of immune cells, and they help explain the shift from an initial phase of overwhelming inflammation to a later state of immune suppression. Epigenetic alterations also contribute to tissue-specific damage, notably in the lungs, kidneys, and heart, and have been linked to disease severity and clinical prognosis. Advances in transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling have made it possible to distinguish molecular subtypes of septic patients, each with distinct immune features and varied responses to treatments such as corticosteroids and metabolic therapies. Emerging biomarkers—like AQP5 methylation, histone lactylation (H3K18la), and m6A RNA methylation—are opening new options for patient classification and more tailored therapeutic strategies. This review examines the current understanding of how epigenetic regulation contributes to the pathophysiology of sepsis and considers its implications for developing more individualized approaches to care.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has affected at least 989 dairy herds across 17 states in the United States (U.S.) and resulted in 70 confirmed human infections, underscoring the urgent need to understand the pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions of emerging H5N1 viruses. In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections.">

        <tr id="Immune organoids have emerged as a ground-breaking platform in immunology, offering a physiologically relevant and controllable environment to model human immune responses and evaluate immunotherapeutic strategies. Derived from stem cells or primary tissues, these three-dimensional constructs recapitulate key aspects of lymphoid tissue architecture, cellular diversity, and functional dynamics, providing a more accurate alternative to traditional two-dimensional cultures and animal models. Their ability to mimic complex immune microenvironments has positioned immune organoids at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy development, autoimmune disease modeling, and personalized medicine. This narrative review highlights the advances in immune organoid technology, with a focus on their applications in testing immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, and cancer vaccines. It also explores how immune organoids facilitate the study of autoimmune disease pathogenesis with insights into their molecular basis and support in high-throughput drug screening. Despite their transformative potential, immune organoids face significant challenges, including the replication of systemic immune interactions, standardization of fabrication protocols, scalability limitations, biological heterogeneity, and the absence of vascularization, which restricts organoid size and maturation. Future directions emphasize the integration of immune organoids with multi-organ systems to better replicate systemic physiology, the development of advanced biomaterials that closely mimic lymphoid extracellular matrices, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize organoid production and data analysis, and the rigorous clinical validation of organoid-derived findings. Continued innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential to overcome existing barriers, enabling the widespread adoption of immune organoids as indispensable tools for advancing immunotherapy, vaccine development, and precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Effective strategies to reinvigorate the immune system are needed to improve outcomes in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Targeting Src family kinases with dasatinib (Dasa) can elicit immunomodulatory effects in some cancer types. Here, we explored the potential of combining Dasa with immune checkpoint blockade in SCLC. While the SCLC models were refractory to anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA4 monotherapy, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 combination immunotherapy (ITc) induced a significant antitumor response. Further, the Dasa+ITc combination was superior to ITc or Dasa alone. Dasa+ITc activity was mediated by CD4+ T cells, MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells (APCs), and natural killer (NK) cells, as depletion of these populations impeded the combination treatment antitumor efficacy. Increased tumor infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK cells, M1-like macrophages, and CD11c+ APCs and a reduction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-like macrophages were found in Dasa+ITc-treated mice. Dasa increased CCL5 in NK cells and reduced Treg cell conversion from CD4+ lymphocytes. Dasa+ITc therapy elicited robust antitumor efficacy in 3D co-cultures of immune and SCLC cells. In vivo experiments showed that CCL5 was necessary for the Dasa+ITc response. In SCLC immunotherapy-treated patients, a gene signature including CD4, CIITA, and tumor mutational burden predicted good prognosis. On-treatment CCL5 plasma levels were increased only in patients with long progression-free survival, and pre-treatment secretomics identified cytokines related to myeloid cells significantly associated with poor prognosis. In summary, combining Dasa with immunotherapy represents a strategy to treat SCLC, with CCL5 as a cytokine that could serve to monitor response.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immune dysfunction in liver disease contributes to significant morbidities, depending on liver damage severity and aetiology. We previously reported long‐lasting generalized CD8 T cell hyperfunction in chronic HCV infection with advanced fibrosis, yet its separation from viral and fibrosis‐driven effects, as well as clinical outcomes of advanced fibrosis, remains unclear. In a murine model of carbon tetrachloride‐induced progressive liver fibrosis, advanced fibrosis was observed by 12 weeks, with pathologies similar to those of human chronic HCV infection. Blood‐circulating CD8 T cells showed IFN‐γ and granzyme B (GrB) hyperfunction in response to anti‐CD3/28 stimulation, as well as impaired responses to ectopic tumour challenge and anti‐PD‐1/CTLA‐4 immunotherapy. Hyperfunction and impaired tumour responses were retained despite liver insult cessation. In a 45% HFD model, which induced steatosis and minimal fibrosis, IFN‐γ and GrB hyperfunction was also observed in blood‐circulating CD8 T cells. This study highlights a prolonged systemic CD8 T cell dysfunction acquired during progressive liver disease, associated with impaired antitumour and immunotherapy responses. These mirror the bulk CD8 T cell dysfunction observed in advanced liver diseases in humans, suggesting that these models could be valuable for future mechanistic studies aimed at identifying targets to help improve clinical outcomes in chronic liver disease.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) playing a pivotal role in disease progression. Neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cells, have gained attention for their dualistic role in cancer immunity. Two major neutrophil subtypes, N1 and N2, have been identified, each exhibiting distinct functions in the TME. N1 neutrophils are typically associated with anti-tumor immunity, promoting tumor cell clearance through mechanisms such as reactive oxygen species production, cytokine release, and the activation of cytotoxic immune cells. In contrast, N2 neutrophils promote tumor progression, metastasis, and immune suppression by secreting pro-angiogenic factors and recruiting regulatory immune cells like Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The polarization of neutrophils into N1 or N2 subtypes is regulated by the dynamic interactions within the TME, including cytokines, hypoxic conditions, and signals from tumor cells. In BC, factors such as IL-8, transforming growth factor-beta, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor drive N2 polarization, contributing to tumor evasion of immune surveillance. Conversely, pro-inflammatory signals can induce N1 polarization, which is often linked to favorable clinical outcomes. However, in aggressive breast cancer subtypes such as triple-negative breast cancer, the TME is more conducive to N2 polarization, resulting in poor prognosis and resistance to treatment.">

Since the groundbreaking development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Yamanaka in 2008, significant progress has been made in generating various iPSCs-derived immunocytes, including T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells. These engineered immune cells offer unprecedented opportunities for personalized cancer therapy as they can be derived from patients’ own cells to minimize immune rejection. In addition, various new techniques are being used for the induction and amplification of iPSCs-derived immunocytes, such as small-molecule techniques, 3D culture systems, nanotechnology, and animal models for the in vivo amplification of immunocytes. Of course, challenges remain in improving immunocyte characteristics. Targeting efficiency needs enhancement to better distinguish tumor cells from healthy tissue, while biological activity must be optimized for sustained antitumor effects. Safety concerns, particularly regarding potential off-target effects and cytokine release syndrome, require further investigation. The immunosuppressive nature of tumor microenvironment also poses significant hurdles for solid tumor treatment. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring the therapeutic potential of iPSCs-derived immunocytes, with researchers investigating combination therapies and genetic modifications to overcome current limitations.">

        <tr id="Surgical ablation or broad radiation of tumor-draining lymph nodes can eliminate the primary tumor response to immunotherapy, highlighting the crucial role of these nodes in mediating the primary tumor response. Here, we show that immunoradiotherapy efficacy is dependent on treatment sequence and migration of modulated dendritic cells from tumor to sentinel lymph nodes. Using a tamoxifen-inducible reporter paired with CITE-sequencing in a murine model of oral cancer, we comprehensively characterize tumor immune cellular migration through lymphatic channels to sentinel lymph nodes at single-cell resolution, revealing a unique immunologic niche defined by distinct cellular phenotypic and transcriptional profiles. Through a structured approach of sequential immunomodulatory radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibition, we show that sequenced, lymphatic-sparing, tumor-directed radiotherapy followed by PD-1 inhibition achieves complete and durable tumor responses. Mechanistically, this treatment approach enhances migration of activated CCR7+ dendritic cell surveillance across the tumor-sentinel lymph node axis, revealing a shift from their canonical role in promoting tolerance to driving antitumor immunity. Overall, this work supports rationally sequencing immune-sensitizing, lymphatic-preserving, tumor-directed radiotherapy followed by immune checkpoint inhibition to optimize tumor response to immunoradiotherapy by driving activated dendritic cells to draining sentinel lymph nodes.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for maintaining immune balance by controlling the activation and expansion of other immune cells. Conventional suppression assays often rely on co-culturing purified cell populations, which limits multiplexed phenotyping and physiological relevance. This protocol describes a high-dimensional, single-cell assay for profiling Treg-mediated suppression within a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) system. Tregs are first isolated by cell sorting and then reintroduced into autologous PBMCs at defined ratios. A 52-marker mass cytometry (CyTOF) panel is used to quantify cell division and phenotypic responses across multiple immune subsets. This approach allows for integrated analysis of Treg function with broad compatibility for patient profiling and drug evaluation. Key features • Quantifies Treg-mediated suppression in autologous PBMCs at single-cell resolution. • Enables high-dimensional phenotyping and proliferation tracking across multiple immune subsets using a 52-marker CyTOF panel. • Maintains physiological relevance by assessing suppression in a complex PBMC environment. • Compatible with patient-derived samples and drug perturbation experiments for translational immunology applications">

        <tr id="The anti-tumor role of the immune system has long been associated with interferon-γ-mediated activation of immune cells and their ability to recognize and eliminate transformed cells. Fundamental principles of tumor immunoediting describe a dynamic interplay between the immune system and neoplastic cells, wherein immune pressure can paradoxically shape tumor evolution. Within this context, macrophages, natural killer cells, and T lymphocytes are central effectors of anti-tumor immunity. Traditionally, macrophages exhibiting M1 phenotype are characterized by high cytotoxic potential and considered important contributors to tumor eradication. In contrast, M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages are associated with immune suppression and tumor progression. However, recent evidence challenges this binary paradigm. It is increasingly evident that M1 macrophages, while initially exerting anti-tumor effects, can also promote tumor progression by applying sustained cytotoxic pressure that selects for more malignant and immune-resistant tumor clones. This phenomenon represents an unexpected and overlooked contribution of cytotoxic macrophages to tumor progression. In this review, we examine the complex, context-dependent function of M1 macrophages and reassess current strategies aimed at enhancing their cytotoxicity. While such approaches may offer short-term benefits, they risk driving clonal selection of aggressive, immune-evasive tumor cells. Therefore, we propose a paradigm shift: instead of promoting M1 polarization alone, therapeutic strategies should consider the broader consequences of macrophage–tumor interactions. A nuanced understanding of macrophage plasticity and tumor dynamics is essential for designing effective immunotherapies. Recognizing the paradoxical role of M1 macrophages is critical to avoiding unintended support of tumor evolution and improving treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), derived from circulating monocytes recruited to tumor sites via chemotactic signals such as C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), are pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Functionally polarized into distinct subtypes, TAMs play dual roles: proinflammatory M1-type TAMs enhance antitumor immunity through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, whereas M2-type TAMs promote tumor progression by facilitating angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. This polarization is dynamically regulated by different cytokines, various signaling pathways, and metabolic cues within the TME. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that M2-like TAMs predominantly infiltrate hypoxic and stromal regions, where they secrete factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to remodel the extracellular matrix and suppress immune responses via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and arginase-1 upregulation. Crucially, TAMs interact extensively with immune cells; M2-TAMs secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TGF-β to inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes while expanding regulatory T (Treg) cells and impairing natural killer (NK) cell function via altered antigen presentation. Conversely, M1-TAMs synergize with dendritic cells to enhance T-cell priming. Therapeutically, targeting TAMs offers promising strategies, including colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors, CCL2 antagonists, and nanoparticle-mediated repolarization of M2-TAMs toward the M1 phenotype. Emerging genetic approaches, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) editing, aim to disrupt protumorigenic pathways in TAMs. Additionally, TAM-related biomarkers (e.g., CD206 and CD163) are being evaluated for their prognostic and predictive utility in immunotherapies. Despite progress, challenges persist owing to TAM plasticity and TME heterogeneity across cancers. This review synthesizes TAM biology, immune crosstalk, and therapeutic advancements, providing a foundation for novel oncology strategies aimed at reprogramming TAMs to overcome treatment resistance and improve clinical outcomes.">

However, direct studies of these viruses in humans are limited by ethical constraints, technical challenges, and their strict species specificity. To overcome these barriers, researchers have developed surrogate models, with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) emerging as a tractable and widely utilized system. MHV68 shares key genetic and biological features with EBV and KSHV, providing critical insights into GHV pathogenesis, including viral latency, reactivation, immune evasion, and virus‐host interactions. This review summarizes current cellular and animal models for GHV research, highlighting the advantages and limitations of MHV68 as a model for studying human GHVs. We explore mechanisms of viral gene function, immune modulation, and host responses, and discuss how these models have advanced our understanding of GHV‐associated diseases. Improved model systems will be essential for guiding future experimental approaches and developing targeted therapies for GHV‐driven malignancies and other related disorders.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and the most common malignant myeloid disorder in adults. Extensive research has elucidated the broad spectrum of biological mechanisms contributing to the development of AML and specifically characterized a variety of genetic alterations initiating and defining the disease. However, the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AML remains relatively unexplored; indeed, studies on the contribution of inflammatory signaling to disease initiation in myeloid malignancies have only recently gained attention, marking an emerging area of research. AML has the highest incidence in the elderly, where inflammation plays an even greater role. A granular understanding of inflammatory processes driving leukemogenesis thus promises to guide therapeutic strategies for a patient population where outcomes remain dismal. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of the current knowledge on the role of inflammatory signaling in AML pathogenesis. It discusses the role of inflammation from premalignant states through malignant transformation, dissecting phenotypic, correlative studies from mechanistic evidence. We thereby highlight questions requiring further research to exploit the translational potential of therapies targeting inflammatory signaling and to address challenges with current immune‐modulating treatments. A particular focus is placed on assessing the role of inflammation in the interplay with genetic events as established factors in disease initiation and progression to clarify the current understanding of inflammatory signaling in AML pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Despite recent progress within the field of immuno-oncology, immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment, defective antigen presentation, and low levels of tumor-specific T cells are key limitations of current cancer immunotherapies. CD40-targeting immunotherapies hold promises for addressing these limitations across solid tumors. Here, we describe ATOR-4066, a bispecific antibody that targets CD40 and CEACAM5 developed for immunotherapy of cancer using the Neo-X-Prime platform. ATOR-4066 showed potent CEACAM5-dependent activation in vitro with ability to activate intratumoral immune cells from patient derived material. In vivo, ATOR-4066 induced superior anti-tumor activity compared to CD40 mAb in MC38-CEA tumors and cured mice with well-established tumors with a heterogeneous CEACAM5 expression. Using RNA sequencing, flow cytometry and cytokine analysis, we show that ATOR-4066 promotes immune cell trafficking to tumors and activates both myeloid cells and T cells within the tumor microenvironment, with limited immune activation in the periphery. ATOR-4066 initially induces a T cell-independent anti-tumor response, yet a functional T cell response is critical for long-term tumor control and immunity directed to tumor antigens other than CEACAM5. Finally, we demonstrate that ATOR-4066 synergizes with PD-1 blockade in vitro. In conclusion, these data provide mechanistic evidence for the proposed mode of action and support further development of ATOR-4066 in CEACAM5 expressing cancers.">

        <tr id="RATIONALE
Bacterial pneumonia poses a substantial global health burden, yet the immunological mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis and resolution are incompletely understood.


METHODS
We generated a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of peripheral blood immune cells from 100 individuals: 39 with severe bacterial pneumonia, 31 with mild disease, and 30 healthy controls. Integrating scRNA-seq with clinical and molecular data revealed profound remodeling of the peripheral immune landscape across disease severities.


MAIN RESULTS
Severe pneumonia was characterized by lymphopenia and monocytosis, accompanied by distinct shifts in T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell subset composition. Classical monocytes emerged as central orchestrators of the cytokine storm observed in severe cases, displaying elevated expression of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., S100A8/9/12) and enhanced TLR4-MYD88 signaling. Exhaustion of innate-like CD8+ T cells, marked by upregulation of canonical inhibitory receptors, was a hallmark of severe disease. In contrast, mild pneumonia exhibited robust CD8+ T effector and helper memory cell activation, along with effective humoral immunity, evidenced by plasma cell expansion and coordinated Tfh-B cell interactions. B cells in mild cases showed enhanced antigen recognition, BCR signaling, and co-stimulatory gene expression, whereas those in severe cases displayed signs of dysfunction. Myeloid cell alterations in severe pneumonia included increased monocytic MDSCs and non-classical monocytes, contributing to immunosuppression and complement overactivation, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
This high-resolution atlas of peripheral immune responses in bacterial pneumonia identifies key cellular and molecular drivers of disease severity, providing potential therapeutic targets for immunomodulation and improved outcomes.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (Tumor Microenvironment, TME) is a core regulatory factor in the occurrence, development, and treatment resistance of tumors. Macrophages, as key immune cell components in the TME, have a profound impact on the tumor process (Visser and Joyce in Cancer Cell 41:374–403, 2023). This review aims to systematically elucidate the characteristics and functional differences of macrophage polarization into M1 and M2 phenotypes within the TME. Additionally, it endeavors to dissect the regulatory mechanisms by which metabolic products, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components secreted by tumor cells modulate macrophage polarization (Wang et al. in Mol Cancer 23:268, 2024). Moreover, the metabolic reprogramming of tumorassociated macrophage (TAM) is a core mechanism for their functional shift, and intervening in metabolic pathways holds promise for reprogramming TAMs to inhibit tumor progression (Jin et al. in Nat Cancer 6:239–252, 2025). Within the TME, macrophages can be polarized into classically activated M1 and alternatively activated M2 types (Ge and Wu in Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi 26:228–237, 2023). Accumulating evidence indicates that classically activated M1 macrophages orchestrate anti-tumor immunity by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), which collectively activate cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, induce tumor cell apoptosis, and enhance immune surveillance (Luo et al. in Front Immunol 15:1352946, 2024). In contrast, M2 macrophages are induced in the TME and promote tumor angiogenesis, immune evasion, tumor cell proliferation, and metastasis by secreting factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) (Wang et al. in NPJ Precis Oncol 8:31, 2024). Therefore, in-depth research on the mechanisms of macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment provides an important basis for developing new tumor immunotherapy strategies and has significant clinical translational value.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a hematologic malignancy originating from mature B cells, where the tumor microenvironmentparticularly proliferation centers (PCs)plays a pivotal role in disease progression and treatment resistance. PCs support tumor cell survival, proliferation, and therapy resistance through intercellular communication, metabolic reprogramming, and extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated signaling. This study investigates the mechanisms by which the CLL microenvironment, especially PCs, contributes to drug resistance and disease evolution, with a particular focus on EVs and metabolic remodeling. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to synthesize current findings in this domain.. Key findings reveal that PCs mediate resistance through multiple interconnected mechanisms, including: (1) the CXCL12/CXCR4 retention axis; (2) CD40-CD40L-induced activation of the alternative NF-B pathway; (3) metabolic reprogramming favoring anti-apoptotic profiles; and (4) EV-mediated communication that alters stromal cell behavior. CLL-derived EVs play a critical role in reshaping the bone marrow microenvironment by transferring miRNAs and proteins that alter stromal cell function and metabolism. Additionally, this study identifies a dual metabolic shift in CLL cells, characterized by the simultaneous enhancement of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which is closely linked to microenvironmental dependency. Furthermore, the research uncovers metabolic regionalization within PCs and spatiotemporal heterogeneity in EV distribution.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs), identified by CD103 expression, play key roles in infection and cancer and often correlate with improved survival in the latter. Their characterization in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is of interest due to its viral etiology.


METHODS
NPC tumors from patients treated at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (PMCC; 2000-2017) were examined for CD103+, CD8+ T cells, and PD-L1 abundance, correlated with survival, and underwent NanoString transcriptomic analysis. Additional cohorts from Hong Kong and Singapore were assessed for CD103+ intra-tumoral immune cell (ITIC) abundance.


RESULTS
Of the 141 PMCC patients, 29% (n = 30/103) of NPC tumors had high CD103+ ITIC (defined as ≥ 30%) linked with TRM gene expression, immune checkpoints, and upregulated pathways in T-cell activation. Abundance of CD103+ ITIC was not associated with improved survival (PMCC: HR = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.4-2.1) across all cohorts.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite similarities to other virally driven tumors, CD103+ ITIC abundance was not prognostic in NPC, highlighting the need for better characterization of TRMs subpopulations.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy represents an emerging and promising approach in the field of cancer immunotherapy, harnessing the body’s own immune cells to target and eliminate cancer cells. This review provides an in-depth analysis of TIL therapy, focusing on its mechanisms, clinical applications, challenges, and future prospects. TILs, particularly CD8 + T cells, are isolated from a patient’s tumor, expanded ex vivo, and reinfused to promote anti-tumor immunity. The success of TIL therapy has been demonstrated in various cancers, particularly melanoma, where it has led to durable responses and, in some cases, complete remission. However, significant challenges remain, including the heterogeneity of TIL populations, difficulties in large-scale expansion, and immune-related adverse events. We also explore current strategies aimed at overcoming these limitations, including genetic modification of TILs, combinatory approaches with checkpoint inhibitors, and optimization of tumor infiltration protocols. With ongoing research and technological advancements, TIL therapy holds substantial promise as a cornerstone of personalized cancer treatment. This review synthesizes the current landscape of TIL therapy, providing insights into its clinical efficacy, potential for broader application, and the future of cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cerebral malaria (CM) is the severe progression of an infection with Plasmodium falciparum, causing detrimental damage to brain tissue and is the most frequent cause of Plasmodium falciparum mortality. The critical role of brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the pathophysiology of CM having been revealed, our investigation focuses on the role of NR2F6, an established immune checkpoint, as a candidate driver of CM pathology. We employed an experimental mouse model of CM based on Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection to compare the relative susceptibility of Nr2f6-knock-out and wild-type C57BL6/N mice. As a remarkable result, Nr2f6 deficiency confers a significant survival benefit. In terms of mechanism, we detected less severe endotheliopathy and, hence, less damage to the blood–brain barrier (BBB), accompanied by decreased sequestered parasites and less cytotoxic T-lymphocytes within the brain, manifesting in a better disease outcome. We present evidence that NR2F6 deficiency renders mice more resistant to experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), confirming a causal and non-redundant role for NR2F6 in the progression of ECM disease. Consequently, pharmacological inhibitors of the NR2F6 pathway could be of use to bolster BBB integrity and protect against CM.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients present with CD8 exhaustion signatures, and pharmacologic inhibition of checkpoints can have therapeutic benefit. The alarmin IL-33 and its receptor STimulation-2 (ST2) promote activation of tissue-regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and accelerate malignant progression in solid tumors, but their role in leukemia remains unclear. Here, we show that ST2+ Treg cells are enriched in bone marrow (BM) of humans and mice with AML and promote CD8+ T cells depletion and exhaustion. ST2 deficiency in Treg cells restores CD8+ T cell function, decreasing AML growth via retention of ST2+ Treg cells precursors in lymph nodes. AML-activated ST2+ Treg cells lack T-bet, IFN-γ and Bcl-6, and kill intratumoral CD8+ T cells by amplified granzyme B-mediated cytotoxicity compared to non-AML primed Treg cells. Engineered anti-ST2 antibodies induce ST2+ Treg cells apoptosis to extend survival in AML models. Together, our findings suggest that ST2 is a potential checkpoint target for AML immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a fatal central nervous system infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans breaching the blood–brain barrier (BBB), carrying a mortality rate approaching 100% in untreated individuals, while even survivors following treatment often experience neurological complications including optic nerve atrophy, memory impairment, hydrocephalus, and motor dysfunction. Current research has yet to fully elucidate the complex pathological mechanisms of CM, particularly leaving a significant gap in the systemic analysis within the dynamic interaction network of immunity, metabolism, and the gut microbiota. This article systematically integrates the interplay of immune responses, metabolic reprogramming, and the gut microbiome to reveal the pathogenesis of CM across multiple dimensions: in immune regulation, the phagocytic-inflammatory equilibrium in macrophages and CD4 + T cells defends against pathogen invasion, but hyperactivated immune responses may damage the BBB and exacerbate neural injury; metabolically, host iron overload induces ferroptosis, disrupting the BBB via lipid peroxidation, while inositol metabolism provides substrates for cryptococcal capsular synthesis, enhancing its virulence and promoting CNS invasion; the gut microbiota, meanwhile, modulates immune homeostasis via the “gut-brain axis,” with its metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) enhancing BBB integrity and suppressing neuroinflammation through immunomodulation. We propose a combined therapeutic strategy of “immunomodulators + metabolic inhibitors + microbiota intervention,” moving beyond traditional single-factor research paradigms to establish a multi-omics integrated framework for the precise treatment of CM—spanning molecular mechanisms to clinical translation—and propelling the field of neuroinfectious diseases towards a host-pathogen-microenvironment systemic regulation paradigm.">

        <tr id="PD-1 restrains effective killing of cancer cells by the immune system and is predominantly located on the surface of T cells or other immune cells. However, cancer cells also express PD-1 to varying degrees, which is commonly associated with a poor prognosis. Here, we investigated the regulation and function of PD-1 expression in prostate cancer (PCa) and revealed the impact on the tumor microenvironment. PD-1 expression in cancer cells positively correlated with Gleason grade and metastasis but negatively correlated with CD8+ T cell infiltration in PCa patients. PCa cells secreted PD-1 in exosomes that enhanced the activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) by activating JAK/STAT3 signaling. The activated MDSCs in turn reduced the infiltration of CD8+ T cells within the tumor, promoting tumor immune evasion. The ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 induced deubiquitination and elevated the abundance of PD-1 in PCa, and USP7 inhibition sensitized PCa tumors to anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. Given the modest efficacy of current immunotherapeutic approaches for PCa, strategies to inhibit the secretion of PD-1-bearing exosomes or USP7 function may emerge as promising immunostimulatory interventions for treating PCa.">

We conducted a comprehensive immune characterization of peripheral NK cells in patients with VEXAS (n=40), patients with autoinflammatory diseases without UBA1 mutations (n=22), and elderly gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n=16). Multiparameter phenotyping was performed using CyTOF, scRNAseq, whole blood stimulation assays and in vitro NK cell cytotoxic assay. Peripheral NK cells in VEXAS were quantitatively and qualitatively impaired. Mass cytometry revealed reduced frequencies of mature cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells and an expansion of the CD56high CD16dim subset. NK cells exhibited features of exhaustion, including increased PD-1 expression, and reduced levels of cytotoxic markers such as NKp46 and CD8α. scRNAseq analysis showed decreased signatures of cytotoxicity and IL-2 and IFN-γ production, alongside increased inflammatory signatures. Whole blood stimulation assays confirmed impaired IL-2, IFN-γ, and granzyme B production following TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/TLR8 agonist stimulation. Extended NK phenotyping by flow cytometry confirmed reduced activating receptors' expression and impaired IFN-γ production in VEXAS. Moreover, in vitro UBA1 inhibitors impaired NK cell cytotoxic capacity and promote cell death. Finally, reduced NK cell frequencies were independently associated with an increased risk of severe infections. These findings suggest that NK cell dysfunction in VEXAS syndrome contributes to increased susceptibility to severe infections.">

This leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells some of which remain within the lung and contribute to enhanced pathogen control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells also display long-term changes following infection. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection finding that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes linked to communication with T cells. MHCI and MHCII proteins continue to be expressed at higher levels in both differentiated epithelial cells and progenitor populations and several differentially expressed genes are downstream of the transcription factor, SpiB, a known orchestrator of antigen presentation. Lung epithelial cells from influenza-infected mice display functional changes, more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells display characteristics of immune memory which could affect outcomes that are protective in the context of infection or pathogenic in chronic inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Persistent antigen exposure during chronic viral infection and tumor development drives CD8 T cells into an exhausted, hypofunctional state. Understanding the molecular pathways that enforce T-cell exhaustion is critical for improving current immunotherapies. Previously, we have shown the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) regulates CD8 T-cell function through LPA receptor 5 (LPAR5) signaling, including demonstrating that Lpar5-/- CD8 T cells exhibit enhanced tumor clearance in murine models of melanoma. Importantly, significantly elevated levels of LPA have been identified in individuals with different cancers and persistent viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus. To investigate the role of Lpar5 in the differentiation and maintenance of exhausted CD8 T cells, we utilized the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection model. In response to infection with LCMV Clone 13, but not Armstrong, one-quarter of Lpar5-/- animals succumbed to infection, and this was accompanied by an increased frequency of LCMV-specific Lpar5-/- CD8 T cells maintained in a less terminally exhausted state. Using P14 transgenic mice, we demonstrate that Lpar5 acts in a cell-intrinsic and temporal manner to regulate CD8 T-cell accumulation and exhaustion programming during Clone 13 infection. The enhanced accumulation of Lpar5-/- P14 cells during the acute phase of Clone 13 infection appears to be regulated by Lpar5-mediated changes in T-cell survival and not through trafficking or proliferation. RNA sequencing analyses and surface phenotyping show that Lpar5 likely regulates CD8 T-cell exhaustion through modulation of NK receptor expression, including the CD94/NKG2A inhibitory axis.">

        <tr id="Adoptive transfer of NK cells can induce complete remissions in 30-50% of patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoma. While blood chimerism occurs, attaining functional homing to the site of tumor without exhaustion has been elusive. During chronic infections and tumorigenesis, exposure to activating stimuli weakens the effector activity of NK cells. Despite this knowledge, there is little known about the mechanisms that govern this dysregulation and whether these disparate activating stimuli use distinct pathways to downregulate effector immunity. In this study, we reveal that chronic NK cell activating receptor (NKAR) stimulation and chronic IL-15 exposure impart distinct modes of dysregulation, with NKAR stimulation inducing a tissue resident-like state that resembles that of tumor-infiltrating NK cells in cancer patients. Using loss- and gain-of-function studies, we identify the transcription factor KLF2 as a master regulator of the NK cell response to chronic activation and provide evidence that KLF2 overexpression promotes NK cell cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and chemotaxis, and inhibits the development of dysfunctional, tissue resident-like features. Using KLF2 reporter mice, we show that in certain tissues, tissue resident NK cells are predominantly KLF2-negative while circulating NK cells in these tissues are overwhelmingly KLF2+. Lastly, using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we demonstrate that conditional KLF2 deficiency in NK cells leads to altered homing and the acquisition of tissue resident-like features in vivo. Together, these findings highlight the profound changes NK cells undergo during prolonged activation and advance our understanding of how some NK cell therapies fail during malignant relapse.">

        <tr id="Tumor driven immune suppression poses a significant impediment to the success of immunotherapy in ovarian cancer. Among the various mechanisms contributing to immune suppression, intracellular communication facilitated by tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) within the tumor microenvironment emerges as a pivotal factor influencing tumor growth. Here, it is demonstrated that extracellular vesicle-packaged eIF4E from tumor cells alters protein translation in macrophages, contributing to antitumor immune response. Mechanistically, tumor derived EV-packaged eIF4E significantly enhances the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), driving the synthesis and secretion of cholesterol. This, in turn, activates macrophages and causes immunosuppression through the X-box binding protein 1 and Programmed death-ligand 1 (XBP1/PD-L1) axis. Strikingly, both genetic and pharmacological depletion of HMGCR in macrophages effectively restores their antitumor activity. Clinically, elevated HMGCR expression in tumor-associated macrophages is associated with poor survival outcomes in ovarian cancer patients. The pivotal role of eIF4E is underscored here as a key signaling mediator, facilitating the communication between tumor and immune cells via EVs to promote immune suppression and suggesting HMGCR as a potential therapeutic target for tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Colon cancer is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with significant global incidence and mortality. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in disease progression and treatment response. Among key components of the TME are tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T cells, whose balance influences cancer outcomes.


METHODS
This review analyzes recent findings regarding the role of Treg cells in colon cancer progression by evaluating preclinical and clinical studies that explore immune cell composition, function, and modulation within the TME.


RESULTS
Treg cells demonstrate a dual role in colon cancer. While they suppress effective anti-tumor immune responses, facilitating immune evasion, they may also mitigate chronic inflammation, which contributes to carcinogenesis. High intratumoral Treg levels are correlated with poor prognosis, reduced immunotherapy efficacy, and lower overall survival. Strategies to deplete or reprogram Tregs, such as immune checkpoint inhibition, modulation of T cell plasticity, and selective targeting, have shown promise in enhancing anti-tumor immunity.


DISCUSSION
Complete depletion of Tregs risks inducing autoimmune toxicity. Therefore, a precise understanding of Treg cell subsets and functions is essential. This review highlights the importance of developing targeted immunotherapeutic strategies that modulate Treg activity while preserving immune homeostasis in colon cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="The generation of memory CD8+ T cells is essential for establishing protective T cell immunity against pathogens and cancers. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying memory CD8+ T cell formation remain incompletely understood. Reliance on specific pathogen-free (SPF) models, characterized by restricted microbial exposure, may limit our understanding of physiologically relevant immune memory development. This study reveals that CD1d-restricted NKT cells regulate central memory T cell (TCM) generation exclusively in a microbe-rich (“dirty”) environment. Under non-SPF housing, CD1d+/− and Ja18+/− mice exhibited enhanced TCM formation compared to NKT-deficient controls (CD1d−/−/Ja18−/−), demonstrating that microbial experience is required for NKT-mediated TCM regulation. Mechanistically, CD1d-restricted NKT cells increased IL-15Rα expression on CD4+ T cells in CD1d+/− mice, potentiating IL-15 trans-presentation and thereby activating the IL-15/pSTAT5/Eomes axis critical for TCM maintenance. Functional validation through adoptive transfer of CFSE-labeled OT-1 memory cells revealed an NKT cell-dependent survival advantage in CD1d+/− hosts. This provides direct evidence that microbiota-experienced niches shape immune memory. Collectively, these findings establish CD1d-restricted NKT cells as physiological regulators of TCM generation and suggest their potential utility as vaccine adjuvants to enhance protective immunity.">

        <tr id="Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are generally unresponsive to tumor targeted treatments and immunotherapies. Genetic alterations acquired during the evolution of CRPC may impact anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy responses, which could inform personalized therapeutic strategies. Using our innovative electroporation-based mouse models, we generated distinct genetic subtypes of CRPC found in patients and uncovered unique immune microenvironments. Specifically, mouse and human prostate tumors with MYC amplification and p53 disruption had weak cytotoxic lymphocyte infiltration and an overall dismal prognosis. MYC and p53 cooperated to induce tumor intrinsic secretion of VEGF, which signaled through VEGFR2 expressed on CD8+ T cells to directly inhibit T cell migration and effector functions. Targeting VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling in vivo remodeled the immune suppressive prostate tumor microenvironment, leading to CD8+ T cell-mediated primary tumor and metastasis growth suppression and significantly increased overall survival in MYC and p53 altered CPRC. VEGFR2 blockade also led to induction of PD-L1 in tumors and produced anti-tumor efficacy in combination with PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade in multiple preclinical CRPC mouse models. Thus, these results identify a genetic mechanism of immune suppression through VEGF signaling in prostate cancer that can be targeted to reactivate immune and immunotherapy responses in an aggressive subtype of CRPC.">

        <tr id="Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, plays a pivotal and multifaceted role in tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance by transducing extracellular mechanical stimuli—such as matrix stiffness and fluid shear stress—into intracellular calcium influx. In tumor cells, Piezo1 promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by activating oncogenic signaling and contributes to an immunosuppressive TME through regulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. In the immune compartment, Piezo1 integrates mechanical cues with metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming to orchestrate the functions of T cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells. Notably, Piezo1 deficiency impairs TH9 cell differentiation, diminishes T cell cytotoxicity, and enhances the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, Piezo1 expression correlates with distinct tumor immune phenotypes, such as “cold tumors,” and with responses to immunotherapy, making it a promising predictive biomarker for treatment efficacy. Given its dual regulatory roles in tumor biology and immune modulation, targeting Piezo1—such as through combination with programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade—offers a potential strategy to reverse immunosuppression and enhance antitumor immunity. This review summarizes emerging insights into Piezo1’s role in cancer progression and immune regulation and highlights its translational potential as a novel target in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Oncolytic viruses (OV) are an emerging form of immunotherapy that utilize naturally occurring or engineered viruses to specifically infect and lyse tumor cells. They achieve tumor treatment through direct tumor cell killing or by inducing immunogenic cell death to enhance immune responses. However, the efficacy of OV has been suboptimal in clinical trials. This review comprehensively examines mechanisms of resistance to OV through three interconnected dimensions: The characteristics of tumors and tumor cells, factors related to stromal cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the host immune status. Potential solutions targeting these mechanisms are also proposed. For instance, OV typically achieve tumor selectivity through tumor-specific receptors or specific promoters. However, due to inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity, the lack of such specific receptors or promoters in tumor cells can lead to off-target effects of OV, resulting in treatment resistance. The ECM in the tumor microenvironment, such as hyaluronic acid, may also impede viral transport. Additionally, the clearance of OV by immune cells can contribute to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes of OV treatment. Consequently, investigating predictive biomarkers of OV efficacy, utilizing ECM-degrading enzymes and combining with immune checkpoint inhibitors represents a promising strategy to augment the therapeutic effects of OV. Synthesizing current evidence, it is anticipated that future investigations will optimize the therapeutic effects of OV treatment and bring better immunotherapeutic outcomes for cancer patients.">

This study compares metabolic (SIRT1, AMPKA, HIF1A, and GLUT1) and inflammatory (NFKB1, NFKB1A, IFNG, and SOCS1) gene expression, and flow cytometry-based assessment of functional markers in NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients (n=15) and the control group (n=10), and their association with clinical outcomes. Severe COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated IFNγ, Granzyme B, and KIR2DL1 expression in NK cells compared to controls (P < 0.005), while LAMP1 was unchanged (P > 0.05). NK cells from deceased patients exhibited significantly lower expression levels of LAMP1 and Granzyme B (P < 0.05). Patients hospitalized >7 days presented lower Granzyme-B+ NK cells (P < 0.05). NK cells from severe COVID-19 patients showed downregulation of HIF1A and GLUT1, and upregulation of NFKB1 (P < 0.05). HIF1A and GLUT1 expression were elevated in patients with >7 days of hospitalization (P < 0.05). SIRT1 expression was higher in patients requiring intubation (P < 0.05).

        <tr id="PURPOSE OF REVIEW
As the HIV pandemic persists in the absence of an effective vaccine, this review summarizes promising recent strategies harnessing natural killer cells as part of the innate immune system for HIV cure.


RECENT FINDINGS
Current HIV cure approaches aim to enhance natural killer (NK) cell function by reversing inhibition, cytokine-mediated activation and targeting reservoir tissues. Additionally, HIV-specific NK cell therapies include broadly neutralizing antibody-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, bispecific antibodies and adoptive NK cell transfers. To date, none of the strategies by themselves showed sufficient efficacy, highlighting the importance of integrated approaches combining multiple NK cell-based strategies as well as considering the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune response to HIV-1.


SUMMARY
Encouraging findings from in vitro studies, animal models and clinical trials studying innovative NK cell-based therapies demonstrate their potential for cure strategies. Different strategies may need to be combined to create synergy to overcome the major challenge represented by the latent viral reservoir.">

        <tr id="Elderly individuals were disproportionally affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, and more than 80% of the global COVID-19-related deaths between 2020 and 2021 occurred among people aged 60 years or older. Several cellular modifications in aged cells may lead to systemic inflammation and fibrotic responses. Age or exogenous insults induce cellular senescence, further increasing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, leading to the condition known as inflammaging, that can contribute to disease severity. Older individuals presented signs of systemic hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19, but few studies analyzed the influence of age on lung tissue responses in cases of severe COVID-19. We hypothesized that age related alterations regarding innate/acquired immunity and cellular senescence in lung tissue of individuals without lung diseases could predispose to viral infection. We also aimed to identify how the aged lung responded to severe COVID-19 infection. We studied lung tissues from 19 individuals that died from non-pulmonary causes and 28 adult individuals who died from COVID-19 between March and May of 2020, divided according to their age (> or < 60 years). Tissue sections were stained, via immunohistochemistry, and 19 markers among immune cells, COVID-19 receptors, cytokines and senescence were analyzed in the lung parenchyma of both groups. In the COVID-19 group, the Luminex multiplex assay technique was used to detect a panel of 25 cytokines/chemokines. In control lungs, aged individuals had a lower TLR7 expression, without differences in other markers. Older patients had a shorter time between onset of symptoms and death, with a significant negative correlation with age. Unlike the adult younger group, older COVID − 19 patients presented significant differences in relation to their age matched controls in the expression of CD8 + T cells, IFN-α2, TLR7, pSTAT-3, p21 and p53. They also presented higher protein expression that IFN-α2 and TGF-beta than the adult COVID-19 group, with a trend to decreased CD20 + cell density in the lungs. Taken together, our data show age adversely affects the lung expression of key proteins related to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, by perpetuating inflammation and increasing pro-fibrotic responses.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are pivotal immunosuppressive components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in gastric cancer (GC), yet their heterogeneity and metabolic crosstalk with tumor cells remain poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 75,743 cells from 11 GC tissues and identified four distinct TAM subsets (TAM-APOE, TAM-IDO1, TAM-SKAP1, TAM-POLB), each exhibiting unique functional signatures. Among these, the TAM-APOE subset, enriched in lipid metabolism and complement pathways, showed the strongest interaction with tumor cells via the MIF-CD74 axis. Functional studies revealed that GC-derived MIF promotes TAM-APOE polarization, upregulating immunosuppressive genes and enhancing tumor progression. In vivo, MIF overexpression in GC cells increases subcutaneous tumor volume, while MIF knockdown decreases tumor weight. Crucially, Milatuzumab, a CD74-targeting antibody, reversed MIF-induced TAM immunosuppression in vitro. Our research provides a comprehensive map of GC-TAM heterogeneity; reveals that the MIF-CD74 axis is a key driver of TAM-mediated immune suppression; and proposes that CD74 blockade is a new therapeutic strategy for GC.

        <tr id="Mpox poses a heightened risk of severe disease and mortality among individuals with HIV, yet the molecular mechanisms and immunopathology underlying multi-organ damage caused by the mpox virus (MPXV), particularly in the context of HIV co-infection, remain poorly understood. Here, we observe increased MPXV replication, more extensive skin lesions, and impaired humoral and cellular immune responses in SIV-MPXV co-infected rhesus macaques compared to those infected with MPXV alone. Multi-organ proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses reveals upregulation of proteins involved in immune and inflammatory pathways in skin lesions and across multiple organs, especially in immune-related tissues. Abnormal activation of DNA replication and cell cycle signaling pathways, which may contribute to enhanced viral replication, is evident in both MPXV and SIV-MPXV co-infected groups. CDK4/6 may present a potential therapeutic target to suppress MPXV replication. These comprehensive proteomic datasets offer valuable insights into the pathogenesis of MPXV in the context of SIV co-infection and support ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of mpox.">

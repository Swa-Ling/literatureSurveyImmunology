        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The gut microbiota crucially regulates the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) based immunotherapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear at the single-cell resolution. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and subsequent validations, we investigate gut microbiota-ICI synergy by profiling the tumor microenvironment (TME) and elucidating critical cellular interactions in mouse models. Our findings reveal that intact gut microbiota combined with ICIs may synergistically increase the proportions of CD8+, CD4+, and γδ T cells, reduce glycolysis metabolism, and reverse exhausted CD8+ T cells into memory/effector CD8+ T cells, enhancing antitumor response. This synergistic effect also induces macrophage reprogramming from M2 protumor Spp1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to Cd74+ TAMs, which act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These macrophage subtypes show a negative correlation within tumors, particularly during fecal microbiota transplantation. Depleting Spp1+ TAMs in Spp1 conditional knockout mice boosts ICI efficacy and T cell infiltration, regardless of gut microbiota status, suggesting a potential upstream role of the gut microbiota and highlighting the crucial negative impact of Spp1+ TAMs during macrophage reprogramming on immunotherapy outcomes. Mechanistically, we propose a γδ T cell-APC-CD8+ T cell axis, where gut microbiota and ICIs enhance Cd40lg expression on γδ T cells, activating Cd40 overexpressing APCs (e.g., Cd74+ TAMs) through CD40-CD40L-related NF-κB signaling and boosting CD8+ T cell responses via CD86-CD28 interactions. These findings highlight the potential importance of γδ T cells and SPP1-related macrophage reprogramming in activating CD8+ T cells, as well as the synergistic effect of gut microbiota and ICIs in immunotherapy through modulating the TME.">

        <tr id="The gastric mucosa is characterized by continuous innate immune surveillance and inflammatory signaling, yet a high proportion of gastric carcinomas (GCs) are recalcitrant to immune-directed therapies. The mechanisms by which GCs evade adaptive immune surveillance within the highly antigenic microenvironment of the gastric mucosa remains unknown. To address this, we collected patient-matched tumor tissue, distant normal tissue, metastasis, and draining lymph nodes to generate a large-scale single-cell immune profiling dataset from 64 patients (n=179 samples, >150,000 cells). From single cell analysis, we identified two distinct sources of impaired tumor surveillance within tumor draining lymph nodes. First, we observed that a significant fraction of tumor draining lymph nodes had undergone cytokine-driven reprogramming, leading to reduced dendritic cell homing and limited T cell priming. Second, T cells undergoing successful activation exhibited limited expansion and constrained differentiation, marked by expression of the quiescence-associated transcription factor Kruppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2). Overexpression of KLF2 in primary T cells limited both their differentiation and cytotoxic capacity. These findings implicate both impaired T cell priming and KLF2-dependent T cell quiescence in limiting T cell immunity in gastric adenocarcinoma. We suggest these findings represent an emerging model for immune silencing in tumors developing from tissues with chronic inflammation.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant non-cancerous cell type in glioblastoma (GBM) and heavily influence GBM biology, contributing to tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, immune evasion, and neovascularization. Current in vitro models that utilize IL-4/IL-13 stimulation fail to capture the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of TAMs observed in vivo. In this study, we utilize a serum-free indirect co-culture model with patient-derived xenolines to polarize primary human macrophages and characterize their molecular and functional phenotypes. We demonstrate that xenoline-polarized macrophages diverge from classical M1/M2 states and instead adopt transcriptional signatures reflective of TAM subsets identified from patients. Notably, macrophages polarized with the radiation-therapy selected xenoline, JX14P-RT, exhibited gene expression patterns enriched for interferon response and hypoxia, mirroring recurrent GBM samples. In contrast, JX14P TAMs showed enrichment in phagocytic gene sets. Functional validation of these phenotypes revealed discrepancies between the transcriptionally predicted and observed phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of integrating phenotypic validation in sequencing studies. Altogether, our findings establish xenoline-polarized macrophages as a more physiologically relevant alternative to traditional models, offering a useful model for studying tumor-immune interaction in vitro.">

        <tr id="Background CNS infection by HIV-1 contributes to neuroinflammation, cognitive impairments, and the establishment of viral reservoirs. Although HIV-1 is known to enter the brain early in infection via “Trojan horse” leukocytes, including infected monocytes and CD4+T cells, the specific cellular phenotypes facilitating this process during acute infection remain incompletely characterized. Objective This study aims to characterize the roles of brain lymphocytes during acute infection and primary CD4+ T cell phenotypes seeding the SIV to the CNS. Methods scRNA-seq was performed on brain and blood cells of three acutely SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The transcriptomic data were analyzed using bioinformatics approaches and validated through in vitro co-culture assays and re-analysis of a publicly available scRNA-seq dataset. Results We found a distinct cell cluster in the brain co-expressing myeloid and lymphoid genes, suggesting brain myeloid cells may engulf CD4+ T cells entering from the blood. This finding was confirmed in by coculture studies of macrophages and T cells, and identified specific chemokines could distinguish such cells. Acute infection induced an increase in proliferating CD4+ cytotoxic-like T cells, which had high expression of viral entry receptors and adhesion molecules, indicating their role in CNS infection. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of cytotoxic genes, MHC class II molecules, ISG15, and USP18 in brain lymphocytes, indicating a robust immune response to acute infection. Conclusion Our findings suggest that CD4+cytotoxic-like T cells represent a key lymphocyte subset responsible for initiating SIV entry into the brain and triggering neuroinflammatory processes. Furthermore, interactions between infiltrating lymphocytes and brain-resident myeloid cells may facilitate viral propagation within the CNS.">

The distinctions of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) between early- and advanced-stage CRC may represent a critical factor, yet remain incompletely elucidated. Methods We comprehensively analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data, bulk RNA transcription data and pathological tissue data to investigate the dynamic changes in the TME. The features of TLS in early- and advanced-stage tumors and their potential impact on immunotherapy were explored using three in-house cohorts. Results We provided single-cell fine maps of the immune landscape in early and advanced CRC. Significant functional differences were identified in CD4 + Tfh and BGC cells between early and advanced CRC. We revealed CXCL13 expression on CD8 + Tex cells, along with CD40–CD40L interactions between CD4 + Tfh and BGC cells, could be key regulators of TLS functionality and subsequently affect the response to immunotherapy. Conclusions Our research shed light on the multilayered immune dysfunction in advanced CRC and elucidates the alterations in the TLS during the progression of CRC, providing insights for functional studies and the exploration of potential target in advanced CRC.

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) present clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. The lack of ICIs efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of tumor-reprogrammed glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs) that create a “cold” immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), impeding the infiltration and activation of effector T cells. GBM-derived αvβ3/αvβ5-integrin ligands, including SPP1, were shown to mediate the emergence of GAMs. We hypothesized that a combination strategy aiming to block the reprogramming of GAMs using a synthetic 7aaRGD peptide that targets SPP1/integrin signaling might overcome resistance to ICIs and reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. Methods Matrigel invasion assay was used to test the efficacy of 7aaRGD in glioma-microglia co-cultures. We determined the impact of 7aaRGD, administered as a monotherapy or combined with PD-1 blockade, on tumor growth, GAMs accumulation and phenotypes, arginase-1 levels and neovasculature in experimental gliomas. The effects of treatments on the tumor immune landscape were dissected using multiparameter flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, cytokine profiling and RNA-seq analysis of sorted GAMs followed by CITE-seq based data deconvolution. Results 7aaRGD efficiently blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in vitro. Intratumorally delivered 7aaRGD alone did not reduce tumor growth in orthotopic gliomas but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive GAMs and led to normalization of peritumoral blood vessels. Combining 7aaRGD with anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in reduced tumor growth, with an increase in the number of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depletion of regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, reflecting the restored “hot” inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. Intratumoral administration of 7aaRGD similarly modified the phenotypes of GAMs in human U87-MG gliomas in immunocompromised mice. Exploration of transcriptomic datasets revealed that high expression of integrin receptor coding genes in pre-treatment biopsies was associated with a poorer response to immune check-point blockade in patients with several types of cancers. Conclusions We demonstrate that combining the blockade of SPP1/integrin signaling with ICIs modifies innate immunity and reinvigorates adaptive antitumor responses, which paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.

        <tr id="Although lung myeloid cells provide an intracellular niche for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), CD4+ T cells limit Mtb growth in these cells to protect the host. The CD4+ T cell activities including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production that account for this protection are poorly understood. Using intravenous antibody labeling and lineage-tracing reporter mice, we show that monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), rather than phenotypically similar monocytes or dendritic cells, are preferentially infected with Mtb in murine lungs. MDMs were recruited to the lungs by Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells via IFN-γ, which promoted the extravasation of monocyte precursors from the blood. It was possible that CD4+ T cells recruited infectable MDMs because these cells are uniquely poised to receive cognate MHCII-mediated help to control intracellular bacteria. Mice with MHCII deficiency in monocyte-derived cells had normal Mtb-specific CD4+ T cell activation, expansion and differentiation but the CD4+ T cells were unable to attenuate Mtb growth. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we showed that MDMs receiving cognate MHCII-mediated help from CD4+ T cells upregulated glycolytic genes associated with Mtb control. Overall, the results indicate that CD4+ T cells recruit infectable MDMs to the lungs and then trigger glycolysis-dependent bacterial control in the MDMs by engaging their MHCII-bound Mtb peptides. Moreover, the results suggest that cognate MHCII-mediated help to promote MDM glycolysis is an essential, IFN-γ-independent effector function of Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells.">

        <tr id="The current concept is that the eye is an immune privileged site endowed with innate immune regulatory networks to maintain organ function. We now have evidence that resident T cells occupy intraocular tissues. In immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, tissue resident T cells trigger disease flares in the skin and joints. This suggests resident T cells in the uvea may have similar functions in non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis, a collective term for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases of the uveal tract causing intraocular inflammation. Here, we demonstrate by spectral cytometry and immunofluorescence imaging that non-inflamed uveal tissue contains multiple T cell subtypes including CD8+ CD103+ tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells. Using single cell RNA & T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to profile aqueous humour cells from donors with acute, active uveitis, we identify clonally expanded T cells which are enriched for TRM -associated genes. We further show that in donors with active uveitis, CD8+ CD103+ T cells persist within tissue in the uveal tract. Using bulk RNA sequencing and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) we show that quiescent iris tissue from donors with a history of uveitis are enriched for genes associated with T cell activation and antigen presentation. Finally, we demonstrate that TRM cells persist in the anterior uvea in mice following resolution of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Our results show that the human eye contains T cells both in health and during active inflammation. Our findings challenge the dogma that the eye is devoid of lymphocytes and supports the concept of resident T cell involvement in the pathogenesis of non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis and as promising targets for therapy.

        <tr id="Neonates, especially those born prematurely, are highly vulnerable to infection-induced mortality. Numerous observational and immunological studies in newborns have shown that live attenuated vaccines have beneficial, non-specific effects (NSEs) against secondary infections to unrelated pathogens. These beneficial effects have been attributed to trained immunity, and emergency granulopoiesis plays an essential role. However, trained immunity has been shown to affect multiple myeloid subsets and how trained immunity influences the host protective response is still undefined. Here we show that Bacillus-Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination improves survival to polymicrobial sepsis by simultaneously reprogramming broad aspects of myelopoiesis. Specifically, BCG vaccination expands multiple myeloid subsets, including the lineage (Lin)−Sca- 1+c-kit+ (LSK) and granulocytic-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), and increases CD11b+Gr1+ cell number, as well as their oxidative metabolism and capacity to stimulate T-cell proliferation in response to sepsis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of neonatal splenocytes suggests that BCG-vaccination changes the broad transcriptional landscape of multiple myeloid subsets. The result is the maturation of various neutrophil and monocyte subsets, stimulation of antimicrobial processes, and suppression of inflammatory pathways and myeloid-derived suppressor cell transcription. These findings reveal that BCG administration early after birth fundamentally reorganizes the myeloid landscape to benefit the subsequent response to polymicrobial infection.

        <tr id="Background Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), as key immune components of the TME, play a pivotal role in tumor progression by fostering an immunosuppressive environment. Programmed death 1 (PD-1), a critical immune checkpoint molecule predominantly expressed on T cells, mediates immune suppression by binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Emerging evidence reveals that TAMs also express PD-1, however, the expression and functional regulatory mechanisms of PD-1 on TAM remain poorly understood. Methods In this study, we combined bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to investigate the association between PD-1 expression on macrophages and patient prognosis, while also uncovering the molecular mechanisms by which PD-1 regulates macrophage function. To further investigate the role of PD-1 in macrophage activity, we established a fluorescence-labeled tumor-bearing mouse model using CT26 cells, a murine colorectal cancer cell line, to evaluate the relationship between PD-1 expression on TAMs and their phagocytic activity as well as other functions. Additionally, to mimic the TME in vitro, we cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with CT26-conditioned medium (CT26-CM). Results Our results suggest that PD-1 expression on TAMs drives macrophage polarization toward an M2-like phenotype, suppresses their phagocytic activity, inhibits the synthesis of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling molecules, and ultimately promotes tumor progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PD-1 regulates the synthesis of IFN-γ signaling molecules and the polarization of M2-type macrophages in BMDMs through the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Overall, our study demonstrates that PD-1 expression on TAMs facilitates the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment, ultimately accelerating tumor progression.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and activated T cells rely on aerobic glycolysis for energy metabolism. The TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) inhibits glycolysis and protects AML cells from apoptosis. Preliminary studies suggest that combining TIGAR inhibition with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) may offer a therapeutic strategy for AML. However, it remains unclear whether silencing TIGAR can enhance T cell function and thereby improve AML prognosis. This study aims to investigate whether TIGAR silencing in host can eliminate AML cells and rejuvenate dysfunctional T cells with mouse models. TIGAR knockout mice on the C57BL/6J background were generated and AML mouse models were established through intravenous injection of C1498 cells. We found that TIGAR depletion enhanced CD8+ T cell counts and raised CD4/CD8 ratio, downregulating CD44 and immune checkpoints CTLA-4, LAG-3, PD-1 on cell surface of CD8+ T cells. TIGAR depletion boosted cytokine secretion (IFN-γ, perforin, granzyme B, TNF-α) by CD8+ T cells and IL-2, TNF-α by CD4+ T cells, improving cytotoxicity against AML cells, proliferation, and reducing apoptosis. TIGAR suppression in host with 2-DG prolonged AML mouse survival, decreased tumor burden, and leukemic infiltration. TIGAR suppression restored thymic T cell development and peripheral immune balance. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis also revealed that high TIGAR expression influences the glycolysis pathway, and correlates with markers of T cell exhaustion. This study indicates that blocking TIGAR prevents CD8+ T cell dysfunction and induces anti-AML immunity.

        <tr id="Eosinophils are agile cells that participate in a multitude of homeostatic and inflammatory responses in the lung, ranging from allergic asthma to antiviral defense against respiratory viral infection. In the context of vaccination followed by viral infection, such as breakthrough infection, eosinophils have been linked to aberrant Th2 responses like vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD). Here, we demonstrate that the lung immune cell composition, cytokine and chemokine repertoire, histopathological profile, and systemic humoral response of breakthrough influenza infection in mice is distinct from that of primary influenza infection or allergic sensitization, canonical Type 1 and 2 immune responses, respectively. Longitudinal comparison of breakthrough infection with allergic sensitization and primary influenza infection demonstrated major differences in lung immunity between treatment groups in female, BALB/c mice. Breakthrough infection mice exhibit lung eosinophil infiltration that peaks at 7-10 days post-challenge, enriched for the Siglec-Fhi subset, but in the absence of overt pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine signals, high viral titers, severe lung lesions, goblet cell hyperplasia, allergic levels of total IgE, or enhanced morbidity. Multiparameter fluorescence imaging corroborated findings from flow cytometry and also unveiled interactions between CD101+Siglec-F+ cells with CD3+ cells in the lung tissue space. Imaging also revealed a marked absence of eosinophil or neutrophil extracellular traps in the lungs of breakthrough infection mice, in contrast with allergic sensitization and primary influenza infection, respectively. Altogether, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the kinetics and cell-cell interplay during non-pathological, balanced Type 1/2 immune responses in vaccinated hosts during breakthrough infection.">

        <tr id="Axl, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family comprised of Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK, is a promising cancer therapeutic target actively under clinical investigation. Axl is understood to be a dual target in cancer to (1) prevent tumor cell growth and invasion and (2) potentiate anti-tumor immunity. This immunity is characterized by myeloid cell activation and downstream recruitment and activation of anti-tumor T cells. However, the ways by which Axl inhibition promotes myeloid cell activation in the tumor microenvironment are incompletely understood. There is thus a need to understand the effects of Axl inhibition on myeloid cells in the context of the broader tumor microenvironment. Here, we developed a human in vitro model system using primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and Axl-expressing melanoma tumor cells to elucidate the effects of Axl inhibition on the myeloid compartment of the tumor microenvironment. We found that treatment with the Axl-specific small molecule inhibitor bemcentinib yields increased expression of markers of activation in both macrophages and dendritic cells. Interestingly, the addition of dendritic cells to the system appears to dampen macrophage response, suggesting that these cells cooperate to share the burden of the innate immune response. Most importantly, we found that treatment-naïve tumor cells and targeted therapy-treated tumor cells have distinct impacts on macrophage state, and these differences dictate the nature of the immune cell response to Axl inhibition. As a whole, our work highlights the utility of in vitro models in unraveling the complex mechanistic effects of Axl inhibition and establishes a robust model system that can be used in future mechanistic drug studies with the potential to inform clinical trial design.">

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized the cellular compositions of necrotizing granulomatous lesions that developed in the lungs of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice. We identified 11 distinct major cell types, including phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages, and T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Among T cells, particularly, Pdcd1⁺ γδ T cells were detected in necrotizing granulomatous lesions, suggesting their potential role in the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. Within the macrophage populations, we identified a cluster with significantly higher Plin2 expression compared to other clusters, whose transcriptomic profile was consistent with that of foamy macrophages. A subset of the Plin2-expressing macrophages was identified as a major source of Ifnb1 and Cxcl1, suggesting their involvement in type I interferon signaling and neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, we identified Flrt2, Hyal1, and Mmp13 as novel molecular markers of Plin2-expressing macrophages, which were localized to the peripheral rim regions of necrotizing granulomas. In conclusion, our results provide the immune landscape of necrotizing granulomas and reveal novel functional states of macrophages contributing to TB pathogenesis.">

Therefore, identifying novel combination treatment strategies to enhance ICBs therapeutic efficacy for CC patients is urgently needed. Here, we discovered that CD39 was highly expressed in exhausted CD8 + T cells from 10 CC patients in our center via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Furthermore, we validated that CC patients with CD39 highly expressed in CD8 + T cells associated with poor prognosis and immunoevasive subtype of CC both in cohort from our center and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Moreover, it was also confirmed that CD39-inhibiting not only enhanced the cytotoxicity of CD8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) but also promoted the infiltration of B cells through increasing CXCL13 secretion both in vitro experiments and subcutaneous tumor models, thereby amplifying anti-tumor immunity of PD-1 blockade. What was more, we have developed a liposome containing POM-1, which effectively enhanced the anti-tumor effect of POM-1.

        <tr id="Background Macrophages have been classically associated with their innate immune functions of responding to acute injury or pathogenic insult, but they have been largely overlooked as primary initiators of adaptive immune responses. Here, we demonstrate that adoptively transferred macrophages, with optimal activation prior to administration, act as a potent cellular cancer therapeutic platform against a murine melanoma model. Method The macrophage therapy was prepared from bone marrow-derived macrophages, pretreated ex vivo with an activation cocktail containing interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, and anti-CD40 antibody. The therapy was administered to tumor-bearing mice via the tail vein. Tumor growth and survival of the treated mice were monitored to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Tumors and spleens were processed to examine immune responses and underlying mechanisms. Results This immunotherapy platform elicits systemic immune responses while infiltrating the tumor to exert direct antitumor effects in support of the systemic adaptive response. The macrophage-based immunotherapy produced a strong CD8+T cell response along with robust natural killer and CD4+T cell activation, inducing a “hot” tumor transition and achieving effective tumor suppression. Conclusions Owing to their inherent ability to home to and infiltrate inflamed tissues, macrophage-based cancer immunotherapies exhibited a unique in vivo trafficking behavior, efficiently reaching and persisting within tumors. Macrophages orchestrated a multiarmed immune attack led by CD8+T cells, with the potential for local, intratumoral activation of effector cells, demonstrating a novel cancer immunotherapy platform with meaningfully different characteristics than clinically evaluated alternatives.">

        <tr id="Although immune checkpoint blockade therapy has generated dramatic responses in certain cancer types, breast tumors are largely unresponsive. Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity leads to the assembly of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and drives resistance of breast tumors to immunotherapies. Importantly, targeting CD73 completely sensitizes quasi-mesenchymal breast tumors to anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. However, the mechanism(s) of sensitization remained unknown. We demonstrate that targeting CD73 in quasi-mesenchymal breast tumors sensitizes them to anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade therapy in a CD4+ T-cell dependent manner. Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity results in elevated expression of cancer cell-intrinsic CD73 in human triple negative breast cancers. Given the ability of quasi-mesenchymal cancer cells to metastasize and resist multiple therapies, these findings can instruct the formation of novel translational strategies for the treatment of human breast cancers. These findings also bring to the forefront the attractive possibility of utilizing the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells along with CD73 and CD4+ T-cells as a predictive criterion for immunotherapy responsiveness.

        <tr id="Prior infection elicits durable reprogramming in myeloid cells and their progenitors; however, the long-term consequences of this reprogramming are not well understood. We previously established a murine model of sepsis survival induced by cecal ligation and puncture which results in enhanced lung injury responses to lipopolysaccharide. In this model, classical monocytes from post-sepsis mice display persistently enhanced cytokine expression after lipopolysaccharide. To test the hypothesis that inflammatory reprogramming of monocytes mediates enhanced lung injury in post-sepsis mice, depletion and/or adoptive transfer was performed three weeks and three months after sepsis. Transcriptomic and epigenomic pathways associated with monocyte reprogramming and shifts in novel monocyte subsets were determined after sepsis in mice and humans. Monocytes from post-sepsis mice mediated enhanced LPS-induced lung injury and promoted neutrophil degranulation. Prior sepsis enhanced JAK-STAT signaling and AP-1 binding in monocytes, shifting toward the neutrophil-like monocyte subset and their progenitors. Similar neutrophil-like monocyte shifts were observed in adult sepsis patients and monocyte counts were predictive of 90-day mortality. We conclude that sepsis induces inflammatory memory affecting bone marrow progenitors and monocyte subsets predisposing to lung injury. These observations serve as a foundation for future investigations on neutrophil-like monocytes and inflammatory program interaction in tissue injury responses. Summary Sepsis shifts the immune program and ontogeny of monocytes and their progenitors contributing to long-term risk for new organ injury.">

        <tr id="Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) share features and regulatory pathways with normal stem cells, yet how the stem cell niche contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify CXCR4+ macrophages as a niche population enriched in normal mammary ducts, where they promote the regenerative activity of basal cells in response to luminal cell-derived CXCL12. CXCL12 triggers AKT-mediated stabilization of β-catenin, which induces Wnt ligands and pro-migratory genes, enabling intraductal macrophage infiltration and supporting regenerative activity of basal cells. Notably, these same CXCR4+ niche macrophages regulate the tumor-initiating activity of various breast cancer subtypes by enhancing TIC survival and tumor-forming capacity, while promoting early immune evasion through regulatory T cell induction. Furthermore, a CXCR4+ niche macrophage gene signature correlates with poor prognosis in human breast cancer. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in orchestrating interactions between niche macrophages, mammary epithelial cells, and immune cells, thereby establishing a supportive niche for both normal tissue regeneration and mammary tumor initiation.">

        <tr id="The role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, it is shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy mice to lupus mice ameliorates lupus‐like symptoms. Microbiota reconstitution effectively reduces systemic class switch recombination (CSR) and elevates immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) naïve isotype. Microbiota profiling reveals an enrichment of Lactobacillus johnsonii post‐FMT, with a significant correlation to purine metabolites. Importantly, the L. johnsonii‐derived inosine, an intermediate metabolite in purine metabolism, effectively alleviates lupus pathogenesis in mice. Inosine inhibits B cell differentiation and reduces renal B cell infiltration to protect mice from lupus. At the molecular level, inosine reprograms B cells through the extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK)‐hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1alpha (HIF‐1α) signaling pathway. Therefore, this study highlights the discovery of a novel microbial metabolite modulating autoimmunity and suggests its potential for innovative microbiome‐based therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes severe intestinal damage and high mortality in neonatal piglets. The continuous emergence of new strains has brought new challenges to prevention and control. In this study, we isolated and characterized a prevalent PEDV virulent strain and analyzed 19,612 jejunal cells from PEDV-infected and control piglets using single-cell sequencing, revealing significant changes in cellular composition, gene expression, and intercellular communication. In response to PEDV infection, epithelial repair was enhanced through increased proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, transit-amplifying (TA) cells, and intestinal progenitor cells into enterocytes. Additionally, PEDV disrupted intercellular communication, compromising epithelial functionality while triggering immune responses, with IFN-γ and IL-10 signaling activation acting as critical regulators of immune balance and tissue homeostasis. Beyond enterocytes, viral genes were detected in various other cell types. Further experiments confirmed that PEDV could initiate replication in B and T lymphocytes but was unable to produce infectious progeny, with T cells additionally undergoing virus-induced apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into PEDV tropism, immune evasion, and epithelial repair, revealing complex host-pathogen interactions that shape disease progression and tissue regeneration, thereby contributing to a better understanding of enteric coronavirus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE The persistent circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) poses a major threat to the swine industry, with emerging strains complicating prevention and control efforts. Currently, no effective measures completely prevent virus transmission, highlighting the need to understand PEDV-host interactions. In this study, we isolated a prevalent virulent strain and used single-cell sequencing to identify new PEDV-infected cell types and explore the complex interplay between the host and PEDV. These findings provide essential insights into viral pathogenesis and facilitate the design of targeted antiviral interventions.

        <tr id="Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized ectopic lymphoid clusters of immune cells that develop in non-lymphoid tissue to promote antigen presentation, drive cytotoxic immune responses, and enhance humoral immunity via B cell clonal expansion. Their presence within the tumor microenvironment (TME) correlates with increased patient survival and an improved response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), positioning TLS as potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers. Despite the widespread use of ICIs across various cancers, their effectiveness remains limited in gynecological malignancies, including ovarian cancer (OC), a notably challenging disease characterized by poor responses to both single and combination ICI therapies. Interestingly, the infiltration of T cells into the OC TME is linked to enhanced progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), yet an immunosuppressive TME frequently impedes therapeutic efficacy, suggesting cell activity within localized immune niches can impact antitumor immunity. This review explores the roles of TLS, their maturity, functionality, identification, and related gene signatures; specific immune cells and cytokines that play a role in TLS formation and antitumor response; and other modifiable elements, including gut microbiota, that may drive improving OC survival by leveraging a TLS-driven antitumor response to bolster immunotherapy outcomes.">

        <tr id="To date, murine sepsis models have failed to recapitulate human acute respiratory distress syndrome, one of the leading complications of human sepsis. We set out to determine if preexisting T cell memory, which is common in human adults and lacking in laboratory mice, could contribute to lung inflammation in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis. After administering an anti-CD3ε activating antibody to C57Bl/6 mice to induce a T cell memory repertoire, we compared the pulmonary immune response to CLP in these “Immune-Educated mice” to responses observed in Uneducated control animals. Compared to Uneducated mice, 24 hours after CLP, Immune-Educated mice had higher alveolar inflammatory cytokine and chemokine concentrations and more pulmonary interstitial macrophages. After 48 hours, the proportion of effector CD4 T cells that produced interferon-gamma was greater in Immune- Educated mice. After 72 hours, there were more alveolar macrophages in the lungs of Educated mice. Separately, we performed adoptive transfer of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells from immunized C57Bl/6J to B6.SJL mice and IFNγ blockade at the time of CLP. Interstitial macrophage recruitment 24 hours post-CLP was more pronounced in mice undergoing adoptive transfer of memory T cells compared to mice that did not undergo adoptive transfer. IFNγ blockade resulted in higher absolute numbers of T cells, memory T cells, and innate cells in the lungs of Educated mice 24 hours post-CLP suggesting that IFNγ is necessary for curbing an overactive immune response in these mice. In conclusion, the presence of memory T cells affects the course of CLP- induced lung inflammation and may provide a model that more closely resembles sepsis- associated lung injury.

Here, we used spatial cell interaction mapping to identify IL-32–expressing CD8+ memory T cells and Tregs as key components of the IDO1/PD-L1 niche in Sri Lankan patients with CL and in patients with distinct forms of dermal leishmaniasis in Brazil and India.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has shown promising clinical efficacy in cancer treatment, but only a subset of patients experience significant therapeutic responses. Tumor cells respond to internal and external stresses, such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the tumor microenvironment. This response helps maintain homeostasis, promoting malignant progression, chemotherapy resistance, and immune escape. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with ICB revealed upregulation of thioredoxin (TXN) expression in the epithelial tissues of LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma) and LUSC (lung squamous cell carcinoma) patients with minimal pathological remission. High TXN expression was also associated with “cold tumors,” characterized by a lack of T cells and low levels of chemokine receptors and immunomodulators. Experimental results showed that TXN was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues, and its knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells. Furthermore, TXN knockdown enhanced T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against these tumor cells, suggesting that TXN contributes to immune escape in NSCLC by promoting tumor cell proliferation and migration while inhibiting immune killing. Notably, TXN knockdown also upregulated CD40 expression, indicating that TXN may regulate immune escape in lung cancer through CD40 modulation.

        <tr id="Dysregulated metabolism of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment leads to immune evasion and tumor progression. As a major cell component in the tumor, the metabolic reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study found that sphingolipid (particularly, sphingosine-1-phosphate or S1P) levels are a clinical indicator for prognosis and immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. S1P primarily derived from TAMs, where NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) plays a key role in controlling the activity of serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in S1P biosynthesis. The S1P produced by NEK2hi TAMs promotes hepatic tumor progression and confers immunotherapy resistance. Targeting S1P synthesis with a NEK2 inhibitor or S1P antagonist disrupted the immunosuppressive function of macrophages, shifted regulatory T cells (Tregs) to TH17 cells, and increased the number and activity of tumor-infiltrating T effectors, thereby enhancing antitumor efficacy in synergy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.">

        <tr id="Background: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to immune suppression observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MDSCs are immature myeloid cells that are hijacked during development and further reprogrammed by the tumor microenvironment (TME) to harbor immune-suppressive properties and inhibit T-cell functions. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, including BRD4, are epigenetic modulators that regulate genes implicated in CLL pathogenesis and TME interactions. Previously, we investigated how the novel BET inhibitor OPN-51107 (OPN5) prevents CLL disease expansion, modulates T-cell immune function, and alters gene expression related to MDSCs. In turn, we hypothesize that BET proteins such as BRD4 regulate MDSC functions, and subsequent pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 will alleviate MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL. Methods: Utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model of CLL, we evaluated BRD4 protein expression in MDSCs derived from the bone marrow of transgenic and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. We then investigated the ex vivo functionality of OPN5-treated MDSCs, expanded from Eµ-TCL1 and WT bone marrow in MDSC-supportive medium. Finally, we conducted an in vivo study utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 adoptive transfer mouse model to determine the in vivo effects of OPN5 on MDSCs and other immune populations. Results: Through the course of this study, we found that MDSCs isolated from Eμ-TCL1 mice upregulate BRD4 expression and are more immune-suppressive than their WT counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrated ex vivo OPN5 treatment reverses the immune-suppressive capacity of MDSCs isolated from leukemic mice, evident via enhanced T-cell proliferation and IFNγ production. Finally, we showed in vivo OPN5 treatment slows CLL disease progression and modulates immune cell populations, including MDSCs. Conclusions: Altogether, these data support BET inhibition as a useful therapeutic approach to reverse MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL.">

        <tr id="Exploiting the immune system to eradicate cancer cells is an area of intense clinical study. However, the mechanisms that shape the tumor-immune microenvironment are incompletely understood. Here, we identify Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins as novel modulators of the tumor-immune microenvironment across diverse cancers. We demonstrate that loss of tumor MBNL expression results in an attenuated response to interferon gamma and reduced tumor antigen presentation in melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer cells. Parallel experiments in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model revealed that MBNL loss reduces tumor cell killing by CD8 + T cells in vitro and facilitates tumor escape from cytotoxic CD8 + T cell infiltration in vivo. Finally, we extended these studies to 29 human cancer types to find that MBNL expression levels are strongly associated with gene expression signatures of T cell tumor infiltration. These insights suggest that MBNL proteins play important roles in shaping the immune landscape across diverse malignancies.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Cellular senescence within the TME, characterized by irreversible growth arrest and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), profoundly impacts tumor biology and immunotherapy efficacy. The senescent TME promotes tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis through complex interactions between senescent cells, SASP factors, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Simultaneously, senescence-induced alterations in immune cell function, including T cell exhaustion, macrophage polarization, and impaired natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, contribute to an immunosuppressive niche that hinders immunosurveillance and fosters tumor immune evasion. Mounting evidence suggests that the senescent TME is a critical mediator of resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Senescence-associated changes in the TME dampen antitumor immunity by reducing CD8+ T cell infiltration and functionality while promoting the accumulation of immunosuppressive cell populations such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Consequently, strategies targeting the senescent TME have emerged as promising approaches to enhance ICI efficacy. Senolytic agents, SASP inhibitors, and combinatorial therapies aimed at eliminating senescent cells, modulating SASP, and reprogramming the immunosuppressive TME have shown potential in preclinical models to sensitize tumors to immunotherapy. As our understanding of the senescent TME evolves, it is becoming increasingly clear that a multifaceted approach integrating TME-targeted interventions with immunotherapy is necessary to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying senescence-driven immunotherapy resistance, identifying robust biomarkers to predict treatment response, and developing novel therapeutic strategies that synergize with ICIs. By harnessing the potential of TME-targeted approaches, we can expand the scope and efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, ultimately leading to improved survival and quality of life for cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC), a leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits profound molecular heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) features that limit therapeutic efficacy. This review elucidates the dual roles of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in GC progression. TLS, ectopic lymphoid organs formed under chronic inflammation, correlate with improved survival and immunotherapy sensitivity by fostering effector T/B cell interactions and antigen presentation. Conversely, immunosuppressive TME components like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) drive immune evasion via cytokine-mediated suppression and checkpoint activation (PD-1/PD-L1). CD8+ T cells exert context-dependent effects, with high infiltration reducing recurrence risk but paradoxically inducing exhaustion in PD-L1-rich microenvironments. Th17 and memory T cells further modulate disease through IL-17-driven angiogenesis and CD45RO+ immune memory dynamics. Multi-omics-based TLS scoring and combinatorial therapies emerge as promising strategies to overcome resistance.">

        <tr id="Introduction Lymphopenia induced by radiotherapy or chemotherapy can promote homeostatic proliferation of residual or adoptive lymphocytes, potentially enhancing antitumor immunity. However, this immunity diminishes rapidly with tumor progression, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the role of PD-1 signaling in homeostatic proliferation–induced antitumor immunity in malignant melanoma. Methods We evaluated T-cell dynamics in lymphopenic mice, analyzing PD-1 expression, IFN-γ production by CD8+ T cells, and T-cell cytotoxicity during homeostatic proliferation. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis was blocked using anti-PD-1 antibodies to assess its impact on T-cell function, dendritic cell (DC) activation, and memory T-cell differentiation. Results Although T cells proliferated continuously in lymphopenic mice, IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells declined over time. PD-1 expression on T cells increased progressively and correlated negatively with effector T-cell cytotoxicity. PD-1 blockade enhanced the recognition of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by homeostatically proliferating (HP) T cells, activated DCs, and increased IFN-γ+ CD8+ T-cell numbers. Additionally, it boosted T-cell cytotoxicity and promoted the conversion of tumor-specific effector T cells into central memory T cells. Discussion These findings indicate that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis plays a critical role in immune tolerance during homeostatic proliferation. Anti-PD-1 therapy may enhance antitumor immunity during lymphopenia recovery after chemotherapy or radiotherapy, offering a potential strategy to sustain T-cell–mediated tumor control.">

While hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers are a standard correlate of immunity against influenza, they do not reliably predict protection in high-risk populations. Using multiomic single-cell profiling, we identified a distinct subset of adaptive-like NK cells that respond to influenza antigen, predominantly in younger females. These TNFSF10+LGALS9+ NK cells exhibit features of adaptive NK cells but lack classical cytomegalovirus-driven markers observed in previous studies. Notably, their increased frequency correlates with high pre-existing HAI titers, suggesting a link between adaptive-like NK responses and humoral immunity. Together, our findings identify an NK subset influenced by age and sex that may contribute to influenza protection, expanding the known diversity of adaptive-like NK cells. These insights could inform future vaccine strategies, particularly for aging populations, by integrating NK responses into assessments of vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a systemic host response to infection with life-threatening consequence which ranks among the top ten causes of death worldwide. Nevertheless, our understanding of the molecular and cellular impact of sepsis remains rudimentary. Methods A mouse sepsis model was established through LPS induction and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect T helper 1 (Th1) cell subsets and serum pro-inflammatory cytokines in septic mice. Additionally, in vivo neutralization experiments were conducted to block IFN-γ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, to explore the regulatory effect of DOCK2 on septic mice. Finally, the regulatory mechanism of DOCK2 was analyzed using an in vivo RNA-seq system. Results We identified dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a critical downregulating factor for LPS signal pathways. DOCK2-deficient mice were highly sensitive to LPS-induced sepsis and E. coli sepsis with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-γ which were mainly due to hyperresponsive Th1 cells. Ulteriorly, we verified the vital role of DOCK2-mediated Th1 cells in sepsis by neutralizing both IFN-γ and CD4 and found both of which blockade reduced the severity of sepsis in Dock2−/− mice. Mechanically, DOCK2-mediated cell cycle progression and cytokine signaling act in concert to govern peripheral Th1 cell fate. Conclusion Our data indicates that DOCK2 acts as a protective role in regulating systemic inflammation and multi-organ injury in bacterial sepsis by constraining Th1 response. These findings provide new targets for immunomodulatory therapy of sepsis, suggesting that targeting the DOCK2-Th1 axis may become a new strategy to improve systemic inflammatory responses associated with bacterial infections.">

        <tr id="Despite significant advances in cancer biology research and treatment, clinical outcomes for patients with liver cancer remain unsatisfactory. The biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the bidirectional signaling between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), which promotes tumor progression in the liver, remain to be elucidated. Fibroblasts are crucial regulators of tumor progression and response to therapy; however, our understanding of their roles remains limited. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic data of pan-liver cancers to characterize the different subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). siRNA transfection was used for knockdown the expression of LAMA4. Western blot assay was used for gene expression analysis. Flow cytometry was used to detect proliferation, toxicity and cytolytic capacity of CD8+ T cells. To establish a spontaneous murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model, a combined DEN and CCL4 approach was performed. Notably, we identified CD90+ extracellular matrix CAFs (eCAFs) associated with poor prognosis. These CD90+ eCAFs, located distal to the tumor nest, overlapped with the distribution of CD8+ T cells. Functional experiments demonstrated that CD90+ eCAFs recruited CD8+ T cells and inhibited their function through secretion of LAMA4. Further investigation revealed that LAMA4 induced the CD8+ T cell senescence through a DNA damage signaling pathway mediated by the receptor ITGA6. In a mouse model of spontaneous HCC, targeting LAMA4 can inhibit the progression of malignant transformation and synergize with anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study reveals the function of specific CAFs subtypes and highlights the importance of interactions with the immune system.

        <tr id="Recombinant interferon alpha (IFNα) has been used to treat cancer patients for over 30 years; however, its clinical utility has been limited by a narrow therapeutic index. Given the recognized anti-tumor and immunomodulatory impacts of IFNα, the development of novel strategies to harness these attributes while minimizing associated toxicity could provide significant benefit for patients. The concept of attenuating IFNα binding affinity for its receptor was conceived to address this challenge and led to the development of CD38-targeted Attenukine™, a CD38-targeted antibody attenuated IFNα immunocytokine. In this study, we sought to delineate the effects of targeting AttenukineTM specifically to tumor cells and/or immune cells using an antibody to CD38, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on certain tumor and immune cells, using different mouse models and anti-human or anti-mouse CD38-targeted Attenukine™. Our results demonstrate that an anti-human CD38 AttenukineTM inhibits tumor growth through direct anti-proliferative effects of IFNα on CD38 + tumor cells as well as by indirectly modulating the anti-tumor immune response. In various in vivo models leveraging syngeneic mice bearing tumors with or without CD38 expression, administration of CD38-murine AttenukineTM mediated anti-tumor efficacy with increased immune activation and intra-tumoral infiltration. These data point to a potential dual mechanism of action for CD38-targeted Attenukine™, involving both tumor- and immune-directed effects, and highlight the potential benefit of a CD38-targeted attenuated IFNα therapy to deliver the known effects of IFNαtreatment to a broad spectrum of patients, while limiting the toxicity typically associated with recombinant IFNα.">

        <tr id="Background Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a severe complication in lung cancer, characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and limited therapeutic options. This study investigates the role of IL-6 in regulating immune suppression and tumor progression in MPE and evaluates the efficacy of dual IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade. Methods IL-6 levels were measured in MPE and paired serum samples from lung cancer patients, and correlations with PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes were analyzed using publicly available datasets. RNA sequencing and immune deconvolution were used to assess immune cell infiltration. CAFs and immune cell infiltration were further evaluated using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and multiplex immunofluorescence. In vitro co-culture systems were employed to simulate the MPE microenvironment and explore IL-6 interactions with CAFs, as well as its regulatory effect on tumor cell PD-L1 expression. Results IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in MPE compared to paired serum and correlated with higher PD-L1 expression and poor survival outcomes in lung cancer patients. In the MPE mouse model, combination therapy with IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade reduced MPE volume, tumor burden, and PD-L1 expression, while enhancing T cell infiltration and alleviating TME immunosuppression. IL-6 was found to drive a positive feedback loop with iCAFs, promoting an immunosuppressive environment. In vitro, IL-6 from the MPE upregulated tumor cell PD-L1 expression the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Conclusion This study identifies IL-6 as a critical contributor of immune suppression and tumor progression in MPE. The combination of IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade effectively alleviated immunosuppression and reduced tumor burden, offering a potential therapeutic approach for MPE management.

        <tr id="Rationale: mRNA cancer vaccines show great promise for tumor therapy, but the therapeutic efficacy is limited. Metabolites play critical roles in immunomodulation. However, their role in mRNA cancer vaccines remains poorly understood. Methods: Metabolome analysis and single-cell RNA sequence were performed to explore the most important metabolite and its source cell. B16-F10-OVA-bearing wide-type and Irg1-depleted C57BL/6 mice were treated with OVA-LNP, OVA&si-Irg1-LNP, or anti-PD-1 antibody to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Flow cytometry analysis was used to examine the immune cells within the lymph nodes, spleens, and the tumor immune environment. Results: We found that macrophage-derived itaconate was increased markedly in activated ipsilateral lymph nodes after ovalbumin-encoding mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (OVA-LNP) injection, compared to homeostatic contralateral lymph nodes. Depleting the immune-responsive gene 1(Irg1), which encodes the itaconate-production enzyme aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1), in macrophages improved dendritic cell antigen presentation and enhances T cell function. Combining Irg1 knockdown via small interfering RNA (siRNA) with OVA mRNA in LNPs augmented the therapeutic efficacy of mRNA cancer vaccines, both as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a link between itaconate and mRNA cancer vaccines, suggesting that targeting Irg1 via siRNA-LNP could be a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of mRNA cancer vaccines.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy, remains incurable and is highly prone to relapse. Immunosuppressive cells in the bone marrow environment inhibit endogenous T-lymphocytes activity and reduce the efficacy immunotherapies. Abnormal bone marrow monocytes in MM have been associated with inferior outcomes. This study explored the mechanism of T-lymphocytes suppression by bone marrow CD14+ monocytes in MM. Methods Single-cell RNA sequence data (GSE124310) derived from MM samples were analyzed. CD14+ monocytes from the bone marrow of patients with newly-diagnosed MM were detected, and RNA sequencing was performed. Interactions between CD14+ monocytes and T-lymphocytes, as along with the corresponding downstream signaling mechanism, were assessed through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results The alterations in MHC II signaling related to outgoing interaction were decreased in CD14 + monocytes from patients with MM. Abnormal numbers, defective antigen presentation, and downregulated surface co-stimulatory molecules in bone marrow CD14+ monocytes were also observed. RNA sequencing identified upregulated expression of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2 (ULK2) in these monocytes, a protein involved in the antigen processing and presentation pathway. CD14+ monocytes from patients with NDMM suppressed T-lymphocyte activity, and treatment of CD14+ monocytes with a ULK1/ULK2 inhibitor alleviated this suppression. MM xenograft model showed that CD14+ monocytes high-expressing ULK2 suppressed T-lymphocytes and promoted tumor growth. Conclusion We demonstrated that CD14+ monocytes from MM can disrupt the delivery of antigenic peptides through the antigen processing and presentation pathway. This disruption affects T-lymphocytes activity and attenuates their ability to kill malignant cells and secrete cytokines. These findings lay the foundation for understanding the immuno-suppressive environment in MM, improving the efficacy of immunotherapy based on T-lymphocytes, and developing new therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review highlights the role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options. TAMs, which constitute a substantial portion of the TME, exhibit high phenotypic plasticity and dynamically shift between pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive states. GBM exploits this plasticity to drive tumor growth by inducing TAM polarization toward the immunosuppressive phenotype through mechanisms involving cytokine secretion, immune checkpoint pathways, and metabolic interactions. This polarization contributes to immune evasion, tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs include depletion, reprogramming toward the pro-inflammatory phenotype, and inhibiting pro-tumor signals. Several approaches are under investigation, such as blocking CSF-1R, disrupting CCL2/CCR2 and PI3K pathways, targeting PD-L1 expression, and utilizing nanoparticle-based delivery systems for selective TAM modulation. Further research targeting TAM plasticity and polarization is essential for developing treatments that overcome GBM’s robust immunosuppressive TME and improve patient survival.">

        <tr id="Introduction Aberrant interaction between innate immune and adaptive immune cells can disrupt tissue homeostasis, consequently triggering chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontitis (PD). Pro-inflammatory macrophages serve as critical mediators in the early immune response, constituting a major population of CD80+ cells, while anti-inflammatory macrophages modulating inflammatory processes through the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). This cytokine facilitates the differentiation of peripheral regulatory T cells (Tregs) and contributes to the establishment of immune tolerance. However, there are no definitive therapies to reshape the tissue homeostasis between innate immune and adaptive immune cells. Methods (1) anti-CD80-MTX-EVs was obtained by gradient centrifugation, which were characterized by TEM and DLS, and the associated membrane proteins were identified by Western Blot. (2) The mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were co-cultured separately with EVs, anti-CD80-EVs, and anti-CD80-MTX-EVs in vitro, and the expression of CD80 on the macrophages surface as well as the proportion of Treg cell generation were detected. (3) EVs, anti-CD80-EVs and anti-CD80-MTX-EVs were injected into mice models of arthritis and periodontitis for treatment, the therapeutic effect was evaluated by the expressions of related cytokines, staining of HE, the proportion of CD80+ macrophages and the phenotypic differentiation of T cells in the tissues. Results We successfully constructed engineered EVs (anti-CD80-MTX-EVs) targeting inflammatory macrophages for intracellular MTX delivering, which inducing the anti-inflammatory transformation while upregulating the expression of TGF-β of macrophages. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that anti-CD80-MTX-EVs effectively reduce CD80+ macrophage levels, promote Treg cell generation, and inhibit Th1 cell production in vivo. Conclusion In this study, the anti-CD80-MTX-Evs demonstrated significant therapeutic effects in both rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis models through a triple mechanism: reducing CD80+ macrophage population, enhancing Treg cell differentiation, and suppressing Th1 cell development. Overall, this study presents an innovative strategy for resolving inflammation within chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Individuals with underlying chronic inflammatory conditions are prone to increased morbidity when posed with an additional inflammatory challenge such as an injury or infection, but why this occurs remains unclear. Herein, we address this question in mouse models by demonstrating that chronic inflammation results in a pronounced expansion of circulating immature neutrophils that exhibit dysregulated effector functions as determined by single cell RNA sequencing and ex vivo functional assays. We show that these immature neutrophils are associated with and contribute to increased immunopathology in response to a new inflammatory challenge. Blocking the migration or function of these immature neutrophils through the administration of therapeutic antibodies or small molecules, profoundly lowers the immunopathology caused by the inflammatory challenge. Together, these studies establish a causal link between immature neutrophils and increased immunopathology, while also providing insights into new therapeutic strategies for treating individuals with chronic inflammatory ailments.">

The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) contains a substantial part of the HIV reservoir and its immunophysiology could be especially conducive for HIV persistence and reactivation. However, the exact cellular microenvironment and molecular mechanisms that govern the renewal of provirus-harboring cells and proviral reactivation in the GIT remain unclear. In this review, we outline the evidence supporting an overarching hypothesis that interferon activity driven by specialized enterocytes creates a microenvironment that fosters proliferation of latently infected CD4+ T cells and sporadic HIV reactivation from these cells. First, we describe unique immunologic features of the gastrointestinal associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), specifically highlighting IFN activity in specialized enterocytes and potential interactions between these cells and neighboring HIV susceptible cells. Then, we will describe dysregulation of IFN signaling in HIV infection and how IFN dysregulation in the GALT may contribute to the persistence and reactivation of the latent HIV reservoir. Finally, we will speculate on the clinical implications of this hypothesis for HIV cure strategies and outline the next steps.">

        <tr id="Aim: Mutations in key regulators of apoptosis have necessitated exploring the alternative cell death pathways like necroptosis in breast cancer (BC). Necroptosis is immunogenic due to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into extracellular environment, which can trigger pro- or anti-tumor immune responses. Inducing necroptosis in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC cells leads to the release of DAMPs, which can influence macrophages polarisation within the tumor microenvironment. The study aims to identify and characterize the DAMPs released from ER+ BC cells after necroptosis induction and to investigate their effects on macrophage properties. Methods: Necroptosis was induced by treating T-47D cells with Z-VAD-FMK and TNF-α (24 hours). The culture medium was collected as induction medium (IM). Necrostatin-1 alongside Z-VAD-FMK and TNF-α was added to inhibit necroptosis, the culture medium was collected as inhibition medium (InM) and used as a negative control for necroptosis. IM also referred as conditioned medium (CM), was analyzed using LC-MS/MS for the identification of DAMPs. THP-1 macrophages were incubated with the CM (24 hours), and their differentiation into M1 or M2 subtypes was assessed using qPCR, by evaluating the expression of specific M1 and M2 markers. Results: A total of 35 unique proteins with potential DAMP activity were identified in the IM. Functional and pathway analyses using PANTHER and DAVID revealed their involvement in immune regulation, metabolism, stress responses, and key pathways such as glycolysis, signaling, and inflammation. These proteins were primarily intracellular or secretory and included cytoskeletal components, chaperones, and binding modulators. Furthermore, IM treatment promoted THP-1 monocyte differentiation into both M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes. Conclusions: These findings highlight the role of necroptosis in generating DAMPs, which can modulate macrophage differentiation within the BC microenvironment. The identified DAMPs hold potential for further investigation as prognostic or predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets in future studies.">

This study compared the immunomodulatory effects of alpha-emitting (225Ac) and beta-emitting (177Lu) radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT) using NM600 in murine prostate cancer models. Methods We assessed immunological changes in TRAMP-C1 and Myc-CaP tumor models treated with 225Ac-NM600 or 177Lu-NM600. Flow cytometry was used to profile immune cell populations, activation markers, and checkpoint molecules, while multiplex assays analyzed cytokine and chemokine expression. Results In general, 225Ac-NM600 elicited stronger immunomodulatory effects than 177Lu-NM600, including cell line dependent increased CD8/Treg ratios, activation of effector and memory T cells, and depletion of suppressive Tregs and MDSCs. The treatment elevated Th1 cytokines, pro-inflammatory chemokines, and checkpoint molecules like PD-1 on CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 on MDSCs, creating a more “hot” TME. Conclusion Alpha-emitting 225Ac-NM600 demonstrated superior ability to enhance antitumor immunity compared to beta-emitting 177Lu-NM600. These findings support the use of 225Ac-NM600 in combination with immunotherapies for advanced prostate cancer treatment.">

However, it is unclear whether prolonged activation of BCL10 within tumors lead to T cell exhaustion and suppress immune responses against cancer. Methods In this study, through multi-layered bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification, the role of BCL10 on immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment was systematically investigated. The correlation between BCL10 expression and infiltrated immune cells was analyzed by immune algorithms such as xCELL, CIBERSORT, QUANTISEQ and MCPcounter using TCGA and GTEx databases. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing data of the cervical squamous cell carcinoma(CESC)microenvironment were analyzed using the GEO database. Moreover, an implanted CESC mice model was established, in which the expression and correlation of BCL10, NF-κB, and PD-1 in CD8+ T cells, as well as the proliferation and apoptosis of CD8+ T cells, were analyzed. Results In silico analysis revealed that the upregulation of BCL10 in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) was correlation with decreased infiltration of CD8+T cells, CD4+Th1 cells and NK T cells, and increased infiltration of Treg cells and CD4+Th2 cells in most tumors including CESC. In implanted CESC mice model, BCL10 expression was found upregulated in CD8+T cells, consequently activating the NF-κB signaling, and leading to upregulation of PD-1 expression, inhibiting proliferation of CD8+T cells, and promoting apoptosis of CD8+T cells. Conclusions BCL10 is closely associated with immunosuppression across various tumor types. In CESC, chronic stimulation and over-activation by tumor antigens result in exhaustion of CD8+ T cells through the over-activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and upregulation of PD-1 expression.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The immune system maintains homeostasis by balancing activating and inhibitory signals. CD300a is an inhibitory receptor predominantly expressed on various immune cells, including mast cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and NK cells. By recruiting phosphatases such as SHP-1, CD300a attenuates immune activation by suppressing key signaling pathways like TLR-MyD88 and FcεRI-mediated signaling. Recent studies suggest that tumors may exploit this inhibitory pathway to evade anti-tumor immune responses, for example by reducing type I interferon production or impairing NK cell cytotoxicity. This review highlights the immunoregulatory functions of CD300a and discusses its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.">

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in combating the influenza A virus (IAV) by initiating adaptive immune responses. However, the impact of ID on DCs and their response to IAV infection remain unclear. This study showed that ID impairs the antigen‐presenting ability of DCs, thereby hindering their capacity to mediate T‐cell proliferation and clear viruses. The restrictive effects of ID on DCs begin in the bone marrow and specifically affect the monocyte DC progenitor (MDP) stage. A reduction in the number of MDPs and compromised immune potential lead to a decrease in the population and functionality of DCs in the subsequent common DC precursor (CDP) stage in the blood, spleen, and lungs. This study highlights the previously unrecognized impact of ID on DCs and provides valuable insights into immune cell responses and the application of iron supplementation in the fight against viral infections.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor resistance is the primary reason for treatment failure in patients with cancer, while oncolytic viruses (OVs), as a novel therapy, have been rapidly advancing through clinical evaluation and are typically assessed in recurrent tumors that are refractory to standard chemotherapy. However, whether the adaptive process that fosters chemotherapy resistance influences the efficacy of OV therapy is unknown. Methods We analyzed chemo-resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) using in vitro, in vivo, and patient-derived organoid models to assess sensitivity to OVs. Through RNA sequencing analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed in clinical samples that indicated TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) expression. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and in vivo neutralization assays to demonstrate that the combination of TBK1 inhibitor (TBK1i) and OVs reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment, particularly by activating natural killer (NK) cells. Through RNA sequencing analysis, we identified intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as a potential target responsible for NK cell activation. Subsequently, we designed and conducted rescue experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, to validate the influence of ICAM-1 on NK cell activity. Results We demonstrated that chemo-resistant CRC showed decreased sensitivity to the OV in vitro, in vivo, and patient-derived organoids. Further investigation revealed aberrant activation of TBK1 in chemo-resistant CRC, which mediated the activation of the type I interferon pathway and impaired viral replication. TBK1 inhibition enhanced intratumor viral replication and direct oncolysis effect in vitro and augmented the antitumor immunity elicited by OVs in vivo. Immune cell profiles presented that OV/TBK1i combination reshaped the tumor microenvironment and especially activated the NK cell response. Immune cell depletion studies demonstrated that NK cells were required for the synergistic therapeutic activity of the OV/TBK1i combination. Mechanistically, TBK1 inhibition synergized with VSVΔ51 to increase ICAM1 expression in a RIPK1-dependent manner, promoting NK cell-mediated tumor killing. Conclusion This study presents a promising approach for treating chemo-resistant CRC by combining OVs and TBK1i.">

        <tr id="Background PERP may have the potential to function as an oncogene. However, the precise function, prognostic value, and predictive significance remain shrouded in ambiguity. Methods We conducted an in-depth analysis using pan-cancer RNA sequencing data and various online web tools to investigate the correlation between PERP and crucial clinical outcomes such as prognosis, tumor microenvironment, and tumor metabolism. In addition, we explored the tumor-promoting role of PERP and its potential mechanisms through models such as immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, cell proliferation assays, wound healing assays, cell migration assays, mass spectrometry analysis and isotope tracing. Further in vivo models confirmed the functional consistency of PERP across pan-cancer. Finally, we analyzed the potential of PERP as a predictive factor for immunotherapy sensitivity in a clinical cohort. Results PERP exhibits elevated expression in the majority of cancer types and impedes immune cell infiltration as well as immune checkpoint reactivity in pan-cancer. We confirmed that PERP can promote tumor progression by tumor cell proliferation, scratch and transwell experiments. Meanwhile, the absence of PERP restricts the flux of 13C6-glucose into glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Importantly, the deficiency of PERP enhances the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of PD1 monoclonal antibodies. In addition, low PERP expression is highly correlated with the response of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients to immunotherapy. Conclusions PERP represents a promising predictive/diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HNSCC patients.

        <tr id="Background Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. Tumor-secreted proteins foster an immunosuppressive environment, enabling immune evasion and reducing the effectiveness of antitumor immunity. Interleukin (IL)-10, an immune-regulatory cytokine, is upregulated in breast cancer (BRCA), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methods In silico analysis was used to identify candidate genes associated with IL-10 expression. Mouse model of BRCA and in vitro co-culture assays were conducted to identify immune cells responsible for IL-10 upregulation. The efficacy of galectin-3 (Gal-3) inhibition combined with chemotherapy was also evaluated. Results Tumor-secreted Gal-3 served as a key immunosuppressive factor in BRCA. Gal-3 promoted IL-10 production in B cells, thus impairing antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, Gal-3 triggered CD45 polymerization, reducing its phosphatase activity and subsequently activating STAT3 to promote IL-10 production. Knockdown of STAT3 or its blockade abrogated Gal-3-induced IL-10 upregulation. Furthermore, Gal-3 inhibition combined with chemotherapy significantly reduced tumor growth and enhanced antitumor immunity. Conclusions Gal-3 is a crucial regulator of immune evasion in BRCA. Targeting Gal-3 may improve the efficacy of BRCA therapies.">

This review summarizes recent studies in understanding tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) biology, highlighting CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) as pivotal regulators of immune surveillance and suppression. We summarize emerging biomarkers such as TCR clonality, spatial distribution of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and exhaustion markers including PD-1, TCF1, and TIM-3, which predict immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy beyond PD-L1 expression. This review specifically describes radiotherapy-induced immunogenic remodeling and peripheral T cell dynamics as innovative strategies to monitor immune response and resistance mechanisms. By integrating results from single-cell omics and AI-driven spatial analysis, we propose multidimensional frameworks of TIL in NSCLC to overcome resistance and optimize immunotherapy combinations.

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) includes a uniquely regulated immune response that supports homeostasis, response to injury, and response to pathogens. Recent work has shown that virus-associated immune responses in the CNS may contribute to neuronal injury and long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive decline. However, the fundamental mechanisms that regulate acute infiltration of immune cells from vascular compartments into the CNS are not well defined. Using an attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC83 (referred to as TC83) to inoculate using olfactory and intracranial injections, we show that infection in the CNS and olfactory pathways results in rapid infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as early as 3- and 5-days post-infection. CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells exhibit a bystander, memory phenotype (CD49d+, Tbet+, NKG2D+, Eomes+), are cytotoxic, and are recruited independent of antigen specific responses. We show that infiltration of CD8+ bystander T-cells is supported by microglia and infiltrating macrophage expression of IL-15 and interferon expression in the CNS. These innate antiviral immune signals support activation of bystander CD8+ T-cells in the CNS that contribute to tissue injury independent of virus replication at early time points post-infection. These data support a mechanism by IL-15 stimulates bystander memory CD8+ T-cells to enter the CNS and contribute to injury independent of antigen-specific stimulation. Importance Prior studies have shown that virus infections in the respiratory and olfactory nerve pathways can result in long term injury in the brain. However, the mechanisms that link virus infection in the olfactory neurons and brain injury are not understood. We show that virus infection of olfactory neurons results in immune stimulation in the brain of resident immune cells to release a cytokine called IL-15 and interferon. This results in infiltration and activation of non-specific T-cells that cause injury of neurons in the brain. This may be an important mechanism by which respiratory viruses and other viruses cause inflammation and injury in the brain.">

        <tr id="The roles of circulating complement C3, produced in hepatocytes, in immune defense are well defined in the literature. Interestingly, the C3 gene evolved before the circulatory system, suggesting an essential but yet unknown role of locally produced C3. Here, we investigated the effect of C3 on cancer immunotherapy and found that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived C3, not hepatocyte-derived C3, determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Tumors developed in CAF-specific C3 knockout mice exhibited resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, with increased immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, the C3 degradation product iC3b suppressed myeloid cell infiltration via complement receptor 3 signaling, and the therapeutic targeting of this pathway restored ICB sensitivity of immunotherapy-resistant tumors. In human cancers, stromal C3 expression correlates with reduced M2-like macrophage infiltration and improved immunotherapeutic outcomes. These data demonstrate the role of locally produced C3 in the innate immune response, which may have been conserved across many organisms.">

        <tr id="Aging leads to a gradual decline in immune function, termed immunosenescence, which significantly elevates the susceptibility to infections, cancers, and other aging-related diseases. Recent advancements have shed light on the molecular underpinnings of immune aging and pioneered novel therapeutic interventions to counteract its effects.

This review systematically summarizes recent discoveries on how MSCs counteract immune aging, particularly their ability to rejuvenate aged immune cells and restore immune homeostasis. It also addresses key challenges, such as variations in MSC sources, donor variability, and the lack of standardized protocols, while proposing future directions to enhance therapeutic precision. Although preclinical and clinical studies highlight the potential of MSC-based strategies for delaying immunosenescence, critical issues remain unresolved, including long-term safety and efficacy, optimizing cell delivery systems, and elucidating context-specific mechanisms. Addressing these challenges will accelerate the development of MSC-based therapies to combat aging-associated immune decline.">

        <tr id="Innate immune memory, also called trained immunity, is a metabolic and epigenetically regulated process that enables innate immune cells to recalibrate their inflammatory reactivity in response to pathogenic or endogenous stimuli. In addition to its function in host defense, trained immunity contributes to diverse immune-mediated diseases. We discovered that complement component 1q (C1q) is an effective modulator of innate immune memory, potently suppressing the responsiveness of myeloid cells. We found that C1q leads to profound reprogramming of myeloid cell metabolism, particularly glycolysis, and exerts control over the transcriptional regulation of important metabolic and inflammatory genes. We corroborate our findings by identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms close to the C1q gene that are linked to induction of trained immunity by Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) or beta-glucan in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results reveal an immunomodulatory role for C1q and provide evidence of a molecular interaction between the complement system and innate immune memory.

        <tr id="Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest primary brain tumor in adults, where current therapies fail to meaningfully extend survival. Available animal GBM tumor models, especially therapy-resistant and recurrent ones with unique immunological aspects, are restricted, impeding innovative treatment research. To confront this critical obstacle we established a unique GBM mouse model that utilizes patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) within humanized mice. Methods We selected two immune-deficient mouse models to facilitate the reconstitution of myeloid lineage cells. After undergoing myeloablation, mice received CD34+ hematopoietic stem progenitor cells derived from human umbilical cord blood for humanization. Upon confirming the reconstitution of human blood cells, mice were xenografted with PDXs resistant to radiation. Tumor profiles and immune cell infiltration were analyzed via flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The findings were evaluated against scRNA-seq data from recurrent human GBM. Results A diverse range of human immune cells, including T, NK, and myeloid lineage cells, infiltrated PDX tumors in humanized mice. Notably, gene expression profiles in these immune cells resembled that of recurrent human GBM. Unlike conventional xenograft models, this model highlighted enhanced tumor diversity, particularly a high fraction of neural progenitor-like cells. Conclusions Our humanized GBM mouse model displayed an immune cell signature similar to recurrent GBM. This model is a valuable resource for analyzing the tumor immune landscape and assessing new therapies, particularly immunotherapies. By enabling effective evaluation of novel treatments, our model has the potential to significantly advance GBM research. Key Points A wide array of human immune cells infiltrates GBM-PDX tumors in humanized mice. The tumor heterogeneity of GBM-PDX is more evident in humanized mouse xenografts. Importance of the study Current GBM treatment development is primarily constrained by the absence of appropriate animal models that can enhance our understanding of human GBM biology and its immune dynamics. We created a specialized GBM mouse model using humanized mice with patient-derived xenografts resistant to radiation. Detailed immune cell analysis showed various human blood cells in the GBM-PDX derived from humanized mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered crucial T-cell subgroups, notably regulatory and exhausted T cells, which matched those observed in recurrent GBM patient tumors. Moreover, the model outperformed standard xenograft approaches in tumor heterogeneity, resembling the intricate diversity observed in recurrent GBM samples. Our humanized GBM mouse model provides a powerful platform to study the interactions between human tumors and immune cells. This tool will facilitate the discovery of immunosuppressive mechanisms and accelerate the assessment of immunotherapies applicable to various brain tumors.">

        <tr id="Herein, we describe the discovery of a novel immunostimulatory drug conjugate (IMC) that employs TLR7/8 agonists conjugated to a tumor-targeting LIV1 antibody. Targeting TLR7/8 agonists to LIV1-expressing tumors enables localized delivery, thereby minimizing systemic toxicity while promoting inflammation and T cell recruitment within the tumor microenvironment (TME) for enhanced antitumor efficacy. Dual activation of TLR7 and TLR8 within the TME facilitates the recruitment of diverse immune cells and induces a broad spectrum of pro-inflammatory cytokines, effectively reshaping the immunosuppressive TME by upregulating costimulatory molecules. The mechanism of action of the IMC involves tumor recognition via surface antigens and Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis, followed by activation of myeloid cells to efficiently present tumor antigens to T-cells, thereby eliciting antitumor immunity. The designed IMCs demonstrate the ability to activate myeloid cells in the presence of tumor cells, display robust antitumor activity, and are well tolerated in toxicology studies.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer globally and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, following lung cancer. Despite the immune system’s capacity for tumor surveillance and elimination, CRC tumors can evade immune responses through complex mechanisms, ultimately escaping immune detection. T and B lymphocytes play a critical role in adaptive immunity against tumors, with T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, driving tumor elimination. Additionally, B cells contribute by producing tumor-specific antibodies, including various immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses that participate in immune modulation. However, the effectiveness of adaptive immunity in CRC is often limited due to tumor-driven immunosuppression. This study investigates the expression of T and B cell activation genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from CRC patients. A panel of 84 genes involved in T and B cell activation was analyzed to assess changes in expression using RT2 QPCR arrays. Additionally, we measured serum levels of the four IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) in CRC patients to explore possible alterations in humoral immunity. Compared to healthy controls, 5 genes were found to be downregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCL3 (fold regulation − 6.36), IL6 (fold regulation − 12.46), CSF2 (fold regulation − 7.50), CXCR3 (fold regulation − 3.01), and TNFSF14 (fold regulation − 4.90). Moreover, 13 genes were upregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCR3 (fold regulation 59.21), CD2 (fold regulation 3.07), CD27 (fold regulation 6.39), CD3G (fold regulation 4.15), CD8B (fold regulation 3.25), FAS (fold regulation 3.94), IL10 (fold regulation 39), IL18R1 (fold regulation 82.39), IL5 (fold regulation 20.4), LAG3 (fold regulation 19.88), MAP3K7 (fold regulation 4.07), TLR1 (fold regulation 6.45), and TLR6 (fold regulation 18.87). The serum levels of the four IgG subclasses were however statistically insignificant in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. Our findings provide insights into the adaptive immune dysfunction in CRC, offering a detailed profile of gene expression changes associated with T and B cell activation and antibody production. Understanding these dysregulations may enhance the development of targeted immunotherapies, potentially improving outcomes for CRC patients through more personalized immunomodulatory approaches.

        <tr id="Background Immunotherapies targeting the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) have shown great promise for a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, safe and robust combination therapies are still needed to bring the benefit to broader patient populations. Methods we performed in vivo treatment with PD-L1 antibody in Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)-derived murine NSCLC model. Expression of B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) was detected during treatment. We evaluated the effects of the combination of anti-BTLA and anti-PD-L1 mAbs on tumor growth and overall survival of mice. In addition, distribution and function of immune cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The role of BTLA in human and murine CD8+ T cells and its impact on reversing exhausted phenotype of PD-1+CD8+ T cell by PD-L1 blockade were analyzed. Furthermore, we investigated expression and distribution of BTLA on lymphocytes in tumor microenvironment of different specimens from NSCLC patients. Results There was no significant difference overall survival between anti-PD-L1 therapy and IgG in LLC-bearing mice, and BTLA expression was increased on CD8+ T cells after PD-L1 antibody treatment. LLC-bearing mice treated with combination of anti-BTLA and anti-PD-L1 therapy had an improved overall survival than anti-BTLA or anti-PD-L1 alone. Compared to monotherapy with anti-BTLA or anti-PD-L1, mice treated with combination therapy demonstrated increased infiltration of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, as well as increased expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α and Ki-67 in CD8+ T cells. In addition, CD8+ T cells co-expressing BTLA and PD-1 exhibited the most exhausted phenotype to resist PD-L1 blockade therapy. Furthermore, BTLA+CD8+ T cells were abnormally increased in different specimens from NSCLC patients, and CD8+ T cells expressing BTLA in NSCLC microenvironment were correlated with clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC patients. Conclusion Our results show that BTLA and PD-1 cooperatively inhibit the activity of CD8+ T cells and are associated with resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade in NSCLC patients. Anti-BTLA blockade enhances the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. Dual BTLA and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade should be further explored to elicit potent antitumor CD8+ T-cell responses in NSCLC patients.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, which significantly contributes to immune suppression of CD8+ T cells. Our previous research identified that dysregulation of the IRE1α-XBP1s-SLC38A2 axis leads to decreased glutamine uptake and senescence of CD8+ T cells in MM. However, the underlying mechanisms of T-cell senescence remain unclear. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze mitochondrial function in CD8+ T cells in MM. The effects of XBP1s and SLC38A2 on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) were evaluated by flow cytometry under loss-of-function experiments. An IRE1α inhibitor (17#) was administered to explore its effects on T-cell senescence and MM cell growth. RNA sequencing was employed to disclose pathway alterations in T cells treated with 17#. The Vk*MYC mouse model was used to assess the impact of 17# on CD8+ T cell senescence and anti-myeloma effects. Results BM-derived CD8+ T cells from patients with MM exhibited downregulated expressions of genes critical for glutamine transport (SLC38A2), mitochondrial respiratory chain, and ATP synthesis, while genes associated with ROS were upregulated. Suppression of XBP1s in CD8+ T cells resulted in decreased mtROS levels, whereas inhibition of SLC38A2 increased mtROS levels. Compound 17# significantly reduced senescence marker KLRG1 expression and increased perforin expression in nutrient-deprived BM CD8+ T cells from healthy donors and in BM CD8+ T cells from patients with MM, while promoting T-cell proliferation. Importantly, 17# did not impair the viability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors or alter the immune phenotypes of healthy CD8+ T cells. The NPR2-cGMP-PKG pathway was activated by IRE1α inhibition in restoring T-cell function. Furthermore, 17# exhibited direct inhibitory effects on MM cells. In Vk*MYC mouse model, 17# decreased mtROS levels in BM CD8+ T cells, reduced the proportion of senescent (KLRG1+CD57+CD28−) T cells, and resulted in a lower tumor burden. Conclusion Inhibiting IRE1α represents a promising strategy to reverse the senescence of CD8+ T cells by mitigating mtROS production. This dual mechanism not only rejuvenates T cells but also directly targets myeloma cells, offering a novel therapeutic approach for MM treatment.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are a diverse population of immune cells that play a central role in tumor immunity and have emerged as critical mediators in cancer immunotherapy. This review explores the phenotypic and functional diversity of TILs—including CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells—and their dynamic interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). While TILs can drive tumor regression, their activity is often hindered by immune checkpoint signaling, metabolic exhaustion, and stromal exclusion. We highlight TIL recruitment, activation, and polarization mechanisms, focusing on chemokine gradients, endothelial adhesion molecules, and dendritic cell-mediated priming. Special emphasis is placed on preclinical models that evaluate TIL function, including 3D tumor spheroids, organoid co-cultures, syngeneic mouse models, and humanized systems. These provide valuable platforms for optimizing TIL-based therapies. Furthermore, we examine the prognostic and predictive value of TILs across cancer types, their role in adoptive cell therapy, and the challenges of translating preclinical success into clinical efficacy. Emerging technologies such as single-cell sequencing, neoantigen prediction, and biomaterial platforms are transforming our understanding of TIL biology and enhancing their therapeutic potential. Innovative strategies—ranging from genetic engineering and combination therapies to targeted modulation of the TME—are being developed to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve TIL persistence, infiltration, and cytotoxicity. This review integrates current advances in TIL research and therapy, offering a comprehensive foundation for future clinical translation. TILs hold significant promise as both biomarkers and therapeutic agents, and with continued innovation, they are poised to become a cornerstone of personalized cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) typically present with widespread metastasis, obscuring a temporal understanding of tumor-immune dynamics. To address this, we perform multi-site global proteomics alongside matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. We order the protein expression profiles using an unbiased pseudotime analysis, recapitulating clinical observations of metastatic progression, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlates with immune cell infiltration, the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to counterbalance γδ T cell abundance, and an increased abundance of exhausted CD8⁺ T cells. The accumulation of Tregs at metastatic sites correlates with SNX8 expression, a critical regulator of the STING pathway. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruit Tregs via MHC class II, fostering an inflammatory phenotype with limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Together, our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with both localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC.">

        <tr id="Lung metastasis remains a leading cause of cancer mortality, driven not only by primary tumors but crucially by dynamic interactions within the premetastatic niche (PMN). Emerging evidence reveals that organ‐specific PMN formation precedes tumor cell arrival, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to metastatic colonization. Primary tumor‐derived factors interact with lung resident cells, promoting the recruitment of bone marrow‐derived cells and creating a favorable microenvironment for the migrating tumor cells. Despite progress, systematic integration of PMN's multilayered regulatory mechanisms—from mechanism to clinical application remains lacking. The review summarizes recent studies investigating the effects of PMN in the entire process of lung metastasis. Our discussion revolves primarily around extracellular vesicles, extracellular matrix remodeling, proinflammation, immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming. We emphasize the impact of various treatment strategies for primary tumors on the PMN in clinical practice, while also summarizing current diagnostic methods and exploring new therapeutic possibilities in the PMN. Finally, we propose a roadmap for future investigations into the lung PMN, highlighting prioritized research axes that bridge mechanistic discoveries with bench‐to‐bedside translation of PMN‐targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated bone marrow failure (BMF) entails a complex immune landscape. Myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are involved in the development and progression of immune aplastic anemia (AA). We used a murine model of BMF to explore the effects of CSF-1R inhibition on immune pathophysiology. Hematopoiesis, immune cell populations, and gene expression were assessed by flow cytometry, cytokine analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing. CSF-1R inhibition with the small molecule PLX3397 intensified BMF in CByB6F1 mice, enhancing inflammation and macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. This was accompanied by increased leukocyte apoptosis, a reduction in CD11b+ myeloid cells, and worsened animal survival. In contrast, the JAK-inhibitor baricitinib attenuated BMF, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, and decreasing CD8+ T cell infiltration of bone marrow. Single-cell RNA analysis revealed upregulation of M1 signature genes in both murine BMF and also AA human samples. In patients with severe AA, there was a shift towards an M1-like monocyte phenotype, correlating with increased inflammatory cytokine expression and altered MDSC populations. These findings highlight the role of myeloid-derived cells in BMF and suggest that M1 macrophages, with defective MDSC function, contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression. Targeting macrophage polarization or MDSCs offers alternative therapeutic strategies in immune-mediated BMF.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Peripheral blood is frequently used to study the immune response in human uveitis because of the inaccessibility of ocular tissue samples. To determine whether peripheral blood immune cells accurately reflect the intraocular immune response, we compared the T‐cell profiles and antigen‐specific cytokine responses between paired vitreous and peripheral blood samples from patients with sight‐threatening posterior uveitis. Methods We collected paired vitreous and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 24 patients with posterior uveitis. Multi‐parametric flow cytometry was employed to identify surface and intracellular cytokine markers after activation with candidate antigenic peptides [Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) peptides and retinal autoantigens]. Data were analysed through manual gating, unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction (FlowSOM, FlowJo). Results The CD8+/CD4+ ratio in a representative set of seven paired samples was higher in the vitreous than in PBMCs. Vitreous CD4+ and CD8+ cells displayed greater polyfunctional potential (TNFα+IFNγ+IL‐2+ and PMA/ionomycin activation) than PBMCs. Upon antigen‐specific activation in vitro, vitreous CD8+ T cells (but not CD4+ T cells) showed a stronger polyfunctional response than PBMCs against both MTb (in TB‐immunoreactive patients) and retinal autoantigens. Unsupervised clustering identified 15 distinct CD3+ T‐cell metaclusters, each with unique profiles in the vitreous and PBMCs. Significant cluster enrichment was observed among the vitreous infiltrating cells in TB‐immunoreactive cases compared to non‐TB uveitis, but no such enrichment was found among PBMCs in either patient cohort. Conclusion The vitreous T‐cell compartment in this group of uveitis patients was functionally dominated by antigen‐responsive cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and was distinct from the corresponding peripheral blood compartment.">

        <tr id="Background Tumors often evade immune surveillance by limiting T cell infiltration. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells is associated with a favorable response to immunotherapy. While BIN1 is recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment in NSCLC has yet to be fully clarified. Methods To investigate the relationship between BIN1 expression and CD8+T cell infiltration in NSCLC, we performed a comprehensive data analysis utilizing clinical information from NSCLC patients. BIN1 expression levels in NSCLC tissues were evaluated, and their correlation with CD8+T cells infiltration and patient survival outcomes was examined. Loss-of-function strategies targeting BIN1 were applied in syngeneic NSCLC mouse models to assess its functional significance. Tumor growth was monitored, and immune cell populations were analyzed in terms of frequency and functionality through mass cytometry and flow cytometry techniques. Cytokine secretion was profiled using multiplex assays. Additionally, RNA sequencing, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, and molecular docking were employed to confirm direct interactions between BIN1 and cytokine-encoding genes. Finally, the regulatory role of BIN1 in ferroptosis in NSCLC cells were explored using metabolomics analysis, ROS measurement, and MDA detection. Results We observed that BIN1 expression is downregulated in NSCLC tumor tissues, with its reduced expression strongly associated with advanced disease progression and poor prognosis. Bioinformatics analysis of immune infiltration in human NSCLC samples revealed a positive correlation between BIN1 expression in NSCLC tissues and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Furthermore, the prognostic impact of BIN1 on NSCLC patients is strongly linked to the level of CD8+ T cell infiltration. In syngeneic mouse models, the knockout of BIN1 in NSCLC cells significantly inhibited CD8+ T cell infiltration and impaired their cytotoxic function, facilitating tumor immune evasion. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that BIN1 directly interacts with G3BP1, and its knockout stabilizes G3BP1. This, in turn, promotes STAT1 degradation and reduces the secretion of T cell-recruiting chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL5. Finally, our findings reveal that BIN1 influences ferroptosis in NSCLC cells through the G3BP1/STAT1/GSH pathway, thereby regulating NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conclusion This study highlights the crucial role of the BIN1/G3BP1/STAT1/CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte signaling pathway in the progression of NSCLC and its mechanisms of immune evasion. This fundings lay a foundation for the development of BIN1-targeted therapies aimed at improving tumor immunogenicity and transforming immunologically “cold” NSCLC into a more responsive disease.

        <tr id="Despite the significant advances in the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), primary and acquired ICI resistance remains the primary impediment to effective cancer immunotherapy. Residing in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in tumor progression by regulating diverse signaling pathways. Notably, accumulating evidence has confirmed that TAMs interplay with various cellular components within the TME directly or indirectly to maintain the dynamic balance of the M1/M2 ratio and shape an immunosuppressive TME, consequently conferring immune evasion and immunotherapy tolerance. Detailed investigation of the communication network around TAMs could provide potential molecular targets and optimize ICI therapies. In this review, we systematically summarize the latest advances in understanding the origin and functional plasticity of TAMs, with a focus on the key signaling pathways driving macrophage polarization and the diverse stimuli that regulate this dynamic process. Moreover, we elaborate on the intricate interplay between TAMs and other cellular constituents within the TME, that is driving tumor initiation, progression and immune evasion, exploring novel targets for cancer immunotherapy. We further discuss current challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need to decode TAM-TME interactions and translate preclinical findings into clinical breakthroughs. In conclusion, while TAM-targeted therapies hold significant promise for enhancing immunotherapy outcomes, addressing key challenges—such as TAM heterogeneity, context-dependent plasticity, and therapeutic resistance—remains critical to achieving optimal clinical efficacy.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Conventional therapies are frequently limited by tumor heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Dendritic cells (DCs), central to orchestrating antitumor immunity, have become key targets for HCC immunotherapy. This review examines the biological functions of DC subsets (cDC1, cDC2, pDC, and moDC) and their roles in initiating and modulating immune responses against HCC. We detail the mechanisms underlying DC impairment within the TME, including suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Additionally, we discuss novel DC-based therapeutic strategies, such as DC-based vaccines designed to enhance antigen presentation and T cell activation. Combining DC vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockers, demonstrates synergistic effects that can overcome immune evasion and improve clinical outcomes. Despite progress, challenges related to DC subset heterogeneity, TME complexity, and patient variability require the further optimization and personalization of DC-based therapies. Future research should focus on refining these strategies, leveraging advanced technologies like genomic profiling and artificial intelligence, to maximize therapeutic efficacy and revolutionize HCC treatment. By restoring DC function and reprogramming the TME, DC-based immunotherapy holds immense potential to transform the management of HCC and improve patient survival.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the remarkable efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, only a subset of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients respond and many eventually progress, underscoring the need to develop novel combination therapies. The interaction between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex niche including cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), vascular cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Using fate mapping, we previously identified a novel subpopulation of resident vascular stem cells derived from vascular smooth muscle cells, designated AdvSca1-SM (vascular Adventitial location, Stem cell antigen-1 expression, SMooth muscle origin) cells. AdvSca1-SM cells are the predominant cell type responding to vessel wall dysfunction and their selective differentiation to myofibroblasts promotes vascular fibrosis. SMC-to-AdvSca1-SM cell reprogramming is dependent on SMC induction of the transcription factor KLF4, and KLF4 is essential for maintenance of the stem cell phenotype. The function of AdvSca1-SM cells in LUAD tumorigenesis has not been explored. Using an orthotopic immunocompetent mouse model of LUAD, we demonstrate that AdvSca1-SM cells are a major component of lung tumors, significantly contributing to cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Compared to AdvSca1-SM cells, CAFs have altered ECM gene expression with a reduction of a stemness signature. AdvSca1-SM-specific genetic ablation of Klf4 altered their phenotype resulting in inhibition of communication between cancer cells and CAFs, decreases in innate immunosuppressive populations, and increased T cell infiltration into the tumor. Targeting this population may represent a novel strategy to improve the response to immunotherapy.">

While the immune system’s adaptive components, including memory T cells, are critical for recognizing and combating these pathogens, recurrent infections and variable disease outcomes persist. Memory T cells are a key element of long-term immunity, capable of responding swiftly upon re-exposure to pathogens. They play diverse roles, including cross-reactivity to conserved viral epitopes and modulation of inflammatory responses. However, the protective efficacy of these cells is influenced by several factors, including viral evolution, host age, and immune system dynamics. This review explores the dichotomy of memory T cells in respiratory virus infections: their potential to confer robust protection and the limitations that allow for breakthrough infections. Understanding the underlying mechanisms governing the formation, maintenance, and functional deployment of memory T cells in respiratory mucosa is critical for improving immunological interventions. We highlight recent advances in vaccine strategies aimed at bolstering T cell-mediated immunity and discuss the challenges posed by viral immune evasion. Addressing these gaps in knowledge is pivotal for designing effective therapeutics and vaccines to mitigate the global burden of respiratory viruses.">

We found the leukemic stroma cells with high level of TGFβ1 secretion can determine TAMs toward M2-polarized subtype. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that bone marrow stromal cells with specific glycans, reduced bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) levels, in MDS/AML promoted M2-polarized subtype through the secretion of TGFβ1, which elevated PD-L1 expression and thereby impaired CD8+ T cell function.

        <tr id="Background Gastrointestinal (GI) disease/dysfunction persists in people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving suppressive combination anti-retroviral therapy (ART) leading to epithelial barrier breakdown, microbial translocation and systemic inflammation that can drive non-AIDS associated comorbidities. Although epigenetic mechanisms are predicted to drive GI dysfunction, they remain unknown and unaddressed in HIV/SIV infection. The present study investigated genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, and gene expression exclusively in colon epithelial cells (CE) in response to simian immunodeficiency virus infection (SIV) and long-term low-dose delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Methods Using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing, we characterized DNA methylation changes in colonic epithelium (CE) of uninfected controls (n=5) and SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) administered vehicle (VEH/SIV; n=7) or THC (THC/SIV; n=6). Intact jejunum resection segments (~5cm) were collected from sixteen ART treated SIV-infected RMs [(VEH/SIV/ART; n=8) and (THC/SIV/ART; n=8)] to confirm protein expression data identified in the colon of ART-naïve SIV-infected RMs. Transcriptomics data was used to confirm expression of differentially methylated genes. Protein expression of differentially methylated genes and their downstream targets was assessed using Immunofluorescence followed by HALO quantification. Results SIV infection in ART-naïve RMs induced marked hypomethylation throughout promoter-associated CpG islands (paCGIs) in genes related to inflammatory response (NLRP6, cGAS), cellular adhesion (PCDH17, CDH7) and proliferation (WIF1, SFRP1, TERT, and HAND2) in CEs. Moreover, low-dose THC reduced NLRP6 protein expression in CE by hypermethylating the NLRP6 paCGI and blocked polyI:C induced NLRP6 upregulation in vitro. In ART suppressed SIV-infected RMs, significant NLRP6 protein upregulation during acute infection was unaffected by long-term ART administration during chronic infection despite successful plasma and tissue viral suppression. In this group, NLRP6 protein upregulation was associated with significantly increased expression of necroptosis-driving proteins; phosphorylated-RIPK3(Ser199), phosphorylated-MLKL(Thr357/Ser358), and HMGB1. Most strikingly, adding ART to THC-treated SIV-infected RMs effectively reduced NLRP6 and necroptosis-driving protein expression to pre-infection levels. Conclusions We conclude that DNA hypomethylation-assisted NLRP6 upregulation can lead to its constitutively high expression resulting in the activation of necroptosis signaling via the RIPK3/p-MLKL pathway that can eventually drive intestinal epithelial loss/death. From a clinical standpoint, low-dose phytocannabinoids in combination with ART could safely and successfully reduce/reverse persistent GI inflammatory responses via modulating DNA methylation.

        <tr id="Background Ovarian cancer (OC) progression is heavily influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), where immune suppression plays a critical role. This study explores the role of thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) in regulating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), T cell exhaustion, and immune checkpoint expression, as well as its transcriptional regulation by SNF2H. Methods We analyzed THBS1 expression and its clinical significance using publicly available datasets (TCGA-OV, GSE14407) and tissue microarrays containing OC and adjacent normal tissues. In vitro functional studies were conducted using OC cell lines (SKOV3, A2780) and co-cultures with macrophages. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and RNA interference were employed to investigate SNF2H-mediated transcriptional regulation of THBS1. In vivo, the role of THBS1 in immune suppression was validated using mouse tumor models. Results THBS1 was significantly overexpressed in OC tissues and associated with poor prognosis. High levels of THBS1 correlated with increased TAM infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization, and upregulation of immune checkpoints PD-L1 and GAL-3, which contribute to T cell exhaustion. Functional assays demonstrated that THBS1 promotes macrophage recruitment and induces M2 polarization through TGF-β1 and IL-4 signaling. Additionally, ChIP assays identified SNF2H as a transcriptional regulator of THBS1, contributing to its overexpression. In vitro targeting of THBS1 reduced TAM-mediated immune suppression and restored T cell cytotoxicity. Conclusion This study positions THBS1 as a key regulator of the OC TME, linking TAM recruitment and polarization to CD8+ T cell exhaustion via immune checkpoint modulation. By identifying SNF2H as a transcriptional regulator of THBS1, we offer new insights into its epigenetic dysregulation and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to reprogram the TME and improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Neutrophils are the first line of defense in nonspecific immunity (innate immunity) and interact with other immune cells to participate in specific defense mechanisms (adaptive immunity). Studies have shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) mediates tumor development and recruits neutrophils into tumors to become tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), an important part of TME, and achieve extended lifespan. TANs can be differentiated into the antitumor or protumor phenotype, and play an important role in tumor occurrence, proliferation and recurrence, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, cell necrosis, and so on. Here, we summarize the TAN origin and subtypes found through Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in different types of tumors in recent literature, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their antitumor and protumor effects on tumors. We focus on the interaction between TANs and immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory TME, as well as signal pathways such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) associated with TAN phenotype transition. Based on the summarized mechanisms, we focus on the potential application and latest strategies of TAN-based immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and combination therapy in the preclinical study and clinical trials of tumors. The discussion on promising therapy encompasses five key areas: inhibition of the tumor-promoting effect of TANs, enhancement of the antitumor effect of TANs, targeting the interaction between TANs and the TME, reprogramming of TANs, and drug delivery carriers. Finally, we discuss the potential of TANs and their related markers as emerging biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent a promising therapeutic approach in viral infection management. However, their interaction with viruses remains poorly understood. MSCs can support antiviral immune responses and act as viral reservoirs, potentially compromising their therapeutic potential. Innate immune system recognition of viral pathogens involves pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which activate mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). MAVS triggers antiviral pathways like IRF3 and NF-κB, leading to interferon (IFN) production and pro-inflammatory responses. This study explores the antiviral response in umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) through targeted stimulation with influenza A virus-derived 5′triphosphate-RNA (3p-hpRNA), a RIG-I agonist. By investigating MAVS activation, we provide mechanistic insights into the immune response at the molecular level. Our findings reveal that 3p-hpRNA stimulation triggers immune activation of the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways through MAVS. Subsequently, this leads to the induction of type I and III IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Critically, this immune activation occurs without compromising mitochondrial integrity. UC-MSCs retain their capacity for mitochondrial transfer to recipient cells. These results highlight the adaptability of UC-MSCs, offering a nuanced understanding of immune responses balancing activation with metabolic integrity. Finally, our research provides mechanistic evidence for MSC-based interventions against viral infections.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing immune-mediated disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. The underlying causes of IBD are not fully understood, but genetic factors have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, including CTLA-4, an essential negative regulator of T cell activation. However, establishing a direct link between CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 knockout mice. In this study, we identified zebrafish Ctla-4 homolog and investigated its role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by generating a Ctla-4-deficient (ctla-4-/-) zebrafish line. These mutant zebrafish exhibited reduced weight, along with impaired epithelial barrier integrity and lymphocytic infiltration in their intestines. Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation-related genes, disturbing immune system homeostasis. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated increased Th2 cells and interleukin 13 expression, along with decreased innate lymphoid cells and upregulated proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited reduced diversity and an altered composition of the intestinal microbiota. All these phenotypes closely resemble those found in mammalian IBD. Lastly, supplementation with Ctla-4-Ig successfully alleviated intestinal inflammation in these mutants. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the pivotal role of Ctla-4 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Additionally, they offer substantial evidence linking CTLA-4 to IBD and establish a novel zebrafish model for investigating both the pathogenesis and potential treatments.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world and the second cause of death related to cancer. Regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration is enriched in several tumor types including CRC and correlates with suppression of the anti-tumor immune response. In the large intestine, thymic Tregs (tTregs Helios+) and peripheral Tregs (pTregs Helios−) coexist and maintain intestinal homeostasis under steady state conditions. The recruitment of Treg cells to the intestine is orchestrated by the CCR9/CCL25 axis, which is potentiated under inflammatory conditions. Interestingly, the balance between cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and Tregs within the tumor microenvironment is critical for antitumor immunity and cancer progression. An elevated CD8+/Treg ratio has been associated with improved clinical outcomes in various cancers, including CRC. Therefore, here we investigate the potential role of chemokine receptor CCR9 on CD8+/Treg ratio and the effect of the recruitment of Treg subpopulations (Helios+ and Helios−) into the tumor microenvironment using the AOM/DSS induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer murine model. Our findings reveal that CCR9 deficiency leads to distinct alterations in the CRC microenvironment, characterized by decreased intratumoral Tregs Helios+. Also, the lack of the receptor leads to an improvement of the antitumor immune response, increasing the CD8+/Treg ratio within the tumor immune infiltrate. These results underscore the importance of CCR9 in shaping the immune microenvironment during CRC development.">

This study investigates the role of cellular communication network factor 1 (CCN1, also known as Cyr61), an extracellular matrix‐associated protein, in modulating the TME of PDAC. It is demonstrated that Ccn1 promotes PDAC progression by upregulating collagen and chemokine expression, thereby facilitating immune cell exclusion and enhancing tumor growth. Using a Ccn1‐deficient PDAC model, decreased collagen and chemokine levels are observed, resulting in increased infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells and reduced myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Furthermore, Ccn1‐deficient tumors exhibit heightened sensitivity to gemcitabine and show enhanced responsiveness to anti‐programmed cell death 1 (anti‐PD1) therapy. Mechanistically, Ccn1 regulates chemokine production through collagen expression, with chemokine levels remaining suppressed even upon interferon‐gamma treatment in collagen‐deficient cells. These findings highlight Ccn1 as a potential therapeutic target that reprograms the TME to enhance the efficacy of both chemotherapy and immunotherapy in PDAC, providing a novel approach for overcoming immune resistance in PDAC.">

Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is now recognized as a major cause of septic death, and identifying effective strategies to counteract it poses a significant challenge. This immunosuppression results from the disruption of immune homeostasis, characterized by the abnormal death of immune effector cells, hyperproliferation of immune suppressor cells, release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of immune checkpoints. Preclinical studies targeting immunosuppression, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promise in reversing immunocyte dysfunctions and establishing host resistance to pathogens.

        <tr id="Background The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited by heterogeneity in individual responses to therapy. The heterogeneous phenotypes and crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in immunotherapy resistance remain largely unclear. Methods A specific CAF subset was identified by integrating comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and transcriptome profiling of patients with HCC with different responses to antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. Mouse orthotopic HCC models and a coculture system were constructed, and cytometry by time-of-flight analysis was performed to investigate the functions and mechanisms of specific CAFs in the immune context of HCC. Results We identified a distinct flavin-containing monooxygenase 2 (FMO2)+ CAF subset associated with a favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy and better clinical outcomes. FMO2+ CAFs increase anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy by promoting tertiary lymphoid structure formation and increasing the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and M1-like macrophages through the C-C motif chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19)-C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 axis. Mechanistically, FMO2 promotes nuclear factor kappa B/p65-mediated CCL19 expression by competitively binding to glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) with praja ring finger ubiquitin ligase 1 (PJA1), thereby suppressing the PJA1-mediated proteasomal degradation of GYS1. CCL19 treatment potentiated the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in mouse orthotopic HCC models. A favorable immunotherapy response was observed in patients with HCC with high serum levels of CCL19. Conclusions We identified a novel FMO2+ CAF subset that serves as a critical regulator of microenvironmental immune properties and a predictive biomarker of the immunotherapy response in patients with HCC. CCL19 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.">

ICI has shown its effectiveness in many solid tumors, but it lacks activity against “cold” tumors which lack CTL infiltration, including most of the colon, prostate, lung and breast cancers. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) responds to PD-1 blockade only in 5–20% cases. Chemotherapy has been shown to have a PD1-sensitizing effect in a fraction of patients with TNBC but the underlying mechanism and the reasoning behind its limitation to only a subset of patients are unknown. Recent data demonstrate the key roles played by paclitaxel-driven Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and the resulting activation of type-1 and type-2 interferon pathways in tumor-associated macrophages, resulting in local M2 to M1 transition and enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation, in the paclitaxel-driven sensitization of “cold” tumors to ICI. These data and the known ability of the TLR4-activated MyD88-NFκB pathway to mobilize both antitumor and tumor-promoting events in the TME provide new tools to enhance the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy for metastatic, and potentially early, TNBC and other taxane-sensitive cancers.">

        <tr id="Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression heavily relies on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In the ccRCC TME, the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) drive a self-perpetuating cycle of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance through diverse interactions between cells and molecules. Furthermore, heterogeneous CAFs facilitate tumor growth through metabolic reprogramming and modulate immune suppression by driving the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which promote a multilayered immunosuppressive network. In addition, CAFs reshape the mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM), hinder the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and further exacerbate immune escape. Moreover, CAF-derived exosomes can confer resistance to chemoradiation therapy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) secreted by CAFs synergizes with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to facilitate adaptive resistance to targeted therapy. Emerging therapeutic strategies—including fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted CAR-T cells and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) inhibitors—can partially reverse this immunosuppressive property. Combination therapies employing immune checkpoint inhibitors and VEGF antagonists exhibit promising synergistic effects, although the clinical translation remains hampered by CAF heterogeneity, dual functional roles, and the lack of specific biomarkers. Future studies should integrate single-cell sequencing and spatial multi-omics techniques to comprehensively analyze the spatio-temporal dynamic heterogeneity of CAF subpopulations and develop precision treatment strategies based on molecular subtyping, aiming to break the vicious cycle of “CAF-TME-resistance” in ccRCC.">

The specific link between CD2 Associated Protein (CD2AP) expression and the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear, and further exploration is needed to understand its potential role in immune response and as a target for immunotherapy in GC. Utilizing RNA sequencing data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for a pan-cancer analysis, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out to determine the expression pattern and immunological involvement of CD2AP. Systematic association of CD2AP with immunological features within the stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) TME was subsequently performed, encompassing factors like cancer immunity cycles, immune checkpoints, immunomodulators, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs). We found that CD2AP was enhanced expression in the TME of a variety of malignancies. CD2AP contributes to forming a stromal reduced TME in GC and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. It was observed that patients with elevated levels of CD2AP, along with high scores on their CD4, CD20, and CD57 immune markers, tended to experience the most favorable prognosis. Furthermore, an IRS was constructed to accurately assess the prognosis of STAD patients. Since CD2AP was associated with the formation of stromal reduced TME in STAD, the expression of CD2AP can improve the effect of immunotherapy of STAD. CD2AP could emerge as a novel prognostic biomarker for STAD, offering a fresh avenue for molecular targeted therapy.

In this study, we found TIGIT highest expression levels in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, with enrichment in immune cells such as NK-T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). A prognostic model incorporating TIGIT expression and other immune-related genes effectively stratified AML patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with the former displaying significantly shorter overall survival times. Our model outperformed traditional prognostic factors, highlighting TIGIT’s potential as a superior predictive biomarker. Additionally, our in vitro and in vivo studies showed that combining tiragolumab with azacitidine (AZA) synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, reducing tumor burden and extending survival in a murine AML model. Our findings underscore TIGIT’s role in hematologic malignancies and its potential as a therapeutic target in AML. The combination of AZA with TIGIT inhibition offers a promising new approach for AML treatment, warranting further clinical evaluation.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are well reported as a strong protective first line of defense against foreign antigens in non-lymphoid tissues. Moreover, TRM cells have demonstrated critical protective roles in antitumor immunity, contributing to enhanced survival and tumor growth inhibition across various cancer types. However, surprisingly, recent studies suggest that TRM cells can exhibit paradoxical effects, potentially promoting tumor progression under certain conditions and leading to adverse outcomes during antitumor immune responses. Understanding the complexities of TRM cell functions will enable us to harness their potential in advancing cancer immunotherapy more effectively. Therefore, this review comprehensively investigates the dual roles of TRM cells in different tumor contexts, highlighting their protective functions in combating cancers and their unfavorable potential to exacerbate tumor development. Additionally, we explore the implications of TRM cell behaviors for future cancer treatment strategies, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize the therapeutic exploitation of TRM cells while mitigating their deleterious effects.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are a type of tissue-restricted memory T cells with terminal differentiation and a memory function. They exist in mucosal tissues for a long period. In the absence of disease, TRM cells promote essential inflammation, which reinforces the intestinal barrier and prevents bacterial translocation. However, in inflammatory or autoimmune environments, TRM cells are hyperactivated. This heightened activity causes the host to release excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in local immune imbalances and damage to the barrier, ultimately leading to tissue lesions. Numbers of studies have shown that TRM cells play a crucial role in the development and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), suggesting that targeted regulation of TRM cells homeostasis may be an important strategy for treating IBD. Here, we compiled the existing understanding of the role of TRM cells in IBD, with particular emphasis on the associated mechanisms and approaches for targeting TRM cells in IBD treatment. This review will serve as a foundation for a better understanding of IBD development and enhancing the effectiveness of clinical treatments for IBD.">

 Dual inhibition of the PD-1 and TIGIT checkpoint receptor pathways has demonstrated synergistic anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies and early clinical trials, but its mechanism(s) of action remains incompletely understood. We now know that PD-1 and TIGIT regulate CD28 and CD226 costimulatory signals and thus co-blockade presents a rational strategy to facilitate the transmission of these activating signals to T cells. However, therapeutic efficacy of the combination is contingent upon a functional anti-TIGIT Fc domain, thereby implicating a role for myeloid cells, which abundantly express Fc receptors (FcR). Here, we aimed to delineate the relevant myeloid cells at play and investigate how they facilitate improved anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses during PD-1 and TIGIT co-blockade therapy.



 We compared the tumor immune infiltrate from wild-type or genetically modified mice treated with anti-PD-L1 in combination with either Fc-active mIgG2a anti-TIGIT (‘Combo-mG2a’) or Fc-inert mIgG2a-LALAPG anti-TIGIT (‘Combo-LALAPG’). Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing were used for cell profiling. Antibody blocking studies and in vitro co-culture assays were performed to confirm in vivo results.



 Tumor-bearing mice treated with Combo-mG2a were able to robustly control their tumors compared to their Combo-LALAPG-treated counterparts. We uncovered a requirement for type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) during Combo-mG2a treatment administration for anti-tumor efficacy and non-exhausted CD8+ T cell programming. Transcriptional profiling and immunophenotyping studies revealed a cDC1 activation state enriched in Combo-mG2a tumors marked by FcR expression and upregulation of the costimulatory ligands CD80/CD86 and PVR (termed ‘FcR+ cDC1’). The receptors for these ligands, CD28 and CD226, respectively, were co-expressed by therapy-responsive CD8+ T cells, with only CD226 being strongly upregulated following Combo-mG2a therapy. CD8+ T cell-intrinsic CD226 signaling was essential for non-exhausted T cell differentiation. Despite the widespread expression of PVR, cDC1-specific PVR expression was critical for maximal therapeutic efficacy of TIGIT and PD-L1 combination blockade. Type-I interferon (IFN-I) administration was sufficient to induce the FcR+ cDC1 state to rescue anti-tumor immunity in Combo-LALAPG tumors, highlighting IFN-I as a key downstream component of FcR engagement in Combo-mG2a tumors that activated cDC1.



 Our study identifies cDC1-facilitated costimulation as a critical factor in the therapeutic efficacy of TIGIT and PD-L1 combination blockade. Mechanistic insights from this work can inform the design of new therapeutic strategies to increase immunotherapy responses.

        <tr id="Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is employed to either treat or prevent relapse in patients with hematologic malignancies, as well as to accelerate recovery of adaptive immunity, after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). With the increased use of DLI, there is renewed interest in the development of approaches able to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) reaction. In this study, we describe a novel and effective safety switch represented by the truncated form of the human CD19 antigen (ΔCD19) used to transduce T lymphocytes (hΔCD19 Tcells). We demonstrated that the exposure of ΔCD19-T-cells to an anti-hCD19-hCD3 T-cell bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) molecule (structurally identical to blinatumomab, an agent largely used in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) resulted into a prompt elimination of hCD19+/CD3+ cells both in vitro and in an in vivo animal model of mice developing a xenograft reaction mimicking GvHD after infusion of in vitro-activated/expanded human T cells. Importantly, the administration of the anti-hCD19-hCD3 BiTE molecule in the animal model, from one hand led to the improvement of signs and symptoms of GvHD, as well as of the overall-survival of the mice, and from the other, after a drug washout, was associated with the resurge of ΔCD19-T-cells without reoccurrence of GvHD. Our study provides evidence that the ΔCD19 suicide gene used in combination with an anti-hCD19-hCD3 T-cell BiTE molecule could represent a valid and effective strategy to control GvHD occurring after the infusion of donor T lymphocytes.">

Among the various therapeutic strategies available, cancer immunotherapy—encompassing adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and immune checkpoint blockade therapy—has emerged as a particularly promising approach following surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and molecular targeted therapies. This form of treatment elicits substantial antigen-specific immune responses, enhances or restores anti-tumor immunity, thereby facilitating the control and destruction of tumor cells, and yielding durable responses across a range of cancers, which can lead to the eradication of tumor lesions and the prevention of recurrence. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), a subset of ACT, are characterized by their heterogeneity and are found within tumor tissues, where they play a crucial role in mediating host antigen-specific immune responses against tumors. This review aims to explore recent advancements in the understanding of TILs biology, their prognostic implications, and their predictive value in therapeutic contexts.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Recent studies have shown that Erythroid progenitor cells exhibit a distinct immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory phenotype associated with the response to bacteria. Methods: The objective of this study was to comprehensively explore the traits of human bone marrow Erythroid cells through protein–protein interaction network analysis using cytokine secretion analysis, and single-cell immunoproteomic analysis using flow cytometry, as well as the re-analysis of publicly available human and mouse bone marrow Erythroid-cell transcriptomic data. Results: Our protein–protein interaction network analysis of human bone marrow Erythroid-cell protein-coding genes identified enrichment in the immune response to lipopolysaccharide, with Calprotectin and Cathepsin G being the main factors. We then mapped the Calprotectin to the CD45+ Erythroid cells of both humans and mice via the analysis of the publicly available scRNA-seq data. Additionally, we observed that human bone marrow Erythroid cells secrete cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1b, IL-8, and IL-18, which are also mainly involved in the immune response to lipopolysaccharide. We also found that human and mouse bone marrow Erythroid-cell conditional media inhibit bacterial growth in vitro. Discussion: These findings suggest that both human and mouse bone marrow CD45+ Erythroid cells possess the potential to combat pathogenic microbes and thus play a role in innate antimicrobial immunity. Conclusions: CD45+ Erythroid cells are a potent immunoregulatory cell population in both humans and mice.">

        <tr id="Background Few studies have focused on the development of multiple myeloma (MM)-specific immunotherapies. Tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD), triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns, may enhance MM-specific antitumor activity, offering a potential treatment strategy. Methods This study confirms that combining reactive oxygen species (ROS)-endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and pyroptosis-inducers (ROS-ERS inducer 1 (REI) and Quillaja saponaria fraction 21 (QS-21), respectively) activates specific anti-MM immunity. MM cell lines were treated with REI and QS-21 alone or in combination and cytotoxicity and apoptosis were examined. ICD markers were identified, including calreticulin, ATP, heat shock protein 70, and high mobility group box 1. Additionally, changes in mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, pyroptosis markers, and immune markers of dendritic cell (DC) maturation and T-cell activation were assessed both in vitro and in vivo. Results ROS-ERS combined with pyroptosis significantly induces MM cell apoptosis and enhances ICD marker activation. The combination treatment induces severe mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress, further promoting pyroptosis and MM-specific T-cell activation. In vivo, the combination treatment reduces tumor growth and improves DC and T-cell activation. Conclusions Thus, ROS-ERS inducers and pyroptosis inducers together significantly enhance the immunogenic response against MM, providing a promising strategy for MM treatment by activating powerful specific T-cell antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="CKLF (chemokine-like factor)-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing family member 4 (CMTM4), belonging to the CMTM family of transmembrane domain proteins, plays a significant role in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of cancer. Nevertheless, its involvement in tumor immunity remains elusive. In the present investigation, we observed an upregulation of CMTM4 expression in patients with cervical cancer (CC), which also serves as a prognostic indicator for patients with CC. In vitro experiments and therapeutic models have demonstrated that CMTM4 upregulates the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment via the CCL2 (C–C motif chemokine ligand 2)/CCR2 (C–C motif chemokine ligand 2) and IL-6 (interleukin-6)/GP130 (glycoprotein 130) axes. This process exerts immunosuppressive effects and promotes the occurrence and progression of CC. Mechanistically, CMTM4 interacts and stabilizes PHB2 (prohibitin 2) through post-translational modification, which further induces activation of the STING (stimulator of interferon genes)/TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1)/STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) pathway, facilitating the nuclear translocation of STAT6 which binds to the CCL2/IL-6 promoter, leading to the upregulation of CCL2/IL-6 transcription expression. Importantly, targeting CMTM4 with CMTM4-small interfering RNA enhanced the effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. Our study identifies CMTM4 as a crucial determinant guiding the homing of MDSCs to CC, thereby contributing to MDSCs-mediated immune suppression and tumor progression. The combination of CMTM4 inhibition and anti-PD-1 treatment shows promising antitumor efficacy against CC. These findings offer novel insights into the tumor microenvironment and have the potential to inform the development of innovative immunotherapy approaches for CC.">

        <tr id="Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) presents aggressive features and a tumor microenvironment with T cell depletion. However, the role of tumor-associated neutrophils in UTUC remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate how UTUC tumor-derived factors modulate neutrophils and their impact on T cell immune responses. Our findings demonstrate that UTUC secreted tumor-derived factors, with apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1) being the predominant factor, which upregulated arginase-1 expression in neutrophils. STAT3 activation was responsible for the upregulation of arginase-1 in neutrophils. Blocking the interactions between Apo-A1 and its receptors reduced arginase-1 expression in neutrophils treated with tumor tissue culture supernatant (TTCS). Moreover, both CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell proliferation were inhibited by neutrophils treated with Apo-A1 or TTCS. Importantly, blocking Apo-A1 signaling in neutrophils reversed the inhibitory effects on T cells. In UTUC patients, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was higher than that in healthy subjects. The expression of arginase-1 in neutrophils and the level of Apo-A1 within UTUC tumors were negatively correlated with tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells. Additionally, neutrophils from UTUC patients showed increased expression of arginase-1 and exhibited inhibitory effects of T cell functions. These findings suggest that UTUC orchestrates an immune-suppressive microenvironment through Apo-A1-mediated upregulation of arginase-1 in neutrophils, ultimately leading to the inhibition of T cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="Microglia are resident innate immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) that provides anti-microbial protection but also promote neuroinflammation. BRD4 is a chromatin reader that binds to acetylated histones and directs transcription of numerous genes. However, it is unknown whether and how BRD4 regulates microglia function. We addressed the role of microglia and BRD4 in a neuroinflammatory disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for multiple sclerosis. It was reported earlier that in EAE, upon initial T cell activation in the peripheral lymphoid organs, CD4+ T cells migrate to CNS and are reactivated by resident or migratory antigen presenting cells resulting in full manifestation of EAE (Rossi and Constantin, Front Immunol 7:506, 2016), (Plastini et al., Front Cell Neurosci 14:269, 2020). Using conditional deletion of Brd4 in CD4 T cells, we reveal that BRD4 regulates T helper cell differentiation and promotes T cell migration to CNS resulting in EAE. It remained unclear whether resident microglia are capable of reactivating migrating T cells to the CNS and if BRD4 plays a role in the process. To determine the role of microglial BRD4 in EAE, we constructed conditional knockout mice lacking Brd4 (Brd4cKO) in microglia. RNA-seq analysis showed that Brd4 deletion led to the downregulation of many microglia genes in both naive and EAE conditions. Consequently, Brd4cKO mice had markedly reduced EAE pathology, namely reduced paralysis, absence of axonal demyelination and inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines. In vehicle treated mice (vehicle) abundant number of T cells were found to be near microglia that may lead to T cell- microglia interaction and T cell reactivation. In contrast, the number of T cells detected in the CNS of Brd4cKO mice was much fewer. This may lead to reduced T cell- microglia interaction, failure of T cells to get reactivated and hence failed to achieve full manifestation of EAE. These results demonstrate that microglia are critically involved in EAE disease progression for which BRD4 is essential. In summary, BRD4 directs transcription of genes defining microglia function. By so doing BRD4 promotes demyelination and neuroinflammation to exacerbate EAE.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy targeting the programmed death ligand-1/programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-L1/PD-1) pathway exhibits limited effectiveness in individuals with recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Recent studies have noted that hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment (TME) triggers intricate interplay, termed “hypoxia-induced exosome-mediated communication”, between cancer cells and various immune cells. However, the role of hypoxia in modulating the immunosuppressive environment and its implications on the efficacy of immunotherapy in NPC remains poorly understood. In this study, we found hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α) was positively associated with increased PD-L1 levels and decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration, and correlated with a poor prognosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that hypoxia regulated the expression of PD-L1 in NPC cells and their exosomes by activating the binding of HIF-1α to the PD-L1 promoter. Meanwhile, using in vitro approaches, we found that macrophages could upregulate their PD-L1 expression through the phagocytosis of exosomal PD-L1 derived from NPC cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that PD-L1+ macrophages could induce CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reduce their proliferation. In conclusion, our study revealed that hypoxia (via HIF-1α) upregulated the expression of PD-L1 in exosomes derived from NPC cells, while macrophages induce the suppression of CD8+ T cells by phagocytosis of exosomal PD-L1. Targeting the PD-L1+ macrophages could potentially serve as a promising approach to augment the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade in NPC.

        <tr id="Mouse models serve as a means of examining immune changes when genes of interest are knocked out (KO). One group of immune gene-producing cells that have been identified is type 2 innate lymphoid cells (Ilc2). These cells are involved in the production of Th2 equivalent immune responses and signal cytokine production during the resolution of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis parasite infection in mice lungs. However, many questions about Ilc2 activity in the gut remain. To study this, retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα)-deficient mice were infected with adult N. brasiliensis and arranged into four treatment groups. Ten days post-infection (dpi), mouse ileum tissue was extracted for RNA-Seq. The RORα-deficient mice showed little change in gene expression at 10 dpi (N = 51) when compared to the WT mice at 10 dpi (N = 915), displaying dysregulation within the mouse gut. Based on the results, the gene expression in the gut of Ilc2-deficient mice denoted that the inability to craft Ilc2 cells left the mice unable to mount classical helminth immune responses involving humoral, mast cell, and antibody Th2-driven reactions. Overall, the results showed the importance of Ilc2 in the gut during N. brasiliensis infections and the effect that the lack of these cells had on immunity.">

        <tr id="Background CD169+ macrophages in lymph nodes (LNs) activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which play a crucial role in anticancer immunity, through antigen presentation and co-stimulation by CD169. Interferon alpha (IFNα) is capable of inducing the CD169+ phenotype of macrophages; however, its clinical applications have been hindered by pharmacokinetic limitations—low LN distribution and an inability to target macrophages. To overcome these issues, this study genetically fused mouse IFNα (mIFNα) with mannosylated mouse serum albumin (Man-MSA), and investigated the antitumor effects of the hybrid protein (Man-MSA-mIFNα) or its add-on effects with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade. Methods To confirm the possibility of CD169+ macrophage-mediated T cell priming, positional information about individual immune cells in LNs of cancer patients was obtained. Traits of Man-MSA-mIFNα, which was prepared using Pichia pastoris to form the high-mannose structure, were characterized by several physicochemical methods. To evaluate the lymphatic drainage of Man-MSA-mIFNα, radioiodine or Cy5-labeled Man-MSA-mIFNα was subcutaneously administered in mice, and then the radioactivity or fluorescence in LNs was analyzed. CD169-diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor (CD169-DTR) mice in which LN CD169+ macrophages can be depleted by DT injection were used to verify whether the antitumor effect of Man-MSA-mIFNα is dependent on LN CD169+ macrophages. Results Multiplex tissue imaging predicted close proximity of CD169+ macrophages and T cells and positive correlation between the number of CD169+ macrophages and T cells in neighborhoods in LNs of cancer patients. Physicochemical analyses showed that Man-MSA-mIFNα was formed from the fusion of the intact Man-MSA and mIFNα. Man-MSA-mIFNα efficiently induced the CD169+ phenotype of macrophages by its high LN distribution and macrophage-targeting capability, and significantly exerted antitumor activity through CD8+ T cell activation in the LNs, whereas its antitumor effects were canceled in CD169-DTR mice. Finally, combination therapy with PD-L1 blockade markedly suppressed tumor growth in MB49-bearing mice, which exhibit resistance to PD-L1 blockade monotherapy. Conclusions The present study successfully designed and developed Man-MSA-mIFNα, which efficiently induces the CD169+ phenotype in LN macrophages, contributing to the antitumor immunity. The findings suggest that our novel strategy targeting CD169⁺ macrophages could be a promising immunotherapy for cancer patients who are unresponsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

        <tr id="Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TDEVs) represent a heterogeneous population of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, which are essential for tumor growth. EVs function as natural carriers of bioactive molecules, including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, enabling them to influence and regulate complex cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TDEVs mainly have immunosuppressive functions as a result of the inhibitory signals disrupting the immune cell anti-tumor activity. They enhance tumor progression and immune evasion by inhibiting the effector function of immune cells and by altering critical processes of immune cell recruitment, polarization, and functional suppression by different signaling pathways. In this sense, TDEVs modulate the NF-κB pathway, promoting inflammation and inducing immune evasion. The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling is required for TDEV-mediated immune suppression and the manifestation of tumor-supporting features. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, necessary for metabolic reprogramming, is orchestrated by TDEV to abrogate immune response and drive cancer cell proliferation. Finally, exosomal cargo can modulate the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, activating pro-inflammatory responses that influence tumor development and immunomodulation. In this review, we take a deep dive into how TDEVs affect the immune cells by altering key signaling pathways. We also examine emerging therapeutic approaches aimed at disrupting EV-mediated pathways, offering promising avenues for the development of novel EV-based cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that expand aberrantly in cancer and exhibit potent immunosuppressive properties. They contribute to tumor progression through both immunological and nonimmunological mechanisms. Immunologically, MDSCs suppress antitumor responses by inhibiting effector cells such as T cells and NK cells, facilitating immune evasion. Nonimmunologically, they promote tumor growth and metastasis through processes such as the epithelial‒mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and premetastatic niche formation. MDSC accumulation is closely linked to accelerated tumor progression, including resistance to both immunotherapies and conventional treatments, making these cells critical therapeutic targets. Clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of MDSC‐targeted strategies to improve treatment efficacy. However, challenges remain in achieving specificity and effectiveness in MDSC‐targeted therapies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of their biology. This review summarizes the origin, classification, and biological characteristics of MDSCs, their dual roles in tumor progression, and their clinical significance. We also discuss recent advances in clinical and preclinical studies, including both traditional targeted therapies and emerging innovative strategies.

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-(L)1 pathways have revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since last decade. However, the efficacy is still limited because the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) restricts ICI-primed T cell immunity. Therefore, it is quite crucial to block the potential mechanisms in inducing immunosuppression to improve ICI efficacy. Immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) 5 is an important immunosuppressive molecule expressed in a wide range of myeloid cells and predicts tumor progression. Our group was the first to report ILT5 expression in solid tumor cells (colorectal cancer). However, the expression and function of ILT5 in NSCLC are still unknown.
 Methods:
 ILT5 expression in NSCLC tissues and tumor cell lines was determined by PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. The impact of tumor-derived ILT5 on T-cell phenotypes and functions was evaluated using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. ILT5-regulated downstream signals and molecules were determined by RNA sequencing, PCR, western blotting, and flow cytometry. Tumor transplantation and immunotherapeutic models were established in C57/BL6 and NSG mice to explore the effect of ILT5 on tumor progression and the synergies of ILT5 blockade with ICIs.
 Results:
 ILT5 is highly expressed in NSCLC cells, predicting poor patient survival. ILT5 induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion rather than senescence and apoptosis in the TME. Mechanistically, ILT5 upregulated PD-L1 through the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn increased PD-1 expression in CD8
 +
 T cells and induced their exhaustion. PIR-B (ILT5 orthlog in mice) overexpression in mice induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion and tumor growth in vivo, while PIR-B knockdown had the opposite effect. More importantly, inhibition of ILT5 synergistically enhanced the tumoricidal effect of PD-1 inhibitor in NSCLC immunotherapeutic models.
 Conclusions:
 Enriched ILT5 expression in NSCLC cells induces CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion via activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR-PD-L1 pathway. ILT5 inhibition synergistically enhanced the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor. Our findings identifies a novel mechanism for tumor immunosuppression and develops a promising strategy for improving ICI efficacy.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is characterized by CNS infiltration of auto-reactive immune cells that drive both acute inflammatory demyelination and chronic progressive axonal and neuronal injury. Expanding evidence implicates CD8+ anti-neural T cells in the irreversible neurodegeneration that underlies progression in multiple sclerosis, yet therapies specifically targeting this cell population are limited. CD8+ T cells from patients with MS exhibit increased engagement of the pentose phosphate pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway reduced glycolysis, glucose uptake, NADPH production, ATP production, proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in CD8+ T cells activated by ligation of CD3 and CD28. Pentose phosphate pathway inhibition also prevented CD8+ T cell-mediated antigen-specific neuronal injury in vitro and in both an adoptive transfer-based cuprizone model of demyelination and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Notably, transcriptional profiling of CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients with MS indicated increased pentose phosphate pathway engagement, suggesting that this pathway is involved in CD8+ T cell-mediated injury of axons and neurons in the demyelinated CNS. Inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway disrupts CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming and effector functions, suggesting that such inhibition may serve as a therapeutic strategy to prevent neurodegeneration in patients with progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background V‐set and immunoglobulin domain containing 4 (VSIG4) is a B7‐family‐related protein almost exclusively expressed on macrophages. The difference in its expression mediates the dynamic transformation of the polarization state of macrophages, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. We sought to reveal the correlation between VSIG4 and the polarization of tumour‐associated macrophages (TAMs) and the immune escape of tumour cells in colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods THP‐1 monocyte‐derived macrophages expressing different levels of VSIG4 were used for in vitro investigations. In addition, the co‐culture system was used to verify the effect of tumour cells on the expression of VSIG4 in macrophages, and the effect of VSIG4 expression level on tumour cells in turn. Subcutaneous xenograft models evaluated the tumour growth inhibition efficacy of VSIG4 blockade as monotherapy and combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Results CRC cells secreted lactate to promote VSIG4 expression in macrophages. On the contrary, VSIG4 promoted macrophage M2 polarization and induced malignant progression of tumour cells by promoting M2 macrophage secretion of heparin‐bound epidermal growth factor. In vivo experiments confirmed that knockdown VSIG4 inhibited tumour growth and improved the efficacy of ICIs therapy. Mechanistically, lactate secreted by CRC cells promoted its expression by influencing the epigenetic modification of VSIG4 in macrophages. In addition, VSIG4 enhanced the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) of macrophages and upregulated PPAR‐γ expression by activating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, which ultimately induced M2 polarization of macrophages. Downregulation of VSIG4 or blocking of FAO reversed the M2 polarization process of macrophages. Conclusions Our findings provide a molecular basis for VSIG4 to influence TAMs polarization by regulating the reprogramming of FAO, suggesting that targeting VSIG4 in macrophages could enhance the ICIs efficacy and represent a new combination therapy strategy for immunotherapy of CRC. Key points Colorectal cancer cells secrete lactate to upregulate VSIG4 in macrophages via the H3K18la‐METTL14‐m6A axis. VSIG4 promotes fatty acid oxidation of macrophages and drives its M2‐type polarization. These VSIG4‐expressing M2 macrophages promote tumour progression and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Inhibition of VSIG4 expression can synergistically enhance the therapeutic effect of anti‐PD‐1 antibody.">

        <tr id="Background Patients living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLWH) develop accelerated liver fibrosis, but the exact mechanism remains unknown. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is the cornerstone for liver fibrosis and influenced by multiple factors, such as viral infection, hepatocellular injury, chronic immune activation, gut mucosal barrier dysfunction, and microbial translocation. Unlike gram-negative bacterial products, the impact of gram-positive microbial products in Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) associated liver inflammation and fibrosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a major gram-positive bacterial component, on HSCs in the context of HIV-1 infection. Methods Human HSCs were isolated from the livers of both non-HIV and HIV-infected patients undergoing hepatic resection. The inflammatory responses of HSCs to LTA stimulation were measured by ELISA before or after HIV-1BaL ex vivo expision. Western blotting, ChIP-qPCR and RNA-seq were used to reveal the mechanisms contributing to the IL-8 response to LTA stimulation and HIV-1BaL exposure in HSCs. Results While LTA stimulation modestly increased IL-8 production in HSCs, this effect was significantly amplified in HIV-1-infected HSCs. Elevated IL-8 levels were detected in HIV-1+ liver sections, and IL-8 treatment of cultured HSCs significantly increased α-SMA and COL1A1 expression, supporting IL-8 as a key inflammatory driver of liver fibrosis in HIV-1+ individuals. Transcriptomic analyses implicated histone acetylation as a regulator of the enhanced IL-8 response of HSCs to LTA in HIV-1 infection. Consistent with this, treatment with Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, further increased the IL-8 response in HIV-1-infected HSCs. ChIP-qPCR confirmed that histone H4K5 acetylation facilitated IL-8 promoter transactivation, rendering HIV-1-infected cells more responsive to LTA. Conclusions HIV-1 infection sensitizes HSCs to LTA stimulation, leading to an amplified IL-8 response mediated through histone acetylation that may accelerate liver fibrosis progression in PLWH. As microbial translocation persists despite effective antiretroviral therapy, these findings underscore the need for targeted strategies to mitigate liver fibrosis in HIV-1 infected HIV-1+ individuals.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized cancer treatment by enabling durable responses. However, most patients showed resistance and limited efficacy. Elucidating mechanisms of resistance is imperative to extend the clinical utility of ICBs. Emerging evidence highlights cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), particularly TGFβ-activated myofibroblastic CAFs, as key orchestrators of immunosuppressive TMEs and ICBs resistance. These CAFs drive T-cell exclusion preventing intratumoral T cells from engaging cancer cells. This review explores the role of TGFβ signaling in CAFs in driving immune evasion and therapy resistance. While targeting TGFβ or CAFs directly has shown limited inconsistent results, downstream molecules in TGFβ-activated CAFs, including induced TGFβ (βig-h3), endocytic receptor 180 (Endo180), leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15), and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), emerge as promising therapeutic targets to counteract T-cell exclusion and restore immunotherapy sensitivity. Advancing research on CAF heterogeneity and pro-tumorigenic subsets may uncover innovative strategies to expand immunotherapy benefits.">

        <tr id="Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are critical for the maintenance of self‐tolerance, and their absence or dysfunction can result in autoimmunity. To determine the critical cell type controlled by Treg and potentially the suppressor mechanism utilized by Treg in the steady state, we utilized mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) exclusively on Treg cells. Complete depletion of Treg was achieved 24 h after DT treatment, but profound activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as measured by induction of CD44 expression and proliferation required 3–4 days. Increased expression of CD80/CD86 was observed on dendritic cells and more prominently on macrophages after 3 days. Depletion of CD4+ T cells or macrophages resulted in ∼50% inhibition of T‐cell activation. The initial steps in T‐cell activation were completely independent of IFN‐γ or IL‐2, while upregulation of CD80/CD86 was partially dependent on IFN‐γ. Complete reversal of immune activation post‐Treg depletion was only achieved by blockade of CD80/CD86 interactions with CD28. We conclude that the major mechanism used by Treg in the steady state is the regulation of CD80/CD86 expression and dysregulation of this suppressor pathway results in lethal autoimmunity driven by co‐stimulatory signals in concert with TCR stimulation, or even by costimulatory signals alone.">

Although clinical detection is relatively easy, a considerable number of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, featuring local tissue infiltration and distant metastasis. Cemiplimab, along with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, enhances T cell activation by blocking the PD-1 pathway, resulting in notable improvements in clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, approximately 50% of the patients with advanced cSCC remain unresponsive to this therapeutic approach. It emphasizes the importance of finding innovative therapeutic targets and strategies to boost the success of immunotherapy across a wider range of patients. Therefore, we focused on frequently neglected functions of innate immune cells. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immune cells exhibit considerable heterogeneity and plasticity, fundamentally contributing to tumor initiation and development. The identification and eradication of cancer cells, along with the modulation of adaptive immune responses, are essential roles of these cells. Consequently, targeting innate immune cells to activate anti-tumor immune responses presents significant potential for enhancing immunotherapeutic strategies in cSCC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The thymus exhibits constitutive activation of nearly all major inflammatory pathways, including sterile MyD88‐dependent signaling and interferon production by mTECs, the presence of cellular and molecular components of type 1, type 2, and type 3 responses, as well as sustained B cell activation. The reasons for the existence of such a complex constitutively active inflammatory network at the site of T cell development—where the initial pathogen encounter is unlikely—have remained enigmatic. We propose that this inflammatory thymic ‘ecosystem’ has evolved to promote immunological tolerance to ‘inflammatory self’—endogenous molecules absent from most peripheral tissues at steady state but upregulated during pathogen invasion. The spatial and temporal overlap with pathogen presence makes the discrimination of the inflammatory self from pathogen‐derived molecules a unique challenge for the adaptive immune system. The frequent occurrence of diseases associated with autoantibodies against proinflammatory cytokines underscores the persistent risk of these molecules being misidentified as foreign. Their abundant representation in the thymus, therefore, is likely to be critical for maintaining tolerance. This review explores current insights into the thymic inflammatory network, its cellular and molecular constituents, and their role in the induction of T cell tolerance.">

Conversely, MSCs also demonstrate potential inhibitory effects on AML, including the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and the modulation of immune responses. These contrasting effects highlight the complexities of MSC-AML interactions and emphasize the need for further research to understand their therapeutic potential fully. Targeting MSCs represents a promising avenue for AML treatment. Strategies aimed at modifying MSC-mediated support of AML cells, such as inhibiting pro-survival signaling pathways, disrupting the leukemia-supportive niche, and enhancing the immune-stimulatory functions of MSCs, could offer novel therapeutic approaches. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of current research. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the dual effects of MSCs in AML, to identify biomarkers that predict patient response to MSC-targeted therapies, and to develop strategies to overcome potential challenges associated with MSC-based interventions. In conclusion, understanding the multifaceted role of MSCs in AML pathogenesis is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic approaches. By harnessing the potential of MSCs and targeting their interactions with AML cells, we can explore novel strategies to improve treatment outcomes and enhance the overall management of this challenging hematological malignancy.

Conventional interventions including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy provide only modest survival benefits, underscoring an urgent need for more effective therapies. Although immunotherapy has revolutionized the management of several solid tumors, its clinical benefit in pancreatic cancer has so far been disappointing. Mounting evidence indicates that a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), dominated by tumor−associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid−derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), drives immune evasion, tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance through complex cytokine and chemokine networks.

        <tr id="Background Multiple myeloma (MM) is a biologically heterogeneous malignancy of clonal plasma cells, often progressing from MGUS or smoldering MM. It causes anemia, bone lesions, and immune dysfunction due to abnormal plasma cell expansion in the bone marrow. Neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors may influence MM progression by affecting immune cells and the bone marrow niche. Growing evidence points to a role for neuroimmune regulation in tumor immunity. Despite therapeutic progress, disease heterogeneity and resistance highlight the need for new strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment and neuroimmune axis. Methods This investigation exploited single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze MM and high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMMh) samples, identifying 11 distinct cell types. We examined their transcriptional signatures, stemness, proliferative properties, and metabolic pathways, with particular attention to neuroimmune interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Using trajectory inference tools such as CytoTRACE, Monocle2, and Slingshot, we traced the differentiation paths of MM cell subpopulations and identified key signaling pathways that may influence immune responses and tumor progression. Results The analysis identified four distinct subpopulations of myeloma cells, with the C0 IGLC3+ myeloma cells representing the least differentiated and most proliferative subset. These cells played a critical role in MM progression and may contribute to immune evasion mechanisms. Additionally, receptor-ligand interactions within the tumor microenvironment were identified, which may be influenced by neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors. These findings suggest that the nervous system and immune modulation significantly affect tumor biology, highlighting potential therapeutic targets that could be exploited to overcome resistance to conventional therapies. Conclusion This single-cell analysis provided new insights into the cellular diversity and differentiation trajectories in MM, offering a deeper understanding of the complex neuroimmune interactions that drive tumor progression and resistance. By incorporating the role of neuroinflammation and immune modulation, our study suggested novel therapeutic strategies targeting the neuroimmune axis in oncology, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective, personalized treatment approaches for MM.">

 Tumor-associated lymphatic vessels are clinically linked to aggressive tumor progression and metastasis. Their expansion is driven by vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), which is highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in melanoma and other solid tumors. Although elevated VEGF-C promotes an immunosuppressive TME, it paradoxically also enhances the response to immunotherapy in mouse models and correlates with improved survival after checkpoint blockade in patients. This enhanced response was associated with VEGF-C-induced alterations in the tumor microenvironment before immunotherapy, characterized by increased infiltration of naïve T cells in VEGF-C-overexpressing tumors, which creates favorable conditions for local T cell activation. Here, we investigated how VEGF-C reshapes the tumor microenvironment during and after immunotherapy response to improve immunotherapy outcome in melanoma, focusing on immune cell trafficking and memory T cell development. We utilized a B16F10 melanoma model overexpressing VEGF-C (B16-VEGFC) or a control vector (B16-Control) in conjunction with the pmel adoptive cell transfer and peptide vaccination model. Our data demonstrate that B16-VEGFC tumors harbor increased transferred antigen-specific T cells, including more proliferating effector and central memory T cells, along with enhanced endogenous T and B cell populations. In parallel, B16-VEGFC tumors and their draining lymph nodes (tdLN) contain higher fractions of total memory T cells, and Tcf1+ stem-like memory T cells in lymphangiogenic tumors localize near lymphatic vessels. In addition to T cell memory, B16-VEGFC tumors and tdLN exhibit enhanced CD103+ dendritic cell trafficking. Moreover, bystander activation and proliferation of non-targeted CD8 T cells increase in B16-VEGFC tumors, indicating robust immune activation through antigen spreading. Collectively, our study establishes that VEGF-C is pivotal in shaping the anti-tumor immune response during immunotherapy by altering both the TME and the systemic immune response. By promoting T cell memory, boosting DC trafficking, and facilitating T cell recruitment, VEGF-C drives a more robust and sustained immune response against melanoma. Future research using photoconvertible mice will further elucidate the trafficking dynamics between the tumor and its draining lymph nodes post-immunotherapy, providing a more comprehensive understanding of VEGF-C's impact on the tumor microenvironment before and during immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review explores the connection between immunometabolism and innate immune cells in gastrointestinal cancers. While cancer cells consume large amounts of nutrients, immune cells in the tumor microenvironment also have unique metabolic demands that influence immune responses. The review examines how metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and amino acid metabolism contribute to the immunosuppressive functions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and innate lymphocytes such as NK cells. These cells create a tumor-friendly environment, helping cancer evade immune attack. The review also discusses how dietary interventions can reshape immune cell metabolism and highlights emerging therapies targeting these metabolic weaknesses to boost antitumor immunity. Understanding these processes could lead to new strategies for improving cancer treatment by manipulating immune cell metabolism.">

 STAT1 gain-of-function (GOF) patients experience severe fungal and viral infections and autoimmunity. CD8+ T cells are key mediators of the adaptive immune response by combating infections. CD8+ T cell dysfunction, in turn, contributes to autoimmune pathogenesis and chronic viral infections. We therefore hypothesized that CD8+ T cell dysfunction contributes to STAT1 GOF pathophysiology and sought to identify the underlying mechanisms.



 We collected high-dimensional immunophenotyping and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes sequencing (CITE-Seq) data on 24 STAT1 GOF patients and age-matched healthy control PBMCs. In addition, T cell function and metabolic data were collected on untreated and in vitro-treated patient and healthy control PBMCs.



 In patients with STAT1 GOF, CD8+ T cell dysfunction was best defined as reduced production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 upon αCD3/αCD28 stimulation. High-dimensional immunophenotyping identified CD38 as a significantly upregulated activation marker on CD8+ T cells and most immune cell populations, from patients with STAT1 GOF. CD38 expression could be further induced by αCD3/αCD28 stimulation and was correlated with the levels of total STAT1 protein. CD38 is an ectoenzyme that consumes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), and low NAD+ levels have been linked to immune dysregulation. Our CITE-Seq data confirmed that STAT1 GOF CD8+ T cells have transcriptional evidence of broadly altered NAD+ metabolism, with both NAD-consuming enzymes such as CD38 and PARP9 as well as NAD+ salvage pathway proteins such as NAMPT being increased. Using an NAD+ enzymatic assay, we confirmed that NAD+ levels were indeed reduced in STAT1 GOF CD8+ T cells while the NADH levels were comparable. By increasing NAD+ levels in patient PBMCs, it was possible to partially normalize CD8+ T cell function in CD8+ T cells from patients with STAT1 GOF. Finally, STAT1 GOF patients receiving JAK inhibitors show reduced CD38 RNA and protein expression and reduced PARP9 and NAMPT transcription.



 Elevated CD38 expression and reduced NAD+ levels contribute to CD8+ T cell dysfunction in CD8+ T cells from patients with STAT1 CD8+ T cells, which can be partially normalized by providing increased NAD+ levels.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Over the last decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4, which reinvigorate T cells for tumor control have become standard-of-care treatment options. In response to the increasingly recognized mechanisms of resistance to T cell activation in immunologically cold tumors, immuno-oncology drug development has started to shift beyond T cell approaches. These include tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a major pro-tumor immune cell population in the tumor microenvironment known to silence immune responses. Areas covered Here we outline anti-TAM therapies in current development, either as monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities. We describe emerging drugs targeting TAMs under investigation in phase II and III testing with a focus on their distinguishing mechanism of action which include (1) reprogramming of TAMs toward anti-tumor function and immune surveillance, (2) blockade of recruitment, and (3) reduction and ablation of TAMs. Expert opinion Several new immuno-oncology agents are under investigation to harness anti-tumor functions of TAMs. While robust anti-tumor efficacy of anti-TAM therapies across advanced solid organ cancers remains elusive to-date, TAM reprogramming therapies have yielded benefits in select cancers. The inherent heterogeneity of the diverse TAM population will require enhanced investments into biomarker-driven approaches to fully leverage its therapeutic potential.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells, serving as pivotal mediators of innate immunity, play an important role in antitumor immunity. Immune checkpoint can be expressed on the surface of NK cells and meticulously regulates their activation states and effector functions through complex signaling networks. In recent years, tumor immunotherapy strategies focusing on NK cell immune checkpoints have demonstrated remarkable advancements. This review systematically elucidates the expression profiles, signaling pathways, and the immune checkpoint molecule regulatory mechanisms localized on the NK cell membrane (e.g., NKG2A, KIRs, and TIGIT) or intracellularly (e.g., BIM, Cbl-b, and EZH2) during tumor immune evasion. Particular attention is devoted to dissecting the regulatory mechanisms through which these immune checkpoint molecules influence NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion, proliferative capacity, and tunable modulation of NK cell immune checkpoint expression by diverse factors within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, this review comprehensively summarizes preclinical advancements in NK cell immune checkpoint blockade strategies, including single checkpoint blockade, combinatorial checkpoint approaches, and their integration with conventional therapeutic modalities. Additionally, emerging therapeutic advancements, such as gene-editing technologies and chimeric antigen receptor-NK (CAR-NK) cell therapy, are evaluated for their prospective applications in immunotherapy based on NK cells. By thoroughly elucidating the molecular regulatory networks underlying NK cell immune checkpoints and their mechanisms of action within the complex tumor microenvironment, this review aims to provide critical theoretical insights and translational foundations to foster the development of innovative tumor immunotherapy strategies, improvement of combination therapies, and realization of personalized precision medicine.">

 Therapeutic checkpoint blockade of TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade has been shown to eradicate large established tumors in preclinical mouse models by enhancing anti-tumor cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. In addition to CD8+ T cells, TIGIT is also expressed on other immune cells, with particularly high expression on immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells. Here, we explored the functional consequences of TIGIT blockade on Treg cells in syngeneic mouse tumor models. In contrast to treatment with Fc-active anti-CTLA-4 which significantly reduced Treg cell frequencies and numbers in tumors, Treg cells were modestly reduced or even increase in tumors with Fc-active anti-TIGIT, indicating that anti-TIGIT was not driving depletion of the bulk Treg cell population. Treg cells had reduced suppressive characteristics and increased effector-like properties, suggesting modulation of the Treg cell phenotype by TIGIT blockade. This effect on Treg cell phenotype was dependent on Fc competency of the anti-TIGIT antibody as well as CD226, the activating counterreceptor to TIGIT. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) demonstrated that anti-TIGIT altered the epigenetic and transcriptional regulatory programs involved in generation and maintenance of suppressive Treg cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) revealed four distinct Treg cell clusters and provided resolution of the gene expression shifts away from suppressive function mediated by anti-TIGIT. Our data demonstrate that co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 reprograms Treg cells from a pro-tumor immunosuppressive phenotype to an anti-tumor effector-like cell that participates in the response against tumors.

Here, we developed a myeloid-specific Mac-1–deficient mouse. Using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS, we report that Mac-1 on myeloid cells is key to disease development. Our data reveal that myeloid-specific Mac-1 significantly increases EAE severity and hinders disease regression. Loss of Mac-1 increases Gr-1+ cells in peripheral tissues and the CNS and preferably accelerates the transition of Ly6Chi monocytes from a pro-inflammatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in a disease stage–dependent manner. Mechanistically, our results demonstrate that Mac-1 suppresses interferon-γ production and prevents monocytes from acquiring immunosuppressive functions by reducing the expression of iNOS, IDO, and CD84. Administration of a NOS-specific inhibitor in Mac-1–deficient EAE mice abolishes disease regression. These insights could help develop Mac-1–targeting strategies for better treatment of MS.">

Bacterial infection is a frequent precipitating factor and complication in ACLF patients, significantly worsening patient outcomes. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying bacterial infections and their impact on ACLF pathophysiology is crucial for developing effective therapies to reduce infection rates and mortality. Current research highlights that immune suppression in ACLF increases susceptibility to bacterial infections, which in turn exacerbate immune dysfunction. However, a comprehensive review summarizing the emerging mechanisms underlying this immunosuppression is currently lacking. This review aims to provide an overview of the latest research, focusing on alterations in the immune responses of innate immune cells—including monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils—as well as adaptive immune cells such as T and B lymphocytes during the onset and progression of bacterial infections in ACLF.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains resistant to immunotherapy due to a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Lahusen et al identify transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) as a critical tumor cell-intrinsic regulator of immune suppression in PDAC. TGM2 enhances the secretion of suppressive cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) via a microtubule-dependent pathway that secondarily impairs T-cell activation and cytotoxicity. Targeting TGM2, either genetically or with microtubule-disrupting agents, restores T cell function and promotes tumor control in preclinical PDAC models. These findings are discussed in the context of our recent work on vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling in PDAC, which independently drives immune evasion through VIP receptor (VPAC)-mediated induction of TGF-β1 secretion from tumor cells, upregulation of programmed death-ligand 1 on myeloid cells, and inhibition of effector T cells. Here, we have explored the mechanistic intersections between TGM2 and VIP signaling—including cytokine secretion, vesicle trafficking, and immune checkpoint regulation—and propose combination strategies that integrate TGM2 or VIP inhibition with checkpoint blockade. Together, these insights suggest a new framework for overcoming immune resistance in PDAC by targeting cancer cell-intrinsic secretory programs and offer a rationale for biomarker-guided, multimodal immunotherapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, also known as signal 1, plays a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of T cells. The question of whether TCR signaling exerts a deterministic role in T cell fate determination is an area of active investigation. It has been particularly challenging to address this question due to the complexities associated with genetic manipulation of TCR signaling components, which often disrupts thymic T cell development or impairs T cell activation upon TCR engagement. Recent study demonstrates that the TCR-Lck/Fyn axis directly induces STAT3 phosphorylation and synergizes with pro-inflammatory cytokines to optimize STAT3 phosphorylation during Th17 cell differentiation. Additionally, the TCR-Lck/Fyn-AKT/mTOR axis negatively regulates Treg cell differentiation. In CD8+ T cells, persistent high-affinity antigen stimulation drives differentiation along the exhaustion pathway, while acute infection or intermediate antigen levels promote differentiation into effector and memory T cells, although the underlying mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. Collectively, these studies provide compelling evidence that TCR signaling has a deterministic impact on T cell fate. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding how TCR signaling shapes T cell fate determination.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological cancer. It remains incurable, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies. In this study, we investigated a panel of peptides derived from a functional motif of Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family 1 (SLAMF1) with single amino acid substitutions and found that several of them exhibited potent anti-cancer activity by inducing MM cell death. The most potent peptide P7N4 significantly reduced the viability of both IL-6-dependent and -independent human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), proteasome inhibitor-resistant MM cells, and primary MM cells, while exerting minimal effects on healthy blood cells. Furthermore, P7N4 enhanced the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent melphalan. When combined with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, P7N4 potentiated the anti-cancer effect of bortezomib in a highly aggressive murine MM model. Mechanistically, P7N4 induced apoptosis in MM cells by disrupting key pro-survival pathways, leading to reduction in IRF4, MYC, and β-catenin levels, as well as inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, in peptide-sensitive HMCL, P7N4 significantly altered the expression of IRF4-associated genes. These effects were likely mediated by direct interaction of peptide with IRF4, targeting this transcription factor for degradation. Overall, our findings established P7N4 as a promising therapeutic candidate for MM, warranting further optimization and in-depth mechanistic studies.">

This study explored the role B cells play in protection against bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae) super-infection with previous heterotypic influenza memory. B cell deficiency resulted in an increased inflammatory lung environment and lung tissue injury during super-infection. Loss of B cells increased populations of memory CD8+ T cells in the lung and these CD8+ T cells were transcriptionally and functionally distinct from WT mice. Use of antibody-deficient mouse models showed that this phenotype was specifically due to loss of antibody production from B cells. Passive immunization with influenza-antibody serum in B cell deficient mice rescued the CD8+ T cell phenotype. CD8+ T cell depletion and lethal super-infection challenge experiments showed that the cytotoxic memory CD8+ T cells from B cell deficient mice protect against super-infection bacterial burden and mortality.

        <tr id="Background Immune evasion is a crucial event in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The identification of new immunotherapeutic targets may provide a promising platform for advancing PDAC treatment. This study aims to investigate the role of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase-5 (B4GALT5) in immune evasion by pancreatic cancer cells and evaluate its potential as an immunotherapeutic target. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis using RNA sequencing data and tissue microarrays from patients with PDAC to investigate the association between B4GALT5 expression and patient prognosis. Using animal models, we further explored the impact of B4GALT5 on the quantity and activity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. RNA sequencing and co-immunoprecipitation were used to explore the mechanism by which B4GALT5 regulates major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) levels. Results Our study demonstrates that high expression of B4GALT5 in tumor cells is significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with PDAC and reduced cytotoxic activity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Specifically, B4GALT5 suppresses MHC-I expression in tumor cells through the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway, enabling them to evade immune surveillance by CD8+ T cells. Conclusions B4GALT5 impairs CD8+ T-cell recognition of tumor cells by regulating MHC-I levels, thereby promoting immune evasion. This makes B4GALT5 a highly promising immunotherapeutic target for improving the poor prognosis of patients with PDAC.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a significant health problem that disproportionately affects the elderly. With the aging worldwide population being less responsive to protective vaccines, there is an urgent need for strategies that can protect the elderly from community-acquired viral infections. Background/Objectives: Allo-priming is a novel immunomodulatory vaccine concept using allogeneic, living, activated Th1 cells that are rejected by the host, creating anti-alloantigen Th1 immunity, increasing Th1 titers. Th1 cells orchestrate cellular immunity, and the age-related decline in Th1 cells contributes to weakened cellular immune response in the elderly, which correlates with poor responsiveness to vaccines and increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections. Increased Th1 cell titers in the elderly were hypothesized to reverse immunosenescence and restore cellular immune function. Restoration of cellular immune function was predicted to restore broad respiratory viral protection through a heterologous immune mechanism. Methods: A phase I/II, multi-center, open-label clinical trial was conducted in 40 healthy adults over 65 years of age to investigate the safety of allo-priming and the effects this vaccination strategy has on cellular immune function over time. Results: Allo-priming had a benign safety profile and significantly increased the titers of circulating Th1 cells. The increase in Th1 cells was shown to provide broad, self-amplifying respiratory viral protection over time in an ex vivo cytopathic effect assay without additional vaccinations and without any viral antigens included in the formulation, as well acting to increase neutralizing antibody titers in low-responding individuals previously vaccinated for COVID-19. Conclusions: These results provide support for an expanded clinical evaluation of this immunomodulatory vaccination strategy as a possible method to restore cellular immune competence to the elderly and provide broad heterologous immune protection from respiratory viral infections without the need for frequent vaccine re-formulations or booster shots (National Library of Medicine: NCT04441047).">

        <tr id="Introduction The H9N2 avian influenza virus, although not highly pathogenic, still poses ongoing risks to poultry health and food security due to its ability to resist vaccines and its potential to spread to humans. Methods This study investigated the effects of baicalin, a flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, on respiratory mucosal immunity during H9N2 infection. In vitro experiments were conducted using MLE-12 alveolar epithelial cells, and in vivo evaluations were performed in a mouse model of H9N2 infection. Results Baicalin treatment enhanced the expression of antiviral proteins Mx1 and PKR in a dose- and time-dependent manner, helping to counteract the virus’s suppression of these defense proteins. In addition to strengthening this epithelial barrier, baicalin has both antiviral and immune-regulating effects: it directly blocks viral replication and helps restore the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio in H9N2-infected mice. Most importantly, baicalin reduces lung damage and spleen shrinkage while keeping the immune system balanced. These results show that baicalin enhances mucosal antiviral defenses by simultaneously regulating innate antiviral pathways (Mx1 and PKR) and restoring adaptive immune balance (CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratio). Discussion These dual protective effects highlight baicalin’s potential as a natural therapeutic strategy for improving mucosal immunity against vaccine-resistant influenza viruses such as H9N2, contributing valuable insights into plant-derived immunomodulatory approaches against emerging zoonotic viral threats.">

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamics of the tumor-immune ecosystem is crucial for advancing neoadjuvant strategies in cancer treatment. This study investigated alterations in the tumor-immune microenvironment related to the response to preoperative combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty patients underwent combination therapy. Biopsy or surgical specimens were obtained before and after treatment. Single-cell-based, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry and image cytometry were employed to assess changes in immune cell densities and profiles. Three distinct immune profiles were identified: hypo-, lymphoid-, and myeloid-inflamed. Significant decreases in tumor volume and increases in CD45+ cells and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) scores were observed in the hypo- and lymphoid-inflamed groups, whereas the myeloid-inflamed group showed minimal changes. After treatment, increased calreticulin expression in tumor cells, together with increased lymphoid cell lineages, was observed in non-recurrent cases. The myeloid-inflamed group exhibited higher expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2, suggesting the presence of a hypoxic and metastasis-promoting environment. Spatial analysis revealed that responders had a high infiltration of T cells within tumor cell nests, whereas non-responders had fewer T cells, with β-catenin expression in cancer cells. Upregulated lymphocyte activation gene 3 in the myeloid-inflammation group, and PD-L1 dynamics suggest potential targets for further therapy. These findings highlight the need for targeted neoadjuvant strategies based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="The incidence rates of fungal infections are increasing, especially in immunocompromised individuals without an FDA-approved vaccine. Accumulating evidence suggests that T cells are instrumental in providing fungal immunity. An apt stimulation and responses of dendritic cells are pivotal in inducing T-cell responses and vaccine success. Using a mouse model of fungal vaccination, we explored the dynamics, kinetics, activation, and antigen presentation of dendritic cell subsets to unravel the features of dendritic cell responses in the absence of CD4+ T cell help. The subcutaneous fungal vaccination induced more robust cDC2 responses than the cDC1 subset in draining lymph nodes. A single immunization with Blastomyces yeasts bolstered DC responses that peaked around day 5 before reverting to basal levels by day 15. The migratory cDC2 was the dominant DC subset, with higher numbers than all other DC subsets combined. Fungal vaccination augmented costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 without altering the levels of MHC molecules. Despite the higher fungal antigen uptake with migratory cDC2, the mean cross-presentation ability of all DC subsets was similar. Counterintuitively, deleting CD4+ T cells enhanced the DC responses, and CD4+ T cells were dispensable for conventional cross-presenting cDC1 responses. Collectively, our study shows that fungal vaccination selectively augmented cDC2 responses, and CD4+ T cells were dispensable for DC activation, antigen uptake, expression of costimulatory molecules, and cross-presentation. Our study provides novel insights into DC responses to an effective fungal vaccine for designing efficacious vaccines tailored for immunocompromised hosts.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vehicles (EVs) are reported to be involved in several processes relating to tumor progression, including angiogenesis, osteolysis, and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). However, the role of EVs in the immune-suppressive milieu of MM is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of MM-derived EVs on T cells, focusing on markers of T cell exhaustion. Using activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors, we observed immunosuppressive effects such as upregulated expression of immune checkpoint markers on CD8+ T cells treated with MM-derived EVs. Proteomic analysis identified several proteins, such as IL-8, SLC1A5, PIN2, and FSP1, associated with regulation of T cell exhaustion and chronic inflammation. Surprisingly, sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) was enriched in MM cell line-derived EVs, implicating SPHK1/S1P signaling in the immunosuppressive effect of MM EVs. Thus, MM-derived EVs may promote T cell exhaustion via upregulating the expression of immune checkpoint markers and thereby contribute to the formation of the immune-suppressive milieu of MM, resulting in impaired T cell activity.">

 AXL expression in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) promotes cancer cell survival, metastasis and engenders immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments. Immune cells (CD4+/CD8+ T cells, NK and NKT cells) become dysfunctional with reduced expression of granzyme B, resulting in impaired cytotoxicity. Bemcentinib (BEM), a selective oral AXL inhibitor, may enhance pembrolizumab (PEM) to restore cytotoxic T cell function in mouse models of LAC. We hypothesize that AXL-PD1 targeting may overcome immune exhaustion in LAC patients who previously failed chemoimmunotherapy.



 Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC; n = 4,439,600 live cells) from 29 LAC patients enrolled in BGBC008 phase 2 open-label, single-arm study of BEM+PEM (NCT03184571) were collected at different treatment time points, analyzed by CyTOF using the Phenograph algorithm and visualized by tSNE plots. Immune cell type proportions and immune cell activation were calculated before and after treatment. Separately, we tested whether adding targeting of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway (an AXL bypass mechanism) with pacritinib, a selective JAK2 inhibitor with no JAK1 activity, can further inhibit tumor growth compared with targeting AXL-PD1 alone, in a C57BL/6 syngeneic mouse D19.1 LAC model.



 BEM + PEM led to immune cell responses following cycle 1 treatment in LAC patients previously treated with chemo-immunotherapy. Specifically, we observed a reduction in monocytes/macrophages (p=0.0134), CD123+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC; p=0.0009), cDC1 (p=0.0009), and myeloid dendritic cell populations (p = 0.0073). Combination treatment led to a reduction in M2-polarized macrophages (reduced CD206 & CD163 levels), re-activation of cDC1 (high CD40 expression) and reduction in CD8+ T cell exhaustion (high granzyme B levels). Fold-change of granzyme B in CD8+ NKT cell populations positively correlated with progression free survival (PFS) (n = 29, Cor = 0.295). Additionally, high phospho-STAT3 expression in macrophages may correlate with poor PFS, supporting our previous research suggesting that pSTAT3 is a bypass mechanism of AXL signaling. In a syngeneic LAC mouse model, triple combination therapy targeting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in addition to AXL and PD-1 resulted in 55% and 90% tumor size reduction and two-fold increase in CD8+ T cell infiltration when compared with AXL/PD-1 dual combination treatment and untreated control groups, respectively.



 CyTOF data suggest that AXL-PD1 drug targeting may overcome immune cell exhaustion and re-activate CD8+ T cell, cDC1 and NKT cells in treatment refractory LAC patients treated with BEM+PEM. Granzyme B expression in PBMCs may serve as a biomarker of treatment response. Furthermore, in vivo drug targeting of AXL-PD1-STAT3 axis demonstrates significant synergy in a syngeneic LAC mouse model, showing a strong potential for future clinical trials.

        <tr id="Background Given the scarcity of effective therapeutic targets, metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) has shorter survival times compared to other advanced breast cancer subtypes. Although chemo-immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in PD-L1+ mTNBC has shown promise, survival benefit remains modest. Therefore, it is crucial to gain improved insight into the mechanisms underlying response and resistance to checkpoint inhibition in mTNBC. Methods We employed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), single cell secretomics, and flow cytometry to identify transcriptomic and proteomic peripheral immune cell signatures associated with response and non-response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and chemotherapy in mTNBC. Results Transcriptomic analysis reveal divergent transcriptional programming of CD33+ myeloid cells between responders and non-responders, even in pretreatment PBMC samples. This divergence, in responders, is characterized by an immune-promoting CD33+ cell phenotype involving IL1b signaling compared to non-responders, where an immunosuppressive phenotype marked by IL1b inhibition is observed. These baseline differences become more pronounced during the course of chemo-immunotherapy. Differences in CD33+ cell phenotype result in functional differences in lymphocyte activities between responders and non-responders. Depletion of CD33+ cells in pre-treatment samples from non-responders, restores T cell effector function. Conclusion Our findings highlight CD33+ cell phenotype as a key determinant of response to chemo-immunotherapy, which can be assessed from peripheral blood. This offers a valuable tool in the context of metastatic TNBC, in which tissue sampling is often challenging.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viruses, including the influenza virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pose significant health threats. As tissue-resident macrophages, alveolar macrophages (AM) are crucial for defending against respiratory viral infection by producing cytokines, engulfing virus-infected cells, and promoting wound healing. However, excessive inflammatory responses can lead to tissue injury. Growing evidence indicates that astragaloside IV (AST IV) regulates innate immune responses. Specifically, AST IV balances the inflammatory response to mitigate tissue damage and promote tissue repair. However, whether AST IV directly targets AM to alleviate lung damage induced by respiratory viral infection remains unclear. Our results demonstrate that AST IV treatment significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in mice during IAV infection. AST IV markedly decreases proinflammatory cytokine levels, mitigates lung injury and promotes lung recovery through enhancing the repair capacity mediated by alveolar type II cells. Mechanistically, AST IV suppresses the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, which is critical for driving inflammatory responses in AM while maintaining mitochondrial fitness. Thus, our findings suggest that AST IV effectively targets AM to alleviate inflammation and lung damage caused by respiratory viral infections, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for managing viral pneumonia.

        <tr id="Seasonal influenza continues to be a global health problem. Current existing vaccines and antivirals against influenza have limited effectiveness, and typically do not stay ahead of the viral evolutionary curve. Broad-spectrum antiviral agents that are effective therapeutically and prophylactically are much needed. We have created a promising new broad-spectrum anti-influenza agent using molecular engineering of a lectin from bananas, H84T, which is well-tolerated and protective in small animal models. However, the potency and effect of H84T on human immune cells and influenza-specific immune responses are undetermined. We found that H84T efficiently inhibited influenza A virus (IAV) replication in primary human dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from blood and tonsil, preserved DC viability and allowed acquisition and presentation of viral antigen. Excitingly, H84T-treated DCs subsequently initiated effective expansion of IAV-specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, H84T preserved the capacity of IAV-exposed DCs to present a second non-IAV antigen and induce robust antigen-specific CD8 T cell expansion. Our data support H84T as a potent antiviral in humans as it not only effectively inhibits IAV infection, but also preserves induction of robust pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses against diverse antigens, which likely is clinically beneficial.">

Assessing the specificity of cTFH subsets to individual malaria antigens is vital to understanding the variation observed in antibody responses and identifying promising malaria vaccine candidates. Using spectral flow cytometry and unbiased clustering analysis, we assessed antigen-specific cTFH cell recall responses in vitro to malaria vaccine candidates Pf-schizont egress antigen-1 (PfSEA-1A) and Pf-glutamic acid-rich protein (PfGARP) within a cross-section of children and adults living in a malaria-holoendemic region of western Kenya. In children, a broad array of cTFH subsets (defined by cytokine and transcription factor expression) were reactive to both malaria antigens, PfSEA-1A and PfGARP, while adults had a narrow profile centering on cTFH17- and cTFH1/17-like subsets following stimulation with PfGARP only. Because TFH17 cells are involved in the maintenance of memory antibody responses within the context of parasitic infections, our results suggest that PfGARP might generate longer-lived antibody responses compared to PfSEA-1A. These findings have intriguing implications for evaluating malaria vaccine candidates as they highlight the importance of including cTFH profiles when assessing interdependent correlates of protective immunity.">

Consequently, gnotobiotic mice colonized with OMM12 have more severe LCMV-induced disease pathology but also enhance viral clearance in the intestinal tract. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of adoptively transferred virus-specific T helper cells and endogenous T helper cells in the intestinal tract reveal a stronger pro-inflammatory Th1 profile and a more vigorous expansion in OMM12 than SPF mice. Altogether, our work highlights the causative function of the intestinal microbiome for shaping adaptive anti-viral immunity with implications for vaccination strategies and anti-cancer treatment regimens.">

In addition to unleashing antitumor immunity, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapies disrupt immune regulatory networks critical for maintaining homeostasis in various tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Despite growing reports of cancer- and ICI-related cognitive impairments among survivors, our understanding of the pathophysiology of ICI-related neurodegenerative effects is limited. Methods. In this study, using a murine model of melanoma, cognitive function tests, and neuroimmunological assays, we investigate the cellular mechanisms and impact of combinatorial blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 on brain function. Syngeneic melanoma was induced in a C57Bl6 mouse model using D4M-3A.UV2 melanoma cells. After confirmation of tumor growth, cancer-bearing and non-cancer mice received combinatorial treatment of anti-CTLA-4 (two doses per week) and anti-PD-1 (three doses per week) for three weeks. One month after completing ICI treatment, mice were administered learning, memory, and memory consolidation cognitive function tasks. Neuroinflammation, synaptic, and myelin integrity analyses and immune cell status in the brain were conducted to analyze neuroimmunological changes post-ICI treatment. Results. While tumor-related alterations in brain function were evident, combination ICI specifically disrupted synaptic integrity and reduced myelin levels independent of neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity in both cancer-bearing and non-cancer mice brains. Combination ICI selectively impaired hippocampal-dependent cognitive function. This is associated with two-fold increase in T cell numbers within the brain along with immune activation of myeloid cells, especially microglia. Furthermore, an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model revealed that combination ICI predisposes the CNS to exacerbated autoimmunity, highlighting neuroinflammation-related, and tumor-independent, neurodegenerative sequelae of combination ICI. Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that combinatorial blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 destabilizes neuroimmune-regulatory networks and activates microglia, contributing to long-term neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments. Therefore, selectively limiting microglial activation could be a potential avenue to preserve CNS functions while maintaining the therapeutic benefits of rapidly evolving ICIs and their combinations.">

        <tr id="Immune regulation is recognized as a cornerstone therapeutic strategy for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases. These disorders, driven by dysregulated immune responses, contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Although conventional immunosuppressive therapies provide symptomatic relief, their prolonged use is often associated with severe adverse effects, underscoring the need for safer and more effective treatment approaches. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), derived from immunoregulatory cells such as regulatory T cells, dendritic cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and neutrophils, have emerged as promising candidates for targeted immunomodulation. These nanoscale vesicles inherit the immunosuppressive properties of their parental cells, thereby facilitating immune homeostasis while mitigating the risks associated with other cell-based therapies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the application of immunoregulatory cell-derived EVs for autoimmune disease treatment, with a particular focus on their mechanisms of action within the immune microenvironment. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential future directions in the development of EV-based therapies for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Human infection with Trypanosoma cruzi leads to Chagas disease that induces profound changes in the immune response across different cell subsets, influencing parasite control and disease pathology. Dissecting the functional characteristics of distinct immune cells in patients with the asymptomatic (indeterminate - IND) or with the cardiac (CCC) clinical forms is crucial for unveiling mechanisms of disease progression and pathology and identifying disease markers.


METHODS
Here, immune-gene targeted single-cell RNA sequencing was applied to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from IND and CCC patients to unravel the immune landscape in this polar, well-characterized, clinical groups.


RESULTS
Our findings revealed different myeloid and lymphoid cell clusters in both cohorts, each exhibiting unique gene expression patterns. CCC was characterized by an increased frequency of KLRB1+CD4+, TBX21+CD8+ T cells, and NK cells, which exhibited upregulation of genes associated with cytotoxic and apoptotic responses. Furthermore, we observed monocyte, B cell subsets, along with dendritic cells, expressing inflammatory and notably cytotoxic genes.


CONCLUSIONS
These results reveal cell-specific changes in CCC compared to IND chronic Chagas disease patients, highlighted by distinct gene expression patterns. These nuanced changes indicate immune signature linked to the clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease, which provide information regarding disease pathology, indicating potential markers related to the disease progression.">

        <tr id="Cancer cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating antigen presentation, allowing them to escape detection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and resist immunotherapy. Dendritic cells (DCs), one of the potent antigen-presenting cells in cancer immunity, are essential for initiating adaptive immune responses. Unfortunately, DC functions are disrupted by the tumor microenvironment. Suppressive cytokines, for instance, can impair DC maturation, reduce antigen-presenting capacity, or induce DC apoptosis. A novel strategy against such challenges is reprogramming cancer cells into DC-like cells. By inducing transcription factors, cancer cells can be directed to develop a DC phenotype, which is characterized by enhanced antigen-presenting markers, co-stimulatory molecules, and an increased ability to prime naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, showing enhanced immune activation and tumor regression. However, limitations remain, including reprogramming efficiency, tumor heterogeneity, and safety issues that require further refinement. This review provides fundamental knowledge about DC in the tumor microenvironment and cell fate reprogramming, recent advances in reprogramming cancer cells into DCs, and eventually discusses perspectives for translating this approach into clinical settings. This innovative reprogramming strategy holds the potential to overcome current limitations in cancer immunotherapy, offering a novel avenue for durable anti-tumor immunity">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key players in the immune system, exhibiting remarkable plasticity that allows them to influence cancer progression in opposing ways. Their polarization into M1 or M2 subtypes dictates their impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME). M1 macrophages, characterized by pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor functions, release cytokines that enhance immune responses and promote tumor destruction. Conversely, M2 macrophages support tumor growth by facilitating angiogenesis, immune suppression, and tissue remodeling, thereby creating a favorable environment for cancer progression. Further classification of M2 macrophages into subtypes M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d underscores their diverse roles in tumor development, metastasis, and immune evasion. Given their crucial role in shaping the TME, macrophages have become a major focus in cancer research. Recent therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram macrophages, shifting their phenotype from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressive. By targeting macrophage polarization, researchers seek to develop novel immunotherapies that enhance treatment efficacy, improve patient outcomes, and combat therapy resistance in cancer.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) are pivotal cell populations involved in the immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, there has been little success in large-scale clinical trials of myeloid cell modulators. We aim to investigate potential molecular targets for TIMs and disclose the underlying mechanism. Using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we analyzed 24 spontaneous HCC tissues from mouse. Orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor models were established with or without anti-SIRPα antibody treatment. Patient-derived tumor xenografts model (PDX) was used to identify the CD47-SIRPα axis blocked therapy. In 24 murine spontaneous HCC tissues, we observed that the proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) plus macrophages accounts for 40–90% of TIMs and SIRPα was highly expressed in TIMs, especially in macrophages and MDSCs. Through in vivo experiments, we showed that anti-SIRPα therapy inhibited tumor growth, accompanied by increased CD8+ T cells infiltration and decreased TIMs including MDSCs and macrophages. We found that anti-SIRPα inhibited immunosuppressive function, migration and PD-L1 expression of myeloid cells. In a series of in vivo experiments, we demonstrated the anti-tumor and immune-active effect of SIRPα-blocked therapy. Mechanistically, anti-SIRPα inhibited the immunosuppressive function and PD-L1 expression of TIMs through downregulating PI3K/AKT signaling in myeloid cells. At last, anti-SIRPα enhanced the antitumor effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy in orthotopic and spontaneous murine models. Together, SIRPα blocked therapy reversed the immunosuppressive TIME, which provides a promising therapeutic rationale for increasing the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in treating HCC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cervical cancer progression is not solely driven by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection but is profoundly influenced by the local immune microenvironment, particularly chronic cytokine imbalances. Unlike the acute cytokine storms observed in infections or sepsis, cervical cancer is characterized by a persistent, low-grade, “smoldering inflammatory response” that fuels tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8 sustain a tumor-supportive milieu, promoting angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and resistance to apoptosis, while immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β dampen anti-tumor immune responses and facilitate immune escape. This review explores chronic cytokine dysregulation in cervical cancer, examining how the prolonged, dysregulated cytokine network shapes the tumor microenvironment, remodels stromal interactions, and influences immune cell recruitment and function. We highlight key cytokines involved in these processes and discuss their clinical significance as potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Understanding these sustained inflammatory processes is critical because they represent a distinct biological landscape compared to acute inflammatory reactions and offer unique windows for therapeutic intervention. The paper reviewed emerging therapeutic strategies targeting these chronic cytokine pathways, including cytokine blockade, immune modulation, and combination approaches integrating immunotherapies or nanomedicine. Addressing chronic cytokine dysregulation holds promise for improving cervical cancer management and patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The immune system plays a major role in pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a devastating lung disease with limited treatment options. Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immune cells with remarkable immunosuppressive functions. We hypothesized that their anti‐inflammatory activity may dampen PF by inhibiting inflammation and its transition to fibrosis. Here, we studied the emergence of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)‐ and monocytic (M)‐MDSCs in a murine model of PF. We assessed immunological, histopathological, and clinical changes at days 3, 7, 14, and 21 following bleomycin challenge. A comprehensive overview of the role of MDSCs during the acute lung injury and chronic phase of pulmonary fibrosis is provided, along with the effects of MDSCs adoptive transfer and depletion. Inflammation and fibrosis increased over a period of 21 days after bleomycin administration. In the lung, the number of PMN‐MDSCs increased, while M‐MDSCs decreased over the time following bleomycin challenge. Especially, M‐MDSCs showed enhanced suppressive activity on day 3 following bleomycin challenge. Adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs attenuated inflammation and fibrosis development. However, depletion of PMN‐MDSCs did not lead to an exacerbation of PF. Our results suggest that adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs can ameliorate the inflammatory responses and thus the development of fibrosis in a bleomycin‐induced pulmonary fibrosis model.">

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial damage. However, the involvement of immune cells and the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells remain poorly understood. We successfully established a mouse model of viral myocarditis induced by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury at different time points. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed at the peak of immune cell infiltration to characterize the immune landscape of infected cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Macrophage depletion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition were performed to validate the immune-stromal crosstalk. Peak immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury occurred on the 7th day of infection. scRNA-seq revealed that endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) were the most substantially expanded cell populations in the hearts of mice with viral infection. Trem2 macrophage, characterized by tissue repair gene signatures, was the predominant MNP subcluster in the infected heart, while tip cells and capillaries were the most expanded endothelial cell clusters. Cell-cell communication analysis identified increased macrophage-endothelial cell interactions during CVB3 infection. Macrophage-derived VEGFA secretion, partially induced by CVB3 infection and apoptotic cardiomyocyte debris, promoted angiogenesis, while macrophage depletion resulted in reduced VEGFA secretion and endothelial proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the protective role of angiogenesis in myocarditis progression. In summary, these results elucidated a cardioprotective role of macrophage-driven angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during viral myocarditis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for inflammatory heart diseases.">

Herein, we report an abnormal ISC death that occurs in Crohn’s disease, which exacerbates colitis, limits ISC-dependent mucosal repair, and is controlled through the death factor Transmembrane protein 219 (TMEM219). Large alterations in TMEM219 expression were observed in patients with Crohn’s disease, particularly in those with active disease and/or those who were nonresponders to conventional therapy, confirming that TMEM219 signaling is abnormally activated and leads to failure of the mucosal regenerative response. Mechanistic studies revealed a proapoptotic TMEM219-mediated molecular signature in Crohn’s disease, which associates with Caspase-8 activation and ISC death. Pharmacological blockade of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 binding/signal with the recombinant protein ecto-TMEM219 restored the self-renewal abilities of miniguts generated from patients with Crohn’s disease in vitro and ameliorated DSS-induced and T cell-mediated colitis in vivo, ultimately leading to mucosal healing. Genetic tissue-specific deletion of TMEM219 in ISCs in newly generated TMEM219fl/flLGR5cre mice revived their mucosal regenerative abilities both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that a TMEM219-dependent ISC death exacerbates colitis and that TMEM219 blockade reestablishes intestinal self-renewal properties in IBD.">

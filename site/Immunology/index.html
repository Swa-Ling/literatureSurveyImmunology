        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Somatic mutations inactivating TET2 are among the most common drivers of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). While TET2 inactivation is associated with monocyte-derived inflammation and improved chimeric antigen-receptor-T cell function, its impact on immunotherapy response is unknown. In our mouse model, hematopoietic Tet2 mutation enhanced immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response. Enhanced ICB response with Tet2 mutation required phagocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells. Mechanistically, in Tet2-mutant tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs), ICB preferentially induced anti-tumor states and restricted cell states linked to tumor progression. Tet2-mutant monocytes activated costimulatory programs, while Tet2-mutant T cells showed enhanced T cell memory signatures, lesser exhaustion and decreased regulatory phenotype. Our murine data was clinically relevant, since we found that melanomas from patients with TET2 driver mutation-CH (TET2-CH) showed enhanced immune infiltration, T cell activation, and T cell memory programs. In melanoma patients treated with ICB, TET2-CH was associated with 6-fold greater odds of clinical benefit. Collectively, our data establishes that hematopoietic Tet2 inactivation primes leukocytes for anti-tumor states associated with immunotherapy response and provides a potential biomarker for personalized therapy.">

        <tr id="Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is a major oncogenic driver in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promising therapeutic effects, overcoming resistance with immunotherapy becomes necessary when resistance develops. However, various clinical trials have revealed that their efficacies remain limited. To investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) factors contributing to poor immune checkpoint blockade responses in ALK-positive patients, we performed single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors with and without ALK rearrangements. Integrative analysis with additional public LUAD cohorts revealed distinct immune landscapes in ALK-positive tumors, marked by enriched innate immunity and depleted adaptive immunity. ALK-positive malignant cells exhibit higher stemness and aggressive phenotype. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in these tumors predominantly maintain pro-tumoral M2-like states, reinforcing immune suppression. B cells show reduced immune reactivity and impaired tertiary lymphoid structure formation, while CD8+ T cells display bystander-like signatures and reduced tumor reactivity. Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles combined with regulatory network analysis suggest that differences in transcription factor activities, rather than chromatin accessibility, may underlie T cell dysfunction. These findings provide insights into the immunosuppressive TME of ALK-positive LUAD, potentially explaining the failure of recent immunotherapy trials and highlighting targets for improving efficacy.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) generally acquire immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting phenotypes, which may contribute to tumor resistance to immunotherapy. We previously showed that suppression of microRNA activity through genetic Dicer1 inactivation rewires TAM’s transcriptomes and prompts their immunostimulatory activation. This phenotypic switch enhanced recruitment and activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and improved the efficacy of immunotherapy in mouse cancer models. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of whole tumors grown in either wild-type mice or mice with macrophage-specific Dicer1 deletion. The analysis of multiple cell populations, including several discrete monocyte and macrophage subsets, indicated broad and convergent immunostimulatory programming of the tumor microenvironment, which was dependent on CTL-derived interferon-gamma (IFNγ), in mice with DICER-deficient macrophages. Intriguingly, dynamic inferences on monocyte/macrophage ontogeny and differentiation by pseudotime analysis revealed trajectories associated with progression into cell cycle, monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, and transition from an immunostimulatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in tumors with DICER-proficient macrophages. Dicer1 deficiency interfered with this trajectory and stalled TAMs at an intermediate state between immature monocytes and macrophages with T cell-stimulatory capacity, thereby impeding immunosuppressive TAM development. This translated into enhanced response to antiangiogenic immunotherapy in an immunotherapy-resistant model of non-small cell lung cancer. Cycling/M2-like macrophages were conserved in human melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma and should represent a more promising therapeutic target than the bulk of TAMs.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic reinforcement of T cell exhaustion is known to be a major barrier limiting T cell responses during immunotherapy. However, the core epigenetic regulators restricting antitumor immunity during prolonged antigen exposure are not clear. We investigated three commonly mutated epigenetic regulators that promote clonal hematopoiesis to determine whether they affect T cell stemness and response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. CD8 T cells lacking Dnmt3a, Tet2, or Asxl1 preserved a progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) population for more than 1 year during chronic antigen exposure without undergoing malignant transformation. Asxl1 controlled the self-renewal capacity of T cells and reduced CD8 T cell differentiation through H2AK119 ubiquitination and epigenetic modification of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase pathway. Asxl1-deficient T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy to improve tumor control in experimental models and conferred a survival advantage to mutated T cells from treated patients. Editor’s summary T cell immunotherapies have been successful in treating some intractable cancers, but there are limitations caused by the inability of T cells to persist after prolonged stimulation. Kang et al. undertook a reverse-translation approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating the durability of T cell responsiveness to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Tsui and Kallies). Inspired by clinical observations from individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome, the epigenetic regulators (Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1) associated with clonal hematopoiesis were identified using experimental models of T cell exhaustion. Epigenetic disruption of the polycomb group repressive deubiquitinase complex resulted in preservation of a stem cell–like T cell population that was responsive to immunotherapy. Extending this mechanism to cancer adoptive cell therapy, Asxl1 disruption was found to endow T cells with superior therapeutic efficacy and an ability to synergize with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Sustained stimulation of CD8 T cells promotes the development of functional exhaustion, a terminal cell fate that has been broadly recognized to limit the durability of T cell–based immunotherapies. This state of exhaustion arises though a progressive transition of multipotent progenitor T cells (Tpex) into a terminally differentiated population (Tex) that has been defined as being nonresponsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The molecular determinants dictating the developmental transition are now being investigated as engineering targets to block the progression of T cell exhaustion and preserve the durability of immunotherapy approaches. RATIONALE We recently observed that the long-term survival of a small cohort of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients treated with anti–PD-L1 therapy was coupled to mutation of the ASXL1 gene among their T cells. Mutations in ASXL1, in addition to DNMT3A and TET2, are commonly associated with conferring a survival advantage among hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in subclonal outgrowth referred to as clonal hematopoiesis. Because of their general link to cellular stemness, we investigated the role of these regulators in the developmental transition of Tpex into Tex and the impact of deletion of these regulators on therapeutic durability during anti–PD-L1 treatment. RESULTS To investigate the role of Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1 in the development and maintenance of an ICB-responsive T cell population, we engineered T cells to contain mutations within each of these genes and then exposed them to a chronic source of antigen by adoptively transferring them into mice infected with the clone 13 strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Disruption of these regulators in a canonical model of T cell exhaustion allowed them to maintain their quantity and ICB-responsive state for >1 year during chronic antigen exposure. Despite being stimulated and undergoing antigen-driven proliferation for 1 year, these T cells did not exhibit any signs of malignant outgrowth. Moreover, the total pool of T cells containing each of these mutations was enriched for a large quantity of stem-like Tcf1+ T cells. Fate-tracking adoptive transfer experiments revealed that this Tcf1+ subset of ASXL1 KO T cells could both self-renew and give rise to potent effectors. Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of the knockout (KO) T cells identified Asxl1 as a regulator of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, controlling the deubiquitination of histone 2A lysine 119, which serves as a molecular checkpoint for the developmental transition of Tpex into Tex. Extension of this mechanistic insight into tumor models revealed that adoptively transferred T cells with Asxl1 disruption resisted tumor microenvironment–induced exhaustion. Moreover, the adoptively transferred Asxl1 KO T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 blockade, resulting in heightened tumor control. Finally, we show that Asxl1 disruption of tumor-specific T cells correlates with increased expansion of T cells in MDS patients after treatment with anti–PD-L1. CONCLUSION Results from these studies show that DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 control the developmental checkpoint between Tpex and terminally exhausted T cells. Specific investigation into Asxl1 revealed its role in T cell differentiation through epigenetic modification of the PR-DUB pathway. These data articulate a reverse-translation approach for defining molecular mechanisms that restrict maintenance of the ICB-responsive stem-like T cells within a suppressive tumor microenvironment. Through our mechanistic investigation of genes associated with patient survival, we have established a scientific rationale for specific genetic modification of discrete epigenetic regulators for future engineering to enhance the durability of cancer immunotherapy. Core epigenetic regulators in maintaining therapeutic durable multipotent Tpex populations. Using the canonical murine model system of exhaustion, disruption of Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1 in CD8 T cells preserved an ICB-responsive Tpex population for >1 year during chronic antigen exposure. Specific investigation into the new epigenetic regulator Asxl1 revealed that this unprecedented maintenance of Tpex is mediated by presence of monoubiqutinated histone 2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) through disruption of the PR-DUB complex.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are critical human pathogens that continually expand to naïve populations and for which there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain. Author Summary Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes brain inflammation in both animals and humans when transmitted by mosquito bite or infectious aerosols. The mechanisms underlying disease caused by VEEV, including the role of the immune response in brain pathology, are not well understood. Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the immune response to VEEV in the brain over time using two advanced sequencing techniques. Following infection, immune cells infiltrate the brain in a sequential fashion and display different activation profiles. Different types of immune cells also display strikingly different spatial patterns throughout the brain. This study provides the most comprehensive description of the immune response to VEEV in the brain performed to date and advances our understanding of immune-driven neuropathology and identification of therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Tumor endothelial (TECs) cells play a critical role in regulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the mechanisms by which TECs modulate immune cell population remain unclear, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we investigated how NSCLC cells tweak normal endothelial cells (NECs) into TECs and the subsequent effects on immune regulation. NECs were cocultured with various NSCLC cell lines, using 2D and 3D coculture models to evaluate TEC-mediated effects on immune cells. We show that direct coculture led to significant transcriptomic, proteomic and kinomic alterations in TECs, especially in pro-inflammatory pathways. We identified a downregulation of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40L in TECs compared to NECs, suggesting impaired T-cell proliferation support. While TECs showed a limited effect on CD8+ T-cell activation, TECs supported CD4 T-cells polarization into Treg and Th22 subsets. Moreover, TECs also promoted M2-like macrophages polarization, thereby potentially contributing to the TME immunosuppression. State-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing of 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) revealed distinct TEC subpopulations, including an inflammatory subset with UPR signature. The latter was absent in 2D-cultured NECs but present in freshly isolated and 2D-cultured TECs from NSCLC patients. Importantly, we also identified within MCTS a perivascular M2-like macrophage subset, predicted to interact with TECs with MIF and Midkine signaling. In conclusion, TECs in NSCLC tumors play a pivotal role in remodeling the TME immune landscape by promoting immune suppression. This study highlights the complex immunoregulatory functions of TECs within our different in vitro models that mimic aspects of the TME. Our data may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting TECs or regulatory signaling to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC.">

IgE PCs had distinct surface and gene expression profiles in these different tissues compared with other Ig isotypes. IgE BMPCs up-regulated genes associated with prosurvival and BM homing, whereas IgE dLN PCs expressed genes associated with recent class switching and differentiation. IgE PCs also exhibited higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein coding genes and higher antibody secretion rate when compared with IgG1.

        <tr id="Introduction Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, demonstrating exceptional clinical responses in a wide range of cancers. Despite the success, a significant proportion of patients still fail to respond, highlighting the existence of unappreciated mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance. Delineating such mechanisms is paramount to minimize immunotherapy failures and optimize the clinical benefit. Methods In this study, we treated tumour-bearing mice with PD-L1 blockage antibody (aPD-L1) immunotherapy, to investigate its effects on cancer-induced emergency myelopoiesis, focusing on bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We examined the impact of aPD-L1 treatment on HSPC quiescence, proliferation, transcriptomic profile, and functionality. Results Herein, we reveal that aPD-L1 in tumour-bearing mice targets the HSPCs in the BM, mediating their exit from quiescence and promoting their proliferation. Notably, disruption of the PDL1/PD1 axis induces transcriptomic reprogramming in HSPCs, observed in both individuals with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and tumour-bearing mice, shifting towards an inflammatory state. Furthermore, HSPCs from aPDL1-treated mice demonstrated resistance to cancer-induced emergency myelopoiesis, evidenced by a lower generation of MDSCs compared to control-treated mice. Discussion Our findings shed light on unrecognized mechanisms of action of ICB immunotherapy in cancer, which involves targeting of BM-driven HSPCs and reprogramming of cancer-induced emergency myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="Obesity induces diverse changes in host immunity, resulting in worse disease outcomes following infection with various pathogens, including arthritogenic alphaviruses. However, the impact of obesity on the functional landscape of immune cells during arthritogenic alphavirus infection remains unexplored. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the blood and tissue immune responses to Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection in lean and obese mice. Footpad injection of MAYV caused significant shifts in immune cell populations and induced robust expression of interferon response and proinflammatory cytokine genes and related pathways in both blood and tissue. In MAYV-infected lean mice, analysis of the local tissue response revealed a unique macrophage subset with high expression of IFN response genes that was not found in obese mice. This was associated with less severe inflammation in lean mice. These results provide evidence for a unique macrophage population that may contribute to the superior capacity of lean mice to control arthritogenic alphavirus infection. Graphical abstract Highlights Obesity worsens disease outcomes following arthritogenic alphavirus infection. Arthritogenic alphavirus infection causes significant shifts in immune cell populations in the blood and footpad. Blood monocytes from lean mice had higher expression of interferon response genes at the later stage of infection. Footpads in lean mice have an expanded population of F4/80lo macrophages with an intense interferon response gene signature before and after alphavirus infection that is not found in obese mice. Macrophages in obese mice express lower levels of interferon response genes, have a unique necroptosis signature, and higher F4/80 expression.">

        <tr id="Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile bacterium responsible for conditions ranging from mild skin and soft-tissue infections to serious disorders such as pneumonia and sepsis. Monocytes play a role in protection against pathogens by migrating to inflamed tissues and differentiating into macrophages but their specific role in the context of S. aureus pulmonary infection has not been fully elucidated. Using a CCR2-DTR transgenic mouse model we demonstrate that over the course of infection monocyte depletion resulted in worse airway clearance of S. aureus. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of CCR2-DTR mice after S. aureus infection displayed significant decreases in interleukin-12 (IL-12), IFN-γ, IP-10, MIG and RANTES, all IFN-γ regulated, compared to wild-type (WT) infected controls. NK cells were identified as the main producers of IFN-γ, but both NK cells and IFN-γ were dispensable for clearance. We demonstrated through cytokine production and RNA-seq analysis that IL-12 and IL-12 regulated genes are strongly induced in monocytes upon S. aureus infection. Administration of IL-12 during infection restored the bacterial burdens in the BALF and lungs of monocyte-depleted CCR2-DTR mice to the levels of WT mice, independent of IFN-γ. In the absence of monocytes, alveolar macrophages are the primary phagocytic cells, and IL-12 influences their capacity to produce reactive oxygen species and clear S. aureus. These results show that production of IL-12 contributes to the control of S. aureus via its influence on alveolar macrophage function.">

        <tr id="Despite our increasing understanding of macrophage heterogeneity, drivers of macrophage phenotypic and functional polarization in the microenvironment are not fully elucidated. Here, our single-cell RNA sequencing data identify a subpopulation of macrophages expressing high levels of the phagocytic receptor MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK+ macrophages), which is closely associated with melanoma progression and immunotherapy resistance. Adoptive transfer of the MerTK+ macrophages into recipient mice notably accelerated tumor growth regardless of macrophage depletion. Mechanistic studies further revealed that ALK And LTK Ligand 1 (ALKAL1), a target gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), facilitated MerTK phosphorylation, resulting in heightened phagocytic activity of MerTK+ macrophages and their subsequent polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Specifically targeted delivery of AhR antagonist to tumor-associated macrophages with mannosylated micelles could suppress MerTK expression and improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti–programmed cell death ligand 1 therapy. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanism of MerTK+ macrophages and provide strategies for improving the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Type 1 immunity mediates host defense through pathogen elimination, but whether this pathway also impacts tissue function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that rapid induction of IFNγ signaling coordinates a multi-cellular response that is critical to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility following infection of mice with a tissue-invasive helminth. IFNγ production is initiated by antigen-independent activation of lamina propria CD8+ T cells following MyD88-dependent recognition of the microbiota during helminth-induced barrier invasion. IFNγ acted directly on intestinal stromal cells to recruit neutrophils that limited parasite-induced tissue injury. IFNγ sensing also limited the expansion of smooth muscle actin-expressing cells to prevent pathological gut dysmotility. Importantly, this tissue-protective response had limited impact on parasite burden, indicating that IFNγ supports a disease tolerance defense strategy. Our results have important implications for managing the pathophysiological sequelae of post-infectious gut dysfunction and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with stromal remodelling. HIGHLIGHTS Type 1 immunity is required for disease tolerance to tissue-invasive infection. Gut-resident CD8+ T cells produce IFNγ in an antigen-independent, yet microbiota-dependent manner. IFNγ signaling recruits neutrophils in a cell-extrinsic manner to limit helminth-induced tissue injury. Direct sensing of IFNγ by intestinal stroma is essential to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility during infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant healthcare burden worldwide, characterized by a complex interplay between obesity and chronic inflammation. While the relationship between CRC, obesity and altered lipid metabolism is not fully understood, there are evidences suggesting a link between them. In this study, we hypothesized that dysregulated lipid metabolism contributes to local accumulation of foam cells (FC) in CRC, which in turn disrupts antitumor immunosurveillance. Methods Tumor infiltrating FC and CD8+ were quantified by digital pathology in patients affected by T2–T4 CRC with any N stage undergoing radical upfront surgery (n=65) and correlated with patients’ clinical outcomes. Multiparametric high-resolution flow cytometry analysis and bulk RNAseq of CRC tissue were conducted to evaluate the phenotype and transcriptomic program of immune cell infiltrate in relation to FC accumulation. The immunosuppressive effects of FC and mechanistic studies on FC-associated transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and anti-PD-L1 inhibition were explored using an in-vitro human model of lipid-engulfed macrophages. Results FC (large CD68+ Bodipy+ macrophages) accumulated at the tumor margin in CRC samples. FChigh tumors exhibited reduced CD8+ T cells and increased regulatory T cells (Tregs). Functional transcriptional profiling depicted an immunosuppressed milieu characterized by reduced interferon gamma, memory CD8+ T cells, and activated macrophages mirrored by increased T-cell exhaustion and Treg enrichment. Furthermore, FChigh tumor phenotype was independent of standard clinical factors but correlated with high body mass index (BMI) and plasma saturated fatty acid levels. In CD8low tumors, the FChigh phenotype was associated with a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 8.6% compared with 28.7% of FClow (p=0.001). In-vitro studies demonstrated that FC significantly impact on CD8 proliferation in TFG-β dependent manner, while inhibition of TGF-β FC-related factors restored antitumor immunity. Conclusions FC exert immunosuppressive activity through a TGF-β-related pathway, resulting in a CD8-excluded microenvironment and identifying immunosuppressed tumors with worse prognosis in patients with primary CRC. FC association with patient BMI and dyslipidemia might explain the link of CRC with obesity, and offers novel therapeutic and preventive perspectives in this specific clinical setting.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Certain cancers present challenges for treatment because they are resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), attributed to low tumor mutational burden and the absence of T cell-inflamed features. Among these, glioblastoma (GBM) is notoriously resistant to ICB. To overcome this resistance, the identification of T cells with heightened stemness marked by T-cell factor 1 (TCF1) expression has gained attention. Several studies have explored ways to preserve stem-like T cells and prevent terminal exhaustion. In this study, we investigate a target that triggers stem-like properties in CD8 T cells to enhance the response to ICB in a murine GBM model. Methods Using Fcgr2b−/− mice and a murine GL261 GBM model, we confirmed the efficacy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) immunotherapy, observing improved survival. Analysis of immune cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and single-cell RNA sequencing delineated distinct subsets of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells in Fcgr2b−/− mice. The crucial role of the stem-like feature in the response to anti-PD-1 treatment for reinvigorating CD8 T cells was analyzed. Adoptive transfer of OT-I cells into OVA-expressing GL261 models and CD8 T cell depletion in Fcgr2b−/− mice confirmed the significance of Fcgr2b−/− CD8 T cells in enhancing the antitumor response. Last, S1P1 inhibitor treatment confirmed that the main source of tumor antigen-specific Fcgr2b−/− CD8 T cells is the tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs). Results In a murine GBM model, anti-PD-1 monotherapy and single-Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIb (FcγRIIB) deletion exhibit limited efficacy. However, their combination substantially improves survival by enhancing cytotoxicity and proliferative capacity in tumor-infiltrating Fcgr2b−/− CD8 T cells. The improved response to anti-PD-1 treatment is associated with the tumor-specific memory T cells (Ttsms) exhibiting high stemness characteristics within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Ttsms in the TdLN thrives in a protective environment, maintaining stem-like characteristics and serving as a secure source for tumor infiltration. This underscores the significance of FcγRIIB ablation in triggering Ttsms and enhancing ICB therapy against GBM. Conclusions Deletion of FcγRIIB on CD8 T cells leads to the generation of a Ttsms, which is localized in TdLN and protected from the immunosuppressive TME. Incorporating these highly stemness-equipped Ttsms enhances the response to anti-PD-1 therapy in immune-suppressed brain tumors.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) enhances T cell responses against cancer, leading to long-term survival in a fraction of patients. CD8+ T cell differentiation in response to chronic antigen stimulation is highly complex, and it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states at which anatomic sites are critical for the response to ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population in the white pulp of the spleen that underwent substantial expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increased systemic antigen redirected differentiation of this population toward a more circulatory exhausted KLR state, whereas a lack of cross-presented tumor antigen reduced its differentiation in the spleen. An analogous population of exhausted KLR CD8+ T cells in human blood samples exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability. Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role of antigen density within the spleen for the differentiation and expansion of T cell clonotypes in response to ICB. Response to ICB depends on optimal splenic antigen levels, whereas increased antigen induces differentiation to circulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T cell dysfunction is a defining feature of many tumor types, but how tumor-specific T cells progress to a terminally exhausted state and which populations are targeted by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains incompletely understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, Morgan et al. profiled T cell differentiation states across different anatomical sites including tumors, draining lymph nodes, and the white pulp of the spleen from tumor-bearing mice treated with ICB. A population of splenic intermediate-exhausted T cells supplied most of the ICB-elicited tumor-specific T cell response, which required low levels of cross-presented tumor antigen in the spleen. Together, these findings identify the spleen as an important site for generating a tumor-specific T cell response after ICB. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to have a poor prognosis due to its ability to relapse following initial response to chemotherapy. While immunotherapies hold the promise to revolutionize cancer treatment, AML has been particularly challenging to target. It is therefore important to better understand the relationship between AML cells and immune cells within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, where this disease grows. Here we focus on non-malignant BM macrophages, and using a combination of intravital microscopy, flow cytometry, transcriptomics and functional analyses we identify a subpopulation of immunomodulatory BM macrophages (IMMs) with a unique profile and function during AML progression. While the majority of macrophages are already being lost at early infiltration, IMMs are locally enriched. They are capable of efferocytosis and support AML growth through inhibition of T cells. Enrichment of IMMs in the BM of patients developing early relapse indicates that future development of interventions that target IMMs’ development and function may improve AML patients’ outcome.">

        <tr id="Tumor cell–originated events prevent efficient antitumor immune response and limit the application of anti-PD1 checkpoint immunotherapy. We show that syndecan-1 (SDC1) has a critical role in the regulation of T cell–mediated control of tumor growth. SDC1 inhibition increases the permeation of CD8+ T cells into tumors and triggers CD8+ T cell–mediated control of tumor growth, accompanied by increased proportions of progenitor-exhausted and effector-like CD8+ T cells. SDC1 deficiency alters multiple signaling events in tumor cells, including enhanced IFN-γ–STAT1 signaling, and augments antigen presentation and sensitivity to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Combinatory inhibition of SDC1 markedly potentiates the therapeutic effects of anti-PD1 in inhibiting tumor growth. Consistently, the findings are supported by the data from human tumors showing that SDC1 expression negatively correlates with T cell presence in tumor tissues and the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our findings suggest that SDC1 inhibits antitumor immunity, and that targeting SDC1 may promote anti-PD1 response for cancer treatment.">

The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who will progress to severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. In patients with overweight/obesity these signatures are exacerbated compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic capacity compared to non-SD. Furthermore, type-I Interferon signalling is downregulated in SD, suggesting defective virus-sensing mechanisms may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction.

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells prevent autoimmunity and facilitate cancer immune evasion. Depletion of Tregs is a promising cancer therapy, but risks of autoimmune reactions hamper its clinical translation. Here, we demonstrate that temporally induced deletion of Ube2n in Tregs (Ube2nTreg-KO) of adult mice results in a robust expansion and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells in response to cancer cell challenges, producing a long-lasting survival benefit without autoimmune complications. The anti-tumor effect persists following adoptive T-cell transfer to T-cell-deficient Rag1-knockout mice. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that UBE2N deletion shifted immunosuppressive Tregs to effector-like T-cells. This shift is characterized by the downregulation of c-Myc target genes, resembling that observed in tumor-infiltrating Tregs of melanoma patients. Further analyses confirm that UBE2N maintains c-Myc protein stability via suppression of K48-Ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Taken together, our studies uncover a hitherto unexplored and potentially druggable UBE2N/c-Myc signaling axis to eradicate Treg-enabled cancer immune escape.">

We explored the human MAIT cell compartment across organ donor–matched blood, barrier, and lymphoid tissues. MAIT cell population size was donor dependent with distinct tissue compartmentalization patterns and adaptations: Intestinal CD103+ resident MAIT cells presented an immunoregulatory CD39highCD27low profile, whereas MAIT cells expressing NCAM1/CD56 dominated in the liver and exhibited enhanced effector capacity with elevated response magnitude and polyfunctionality. Both intestinal CD39high and hepatic CD56+ adaptations accumulated with donor age. CD56+ MAIT cells displayed limited T cell receptor–repertoire breadth, elevated MR1 binding, and a transcriptional profile skewed toward innate activation pathways. Furthermore, CD56 was dynamically up-regulated to a persistent steady-state equilibrium after exposure to antigen or IL-7. In summary, we demonstrate functional heterogeneity and tissue site adaptation in resident MAIT cells across human barrier tissues with distinct regulatory and effector signatures. Human MAIT cells exhibit tissue site–dependent adaptation and functional specialization. Editor’s summary Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a subset of innate-like T cells that recognize microbial riboflavin pathway–derived metabolites. Our understanding of MAIT cell functions in tissue homeostasis and antimicrobial responses has primarily relied on studies of mice and human peripheral blood. Using paired samples from adult human blood and mucosal and lymphoid tissues, Kammann et al. performed a cross-tissue characterization of human MAIT cells. Tissue-specific adaptations included a population of intestinal CD39hi MAIT cells with an immunoregulatory phenotype and liver-enriched CD56+ MAIT cells bearing enhanced effector capacity and innate-like features. Together, these findings highlight the phenotypic and functional specialization of human MAIT cells within specific tissue sites. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="The potent immunostimulatory effects of toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonism in combination with PD-1 blockade have resulted in various preclinical investigations, yet the mechanism of action in humans remains unknown. To decipher the combinatory mode of action of TLR8 agonism and PD-1 blockade, we employed a unique, open-label, phase 1b pre-operative window of opportunity clinical trial (NCT03906526) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Matched pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from the same lesion were obtained. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and custom multiplex staining to leverage the unique advantage of same-lesion longitudinal sampling. Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased CLEC9A+ dendritic cell and CLEC7A/SYK expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8+ T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13+CD8+ T- cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients. This study provides key insights into the mode of action of TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade immune targeting in HNSCC patients.">

        <tr id="Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) typically present with widespread metastasis, obscuring a temporal understanding of tumor-immune dynamics. We performed multi-site global proteomics and matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. The protein expression profiles were ordered by pseudotime, recapitulating metastatic progression observed in the clinic, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlated with immune cell infiltration and the recruitment of Tregs to counterbalance the effect of γδ and CD4+ T cells. Whilst later-stage metastases recruited Tregs via chemokines induced by SNX8, early-stage tumors relied more on antigen presentation. The exclusion of CD4+ TILs from the epithelium was correlated with metastatic progression, whereas CD8+ TILs were not, likely due to a predominance of exhausted CD8+ T cells. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruited Tregs via MHC class II, resulting in an inflammatory phenotype characterized by limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Additionally, IFI44L expression on macrophages caused immune exclusion by downregulating CD53 on T cells. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC, highlighting potential targets to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Macrophages orchestrate tissue homeostasis and immunity. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophage presence is largely associated with poor prognosis because of their reprogramming into immunosuppressive cells. We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses. Coculture assays and cell-cell communication analyses support that hypoxic-activated macrophages enhance T cell–mediated responses. The NF-κB–associated hypomethylation signature is displayed by a subset of hypoxic inflammatory macrophages, isolated from ovarian tumors. Our results challenge paradigms regarding the effects of hypoxia on macrophages and highlight actionable target cells to modulate anticancer immune responses.">

TNFSF13 is a cytokine important for B cell maturation and function, but roles for epithelial TNFSF13 and putative contribution to inflammatory bowel disease are poorly understood. We evaluated functional consequences of a novel monoallelic TNFSF13 variant using biopsies, tissue-derived colonoids and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived colon organoids. TNFSF13 variant colonoids exhibited a >50% reduction in secreted TNFSF13, increased epithelial proliferation, and reduced apoptosis, which was confirmed in iPSC-derived colon organoids. Single cell RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry, and co-immunoprecipitation identified FAS as the predominant colonic epithelial receptor for TNFSF13. Imaging mass cytometry revealed an increase in epithelial-associated B cells in TNFSF13 variant colon tissue sections. Finally, TNFSF13 variant colonoids co-cultured with memory B cells demonstrated a reduction in the production of IgA+ plasma cells compared to control colonoid co-cultures.

By comparing the microbiota composition between survivors and mice that succumbed to IAV strain PR8 infection, we identified that the commensal bacterium Blautia coccoides protects antibiotics (Abx)-treated or germ-free (GF) mice from PR8 infection by inducing functionally optimal virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Administration of exogenous acetate reproduced the protective effect of B. coccoides monocolonization in Abx and GF mice, enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis as well as secretion of IFN-γ and granzyme B in virus-specific CD8+ T cells, dependent on GPR43 signaling and acetyl-CoA synthetase 2. Thus, we have demonstrated that microbiota-derived acetate possesses an antiviral effect that induces an optimal virus-specific CD8+ T cell response to IAV PR8 infection via GPR43-dependent metabolic reprogramming.">

        <tr id="CD4 T helper cells (TH cells) play a vital role in coordinating and amplifying the immune response to specific pathogens. They constitutively produce different kinds of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which mediate cell-to cell communication and play diverse roles in immune regulation and inflammatory processes. Here we provide a resource documenting the composition of activated TH cell EVs and demonstrating their ability to instigate pro-inflammatory response in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). EVs were characterized by lipidomics, proteomics, and NanoFCM. The activated TH cells derived EVs (act-EVs) were found to be enriched in TH cell-specific proteins, transmembrane and cytosolic EV marker proteins, and HLA proteins relative to resting CD4 T cells EVs (rest-EVs). The pro-inflammatory effect of act-EVs vs rest-EVs on donor matched APCs were characterized by chemokine and cytokine profiling and flow cytometry analysis. There was no discernible contrast in endotoxin levels between act-EVs and rest-EVs. Functional distinctions were seen to arise from variations in the content and composition of these EVs. Moreover, we validated our findings with an in-vivo investigation in mice, demonstrating the recruitment of monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, and NK cells in the spleen, accompanied by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum after administering act-EVs. In summary, this study sheds light on the role of TH cell released EVs in modulating the immune response during pro-inflammatory responses and this resource provides a foundation for development of novel therapeutics on EV based scaffolds.">

        <tr id="The relationship between chronic viral infection and cancer response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is poorly understood. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is globally endemic and causes severe disease in the immunocompromised. In immunocompetent individuals the clinical effects of CMV infection are an area of active investigation. Here, in analysis of 396 patients receiving ICB for cancer, we investigate the oncological and immunological consequences of CMV seropositivity. We find that infection with CMV leads to profound skewing of CD8+ T cell subsets towards an effector phenotype, divergence in gene expression, increased total lymphocyte count and reduced neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. These differences are associated with immunologically distinct responses to ICB in patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). We identify a gene set highly-associated with CMV infection which is robustly induced by combination ICB (anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-1, cICB) but not by single-agent anti-PD-1 (sICB) in CMV seronegative individuals. Consequently, CMV seropositivity is associated with prolonged Overall Survival (OS) in those treated with sICB (HR 0.49, P.01) whereas there is no observed survival association of CMV following cICB treatment (HR 0.95, P=.82). We demon- strate these CMV-determined divergent effects are driven by expression of TBX21, encoding the transcription factor T-bet. Expression of TBX21 predicts OS across all patients (HR 0.67, P=0.013 for above-median expression), with durable response to ICB associated with induction of expanded TBX21 expressing CD8+ clones. Unexpectedly, we find CMV infection is associated with reduced cumulative incidence of Grade 3+ immune related adverse events (irAEs) at 6 months (0.31 vs. 0.53, P=2.1x10-5), notably lowering incidence of colitis (P=.00095) and pneumonitis (P=.026), with infected patients requiring fewer steroids or second line immunosuppressants. Finally we link CMV infection to protection against MM, demonstrating lower seropositivity rates in patients with MM, but not early Stage II/III disease, compared to population controls from the UK biobank (OR 0.53, P=.00016). CMV protection is contingent upon melanoma BRAF mutation status, with CMV being associated with reduced development of MM in BRAF mutated patients and later presentation of BRAF wild-type MM. This work reveals a previously unrecognised interaction between CMV infection, melanoma muta- tional state, development of metastatic disease and response to ICB, as well as demonstrating CMV infection protects against ICB irAEs, underpinning the importance of prior infection history and chronic immune activation in development of MM and outcomes to immunotherapy. We anticipate other immunosensitive cancers may show similar interactions between chronic viral infection and response to ICB.">

        <tr id="Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is a potent cytokine critical for response to immunotherapy, yet conventional methods to systemically deliver this cytokine have been hindered by severe dose-limiting toxicities. Here, we engineered a strain of probiotic bacteria that home to tumors and locally release IFN-γ. A single intratumoral injection of these IFN-γ–producing bacteria was sufficient to drive systemic tumor antigen–specific antitumor immunity, without observable toxicity. Although cancer cells use various resistance mechanisms to evade immune responses, bacteria-derived IFN-γ overcame primary resistance to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade via activation of cytotoxic Foxp3−CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Moreover, by activating natural killer (NK) cells, bacteria-derived IFN-γ also overcame acquired resistance mechanisms to PD-1 blockade, specifically loss-of-function mutations in IFN-γ signaling and antigen presentation pathways. Collectively, these results demonstrate the promise of combining IFN-γ–producing bacteria with PD-1 blockade as a therapeutic strategy for overcoming immunotherapy-resistant, locally advanced, and metastatic disease. Bacteria engineered for intratumoral delivery of IFN-γ synergize with PD-1 blockade to overcome tumor-intrinsic immune resistance. Editor’s summary Engineering bacteria to release therapeutic candidates within tumors circumvents the severe toxicity associated with systemic delivery and is a promising strategy for immunotherapy. Li et al. engineered a strain of E. coli to express the cytokine IFN-γ within the tumor core (SLIC–IFN-γ). In mice, intratumoral injection of SLIC–IFN-γ promoted antitumor immunity by polarizing tumor-associated myeloid cells and activating cytotoxic T cells.

Together, these findings suggest that SLIC–IFN-γ is an attractive therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to PD-1 blockade. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has revolutionised the treatment of multiple cancer types, however, these treatments only work for a proportion of patients and biomarkers to predict response are lacking. One correlate of response is the reinvigoration of a subset of CD8 T cells that have an exhausted phenotype and impaired functionality. In order to develop new therapies, reproducible models are required to identify candidate target genes that enables the reversal of key hallmarks of T cell exhaustion. Here we describe the development of an in vitro model by chronically stimulating T cells with their cognate antigen and performed an in depth temporal phenotypic characterisation. This model recapitulates many of the critical hallmarks of exhaustion, including increased expression of canonical exhaustion surface markers, impaired proliferation, reduced cytokine production, decreased release of cytotoxic granules, and metabolic alterations, including dysfunctional mitochondria. These exhaustion hallmarks were validated using an in vivo model and a gene signature identified which robustly define the shared in vitro and in vivo exhausted state. Critically, this signature is also observed in tumour infiltrating T cells from multiple human tumour types, validating the translational potential of this model for discovering and triaging new therapies.">

We found that the myeloid cell populations were significantly changed by SIVE. In SIVE microglia-like cells express high levels of chemoattractants capable of recruiting highly activated CAM-like cells to the site of infection/inflammation. A unique population of microglia-like cells was found in which the chromatin accessibility of genes diverged from their RNA expression. Additionally, we observed a dramatic shift of upstream gene regulators and their targets in brain myeloid cells during SIVE. In summary, this study further uncovers the transcriptome, gene regulatory events and potential roles of different brain myeloid phenotypes in SIVE.">

        <tr id="MALT1 protease is an intracellular signaling molecule that promotes tumor progression via cancer cell-intrinsic and cancer cell-extrinsic mechanisms. MALT1 has been mostly studied in lymphocytes, and little is known about its role in tumor-associated macrophages. Here, we show that MALT1 plays a key role in glioblastoma (GBM)-associated macrophages. Mechanistically, GBM tumor cells induce a MALT1-NF-κB signaling axis within macrophages, leading to macrophage migration and polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Inactivation of MALT1 protease promotes transcriptional reprogramming that reduces migration and restores a macrophage “M1-like” phenotype. Preclinical in vivo analysis shows that MALT1 inhibitor treatment results in increased immuno-reactivity of GBM-associated macrophages and reduced GBM tumor growth. Further, the addition of MALT1 inhibitor to temozolomide reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, which may enhance the efficacy of this standard-of-care chemotherapeutic. Together, our findings suggest that MALT1 protease inhibition represents a promising macrophage-targeted immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of GBM. Graphical abstract.

        <tr id="Chronic infections drive a CD8 T cell program termed T cell exhaustion, characterized by reduced effector functions. While cell-intrinsic mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell exhaustion have been extensively studied, the impact of the metabolic environment in which exhausted CD8 T cells (Tex) operate remains less clear. Using untargeted metabolomics and the murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection model we investigated systemic metabolite changes early and late following acute versus chronic viral infections. We identified distinct short-term and persistent metabolite shifts, with the most significant differences occurring transiently during the acute phase of the sustained infection. This included nutrient changes that were independent of viral loads and partially associated with CD8 T cell-induced anorexia and lipolysis. One remarkable observation was the elevation of medium- and long-chain fatty acid (FA) and acylcarnitines during the early phase after chronic infection. During this time, virus-specific CD8 T cells from chronically infected mice exhibited increased lipid accumulation and uptake compared to their counterparts from acute infection, particularly stem-like Tex (TexSTEM), a subset that generates effector-like TexINT which directly limit viral replication. Notably, only TexSTEM increased oxidative metabolism and ATP production upon FA exposure. Consistently, short-term reintroduction of FA during late chronic infection exclusively improved TexSTEM mitochondrial fitness, percentages and numbers. This treatment, however, also reduced TexINT, resulting in compromised viral control. Our study offers a valuable resource for investigating the role of specific metabolites in regulating immune responses during acute and chronic viral infections and highlights the potential of long-chain FA to influence TexSTEM and viral control during a protracted infection. Significance This study examines systemic metabolite changes during acute and chronic viral infections. Notably, we identified an early, transient nutrient shift in chronic infection, marked by an increase in medium- and long-chain fatty acid related species. Concomitantly, a virus-specific stem-like T cell population, essential for maintaining other T cells, displayed high lipid avidity and was capable of metabolizing exogenous fatty acids. Administering fatty acids late in chronic infection, when endogenous lipid levels had normalized, expanded this stem-like T cell population and enhanced their mitochondrial fitness. These findings highlight the potential role of fatty acids in regulating stem-like T cells in chronic settings and offer a valuable resource for studying other metabolic signatures in both acute and persistent infections.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has changed the treatment paradigm for many types of cancer, but immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have not shown benefit in prostate cancer (PCa). Chronic inflammation contributes to the immunosuppressive prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) and is associated with poor response to ICIs. The primary source of inflammatory cytokine production is the inflammasome. Here, we identify PIM kinases as important regulators of inflammasome activation in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Analysis of clinical data from a cohort of treatment naïve, hormone responsive PCa patients revealed that tumors from patients with high PIM1/2/3 display an immunosuppressive TME characterized by high inflammation (IL-1β and TNFα) and a high density of repressive immune cells, most notably TAMs. Strikingly, macrophage-specific knockout of PIM reduced tumor growth in syngeneic models of prostate cancer. Transcriptional analyses indicate that eliminating PIM from macrophages enhanced the adaptive immune response and increased cytotoxic immune cells. Combined treatment with PIM inhibitors and ICIs synergistically reduced tumor growth. Immune profiling revealed that PIM inhibitors sensitized PCa tumors to ICIs by increasing tumor suppressive TAMs and increasing the activation of cytotoxic T cells. Collectively, our data implicate macrophage PIM as a driver of inflammation that limits the potency of ICIs and provides preclinical evidence that PIM inhibitors are an effective strategy to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in prostate cancer.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most abundant immune cells associated with tumors, which often exhibit immune regulatory phenotypes that promote tumor growth and confer resistance to anti-tumor immune therapies. Despite extensive efforts in developing immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at controlling the recruitment or reprogramming of TAMs, success has been limited due to strategic caveats, underscoring the need for a novel approach targeting the TAMs. PU.1, a lineage-dependent transcription factor, is highly expressed throughout the lifespan of macrophages. We have found that inhibition of PU.1 by the small molecule DB2313 suppresses melanoma tumor growth in mice through enhanced tumor recruitment of CD4+ T helper cells and cytotoxic T/NK cells mediated by TAMs. Whole transcriptome and targeted gene expression analyses revealed that DB2313 upregulates CXCL9 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and TAMs. The anti-tumor effects of DB2313 were abolished by depleting macrophages with clodronate or inhibiting the CXCL9-CXCR3 chemokine axis using neutralizing antibodies against CXCL9 or CXCR3. Collectively, these results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PU.1 suppresses tumor growth by promoting tumor infiltrating lymphocytes through the CXCL9-CXCR3 chemokine axis.

These elements are intricately embedded in a mineralized extracellular matrix, setting it apart from other primary TMEs. In a state of normal physiological function, these cell types collaborate in a coordinated manner to maintain the homeostasis of the bone and hematopoietic systems. However, in the pathological condition, i.e., neoplastic malignancies, the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) has been shown to promote cancer cells proliferation, migration, apoptosis and drug resistance, as well as immune escape. The intricate and dynamic system of the TIME in osteosarcoma involves crucial roles played by various infiltrating cells, the complement system, and exosomes. This complexity is closely associated with tumor cells evading immune surveillance, experiencing uncontrolled proliferation, and facilitating metastasis. In this review, we elucidate the intricate interplay between diverse cell populations in the osteosarcoma TIME, each contributing uniquely to tumor progression. From chondroblastic and osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells to osteoclasts, stromal cells, and various myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets, the comprehensive single-cell analysis provides a detailed roadmap of the complex osteosarcoma ecosystem. Furthermore, we summarize the mutations, epigenetic mechanisms, and extracellular vesicles that dictate the immunologic landscape and modulate the TIME of osteosarcoma. The perspectives of the clinical implementation of immunotherapy and therapeutic approaches for targeting immune cells are also intensively discussed.">

        <tr id="High-grade gliomas are a major health challenge with poor prognosis and high morbidity. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have emerged as promising therapeutic options for several malignancies yet show little efficacy against central nervous system (CNS) tumors. CD200 is a newly recognized immune checkpoint that modulates immune homeostasis. CD200 protein is expressed by a variety of cells, including immune cells and stromal cells, and is overexpressed by many tumors. The shedding of CD200 from tumor cells can create an immunosuppressive environment that dampens anti-tumor immunity by modulating cytolytic activity and cytokine expression both within and outside the tumor microenvironment (TME). While it is well-accepted that CD200 induces a pro-tumorigenic environment through its ability to suppress the immune response, we sought to determine the role of glioma-specific expression of CD200. We show that CD200 is expressed across glioma types, is shed from tumor cells, and increases over time in the serum of patients undergoing immunotherapy. Using CD200 knockout (KO) glioma models, we demonstrated that glioma cell-derived CD200 promotes tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. Notably, CD200 KO gliomas are spontaneously rejected by their host, a process that required a fully functional immune system, including NK and T-cells. Moreover, we report that glioma-derived or brain-injected soluble CD200 contributes to the suppression of antigen-specific CD8 T-cells in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Our work provides new mechanistic insights regarding CD200-mediated immunosuppression by gliomas.

HAM/TSP individuals exhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with elevated co-expression of multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs), but ICP blockade strategies can only partially restore CD8+ T-cell effector function.

Here, we evaluated the impact of exosomes isolated from HTLV-1-infected cells and HAM/TSP patient sera on dendritic cell (DC) and T-cell phenotypes and function. We observed that exosomes derived from HTLV-infected cell lines (OSP2) elicit proinflammatory cytokine responses in DCs, promote helper CD4+ T-cell polarization, and suppress CD8+ T-cell effector function. Furthermore, exosomes from individuals with HAM/TSP stimulate CD4+ T-cell polarization, marked by increased Th1 and regulatory T-cell differentiation. We conclude that exosomes in the setting of HAM/TSP are detrimental to DC and T-cell function and may contribute to the progression of pathology with HTLV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which the production of pathogenic autoantibodies depends on T follicular helper (TFH) cells. This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) reduces the expansion of TFH cells and the associated autoantibody production in lupus-prone mice. Integrated cellular, transcriptomic, epigenetic and metabolic analyses showed that 2DG reversed the enhanced cell expansion and effector functions, as well as mitochondrial and lysosomal defects in lupus TFH cells, which include an increased chaperone-mediated autophagy induced by TLR7 activation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of 2DG-reprogrammed TFH cells protected lupus-prone mice from disease progression. Orthologs of genes responsive to 2DG in murine lupus TFH cells were overexpressed in the TFH cells of SLE patients, suggesting a therapeutic potential of targeting glycolysis to eliminate aberrant TFH cells and curb the production of autoantibodies inducing tissue damage.">

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic response demonstrated the effectiveness of adenovirus vector vaccines in inducing protective cellular and antibody responses. However, we still lack mechanistic understanding of the factors regulating immunity induced by this platform, especially innate pathways. We utilized a human tonsil organoid model to study the regulation of adaptive responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-α was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-α-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-α and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells, including TFH. These data provide key insights into innate pathways regulating ChAdOx1-induced immunity and highlights the promise of this model for vaccine platform mechanistic studies.

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) belong to a continuous disease spectrum of myeloid malignancies with poor prognosis in the relapsed/refractory setting necessitating novel therapies. Natural killer (NK) cells from patients with myeloid malignancies display global dysfunction with impaired killing capacity, altered metabolism, and an exhausted phenotype at the single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic levels. In this study, we identified that this dysfunction was mediated through a cross-talk between NK cells and myeloid blasts necessitating cell-cell contact. NK cell dysfunction could be prevented by targeting the αvβ-integrin/TGF-β/SMAD pathway but, once established, was persistent because of profound epigenetic reprogramming. We identified BATF as a core transcription factor and the main mediator of this NK cell dysfunction in AML. Mechanistically, we found that BATF was directly regulated and induced by SMAD2/3 and, in turn, bound to key genes related to NK cell exhaustion, such as HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, and CTLA4. BATF deletion enhanced NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unidentified mechanism of NK immune evasion in AML manifested by epigenetic rewiring and inactivation of NK cells by myeloid blasts. This work highlights the importance of using healthy allogeneic NK cells as an adoptive cell therapy to treat patients with myeloid malignancies combined with strategies aimed at preventing the dysfunction by targeting the TGF-β pathway or BATF. BATF deletion prevents epigenetic rewiring and enhances the antitumor activity of NK cells in AML. Editor’s summary Patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), often relapse after standard of care. To improve outcomes, Kumar et al. have investigated the role of natural killer (NK) cells in antitumor immunity against myeloid blasts and have identified global dysfunction of NK cells in these patients. They identified BATF as responsible for this dysfunction, and by knocking out BATF downstream of the TGF-β canonical pathway in NK cells, they were able to enhance NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. This has led to the initiation of a promising clinical trial using these TGFBR2 knockout NK cells against myeloid malignancies. —Dorothy Hallberg">

        <tr id="A hallmark of HIV infection is disruption of intestinal barrier integrity that persists in people with HIV (PWH) despite treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART). This disruption is central to HIV disease progression, yet the causes remain incompletely understood. We report a novel mechanism by which immunometabolic defects in colon resident CD8+ T cells in PWH lead to intestinal epithelial apoptosis and disruption of intestinal barrier integrity. We show that in PWH, these cells downregulate the lipid sensor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), which results in reduced intracellular lipid droplets, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and acquisition of lipids by CD8+ T cells from intestinal epithelial cells, which then contributes to epithelial cell death. Our findings indicate that HIV-associated immunometabolic dysregulation of colon CD8+ T cell leads to loss of intestinal epithelial homeostasis. These results identify potential new strategies to reduce comorbidities in PWH and other disorders with disrupted intestinal barrier integrity.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal malignancy that is often resistant to therapy. An immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and oncogenic mutations in KRAS have both been implicated as drivers of resistance to therapy. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibition has not yet shown clinical efficacy, likely because of rapid acquisition of tumor-intrinsic resistance. However, the unique PDAC TME may also be a driver of resistance. We found that long-term focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor treatment led to hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway in PDAC cells in mouse models and tissues from patients with PDAC. Concomitant inhibition of both FAK (with VS-4718) and rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma and MAPK kinase (RAF-MEK) (with avutometinib) induced tumor growth inhibition and increased survival across multiple PDAC mouse models. In the TME, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) impaired the down-regulation of MYC by RAF-MEK inhibition in PDAC cells, resulting in resistance. By contrast, FAK inhibition reprogramed CAFs to suppress the production of FGF1, which can drive resistance to RAF-MEK inhibition. The addition of chemotherapy to combined FAK and RAF-MEK inhibition led to tumor regression, a decrease in liver metastasis, and improved survival in KRAS-driven PDAC mouse models. Combination of FAK and RAF-MEK inhibition alone improved antitumor immunity and priming of T cell responses in response to chemotherapy. These findings provided the rationale for an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of avutometinib and defactinib in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with PDAC and may suggest further paths for combined stromal and tumor-targeting therapies. Stromal reprograming by FAK inhibition overcomes RAS-MAPK inhibition resistance and enhances responses to therapy in pancreas cancer models. Editor’s summary Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) often becomes resistant to therapy. It is unclear how combining different therapies could overcome tumor resistance. Liu et al. showed that combining focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition with rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (RAF-MEK) inhibition improved survival and inhibited tumor growth in mouse PDAC models. Sequencing and cell culture experiments confirmed that cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment were responsible for therapy resistance. Combining FAK and RAF-MEK inhibition with chemotherapy resulted in tumor regression, increased survival, and decreased liver metastasis in mouse models. Together, these results suggest that targeting both stromal and tumor factors involved in therapy resistance could improve PDAC responses to treatment. —Brandon Berry">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are key mediators of lung function and are potential targets for therapies during respiratory infections. TGFβ is an important regulator of AM differentiation and maintenance, but how TGFβ directly modulates the innate immune responses of AMs remains unclear. This shortcoming prevents effective targeting of AMs to improve lung function in health and disease. Here we leveraged an optimized ex vivo AM model system, fetal-liver derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs), to dissect the role of TGFβ in AMs. Using transcriptional analysis, we first globally defined how TGFβ regulates gene expression of resting FLAMs. We found that TGFβ maintains the baseline metabolic state of AMs by driving lipid metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation and restricting inflammation. To better understand inflammatory regulation in FLAMs, we next directly tested how TGFβ alters the response to TLR2 agonists. While both TGFβ (+) and TGFβ (−) FLAMs robustly responded to TLR2 agonists, we found an unexpected activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses in FLAMs and primary AMs in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Surprisingly, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and the interferon regulator factors 3 and 7 were required for IFN production by TLR2 agonists. Together, these data suggest that TGFβ modulates AM metabolic networks and innate immune signaling cascades to control inflammatory pathways in AMs.">

While bacteria can either promote or inhibit cancer growth, intratumoral bacteria can also be engineered using synthetic biology to remodel the tumor microenvironment. Here, we engineered the probiotic bacterium E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to express the human chemokine CXCL13, a critical component of germinal center (GC) formation. The GC reaction is a fundamental aspect of adaptive immunity by which antibody affinity develops in secondary lymphoid organs for defense against pathogens. Using orthotopic models of bladder cancer, engineered CXCL13-expressing EcN colonized bladder tumors and elicited GC responses in bladder tumor–draining lymph nodes after intravesical delivery. Furthermore, when combined with PD-1 blockade, engineered EcN amplified the antitumor antibody response and promoted long-term survival and protective immunity upon tumor rechallenge. Thus, we demonstrate that synthetically engineered CXCL13-expressing EcN can enhance the efficacy of PD-1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy by amplifying tumor-specific humoral immunity.">

Blood and resected lung tissue were collected at the first LVRS (L1). Following 6–10 weeks of recovery, patients received a placebo or intravenous administration of 2 × 106 cells/kg bodyweight BM-MSC (n = 5 and n = 9, resp.) in week 3 and 4 before the second LVRS (L2), where blood and lung tissue were collected. Irrespective of BM-MSC or placebo treatment, proportions of circulating lymphocytes including central memory CD4 regulatory, effector memory CD8 and γδ T cells were higher, whereas myeloid cell percentages were lower in L2 compared to L1. In resected lung tissue, proportions of Treg (p = 0.0067) and anti-inflammatory CD163− macrophages (p = 0.0001) were increased in L2 compared to L1, while proportions of pro-inflammatory CD163+ macrophages were decreased (p = 0.0004). There were no effects of BM-MSC treatment on immune profiles in emphysema patients.

        <tr id="The intestinal immune system maintains a balance between active immunity needed for protection and tolerance towards harmless antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) found in the intestinal mucosa are key to the adaptive arm of these immunoregulatory events. DCs sample antigens in the tissue and then migrate to the draining lymph nodes, where they prime the T cells that then migrate back to the tissue as effector or regulatory cells. Intestinal DC are highly heterogeneous, and it remains unclear exactly which subsets induces the different kinds of immune response, or what signalling molecules and cellular mechanisms are involved. Here, we have studied these issues using Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) infection in mice, a model which is uniquely suited to dissecting this regulatory circuit in the gut, where it drives type 2 protective immunity at the same time as inhibiting other aspects of the immune response. Here, we characterise intestinal DC during Hpb infection for the first time. We observed a dynamical change of intestinal DC populations throughout the course of infection that correlated with altered phenotype and function. In particular, Hpb infection saw a rise in a population of CD103+ DC2 that retained a potent ability to drive Tregs during the infection and unlike CD103-DC2, had a reduced ability to induce pro-inflammatory immune response. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed that TGFβ signalling may be responsible for some of the changes observed. This was confirmed in vitro, where supplementation TGFβ or Hpb-produced TGFβ mimic (TGM) replicated the immunomodulatory effects seen in DCs in vivo. Together, these results present a mechanistic explanation of how helminths such as Hpb may modulate host immune responses by altering the differentiation and function of local DCs. Furthermore, our work provides the basis for understanding immune homeostasis in the intestine at the molecular and cellular levels. Thus, this work fills out a crucial gap in our knowledge of basic biology underlining the DC decision between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response in the central circuit of adaptive immune response.">

To date, it remains elusive how the duration of TN-DC interactions and integration of activation signals are controlled in vivo. Here, we report that lymphoid stroma-secreted ligands for CCR7 constrained interaction duration by gradually inducing CD8+ T cell release from DCs. At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses. In sum, our findings uncover that lymphoid stromal chemokines act as built-in “disruptors” of T cell-DC interactions for long-term preservation of TEFF functionality.">

In this study, we explored the immunomodulatory function of contactin-4 (CNTN4). CNTN4 was highly expressed in tumor tissues, and expression impaired the antitumor function of T cells. CNTN4 bound to amyloid precursor protein (APP) on T cells, which attenuated conjugation between cancer cells and T cells, and diminished T cell receptor signaling cascades. We developed an anti-CNTN4 antibody (GENA-104A16) and an anti-APP antibody (5A7) that blocked the binding between CNTN4 and APP. Administration of either GENA-104A16 or 5A7 promoted antitumor T cell responses in a syngeneic mouse model and increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in vivo. Furthermore, elevated CNTN4 levels were associated with poor prognosis and negatively correlated with various cytotoxic immune-related markers. These results suggest that CNTN4-APP is an inhibitory checkpoint in T cells and represents a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Targeting the CNTN4-APP axis may boost anticancer immunity and improve conventional immunotherapy efficacy. Editor’s summary Contactin-4 (CNTN4) is an adhesion molecule known to engage amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain, but the function of this axis in T cells and antitumor immunity is not known. Jeon et al. explored the immunomodulatory role of CNTN4-APP, finding that CNTN4 expressed on tumor cells prevents T cell activation by engaging APP on T cells. They developed an anti-CNTN4 antibody (GENA-104A16) and an anti-APP antibody (5A7) and found that blocking the CNTN4-APP interaction promoted tumor killing. Expression of APP on T cells negatively correlated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer. These findings indicate that CNTN4-APP functions as an inhibitory checkpoint in T cells. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND Immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, altering their energy production in response to HIV infection. During acute HIV infection, CD4+ T cells increase glycolysis to fuel viral replication and defense, but prolonged activation leads to immune exhaustion, with reduced T cell function and impaired pathogen elimination, contributing to AIDS progression. However, the details Metabolic dynamics of Immune Cells during HIV Infection (UT) and after receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains unknown. Communication between Immune cells will be modified to response HIV infection, which can be mediated by metabolites. In this study, we deciphered Metabolic pathway dynamics of all Immune Cells by comparing UT and ART with seronegative controls (SN). Additionally, we investigate alteration of metabolite-mediated cell-cell communications in HIV Infection. METHODS Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of PBMC from SN, UT and ART were analyzed with KEGG Metabolic pathways by irGSEA and algorithm MEBOCOST to study cell-cell communications mediated by metabolites from sender cells and sensor proteins on receiver cells. RESULTS lots of differentially expressed Metabolic Pathways were identified for immune cells, including Energy Production and Utilization, Lipid Metabolism, Amino Acid Metabolism, Glycosylation and Glycan Biosynthesis and Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense. CONCLUSIONS The analysis highlights the intricate metabolic interplay between monocytes and other immune cells, reflecting their central role in orchestrating immune responses through metabolite exchange. These insights may open avenues for therapeutic interventions, targeting metabolic pathways to enhance immune function or inhibit pathogen survival.">

        <tr id="Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a pleiotropic cytokine, able to promote both myelopoiesis and activation of immune cells. Particularly in the lung, GM-CSF plays an important homeostatic role in the development and maintenance of alveolar macrophages, and is therefore considered to play a role in respiratory virus infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, although the benefits of GM-CSF treatment in clinical studies remain inconclusive. To address this, we tested inhaled GM-CSF treatment in the Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM) mouse model. Our findings show that local GM-CSF therapy during PVM disease increased local neutrophilia and monocyte-derived cell influx, but diminished CD8+ T cells responses. Despite this, the observed effects on T cells and myeloid cells did not result in an altered clinical outcome during PVM infection. We conclude that inhaled GM-CSF therapy cannot be considered as a universal protective therapy in respiratory virus infections.">

        <tr id="Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are the regenerative force of the gut epithelium. Lgr5+-ISC have been shown to respond to changes in their microenvironment by coping with different metabolites, adapting to caloric changes, and recovering from injury and inflammation. However, how pathogenic bacteria affect adult stem cell regeneration and, as a consequence, the overall tissue adaption to infection has yet to be explored in depth. Here, we interrogated early Lgr5+ ISC responses to an enteric intracellular pathogen by profiling individual IECs from the mouse small intestine. Utilizing GFP-labeled Salmonella enterica, we isolated intracellular invaded cells to elucidate invasion programs of epithelial cell subsets. In particular, we identified a Salmonella-specific infection signature comprised of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, including the Defensin gene family. Our findings demonstrate that Salmonella enterica targets differentiated Paneth, enterocytes, and stem/progenitor cells at these early stages of infection. In response, a rapid Lg5+ ISC-driven cellular remodeling to enterocyte and Paneth lineages expressing AMP genes is initiated to combat the intruders. Importantly, we uncovered an ISC differentiation program via inflammasome activation to protect the crypt environment, while eliminating infected stem cells from the overall stem cell pool. This novel Lgr5+ stem cell defense mechanism not only protects the gut epithelium from persistent bacterial infection but also promotes tissue regeneration. We propose epithelial remodeling to AMP-secreting cells as a novel innate immune response to handle different gut stresses mediated by Lgr5+ ISCs to maintain organizational principles of gut homeostasis and physiology.">

        <tr id="The identification of specific markers for microglia has been a long-standing challenge. Recently, markers such as P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls have been proposed as microglia-specific and widely used to explore microglial functions within various central nervous system (CNS) contexts. The specificity of these markers was based on the assumption that circulating monocytes retain their distinct signatures even after infiltrating the CNS. However, recent findings reveal that infiltrating monocytes can adopt microglia-like characteristics while maintaining a pro-inflammatory profile upon permanent engraftment in the CNS.In this study, we utilize bone marrow chimeras, single-cell RNA sequencing, ATAC-seq, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that engrafted monocytes acquire expression of established microglia markers—P2ry12, TMEM119, Fcrls—and the pan-myeloid marker Iba1, which has been commonly mischaracterized as microglia-specific. These changes are accompanied by alterations in chromatin accessibility and shifts in chromatin binding motifs that are indicative of microglial identity. Moreover, we show that engrafted monocytes dynamically regulate the expression of CX3CR1, CCR2, Ly6C, and transcription factors PU.1, CTCF, RUNX, AP-1, CEBP, and IRF2, all of which are crucial for shaping microglial identity. This study is the first to illustrate that engrafted monocytes in the retina undergo both epigenetic and transcriptional changes, enabling them to express microglia-like signatures. These findings highlight the need for future research to account for these changes when assessing the roles of monocytes and microglia in CNS pathology. Significance Statement Monocytes can express putative microglia markers P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls upon engraftment into the retina. Given their involvement in neuroinflammation, it is crucial to consider this overlap when utilizing these markers for experimental analysis.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

Here, we extensively validate a combination of scRNA-seq profiling and matching flow cytometry isolation that reproducibly identifies 7 key CM and Endo populations across mouse strains and accurately surveys both niche locations. We demonstrate that different perturbations exert specific effects on different compartments, with type I interferon responses causing CM mesenchymal stromal cells to adopt an inflammatory phenotype associated with overproduction of chemokines modulating local monocyte dynamics in the surrounding microenvironment.

        <tr id="Myeloid cells including brain-resident (microglia) and peripheral macrophages play a crucial role in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). They respond to disruption of tissue homeostasis associated with disease conditions by acquiring various transcriptional and functional states. Experimental investigation of these states is hampered by the lack of tools that enable accessible and robust reprogramming of human macrophages toward Alzheimer’s disease-relevant molecular and cellular phenotypes in vitro. In this study, we investigated the ability of a cytokine mix, including interleukin-4 (IL4), colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1/MCSF), interleukin 34 (IL34) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), to induce reprogramming of cultured human THP-1 macrophages. Our results indicate this treatment led to significant transcriptomic changes, driving THP-1 macrophages towards a transcriptional state reminiscent of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and lipid-associated macrophages (LAM) collectively referred to as DLAM. Transcriptome profiling revealed gene expression changes related to oxidative phosphorylation, lysosome function, and lipid metabolism. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an increased proportion of DLAM clusters in cytokine mix-treated THP-1 macrophages. Functional assays demonstrated alterations in cell motility, phagocytosis, lysosomal activity, and metabolic and energetic profiles. Our findings provide insights into the cytokine-mediated reprogramming of macrophages towards disease-relevant states, highlighting their role in neurodegenerative diseases and potential for therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Severe viral pneumonia can induce rapid expansion of KRT5+ basal-like cells in small airways and alveoli; this forms a scar-like structure that persists in the injured alveoli and impedes normal alveolar epithelium regeneration. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which viral infection induced this remodeling response. Through comparing different lung-injury models, we demonstrated that infection induced strong IFN-γ signal–stimulated dysplastic KRT5+ cell formation. Inactivation of interferon receptor 1 (Ifngr1) reduced dysplastic cell formation, ameliorated lung fibrosis, and improved lung-function recovery. Mechanistically, IFN-γ regulated dysplastic cell formation via the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) pathway. Inhibiting FAK/Src diminished IFN-γ–induced YAP nuclear translocation and dysplastic cell formation. Inhibiting YAP during viral infection prevented dysplastic cell formation, whereas inhibiting YAP in persistent KRT5+ cells led to their conversion into distal club cells. Importantly, human dysplastic cells exhibited elevated FAK and YAP activity, and IFN-γ treatment promoted the transformation of human alveolar progenitor cells into dysplastic cells. These findings uncover the role of infection-induced inflammatory response in alveolar remodeling and may provide potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of alveolar remodeling in patients with severe viral pneumonia.">

Central to the function of TLS are DCs, professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that coordinate the adaptive immune response, and which can be classified into different subsets, with specific functions, and markers. In this article, we review current data on the contribution of different DC subsets to TLS function in cancer and autoimmunity, two opposite sides of the immune response. Different DC subsets can be found in different tumor types, correlating with cancer prognosis. Moreover, DCs are also present in TLS found in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, contributing to disease development. Broadly, the presence of DCs in TLS appears to be associated with favorable clinical outcomes in cancer while in autoimmune pathologies these cells are associated with unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, it is important to analyze the complex functions of DCs within TLS in order to enhance our fundamental understanding of immune regulation but also as a possible route to create innovative clinical interventions designed for the specific needs of patients with diverse pathological diseases.">

        <tr id="While neutrophils are the predominant cell type in the lungs of humans with active tuberculosis (TB), they are relatively scarce in the lungs of most strains of mice that are used to study the disease. However, similar to humans, neutrophils account for approximately 45% of CD45+ cells in the lungs of Apoe-/- mice on a high-cholesterol (HC) diet following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We hypothesized that the susceptibility of Apoe-/- HC mice might arise from an unrestrained feed-forward loop in which production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) stimulates production of type I interferons by pDCs which in turn leads to the recruitment and activation of more neutrophils, and demonstrated that depleting neutrophils, depleting plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), or blocking type I interferon signaling, improved the outcome of infection. In concordance with these results, we found that Mtb-infected in Apoe-/-HC mice produce high levels of LTB4 and 12-HETE, two eicosanoids known to act as neutrophil chemoattractants and showed that blocking leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor signaling also improved the outcome of tuberculosis. While production of NETs has been associated with severe tuberculosis in other mouse models and in humans, a causative role for NETs in the pathology has not been directly established. We demonstrate that blocking the activation of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), an enzyme critical to NET formation, leads to fewer NETs in the lungs and, strikingly, completely reverses the hypersusceptibility of Apoe-/-HC mice to tuberculosis.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="Functional tumor-specific CD8+ T cells are essential for an effective anti-tumor immune response and the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In comparison to other organ sites, we found higher numbers of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in primary, metastatic liver tumors in murine tumor models. Despite their abundance, CD8+ T cells in the liver displayed an exhausted phenotype. Depletion of CD8+ T cells showed that liver tumor-reactive CD8+ T failed to control liver tumors but was effective against subcutaneous tumors. Similarly, analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from patients showed a higher frequency of exhausted tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells in liver metastasis compared to paired primary colon cancer. High-dimensional, multi-omic analysis combining proteomic CODEX and scRNA-seq data revealed enriched interaction of SPP1+ macrophages and CD8+ tumor-reactive T cells in profibrotic, alpha-SMA rich regions in the liver. Liver tumors grew less in Spp1-/- mice and the tumor-specific CD8+ T cells were less exhausted. Differential pseudotime trajectory inference analysis revealed extrahepatic signaling promoting an intermediate cell (IC) population in the liver, characterized by co-expression of VISG4, CSF1R, CD163, TGF-βR, IL-6R, SPP1. scRNA-seq of a third data set of premetastatic adenocarcinoma showed that enrichment of this population may predict liver metastasis. Our data suggests a mechanism by which extrahepatic tumors facilitate the formation of liver metastasis by promoting an IC population inhibiting tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell function.">

        <tr id="Arthritogenic alphaviruses cause disease characterized by fever, rash, and incapacitating joint pain. Alphavirus infection stimulates robust inflammatory responses in infected hosts, leading to the upregulation of several cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF is secreted by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and monocytes and binds to colony stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R, also known as G-CSFR) on the surface of myeloid cells. G-CSFR signaling initiates proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of myeloid cells, especially neutrophils. Importantly, G-CSF has been found at high levels in both the acute and chronic phases of chikungunya disease; however, the role of G-CSF in arthritogenic alphavirus disease remains unexplored. Here, we sought to test the effect of G-CSF on chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection using G-CSFR-deficient mice (G-CSFR−/−). We observed sustained weight loss in G-CSFR−/− mice following viand MAYV infection compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, G-CSFR−/− mice had a significantly higher percentage of inflammatory monocytes and reduction in neutrophils throughout infection. The difference in weight loss in G-CSFR−/− mice induced by alphavirus infection was corrected by blocking type I IFN signaling. In summary, these studies show that type I IFN signaling contributes to G-CSFR mediated control of arthritogenic alphavirus disease.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the resident immune cells of the Central Nervous System (CNS), play crucial roles in homeostasis, immune responses, and the modulation of neuronal functions. In brain tumors, microglia are difficult to distinguish from infiltrating macrophages and are collectively called Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs). While these cells exhibit plasticity, support tumor growth, and suppress antitumor immune responses, their identity and function remain largely unknown. Cellular senescence, a state of growth arrest associated with the upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4A (Cdkn2a), can both suppress and promote tumor progression via the secretion of inflammatory and tissue remodeling factors, collectively known as Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). By leveraging existing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of murine brain tumors, we identified a population of Cdkn2a-positive TAMs involved in immune regulation and neurogenesis, characterized by high expression of Emb and Cd93, which we named MECC (Microglia-like, and Emb-, CD93- and Cdkn2a-positive) cells. In humans, these cells were more prevalent in recurrent glioblastoma and associated with poorer prognosis. Comparative analysis of brain samples from patients with neurodegeneration and healthy older individuals revealed the specificity of MECCs for brain tumors. These findings suggest that MECCs are a unique and distinct cell population associated with aggressive brain tumors, which could potentially serve as targets for novel treatments.">

        <tr id="CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key to maintain peripheral self-tolerance and suppress immune responses to tumors. Their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) correlates with poor clinical outcome in several human cancers, including breast cancer (BC). However, the properties of intratumoral Tregs remain largely unknown. Here, we found that a functionally distinct subpopulation of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, which express the Foxp3 splicing variant retaining exon 2 (Foxp3E2), is prominent in the TME and peripheral blood of hormone receptor- positive (HR+) BC subjects with poor prognosis. Notably, a comprehensive examination of the Tumor Cell Genome Atlas (TCGA) validated Foxp3E2 as an independent prognostic marker in all other BC subtypes. We found that FOXP3E2 expression underlies BCs with highly immune suppressive landscape, defective mismatch repair and a stem-like signature thus highlighting pathways involved in tumor immune evasion. Finally, we confirmed the higher immunosuppressive capacity of BC patients-derived Foxp3E2+ Tregs by functional assays. Our study suggests Foxp3E2+ Tregs might be used as an independent biomarker to predict BC prognosis and recurrence, and to develop super-targeted depletion-based immunotherapies. One-sentence summaries Foxp3E2+ Treg enrichment reflects an increased tumor-immune suppression and predicts prognosis and recurrence in breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract B cells can have a wide range of pro- and anti- inflammatory functions. A subset of B cells called regulatory B cells (Bregs) can potently suppress immune responses. Bregs have been shown to maintain immune homeostasis and modulate inflammatory responses. Bregs are an exciting cellular target across a range of diseases, including Breg induction in autoimmunity, allergy and transplantation, and Breg suppression in cancers and infection. Bregs exhibit a remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, rendering their unequivocal identification a challenging task. The lack of a universally accepted and exclusive surface marker set for Bregs across various studies contributes to inconsistencies in their categorization. This review paper presents a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the phenotypic and functional properties of human Bregs while addressing the persisting ambiguities and discrepancies in their characterization. Finally, the paper examines the promising therapeutic opportunities presented by Bregs as their immunomodulatory capacities have gained attention in the context of autoimmune diseases, allergic conditions, and cancer. We explore the exciting potential in harnessing Bregs as potential therapeutic agents and the avenues that remain open for the development of Breg-based treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that lacks hormone receptors and HER2 amplification, making it unresponsive to standard hormone or HER2-targeted therapies. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in tumors with high lymphocyte infiltration, their efficacy remains limited in tumors with minimal lymphocyte infiltration. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel approach to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from an immunosuppressive to an inflammatory phenotype within the tumor microenvironment (TME), aiming to enhance therapeutic outcomes in TNBC. Methods We designed a chimeric cytokine receptor (ChCR) that triggers STAT1 signaling upon stimulation with IL-10 or TGFβ, cytokines prevalent in the TME that typically drive immunosuppression. Human primary macrophages were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing the ChCR, and changes in their phenotype, secretome, and transcriptome were analyzed following stimulation. The anti-tumoral activity of these reprogrammed macrophages was assessed using co-culture assays with 3D TNBC spheroids. Results ChCR expressing macrophages showed robust STAT1 activation in response to IL-10 or TGFβ stimulation, resulting in an inflammatory phenotype similar to IFNγ activation, as confirmed by phenotypic markers, and transcriptomic profiling. These ChCR-stimulated macrophages demonstrated significant anti-tumoral effects in 3D TNBC spheroids. Moreover, ChCR stimulation led to the upregulation of genes associated with good response to ICIs, among others CXCL9 and CXCL10, chemokines essential for lymphocyte recruitment. Secretion of CXCL10 was also confirmed by ELISA. Conclusion We successfully engineered a ChCR that reprograms TAMs within an IL-10- and TGFβ-rich environment, inducing an inflammatory phenotype and anti-tumoral activity. The expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 further supports lymphocyte recruitment, potentially facilitating greater lymphocyte infiltration and disrupting the immunosuppressive TME. This approach offers a promising strategy to improve immunotherapy outcomes in TNBC patients, particularly those with low immune cell infiltration, thereby addressing a critical unmet clinical need.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Fungal pathogens are underappreciated causes of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In previous studies, we determined that a heat-killed, Cryptococcus neoformans fbp1-deficient strain (HK-fbp1) is a potent vaccine candidate. We determined that vaccination with HK-fbp1 confers protective immunity against lethal Cryptococcosis in an interferon γ (IFNγ)-dependent manner. In this study, we set out to uncover cellular sources and relevant targets of the protective effects of IFNγ in response to the HK-fbp1 vaccine. We found that early IFNγ production peaks at day 3 and that monocytes and neutrophils are important sources of this cytokine after vaccination. Neutralization of IFNγ at day 3 results in impaired CCR2+ monocyte recruitment and reduced differentiation into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC). In turn, depletion of CCR2+ cells prior to immunization results in impaired activation of IFNγ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells. Thus, monocytes are important targets of innate IFNγ and help promote further IFNγ production by lymphocytes. We employed monocyte-fate mapper and conditional STAT1 knockout mice to uncover that STAT1 activation in CD11c+ cells, including alveolar macrophages, Mo-DCs, and monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-Mac) is essential for HK-fbp1 vaccine-induced protection. Altogether, our aggregate findings suggest critical roles for innate cells as orchestrators of vaccine-induced protection against Cryptococcus infection. IMPORTANCE The number of patients susceptible to invasive fungal infections across the world continues to rise at an alarming pace yet current antifungal drugs are often inadequate. Immune-based interventions and novel antifungal vaccines hold the promise of significantly improving patient outcomes. In previous studies, we identified a Cryptococcus neoformans mutant strain (Fbp1-deficient) as a potent, heat-inactivated vaccine candidate capable of inducing homologous and heterologous antifungal protection. In this study, we used a combination of methods together with a cohort of conditional knockout mouse strains to interrogate the roles of innate cells in the orchestration of vaccine-induced antifungal protection. We uncovered novel roles for neutrophils and monocytes as coordinators of a STAT1-dependent cascade of responses that mediate vaccine-induced protection against invasive cryptococcosis. This new knowledge will help guide the future development of much-needed antifungal vaccines.">

To address their role in the course of the disease, we performed in-depth immunophenotypic analysis of 104 pre-treatment bone marrow (BM) samples using mass and flow cytometry and observed an increased frequency of the CD57+CXCR3+ subset of CD8+ T cells in patients who failed azacitidine (AZA) therapy. Furthermore, an increased baseline frequency (>29%) of the CD57+CXCR3+CD8+ T cell subset was correlated with poor overall survival. We performed scRNA-seq to assess the transcriptional profile of BM CD8+ T cells from treatment-naive patients. The response to AZA was positively associated with the enrichment of IFN-mediated pathways, whereas an enhanced TGF-β signaling signature was observed in non-responders. Our results suggest that targeting CD8+ T cells with inhibitors of TGF-β signaling in combination with AZA is a potential therapeutic strategy for HR-MDS and AML.">

        <tr id="Cancer treatment has been rapidly transformed by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1. However, many patients fail to respond, especially those with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), suggesting the existence of additional immune checkpoints that act through orthogonal mechanisms. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-7 and -9 are newly designated glycoimmune checkpoints that are abundantly expressed by tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. We discovered that T cells express only basal levels of Siglec transcripts; instead, they acquire Siglec-7 and -9 from interacting myeloid cells in the TME via trogocytosis, which impairs their activation and effector function. Mechanistically, Siglec-7 and -9 suppress T cell activity by dephosphorylating T cell receptor (TCR)-related signaling cascades. Using sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry, we developed a ligand that binds to Siglec-7 and -9 with high-affinity and exclusive specificity. Using this ligand, we constructed a Siglec-7/9 degrader that targets membrane Siglec-7 and -9 to the lysosome for degradation. Administration of this degrader induced efficient Siglec degradation in both T cells and myeloid cells in the TME. We found that Siglec-7/9 degradation has a negligible effect on macrophage phagocytosis, but significantly enhances T cell anti-tumor immunity. The degrader, particularly when combined with anti-CTLA-4, enhanced macrophage antigen presentation, reshaped the TME, and resulted in long-lasting T cell memory and excellent tumor control in multiple murine tumor models. These findings underscore the need to consider exogenous checkpoints acquired by T cells in the TME when selecting specific checkpoint blockade therapy to enhance T cell immunity.">

        <tr id="Drugs that eliminate senescent cells, senolytics, can be powerful when combined with pro-senescence cancer therapies. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen, we identify here SLC25A23 as a vulnerability of senescent cancer cells. Suppressing SLC25A23 disrupts cellular calcium homeostasis, impairs oxidative phosphorylation and interferes with redox signaling, leading to death of senescent cells. These effects can be replicated by salinomycin, a cation ionophore antibiotic. Salinomycin prompts a PANoptosis-like cell death in senescent cells, including apoptosis and two forms of immunogenic cell death: necroptosis and pyroptosis. Notably, we observed that salinomycin treatment or SLC25A23 suppression elevates reactive oxygen species, upregulating death receptor 5 via JNK pathway activation. We show that a combination of a DR5 agonistic antibody and salinomycin is a robust senolytic cocktail. We provide evidence that this drug combination provokes a potent NK and CD8+ T cell mediated immune destruction of senescent cancer cells, mediated by the pyroptotic cytokine IL18. Significance The efficacy of multiple cancer drugs is limited by the induction of senescence, which enables cancer cells to evade cell death. We uncover here a new selective vulnerability of senescent cancer cells and we show that this vulnerability can be targeted with a commonly-used antibiotic. We show that a combination of senescence-inducing therapy, combined with this antibiotic causes a highly immunogenic cell death phenotype that further stimulates potent immune destruction of senescent cancer cells.">

        <tr id="The thymus is the central organ involved with T-cell development and the production of naïve T cells. During normal aging, the thymus undergoes marked involution, reducing naïve T-cell output and resulting in a predominance of long-lived memory T cells in the periphery. Outside of aging, systemic stress responses that induce corticosteroids (CS), or other insults such as radiation exposure, induce thymocyte apoptosis, resulting in a transient acute thymic involution with subsequent recovery occurring after cessation of the stimulus. Despite the increasing utilization of immunostimulatory regimens in cancer, effects on the thymus and naïve T cell output have not been well characterized. Using both mouse and human systems, the thymic effects of systemic immunostimulatory regimens, such as high dose IL-2 (HD IL-2) with or without agonistic anti-CD40 mAbs and acute primary viral infection, were investigated. These regimens produced a marked acute thymic involution in mice, which correlated with elevated serum glucocorticoid levels and a diminishment of naïve T cells in the periphery. This effect was transient and followed with a rapid thymic “rebound” effect, in which an even greater quantity of thymocytes was observed compared to controls. Similar results were observed in humans, as patients receiving HD IL-2 treatment for cancer demonstrated significantly increased cortisol levels, accompanied by decreased peripheral blood naïve T cells and reduced T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a marker indicative of recent thymic emigrants. Mice adrenalectomized prior to receiving immunotherapy or viral infection demonstrated protection from this glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution, despite experiencing a substantially higher inflammatory cytokine response and increased immunopathology. Investigation into the effects of immunostimulation on middle aged (7-12 months) and advance aged (22-24 months) mice, which had already undergone significant thymic involution and had a diminished naïve T cell population in the periphery at baseline, revealed that even further involution was incurred. Thymic rebound hyperplasia, however, only occurred in young and middle-aged recipients, while advance aged not only lacked this rebound hyperplasia, but were entirely absent of any indication of thymic restoration. This coincided with prolonged deficits in naïve T cell numbers in advanced aged recipients, further skewing the already memory dominant T cell pool. These results demonstrate that, in both mice and humans, systemic immunostimulatory cancer therapies, as well as immune challenges like subacute viral infections, have the potential to induce profound, but transient, glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution and substantially reduced thymic output, resulting in the reduction of peripheral naive T cells. This can then be followed by a marked rebound effect with naïve T cell restoration, events that were shown not to occur in advanced-aged mice.">

        <tr id="HBV infection is a key risk factor for the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a highly invasive tumor, and is characterized by its persistent immunosuppressive microenvironment. This review provides an in-depth analysis of HBV-related HCC and explores the interactions between neutrophils, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, examining their roles in regulating tumor-associated macrophages and CD8+ T cells and shaping the tumor microenvironment. Two critical players in the immunosuppressive milieu of HBV-related HCC are CD8+ T cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The study explores how TAMs, initially recruited to combat infection, transform, adopting a tumor-promoting phenotype, turning against the body, promoting tumor cell proliferation, suppressing anti-tumor immunity, and assisting in the spread of cancer. Meanwhile, CD8+ T cells, crucial for controlling HBV infection, become dysfunctional and exhausted in response to persistent chronic viral inflammation. The review then dissects how TAMs manipulate this immune response, further depleting CD8+ T cell functions through mechanisms like arginine deprivation and creating hypoxic environments that lead to exhaustion. Finally, it explores the challenges and promising therapeutic avenues that target TAMs and CD8+ T cells, either separately or in combination with antiviral therapy and personalized medicine approaches, offering hope for improved outcomes in HBV-related HCC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Limited activation and infiltration of CD8+ T cells are major challenges facing T cell-based immunotherapy for most solid tumors, of which the mechanism is multilayered and not yet fully understood. Methods Levels of CD93 expression on monocytes from paired non-tumor, peritumor and tumor tissues of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were evaluated. The underlying mechanisms mediating effects of CD93+ monocytes on the inhibition and tumor exclusion of CD8+ T cells were studied through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results In this study, we found that monocytes in the peritumoral tissues of HCC significantly increased levels of CD93 expression, and these CD93+ monocytes collocated with CD8+ T cells, whose density was much higher in peritumor than intratumor areas. In vitro experiments showed that glycolytic switch mediated tumor-induced CD93 upregulation in monocytes via the Erk signaling pathway. CD93 on the one hand could enhance PD-L1 expression through the AKT-GSK3β axis, while on the other hand inducing monocytes to produce versican, a type of matrix component which interacted with hyaluronan and collagens to inhibit CD8+ T cell migration. Consistently, levels of CD93+ monocytes positively correlated with the density of peritumoral CD8+ T cells while negatively correlated with that of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. Targeting CD93 on monocytes not only increased the infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells but also enhanced tumor sensitivity to anti-PD-1 treatment in mice in vivo. Conclusion This study identified an important mechanism contributing to the activation and limited infiltration of CD8+ T cells in solid tumors, and CD93+ monocytes might represent a plausible immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.">

        <tr id="Intestinal stem cells (ISC) promote tissue repair after genotoxic or immune-mediated injury. However, ISCs are particularly sensitive to various stressors and primary targets of overwhelming immune responses such as interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated killing. In mouse models of gut damage and biopsies from patients having undergone allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, we observed IFNy expression by intestinal Treg cells. Treg cells leverage combined IFNγ and interleukin 10 (IL-10) stimulation of ISCs to nurture the growth of intestinal organoids through the activation of the mTORC1 and Myc pathways. Similarly, Treg cells or the combined addition of recombinant IFNγ and IL-10 promote the regeneration of organoids after irradiation. Exposure of organoids to Wnt- or EGF-free culture conditions revealed distinct growth factor-like properties of IFNγ and IL-10. While IFNγ induced epithelial proliferation and differentiation, combined addition of IFNγ and IL-10 led to balanced proliferation, ensuring ISC maintenance. Our results uncover a context-dependent role of inflammatory signaling in ISC, through which Treg cells promote epithelial repair.">

        <tr id="The nasal, oropharyngeal, and bronchial mucosa are primary contact points for airborne pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), SARS-CoV-2, and influenza virus. While mucosal surfaces can function as both entry points and barriers to infection, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) facilitate early immune responses to mucosal antigens. MALT contains a variety of specialized epithelial cells, including a rare cell type called a microfold cell (M cell) that functions to transport apical antigens to basolateral antigen-presenting cells, a crucial step in the initiation of mucosal immunity. M cells have been extensively characterized in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in murine and human models. However, the precise development and functions of human airway M cells is unknown. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), we generated an atlas of cells from the human adenoid and identified 16 unique cell types representing basal, club, hillock, and hematopoietic lineages, defined their developmental trajectories, and determined cell-cell relationships. Using trajectory analysis, we found that human airway M cells develop from progenitor club cells and express a gene signature distinct from intestinal M cells. Surprisingly, we also identified a heretofore unknown epithelial cell type demonstrating a robust interferon-stimulated gene signature. Our analysis of human adenoid cells enhances our understanding of mucosal immune responses and the role of M cells in airway immunity. This work also provides a resource for understanding early interactions of pathogens with airway mucosa and a platform for development of mucosal vaccines.">

        <tr id="Proliferating tumor cells take up glutamine for anabolic processes engendering glutamine deficiency in the tumor microenvironment. How this might impact immune cells is not well understood. Using multiple mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, glutamine antagonists, as well as genetic and pharmacological inhibition of glutamine utilization, we found that the number and frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) is dependent on microenvironmental glutamine levels. cDCs comprise two distinct subsets – cDC1 and cDC2, with the former subset playing a critical role in antigen cross-presentation and tumor immunity. While both subsets show dependence on Glutamine, cDC1s are particularly sensitive. Notably, glutamine antagonism did not reduce the frequency of DC precursors but decreased proliferation and survival of cDC1s. Further studies suggest a role of the nutrient sensing mTOR signaling pathway in this process. Taken together, these findings uncover glutamine dependence of cDC1s that is coopted by tumors to escape immune responses. One Sentence Summary Type 1 conventional dendritic cells require glutamine to maintain their number in non-lymphoid tissue. Significance Immune evasion is a key hallmark of cancer; however, the underlying pathways are diverse, tumor-specific and not fully elucidated. Many tumor cells avidly import glutamine to support their anabolic needs, creating a glutamine-deficient tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, using mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, we show that glutamine depletion in TME leads to reduced type 1 conventional dendritic cells – a cell type that is critical for adaptive immune responses. This work is a paradigm for how tumor cell metabolism can regulate anti-tumor immune responses and will be foundational to future efforts targeting glutamine metabolism for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Smooth muscle cell (SMC) plasticity and phenotypic switching play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, but their role in tumorigenesis is unknown. We investigated whether and how SMC diversity and plasticity plays a role in tumor angiogenesis and the tumor microenvironment. Methods and Results We use SMC-specific lineage-tracing mouse models and single cell RNA sequencing to observe the phenotypic diversity of SMCs participating in tumor vascularization. We find that a significant proportion of SMCs adopt a phenotype traditionally associated with macrophage-like cells. These cells are transcriptionally similar to ‘resolution phase’ M2b macrophages, which have been described to have a role in inflammation resolution. Computationally predicted by the ligand-receptor algorithm CellChat, signaling from BST2 on the surface of tumor cells to PIRA2 on SMCs promote this phenotypic transition; in vitro SMC assays demonstrate upregulation of macrophage transcriptional programs, and increased proliferation, migration, and phagocytic ability when exposed to BST2. Knockdown of BST2 in the tumor significantly decreases the transition towards a macrophage-like phenotype, and cells that do transition have a comparatively higher inflammatory signal typically associated with anti-tumor effect. Conclusion As BST2 is known to be a poor prognostic marker in multiple cancers where it is associated with an M2 macrophage-skewed TME, these studies suggest that phenotypically switched SMCs may have a previously unidentified role in this immunosuppressive milieu. Further translational work is needed to understand how this phenotypic switch could influence the response to anti-cancer agents and if targeted inhibition of SMC plasticity would be therapeutically beneficial.">

Few T cells (<5%) express NKG2C or DAP12 proteins. CeD villous enterocytes express an IFNγ signature (by single cell RNA sequencing and nuclear phopho-STAT1 and HLA-DR protein staining). CeD enterocytes express increased IFNγ-inducible chemokines CCL3, CCL4, CXCL10 and CXCL11 mRNA while CeD intraepithelial T cells express reduced levels of CCR5 and CXCR3 chemokine receptors, suggesting ligand-induced downregulation. CeD enterocyte HLA-E mRNA and protein are upregulated whereas HLA-B mRNA but not protein increases. Proximity ligation detected frequent interactions of αβ and γδ TCRs with HLA-E and HLA-B but not with HLA-DR and fewer NKG2C interactions with HLA-E. We suggest that CeD IFNγ-producing TCR αβ and γδ CTLs are recruited into villous epithelium by IFNγ-induced enterocyte production of CCR5 and CXCR3-binding chemokines and kill villous enterocytes primarily by TCR engagement with class I HLA molecules, including HLA-E, likely presenting gluten peptides. The IFN-γ signature of CeD villous enterocytes is a potential biomarker of active disease and a therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) is known for causing seasonal epidemics ranging from flu to more severe outcomes like pneumonia, cytokine storms, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The innate immune response and inflammasome activation play pivotal roles in sensing, preventing, and clearing the infection, as well as in the potential exacerbation of disease progression. This study examines the complex relationships between donor-specific characteristics and cytokine responses during H3N2 IAV infection using an ex vivo model. At 24 h post infection in 31 human lung explant tissue samples, key cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) were upregulated. Interestingly, a history of lung cancer did not impact the acute immune response. However, cigarette smoking and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on macrophages significantly increased IL-2 levels. Conversely, age inversely affected IL-4 levels, and diabetes mellitus negatively influenced IL-6 levels. Additionally, both diabetes mellitus and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression on CD3+/CD4+ T cells negatively impacted TNF-α levels, while body mass index was inversely associated with IFN-γ production. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression emerged as crucial in mediating acute innate and adaptive immune responses. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between individual physiological traits and immune responses during influenza infection, underscoring the importance of tailored and personalized approaches in IAV treatment and prevention.">

        <tr id="A principal reason for the high global morbidity and mortality of tuberculosis (TB) is the lack of efficacy of the only licensed TB vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), as parenteral BCG does not induce local pulmonary immune memory. Animal studies have shown that mucosal BCG vaccination provides superior protection against TB due to generation of lung resident memory T cells (TRM). Here, we demonstrated that following mucosal vaccination with the genetically modified virulent BCG strain, BCG::RD1, distal airway epithelial progenitors were mobilized to assist with restoration of alveolar epithelium. By way of their migration-mediated activation of latent TGF-β, lung CD8+ TRM differentiation was induced. Mucosal vaccinations using nonvirulent strains of BCG in which airway epithelial progenitors were not mobilized, as well as genetic inhibition of migration-mediated activation of TGF-β, resulted in significantly lower numbers of lung CD8+ TRM. In addition, we discovered CD8+ cells with ex-lung and stem-like TRM phenotypes that persisted in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes for up to four months following mucosal BCG vaccination. These results link airway epithelial progenitor-mediated repair of injured lung tissue with induction of resident T cell memory and delineate why persistence of TRM in the lung is short-lived. These findings may explain why mucosal vaccination with virulent BCG strains is more protective against TB and thus have notable implications for future TB vaccine development. One Sentence Summary Following lung damage due to inhalation of virulent BCG, distal airway epithelial progenitor cells interact with lung CD8+ T cells to induce their differentiation into resident memory T cells via migration-mediated activation of TGF-β.">

        <tr id="HIV-1 infection induces persistent immune system activation despite antiretroviral therapy. New immunomodulatory targets might be required to restore immune competence. The dendritic cells immunoreceptor (DCIR) can bind HIV-1 and regulate immune functions and extracellular vesicles (EVs) production. EVs have emerged as biomarkers and a non-invasive tool to monitor HIV-1 progression. In people living with HIV-1, an increase in the size and abundance of EVs is associated with a decline in the CD4/CD8 T cells ratio, a key marker of immune dysfunction. Analysis of host nucleic acids within EVs has revealed an enrichment of microRNA-155 (miR-155) during HIV-1 infection. Experiments have demonstrated that miR-155-rich EVs enhance HIV-1 infection in vitro. A humanized NSG-mice model was established to assess the in vivo impact of miR-155-rich EVs. Co-production of virus with miR-155-rich EVs heightened the viral load and lowered the CD4/CD8 ratio in the mice. Upon euthanasia, EVs were isolated from plasma for size and quantity assessment. Consistent with findings in individuals with HIV-1, increased EVs size and abundance were inversely correlated with the CD4/CD8 ratio. Next, by using the more closely related physiological virus co-product with EV-miR-155, we tested a DCIR inhibitor to limit infection and immune damage in a humanized mouse model. DCIR inhibition reduced infection and partially restored immune functions. Finally, viral particles and various EV subtypes can convey HIV-1 RNA. HIV-1 RNA was predominantly associated with large EVs (200-1000nm) rather than small EVs (50-200nm). Viral loads in large EVs strongly correlated with blood and tissue markers of immune activation. The humanized mice model has proven its applicability to studying the roles of EVs on HIV-1 infection and investigating the impact of DCIR inhibition. Author Summary Despite more than 40 years of research, HIV remains a threat to public health around the world. People living with HIV are efficiently treated with antiretroviral therapy, but damage to the immune system persists and the causes remain unknown. Extracellular vesicles allow material, such as microRNA, to transfer between cells. Here, we evaluated the impact of one microRNA, microRNA-155, transported by extracellular vesicles, on HIV infection. Mice were grafted with a human immune system to allow infection by HIV. We showed that extracellular vesicles carrying microRNA-155 amplified mice infection. Extracellular vesicles also reflect the state of their cell of origin. Their analysis can reveal biomarkers to monitor HIV infection. Thus, HIV viral load was quantified in purified extracellular vesicles. We found that the measurement of HIV viral load in purified EVs is a more precise biomarker of disease progression than the traditional plasma viral load. Additionally, potential treatments like DCIR inhibitors improve our ability to manage HIV-1 by restoring the CD4/CD8 ratio, a critical element of the infection process. Overall, our study highlighted the importance of extracellular vesicle cargo in a humanized mouse model of HIV-1 infection, as well as the potential of targeting DCIR to restore the immune response. Highlights MicroRNA-155 promotes HIV-1 infection of humanized NSG mice Abundance and size of total plasmatic EVs are biomarkers of immune dysfunction associated with HIV-1 infection DCIR inhibition limits HIV-1 infection of humanized NSG mice and attenuates immune impairment HIV-1 RNA enrichment in large EVs was associated with biomarkers of immune activation and dysfunction">

        <tr id="Introduction This is a prospective, rigorous inquiry into the systemic immune effects of standard adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, for WHO grade 4, glioblastoma. The purpose is to identify peripheral immunologic effects never yet reported in key immune populations, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which are critical to the immune suppressive environment of glioblastoma. We hypothesize that harmful immune-supportive white blood cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, expand in response to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide, essentially promoting systemic immunity similar what is seen in chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Methods 16 patients were enrolled in a single-institution, observational, immune surveillance study where peripheral blood was collected and interrogated by flow cytometry and RNAseq. Tumor tissue from baseline assessment was analyzed with spatial proteomics to link peripheral blood findings to baseline tissue characteristics. Results We identified an increase in myeloid-derived suppressor cells during the final week of a six-week treatment of chemoradiotherapy in peripheral blood of patients that were not alive at two years after diagnosis compared to those who were living. This was also associated with a decrease in CD8+ T lymphocytes that produced IFNγ, the potent anti-tumor cytokine. Discussion These data suggest that, as in chronic inflammatory disease, systemic immunity is impaired following delivery of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Finally, baseline investigation of myeloid cells within tumor tissue did not differ between survival groups, indicating immune surveillance of peripheral blood during adjuvant therapy may be a critical missing link to educate our understanding of the immune effects of standard of care therapy for glioblastoma.">

        <tr id="Background Immune therapies are emerging as a critical component of cancer treatment, capable of delivering durable and potentially curative responses. While CAR-T cell therapy has proven effective for hematological malignancies, it faces challenges in treating solid tumors due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and physical barriers hindering CAR-T cell infiltration. NK cells, particularly adaptive NK (aNK) cells, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to recognize and kill tumor cells without prior sensitization and their resistance to immunosuppressive environments. Purpose The study investigates the role of cytokines, specifically IL-21 and IL-15, in enhancing aNK cell expansion and activation using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Methods Buffy coats and GBM TILs were collected from Karolinska Hospital. NK cells were isolated and expanded in vitro with IL-15 and IL-21 cytokines and feeder cells (K562 and K562E). Furthermore, tumor lysate was added in the cultures to boost memory responses in aNK cells. NK cell functionality, cytotoxicity, and phenotyping was assessed using flow cytometry and statistical analysis (t-test and two-way ANOVA) used to validate the results. Further animal model was used to validate the cytotoxicity capacities of these cells against GBM tumors using a zebrafish model. Results IL-21 drives the expansion of aNK better than IL-15 controls, data shown in PBMCs and TILs derived from GBM patients and IPLA OVCA patients. Additionally, the use of tumor lysate as a booster for restimulation further amplifies the cytotoxic capacity of aNK cells against autologous tumors. The zebrafish model validates this method, by decreasing the tumor size in zebrafish animals after 3 days of injection. Conclusion The results demonstrate that IL-21 is essential for the specific expansion of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. Additionally, tumor lysate significantly increases the cytotoxic efficacy of aNK cells upon restimulation with the same tumor cells. These findings suggest that IL-21 plays a crucial role in the specific expansion and activation of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. By optimizing the expansion protocol, this method aims to advance the clinical application of aNK cells in immunotherapies for solid tumors, offering a potential solution to the limitations faced by current CAR-T therapies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) T regulatory cells are critical for maintaining self-tolerance, immune homeostasis, and regulating the immune system. Methods We investigated interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) signalling on T regulatory cells (Tregs) during Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) infection using a mouse model on a BALB/c background, specifically with IL-4Rα knockdown in Tregs (Foxp3creIL-4Rα−/lox). Results We showed an impairment of Treg responses, along with a decreased bacterial burden and diminished tissue pathology in the liver and spleen, which translated into better survival. Mechanistically, we observed an enhancement of the Th1 signature, characterised by increased expression of the T-bet transcription factor and a greater number of effector T cells producing IFN-γ, IL-2 following ex-vivo stimulation with heat-killed L. monocytogenes in Foxp3creIL-4Rα-/lox mice. Furthermore, CD8 T cells from Foxp3creIL-4Rα-/lox mice displayed increased cytotoxicity (Granzyme-B) with higher proliferation capacity (Ki-67), better survival (Bcl-2) with concomitant reduced apoptosis (activated caspase 3). In contrast to L. monocytogenes, Foxp3creIL-4Rα-/lox mice displayed similar bacterial burdens, lung pathology and survival during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection, despite increased T cell numbers and IFN-γ, TNF and IL-17 production. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that the diminished IL-4Rα signalling on Foxp3+ T regulatory cells resulted in a loss of their functionality, leading to survival benefits in listeriosis but not in tuberculosis.">

        <tr id="Aberrant Notch, which is a defining feature of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, regulates intercellular communication in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). This includes tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment through Notch-dependent cytokine secretion, contributing to an immunosuppressive TIME. Despite the low response rate of TNBC to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), here, we report that inhibition of Notch-driven cytokine-mediated programs reduces TAMs and induces responsiveness to sequentially delivered ICB. This is characterized by the emergence of GrB+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the primary tumor. A more impressive effect of sequential treatment is observed in the lung where TAM depletion and increased CTLs are accompanied by near-complete abolition of metastases. This is due to (i) therapeutic reduction in Notch-dependent, prometastatic circulating factors released by the primary tumor, and (ii) elevated PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in lung metastases, rendering them profoundly sensitive to ICB. These findings highlight the potential of combination cytokine inhibition and ICB as an immunotherapeutic strategy in TNBC.">

        <tr id="Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is associated with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a poliomyelitis-like illness causing paralysis in young children. However, mechanisms of paralysis are unclear, and antiviral therapies are lacking. To better understand EV-D68 disease, we inoculated newborn mice intracranially to assess viral tropism, virulence, and immune responses. Wild-type (WT) mice inoculated intracranially with a neurovirulent strain of EV-D68 showed infection of spinal cord neurons and developed paralysis. Spinal tissue from infected mice revealed increased levels of chemokines, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, and T cells relative to controls, suggesting that immune cell infiltration influences pathogenesis. To define the contribution of cytokine-mediated immune cell recruitment to disease, we inoculated mice lacking CCR2, a receptor for several EV-D68-upregulated cytokines, or RAG1, which is required for lymphocyte maturation. WT, Ccr2-/-, and Rag1-/- mice had comparable viral titers in spinal tissue. However, Ccr2-/- and Rag1-/- mice had significantly less paralysis relative to WT mice. Consistent with impaired T cell recruitment to sites of infection in Ccr2-/- and Rag1-/- mice, antibody-mediated depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from WT mice diminished paralysis. These results indicate that immune cell recruitment to the spinal cord promotes EV-D68-associated paralysis and illuminate new targets for therapeutic intervention. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is primarily categorized into basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most prevalent form of skin cancer, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), the second most common type. Both BCC and cSCC represent a significant health burden, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. The immune system plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of NMSC, making it a critical focus for therapeutic interventions. This review highlights key immunological targets in BCC and cSCC, with a focus on immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4, which regulate T cell activity and contribute to immune evasion. This review also highlights anti-tumor immune cell subsets within the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and dendritic cells. Additionally, it examines the immunosuppressive elements of the TME, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as well as their roles in NMSC progression and resistance to therapy. Emerging strategies targeting these immune elements, such as monoclonal antibodies, are also discussed for their potential to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve clinical outcomes. By elucidating the immunological landscape of BCC and cSCC and drawing comparisons to melanoma, this review highlights the transformative potential of immunotherapy in treating these malignancies.">

        <tr id="Abstract High-grade serous ovarian cancer remains a poorly understood disease with a high mortality rate. Although most patients respond to cytotoxic therapies, a majority will experience recurrence. This may be due to a minority of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells (CSC) that survive chemotherapy and are capable of repopulating heterogeneous tumors. It remains unclear how CSCs are supported in the tumor microenvironment (TME) particularly during chemotherapy exposure. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) make up half of the immune population of the ovarian TME and are known to support CSCs and contribute to cancer progression. TAMs are plastic cells that alter their phenotype in response to environmental stimuli and thus may influence CSC maintenance during chemotherapy. Given the plasticity of TAMs, we studied the effects of carboplatin on macrophage phenotypes using both THP1- and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)–derived macrophages and whether this supports CSCs and ovarian cancer progression following treatment. We found that carboplatin exposure induces an M1-like proinflammatory phenotype that promotes SOX2 expression, spheroid formation, and CD117+ ovarian CSCs, and that macrophage-secreted CCL2/MCP-1 is at least partially responsible for this effect. Depletion of TAMs during carboplatin exposure results in fewer CSCs and prolonged survival in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. This study supports a role for platinum-based chemotherapies in promoting a transient proinflammatory M1-like TAM that enriches for CSCs during treatment. Improving our understanding of TME responses to cytotoxic drugs and identifying novel mechanisms of CSC maintenance will enable the development of better therapeutic strategies for high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Significance: We show that chemotherapy enhances proinflammatory macrophage phenotypes that correlate with ovarian cancer progression. Given that macrophages are the most prominent immune cell within these tumors, this work provides the foundation for future translational studies targeting specific macrophage populations during chemotherapy, a promising approach to prevent relapse in ovarian cancer.">

Plasmacytoid dendritic cell infiltration is known to be associated with glioblastoma progression and promotes tumor immunosuppression. We provide important details to indicate that glioblastoma cell-secreted CCL21 plays a dual role both in recruiting plasmacytoid dendritic cells via binding to CCR7 and activating plasmacytoid dendritic cells through the CCR7/ACKR4—β-arrestin/CIITA pathway. Our result also provides a rationale to therapeutically target CCL21 as a potential novel treatment for glioblastoma. Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that are traditionally divided into two distinct subsets: myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). pDCs are known for their ability to secrete large amounts of cytokine type I interferons (IFN- α). In our previous work, we have demonstrated that pDC infiltration promotes glioblastoma (GBM) tumor immunosuppression through decreased IFN-α secretion via TLR-9 signaling and increased suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) via increased IL-10 secretion, resulting in poor overall outcomes in mouse models of GBM. Further dissecting the overall mechanism of pDC-mediated GBM immunosuppression, in this study, we identified CCL21 as highly upregulated by multiple GBM cell lines, which recruit pDCs to tumor sites via CCL21-CCR7 signaling. Furthermore, pDCs are activated by CCL21 in the GBM microenvironment through intracellular signaling of β-arrestin and CIITA. Finally, we found that CCL21-treated pDCs directly suppress CD8+ T cell proliferation without affecting regulatory T cells (Tregs) differentiation, which is considered the canonical pathway of immunotolerant regulation. Taken together, our results show that pDCs play a multifaced role in GBM immunosuppression, and CCL21 could be a novel therapeutic target in GBM to overcome pDC-mediated immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="There is a complex interplay between viral infection and host innate immune response regarding disease severity and outcomes. Neutrophil hyperactivation, including excessive release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is linked to exacerbated disease in acute COVID-19, notably in hospitalized patients. Delineating protective versus detrimental neutrophil responses is essential to developing targeted COVID-19 therapies and relies on high-quality translational animal models. In this study, we utilize a previously established feline model for COVID-19 to investigate neutrophil dysfunction in which experimentally infected cats develop clinical disease that mimics acute COVID-19. Specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2; Delta variant) (n = 24) or vehicle (n = 6). Plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissues were collected at various time points over 12 days post-inoculation. Systematic and temporal evaluation of the kinetics of neutrophil activation was conducted by measuring markers of activation including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) in SARS-CoV-2-infected cats at 4 and 12 days post-inoculation (dpi) and compared to vehicle-inoculated controls. Cytokine profiling supported elevated innate inflammatory responses with specific upregulation of neutrophil activation and NET formation-related markers, namely IL-8, IL-18, CXCL1, and SDF-1, in infected cats. An increase in MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free dsDNA in infected cats compared to vehicle-inoculated was noted and supported by histopathologic severity in respiratory tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses further supported correlation of NET markers with tissue damage, especially 4 dpi. Differential gene expression analyses indicated an upregulation of genes associated with innate immune and neutrophil activation pathways. Transcripts involved in activation and NETosis pathways were upregulated by 4 dpi and downregulated by 12 dpi, suggesting peak activation of neutrophils and NET-associated markers in the early acute stages of infection. Correlation analyses conducted between NET-specific markers and clinical scores as well as histopathologic scores support association between neutrophil activation and disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model. Overall, this study emphasizes the effect of neutrophil activation and NET release in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a feline model, prompting further investigation into therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating excessive innate inflammatory responses in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils play a crucial role in various pathophysiological conditions, yet targeting them for therapeutic intervention has been discouraged due to the associated risk of infections. Thus, identification of neutrophil subsets and their involvement in inflammatory conditions is warranted for targeted therapeutic strategies. This study, through screening of surface proteins on neutrophils isolated from different tissue microenvironments, identified a distinct neutrophil subset, CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils, expressing Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). Interestingly, these Sca1pos neutrophils were more abundant in the liver than BM, blood, and lungs. Further analysis revealed that Sca1pos neutrophils are mature and activated with enhanced effector functions, including superoxide generation, phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis. Tracing studies demonstrated ageing-independent characteristics of Sca1pos neutrophils. Remarkably, Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophils promote T cell proliferation through ROS, while inhibition of Sca-1 restores T cell proliferation and ROS generation. Intriguingly, inflammatory as well as metabolic cues induce the transition of conventional neutrophils (Sca1neg) to Sca1pos neutrophils and differentiation of progenitors (granulocyte monocyte progenitors, GMPs) into Sca1pos neutrophils. Furthermore, in vivo models of acute inflammation, peritonitis, and chronic inflammatory condition, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), exhibit an increase of Sca1pos neutrophils at inflammatory sites, while the pharmacological approach using NAC specifically mitigates the expansion of these pro-inflammatory neutrophils. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel subset of Sca1pos neutrophils with implications for inflammation. Significance Statement Neutrophilic inflammation remains the leading driver in infectious and inflammatory diseases. Targeting neutrophil populations remained un-recommended due to hampering the immunological functions of neutrophils. The heterogeneity of neutrophils provides the perspective to target altered neutrophil subsets, but subtle changes defining neutrophil subsets make it complex and ambiguous. Our study identified abundant expression of Sca1on distinct neutrophils under steady state and inflammation. Thus, we reported previously undefined Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophil subsets and elucidated their regulation. This study further established their involvement in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. This understanding may further pave the way toward targeting specific neutrophil subsets in pathologies characterized by neutrophilic inflammation. Graphical Abstract Highlights CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophil subset identified with <1% presence in BM and >40% frequency in the liver. These neutrophils are mature and activated, demonstrating enhanced effector functions. Sca1pos neutrophils promote T cell proliferation and display pro-inflammatory characteristics. Conventional Sca1neg neutrophils transition into Sca1pos neutrophils in response to inflammatory signals, while progenitors undergo differentiation. Both acute and chronic inflammatory models show the expansion of CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils.">

        <tr id="Introduction Patients with chronic HBV infection (CHI) exhibit defective anti-viral immune-response whose underlying causes still remain unclear. Monocytes act as immune sentinels for pathogens and can regulate immunity via interaction with other immune-cells, apart from differentiating into macrophages. Immune-checkpoint molecules (ICMs) expressed by immune-cells, including monocytes are known to negatively regulate immune-responses. Here, we evaluated the expression of ICMs, namely, Gal-9, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 on monocytes in different phases of CHI, identified the viral and the host factors causing their aberrant expression and investigated their impact during interaction of monocytes with T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells and also on monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Influence of Tenofovir therapy on the expression of monocytic ICMs was also studied. Methods Collection of blood and liver-tissue samples from HBV infected patients and controls, flow-cytometry, cell sorting, cell culture and immune-fluorescence were performed for this study. Results Gal-9+ and PD-L1+-monocytes were significantly increased in HBeAg-positive as well as HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients than healthy controls (HC). In immune-tolerant (IT) subjects, only Gal-9+-monocytes and in inactive carriers (IC), PD-L1+-monocytes were higher than HC while CTLA-4+-monocytes remained comparable among groups. High serum Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) concentration in CHB as well as IT and TNF-α in CHB triggered monocytic Gal-9-expression whereas, PD-L1 was induced by elevated TNF-α and IL-4 in CHB and IL-1β in CHB and IC. Purified monocytes from CHB and IT having high Gal-9 expression led to expansion of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+-Tregs, CD19+IL-10+-Bregs and CD19+CD27-CD21–atypical memory B-cells and these monocytes also preferentially differentiated into M2-macrophages. These phenomena were reversed by anti-Gal-9-antibody. Parallelly, PD-L1+-monocytes in CHB and IC reduced IL-2/IFN-γ and IL-6 production by HBV-specific T- and B-cells respectively, which were restored by anti-PD-L1-antibody. Both Gal-9+- and PD-L1+-monocytes caused decline in IFN-γ+-NK-cells but enhanced IL-10-expressing HBV-specific-T-cells and NK-cells. Increased intrahepatic CD14+Gal-9+ and CD14+PD-L1+-monocytes were noted in CHB patients than HC. One-year tenofovir therapy failed to reduce monocytic Gal-9 and PD-L1 along with the levels of HBsAg, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-4. Conclusions Monocytic Gal-9 and PD-L1, expressed heterogeneously in different phases of CHI, exert diverse inhibitory effects on immune-responses and their therapeutic targeting could boost anti-HBV immunity.">

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment, with oncolytic adenoviruses showing power as immunotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the immunotherapeutic potential of an adenovirus construct expressing CXCL9, CXCL10, or IL-15 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumor models. Our results demonstrated robust cytokine secretion upon viral treatment, suggesting effective transgene expression. Subsequent analysis using resistance-based transwell migration and microfluidic chip assays demonstrated increased T-cell migration in response to chemokine secretion by infected cells in both 2D and 3D cell models. Flow cytometry analysis revealed CXCR3 receptor expression across T-cell subsets, with the highest percentage found on CD8+ T-cells, underscoring their key role in immune cell migration. Alongside T-cells, we also detected NK-cells in the tumors of immunocompromised mice treated with cytokine-encoding adenoviruses. Furthermore, we identified potential immunogenic antigens that may enhance the efficacy and specificity of our armed oncolytic adenoviruses in ccRCC. Overall, our findings using ccRCC cell line, in vivo humanized mice, physiologically relevant PDCs in 2D and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) in 3D suggest that chemokine-armed adenoviruses hold promise for enhancing T-cell migration and improving immunotherapy outcomes in ccRCC. Our study contributes to the development of more effective ccRCC treatment strategies by elucidating immune cell infiltration and activation mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and highlights the usefulness of PDOs for predicting clinical relevance and validating novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Overall, our research offers insights into the rational design and optimization of viral-based immunotherapies for ccRCC.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the brain’s resident macrophages, can be reconstituted by surrogate cells - a process termed “microglia replacement.” To expand the microglia replacement toolkit, we here introduce estrogen-regulated (ER) homeobox B8 (Hoxb8) conditionally immortalized macrophages, a cell model for generation of immune cells from murine bone marrow, as a versatile model for microglia replacement. We find that ER-Hoxb8 macrophages are highly comparable to primary bone marrow-derived (BMD) macrophages in vitro, and, when transplanted into a microglia-free brain, engraft the parenchyma and differentiate into microglia-like cells. Furthermore, ER-Hoxb8 progenitors are readily transducible by virus and easily stored as stable, genetically manipulated cell lines. As a demonstration of this system’s power for studying the effects of disease mutations on microglia in vivo, we created stable, Adar1-mutated ER-Hoxb8 lines using CRISPR-Cas9 to study the intrinsic contribution of macrophages to Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS), an inherited interferonopathy that primarily affects the brain and immune system. We find that Adar1 knockout elicited interferon secretion and impaired macrophage production in vitro, while preventing brain macrophage engraftment in vivo - phenotypes that can be rescued with concurrent mutation of Ifih1 (MDA5) in vitro, but not in vivo. Lastly, we extended these findings by generating ER-Hoxb8 progenitors from mice harboring a patient-specific Adar1 mutation (D1113H). We demonstrated the ability of microglia-specific D1113H mutation to drive interferon production in vivo, suggesting microglia drive AGS neuropathology. In sum, we introduce the ER-Hoxb8 approach to model microglia replacement and use it to clarify macrophage contributions to AGS.">

        <tr id="In both humans and mice, natural killer (NK) cells are important lymphocytes of the innate immune system. They are often considered pro-inflammatory effector cells but may also have a regulatory or pro-resolving function by switching their cytokine profile towards the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β, and by killing pro-inflammatory immune cells. Here, the role of NK cells in the resolution of malaria lung pathology was studied. Malaria complications, such as malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS), are often lethal despite the rapid and efficient killing of Plasmodium parasites with antimalarial drugs. Hence, studying the resolution and healing mechanisms involved in the recovery from these complications could be useful to develop adjunctive treatments. Treatment of Plasmodium berghei NK65-infected C57BL/6 mice with a combination of artesunate and chloroquine starting at the appearance of symptoms was used as a model to study the resolution of MA-ARDS. The role of NK cells was studied using anti-NK1.1 depletion antibodies and NK cell-deficient mice. Using both methods, NK cells were found to be dispensable in the development of MA-ARDS, as shown previously. In contrast, NK cells were crucial in the initiation of resolution upon antimalarial treatment, as survival was significantly decreased in the absence of NK cells. Considerably increased IL-10 expression by NK cells suggested an anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving phenotype. Despite the increase in Il10 expression in the NK cells, inhibition of the IL-10/IL-10R axis using anti-IL10R antibodies had no effect on the resolution for MA-ARDS, suggesting that the pro-resolving effect of NK cells cannot solely be attributed to their IL-10 production. In conclusion, NK cells contribute to the resolution of experimental MA-ARDS.">

        <tr id="The mucosal immune system is a critical first line of defense to infectious diseases, as many pathogens enter the body through mucosal surfaces, disrupting the balanced interactions between mucosal cells, secretory molecules, and microbiota in this challenging microenvironment. The mucosal immune system comprises of a complex and integrated network that includes the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). One of its primary responses to microbes is the secretion of IgA, whose role in the mucosa is vital for preventing pathogen colonization, invasion and spread. The mechanisms involved in these key responses include neutralization of pathogens, immune exclusion, immune modulation, and cross-protection. The generation and maintenance of high affinity IgA responses require a delicate balance of multiple components, including B and T cell interactions, innate cells, the cytokine milieu (e.g., IL-21, IL-10, TGF-β), and other factors essential for intestinal homeostasis, including the gut microbiota. In this review, we will discuss the main cellular components (e.g., T cells, innate lymphoid cells, dendritic cells) in the gut microenvironment as mediators of important effector responses and as critical players in supporting B cells in eliciting and maintaining IgA production, particularly in the context of enteric infections and vaccination in humans. Understanding the mechanisms of humoral and cellular components in protection could guide and accelerate the development of more effective mucosal vaccines and therapeutic interventions to efficiently combat mucosal infections.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Increased CD4+GNLY+ T cells have been confirmed to be inversely associated with CD4+ T cell count in immunological non-responders (INRs), however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the characteristics of CD4+GNLY+ T cells and their relationship with immune restoration. Single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell TCR sequencing, and flow cytometry were used to analyze the frequency, phenotypes, and function of CD4+GNLY+ T cells. Moreover, Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect plasma cytokines production in patients. CD4+GNLY+ T cells were found to be highly clonally expanded, characterized by higher levels of cytotoxicity, senescence, P24, and HIV-1 DNA than CD4+GNLY− T cells. Additionally, the frequency of CD4+GNLY+ T cells increased after ART, and further increased in INRs, and were positively associated with the antiretroviral therapy duration in INR. Furthermore, increased IL-15 levels in INRs positively correlated with the frequency and senescence of CD4+GNLY+ T cells, suggesting that CD4+GNLY+ T cells may provide new insights for understanding the poor immune reconstitution of INRs. In conclusion, increased, highly clonally expanded, and senescent CD4+GNLY+ T cells may contribute to poor immune reconstitution in HIV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Harnessing the immunogenic potential of senescent tumor cells provides an opportunity to remodel tumor microenvironment (TME) and boost antitumor immunity. However, this potential needs to be sophisticatedly wielded to avoid additional immunosuppressive capacity of senescent cells. Our study shows that blocking the JAK2/STAT3 pathway enhances immunogenic efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib (Ali)–induced senescence by reducing immunosuppressive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) while preserving immunogenic SASP. Hypothesizing that SASP reprogramming with Ali and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Rux) will benefit cancer immunotherapy, we create nanoparticulate crystals (Ali-Rux) composed of Ali and Rux with a fully active pharmaceutical ingredient. Immunization with Ali-Rux–orchestrated senescent cells promotes stronger activation of antigen-presenting cells, enhancing antitumor immune surveillance. This approach remodels the TME by increasing CD8+ T cell and NK recruitment and activation while decreasing MDSCs. Combined with PD-L1 blockade, Ali-Rux elicits a durable antitumor immune response, suggesting the TME reshaping approach as a potential cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Pregnancy is associated with profound changes in immunity. However, pregnancy-related respiratory immune adaptations in response to influenza infection and their impact on disease severity remain unclear. Here, we describe, in a preclinical model of mid-gestation pregnancy, a mechanism of enhanced host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) localized to the nasal cavity that limits viral replication and reduces the magnitude of intrapulmonary immune responses. Consequently, the pregnant mice show reduced pulmonary pathology and preserved airway function after IAV infection. The early restriction of viral replication is independent of type I interferon (IFN) but dependent on increased antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) driven by interleukin-17+ (IL-17+) γδ+ T cells within the nasal passages. This pathway of host defense against IAV infection in the upper airways during pregnancy restricts early viral infection and prevents virus dissemination into the lung supporting maternal fitness.">

        <tr id="Abstract Mounting evidence indicates the involvement of peripheral immunity in the regulation of brain function, influencing aspects such as neuronal development, emotion, and cognitive abilities. Previous studies from our laboratory have revealed that neonatal hepatitis B vaccination can downregulate hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and spatial learning memory. In the current post-epidemic era characterized by universal vaccination, understanding the impact of acquired immunity on neuronal function and neuropsychiatric disorders, along with exploring potential underlying mechanisms, becomes imperative. We employed hepatitis B vaccine-induced CD3 positive T cells in immunodeficient mice to investigate the key mechanisms through which T cell subsets modulate hippocampal neurogenesis and anxiety-like behaviours. Our data revealed that mice receiving hepatitis B vaccine-induced T cells exhibited heightened anxiety and decreased hippocampal cell proliferation compared to those receiving phosphate-buffered saline-T cells or wild-type mice. Importantly, these changes were predominantly mediated by infiltrated CD8+ T cells into the brain, rather than CD4+ T cells. Transcriptome profiling of CD8+ T cells unveiled that C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 positive (CXCR6+) CD8+ T cells were recruited into the brain through microglial and astrocyte-derived C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16 (CXCL16). This recruitment process impaired neurogenesis and induced anxiety-like behaviour via tumour necrosis factor-α-dependent mechanisms. Our findings highlight the role of glial cell derived CXCL16 in mediating the recruitment of CXCR6+CD8+ T cell subsets into the brain. This mechanism represents a potential avenue for modulating hippocampal neurogenesis and emotion-related behaviours after hepatitis B vaccination.">

        <tr id="Tumor immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment in recent years, offering vast potential. This method primarily involves targeting and inhibiting the suppressive checkpoints present in different immune cells to enhance their activation, ultimately leading to tumor regression. However, tumor cells exploit the surrounding immune cells and tissues to establish a tumor microenvironment (TME) that supports their survival and growth. Within the TME, the efficacy of effector immune cells is compromised, as tumor cells exploit inhibitory immune cells to suppress their function. Furthermore, certain immune cells can be co-opted by tumor cells to facilitate tumor growth. While significantly enhancing the body’s tumor immunity can lead to tumor regression, it can also result in severe toxic side effects and an inflammatory factor storm. As a consequence, patients often discontinue treatment due to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) or, in extreme cases, succumb to toxic side effects before experiencing tumor regression. In this analysis, we examined several remission regimens for irAEs, each with its own drawbacks, including toxic side effects or suppression of tumor immunotherapy, which is undesirable. A recent research study, specifically aimed at downregulating intestinal epithelial barrier permeability, has shown promising results in reducing the severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) while preserving immune function. This approach effectively reduces the severity of IBD without compromising the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ, which are crucial for maintaining the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. Based on the substantial similarities between IBD and ICI colitis (combo immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced colitis), this review proposes that targeting epithelial cells represents a crucial research direction for mitigating irAEs in the future.">

        <tr id="T cells engineered to express chimeric-antigen receptors (CAR-T cells) can effectively control relapsed and refractory haematological malignancies in the clinic. However, the successes of CAR-T cell therapy have not been recapitulated in solid tumours due to a range of barriers such as immunosuppression, poor infiltration, and tumour heterogeneity. Numerous strategies are being developed to overcome these barriers, which include improving culture conditions and manufacturing protocols, implementing novel CAR designs, and novel approaches to engineering the T cell phenotype. In this review, we describe the various emerging strategies to improve CAR T cell therapy for solid tumours. We specifically focus on new strategies to modulate cell function and fate that have precipitated from the growing knowledge of transcriptional circuits driving T cell differentiation, with the ultimate goal of driving more productive anti-tumour T cell immunity. Evidence shows that enrichment of particular phenotypic subsets of T cells in the initial cell product correlates to improved therapeutic responses and clinical outcomes. Furthermore, T cell exhaustion and poor persistence are major factors limiting therapeutic efficacy. The latest preclinical work shows that targeting specific master regulators and transcription factors can overcome these key barriers, resulting in superior T cell therapeutic products. This can be achieved by targeting key transcriptional circuits promoting memory-like phenotypes or sustaining key effector functions within the hostile tumour microenvironment. Additional discussion points include emerging considerations for the field such as (i) targeting permutations of transcription factors, (ii) transient expression systems, (iii) tissue specificity, and (iv) expanding this strategy beyond CAR-T cell therapy and cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Broad T cell phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions were prominent in COVID-19. There are few and inconclusive data about the role of immune checkpoints for T cell exhaustion/activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Methods We tested T cell subsets and immune checkpoints in 177 MM patients with COVID-19, as well as in 32 healthy infected controls and 42 uninfected MM patients. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulation and immune checkpoints (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, OX40, and 4-1BB) were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results We have found that pronounced lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio in severe COVID-19 patients were especially developed within the first month after infection. And T cell subset dysregulation was persistent in severe patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune checkpoints on CD4+ T cells were variable and uncorrelated with the level of adaptive immunity, while the proportion of CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with humoral immune response. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in severe patients and sustained for more than 2 months, which was associated with impaired cellular immune function. Moreover, exhausted molecules PD-1 and TIGIT on T cells were reduced in immunotherapy patients. Conclusion The prolonged T cell dysregulation after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the close surveillance from reinfection in MM patients even during convalescence. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells could be important prognostic factors to stratify prognosis in MM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, immunotherapy may downregulate the expression of exhausted checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT, leading to T cell overactivation and severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="In EAE, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, immunization with MOG autoantigen results in the generation of Th1/Th17 T cells in the periphery. MOG-specific T cells then invade into the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neuronal demyelination. Microglia, innate immune cells in the CNS are known to regulate various neuronal diseases. However, the role of microglia in EAE has remained elusive. BRD4 is a BET protein expressed in microglia, whether BRD4 in microglia contributes to EAE has not been determined. We show that EAE pathology was markedly reduced with microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout (cKO). In these mice, microglia- T cell interactions were greatly reduced, leading to the lack of T cell reactivation. Microglia specific transcriptome data showed downregulation of genes required for interaction with and reactivation of T cells in Brd4 cKO samples. In summary, BRD4 plays a critical role in regulating microglia function in normal and EAE CNS. Summary This study demonstrates that in a EAE model, microglia-specific Brd4 conditional knockout mice were defective in expressing genes required for microglia- T cells interaction and those involved in neuroinflammation, and demyelination resulting in fewer CNS T cell invasion and display marked reduction in EAE pathology.">

        <tr id="The incidence and mortality of digestive system-related cancers have always been high and attributed to the heterogeneity and complexity of the immune microenvironment of the digestive system. Furthermore, several studies have shown that chronic inflammation in the digestive system is responsible for cancer incidence; therefore, controlling inflammation is a potential strategy to stop the development of cancer. Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC) represent a heterogeneous group of lymphocytes that exist in contrast to T cells. They function by interacting with cytokines and immune cells in an antigen-independent manner. In the digestive system cancer, from the inflammatory phase to the development, migration, and metastasis of tumors, ILC have been found to interact with the immune microenvironment and either control or promote these processes. The conventional treatments for digestive tumors have limited efficacy, therefore, ILC-associated immunotherapies are promising strategies. This study reviews the characterization of different ILC subpopulations, how they interact with and influence the immune microenvironment as well as chronic inflammation, and their promotional or inhibitory role in four common digestive system tumors, including pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, and hepatocellular cancers. In particular, the review emphasizes the role of ILC in associating chronic inflammation with cancer and the potential for enhanced immunotherapy with cytokine therapy and adoptive immune cell therapy.">

However, the impact of such early-life RSV infections on intestinal immunity in adulthood remains unclear. Herein, we show that RSV infection in 3-week-old mice induced persistent differential natural killer (NK) and T cell profiles within the lungs and gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoid tissues (GALT) in adulthood. Notably, male mice exhibited more pronounced RSV-induced changes in immune cell populations in both the lungs and GALT, while female mice displayed greater resilience. Importantly, early-life RSV infection was associated with the chronic downregulation of CD69-expressing T lymphocytes, particularly T regulatory cells in Peyer’s patches, which could have a significant impact on T cell functionality and immune tolerance. We propose that RSV infection in early life is a trigger for the breakdown in immune tolerance at mucosal surfaces, with potential implications for airways allergic disease, food allergies, and other GI inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Gliomas are diverse types of tumors originating from glial cells. Among these tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form and has a poor prognosis and high mortality rate, with treatment success largely influenced by patient age, tumor location, and genetic mutations. Glioma cells can reprogram their tumor microenvironment (TME) to support tumor proliferation and survival, interacting with other cells through cytokines and growth factors. The TME of gliomas is highly heterogeneous, complex, and often immunosuppressive, interfering with treatment strategies. Current therapeutic strategies focus on modulating immune cell activities and enhancing anti-tumor responses. T-cell-based immunotherapies are being explored to target glioma cells. These include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy, which involve engineering T cells to recognize tumor antigens. However, these therapies face multiple challenges including tumor heterogeneity, immunosuppression by T cell exhaustion, and altered antigen presentation, etc. Future research should focus on boosting T cell functions, targeting immune checkpoints, and developing more effective delivery methods to improve treatment outcomes for glioma patients. Abstract Glioma is known for its immunosuppressive microenvironment, which makes it challenging to target through immunotherapies. Immune cells like macrophages, microglia, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and T lymphocytes are known to infiltrate the glioma tumor microenvironment and regulate immune response distinctively. Among the variety of immune cells, T lymphocytes have highly complex and multifaceted roles in the glioma immune landscape. T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, are known for their pivotal roles in anti-tumor responses. However, these cells may behave differently in the highly dynamic glioma microenvironment, for example, via an immune invasion mechanism enforced by tumor cells. Therefore, T lymphocytes play dual roles in glioma immunity, firstly by their anti-tumor responses, and secondly by exploiting gliomas to promote immune invasion. As an immunosuppression strategy, glioma induces T-cell exhaustion and suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells (Tregs) or by altering their signaling pathways. Further, the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors on the glioma cell surface leads to T cell anergy and dysfunction. Overall, this dynamic interplay between T lymphocytes and glioma is crucial for designing more effective immunotherapies. The current review provides detailed knowledge on the roles of T lymphocytes in the glioma immune microenvironment and helps to explore novel therapeutic approaches to reinvigorate T lymphocytes.">

        <tr id="The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been identified as an epithelial cell receptor for Mucorales fungi and Candida albicans. Blocking EGFR with small molecule inhibitors reduces disease severity in mouse models of mucormycosis and oropharyngeal candidiasis. In contrast, cases of invasive aspergillosis have been reported in cancer patients who were treated with EGFR inhibitors, suggesting that EGFR signaling may play a protective role in the host defense against this infection. Here, we analyzed transcriptomic data from the lungs of mice with invasive aspergillosis and found evidence that Aspergillus fumigatus infection activates multiple genes that are predicted to function in the EGFR signaling pathway. We also found that A. fumigatus infection activates EGFR in both a human small airway epithelial (HSAE) cell line and in the lungs of immunosuppressed mice. EGFR signaling in HSAE cells is required for maximal endocytosis of A. fumigatus and for fungal-induced proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. In a corticosteroid immunosuppressed mouse model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, inhibition of EGFR with gefitinib decreased whole lung chemokine levels and reduced accumulation of phagocytes in the lung, leading to a decrease in fungal killing, an increase in pulmonary fungal burden, and accelerated mortality. Thus, EGFR signaling is required for pulmonary epithelial cells to orchestrate the host innate immune defense against invasive aspergillosis in immunosuppressed hosts. Importance When A. fumigatus infects the lungs, it invades epithelial cells that line the airways. During this process, the fungus interacts with epithelial cell receptors. This interaction stimulates epithelial cells to endocytose the fungus. It also induces these cells to secret proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit phagocytes to the site of infection where they can kill the fungus. Here, we show that in small airway epithelial cells, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) acts a sensor for A. fumigatus that triggers the production of chemokines in response to fungal infection. In corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mice, blocking EGFR with the kinase inhibitor, gefitinib reduces chemokine production in the lungs. This leads to decreased accumulation of neutrophils and dendritic cell in the lungs, reduced A. fumigatus killing, and increased mortality. These results provide a potential explanation as to why some cancer patients who are treated with EGFR inhibitors develop invasive aspergillosis.">

        <tr id="Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a tiny structure that contains multiple immune cell components around tumor cells, which plays an important role in tumorigenesis, and is also the potential core area of activated immunotherapy. How immune cells with tumor-killing capacity in TIME are hijacked by tumor cells during the progression of tumorigenesis and transformed into subpopulations that facilitate cancer advancement is a question that needs to be urgently addressed nowadays. γδ T cells (their T cell receptors are composed of γ and δ chains), a unique T cell subpopulation distinguished from conventional αβ T cells, are involved in a variety of immune response processes through direct tumor-killing effects and/or indirectly influencing the activity of other immune cells. However, the presence of γδ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in some tumors, suggesting that certain γδ T cell subsets may also have pro-tumorigenic effects. Recent studies have revealed that metabolic pathways such as activation of glycolysis, increase of lipid metabolism, enhancement of mitochondrial biosynthesis, alterations of fatty acid metabolism reshape the local TME, and immune cells trigger metabolic adaptation through metabolic reprogramming to meet their own needs and play the role of anti-tumor or immunosuppression. Combining previous studies and our bioinformatics results, we hypothesize that γδT cells compete for resources with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by means of fatty acid metabolic regulation in the TME, which results in the weakening or loss of their ability to recognize and kill HCC cells through genetic and epigenetic alterations, thus allowing γδT cells to be hijacked by HCC cells as a subpopulation that promotes HCC progression.">

Engagement of PD-L1 with PD-1 expressed on CD8+ T cells activates downstream signaling pathways that culminate in T cell exhaustion and/or apoptosis. Physiologically, these immunosuppressive effects exist to prevent autoimmunity, but cancer cells exploit this pathway by overexpressing PD-L1 to facilitate immune escape. Intravenously (IV) administered immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that block the interaction between PD-1/PD-L1 have achieved great success in reversing T cell exhaustion and promoting tumor regression in various malignancies. However, these ICIs can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to off-tumor toxicities which limits their therapeutic potential. Therefore, considerable effort has been channeled into exploring alternative delivery strategies that enhance tumor-directed delivery of PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs and reduce irAEs. Here, we briefly describe PD-1/PD-L1-targeted cancer immunotherapy and associated irAEs. We then provide a detailed review of alternative delivery approaches, including locoregional (LDD)-, oncolytic virus (OV)-, nanoparticle (NP)-, and ultrasound and microbubble (USMB)-mediated delivery that are currently under investigation for enhancing tumor-specific delivery to minimize toxic off-tumor effects. We conclude with a commentary on key challenges associated with these delivery methods and potential strategies to mitigate them.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, triggers a complex immune response, with T regulatory cells (Tregs) playing a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation. The current study investigates the function of T regulatory cells during COVID-19 infection and the subsequent recovery period, emphasizing their impact on immune regulation and inflammation control. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of Treg subpopulations in peripheral blood samples from COVID-19 patients at different stages: acute infection, early convalescence, and long-term recovery. Flow cytometry was employed to quantify Tregs including “naïve”, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector cells (TEMRA). Additionally, the functional state of the Tregs was assessed by the expression of purinergic signaling molecules (CD39, CD73). Cytokine profiles were assessed through multiplex analysis. Our findings indicate a significant decrease in the number of Tregs during the acute phase of COVID-19, which correlates with heightened inflammatory markers and increased disease severity. Specifically, we found a decrease in the relative numbers of “naïve” and an increase in EM Tregs, as well as a decrease in the absolute numbers of “naïve” and CM Tregs. During the early convalescent period, the absolute counts of all Treg populations tended to increase, accompanied by a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Despite this, one year after recovery, the decreased subpopulations of regulatory T cells had not yet reached the levels observed in healthy donors. Finally, we observed the re-establishment of CD39 expression in all Treg subsets; however, there was no change in CD73 expression among Tregs. Understanding these immunological changes across different T regulatory subsets and adenosine signaling pathways offers important insights into the disease’s pathogenesis and provides a broader view of immune system dynamics during recovery.">

NK cells suppressed thymus recovery by aberrantly targeting thymic epithelial cells (TECs), which act as the master regulators of organ function and regeneration. Together these studies reveal a novel pathway regulating tissue regeneration in the thymus and offer IL-18 as a potential therapeutic target to boost thymic function.

This approach revealed two distinct therapeutic responses: “Responders” with tumor regression and “Non-Responders” with tumor progression. In-depth analysis of individual brains from both groups uncovered dynamic interactions between the OV and the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the involvement of Iba-1+ microglia and tumor necrosis in hindering OV distribution within the tumor. To address this, we incorporated a CSF-1 receptor inhibitor (PLX3397), which improved tumor control by enhancing OV’s direct cytopathic effects and reducing microglial interference.

        <tr id="Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality. Editor’s summary During embryonic development, macrophages interact with blood stem cells, removing those exhibiting high levels of cellular stress. The surviving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can proliferate and give rise to blood cell linages in adults. Pessoa Rodrigues et al. used zebrafish models and mammalian systems to investigate signals within HSPCs that could prevent macrophages from engulfing them. Molecules associated with innate immune nucleic acid sensing promoted the expression of Beta-2-microglobulin on the surface of HSPCs to increase their survival when they interacted with macrophages. Impairing this pathway decreased the number of distinct stem cell clones in adult zebrafish. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) produce mature blood cells throughout life. During this process, HSPCs engage in interactions with the variety of cells present in the marrow niche, including macrophages. These macrophages mediate a myriad of processes by releasing cytokines and chemokines and patrolling to remove stressed, dead, or aging cells. In this manner, macrophages contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During hematopoiesis, macrophages ensure the quality of normal blood stem cells and determine the number of hematopoietic clones that participate in adult hematopoiesis. They then either engulf a stem cell completely, referred to as “dooming,” or capture portions of the stem cell’s cellular material, referred to as “grooming.” After grooming, the stem cell continues to divide, whereas the doomed HSPC clone is eliminated. RATIONALE Past work has shown that the HSPC-macrophage interaction is mediated by an “eat-me” signal, calreticulin (Calr), on the surface of HSPCs. Surface Calr levels are increased in stem cells with higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this triggers macrophages to engulf and kill stem cells that have high amounts of stress-activated proteins. However, the specific molecular cues that regulate the dooming versus grooming behavior are still unknown. RESULTS To investigate the cues mediating grooming versus dooming, we screened a panel of 1200 bioactive small molecules in human cells and identified 93 compounds that robustly increased surface CALR in a dose-dependent manner. Of these compounds, 22 also facilitated interactions between macrophages and stem cells in zebrafish. Compounds that depended on ROS to increase CALR showed higher dooming ratios and, conversely, animals treated with ROS-independent compounds exhibited a higher probability of grooming events despite increased CALR and increased macrophage–stem cell interactions. To investigate the signals involved in interactions under ROS-independent conditions, we undertook a genome-wide screen in human cells. We identified Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as a CALR inducer in the “don’t eat me” context. Next, we found that TLR3 expression was required for the expression of the “don’t eat me” signal Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). Antibody staining and studies of a b2m knockout zebrafish line showed that b2m on stem cells was required for preventing the macrophage dooming. To determine whether the increased dooming observed in the b2m mutant affected clonal dominance, we generated mosaic deletions using the zebrabow color barcoding system (TWISTR) as a lineage tracer. Mosaic deletion of b2m reduced the number of myeloid clones but increased clonal dominance. The dominant clones in these fish were wild type for b2m that were resistant to dooming and overtook the adult marrow. TLR3 signaling is activated by double-stranded RNA, which can sometimes be found in cells due to the expression of transcripts associated with repetitive elements (REs), including long terminal repeats (LTRs) and endogenous retroviruses. RE expression in HSPCs positively correlated with elevated levels of B2m. Moreover, overexpressing ltr4 in zebrafish led to higher HSPC proliferation, indicative of decreased dooming. Impairing the TLR3-B2M pathway by disrupting the expression of TLR3, IRF3, or B2M expression decreased the number of blood cell clones in zebrafish. Using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor CM272 to promote up-regulation of REs amplified the proliferation of already established HSPC clones in zebrafish embryos. CONCLUSION Our findings support a model in which endogenous TLR3 ligands lead to expression of b2m, thereby providing a blockade against macrophage-induced dooming and determining hematopoietic stem cell clonality by monitoring stem cell quality with macrophages. The balance of Calr and B2m governs the number of long-lived HSC clones that contribute to the adult blood system through macrophage-mediated quality assurance. This sheds light on the intricate interplay between HSPC clonal expansion and immune-regulated cell clearance. We propose that this protective mechanism may also operate in adulthood in response to environmental stress, such as during infections or in clonal stem cell disorders. Manipulating the levels of “don’t eat-me” and “eat-me” signals may have important therapeutic implications for immune therapy by harnessing the macrophage-selective removal of a mutated stem cell clone. ROS and TLR3 signaling mediates the “eat-me” and “don’t eat me” signals that determine stem cell clonal selection by macrophages. Shown is a schematic overview of the proposed model showing the balance between the Calr-mediated “eat-me” and B2m-mediated “don’t eat-me” signals that influence macrophage behavior.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive, poorly immunogenic cancer and non-responsive to all currently available treatments, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. As survival rates remain low (13%), there is an urgent need for new therapeutic options. A hallmark of PDAC is the limited infiltration of anti-tumor cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data of PDAC tumors from treatment naïve patients reveals high expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. PSGL-1 is an intrinsic negative regulator of CD8+ T cells that promotes the development of functional exhaustion. We therefore hypothesized that PSGL-1-mediated immune suppression is a critical barrier to effective anti-tumor immunity in PDAC. To test this, we used preclinical models of orthotopic injection PDAC tumor cells into pancreata, recapitulating patient responses to PDAC with limited T cell infiltrates and uncontrolled tumor growth in C57BL/6 (wildtype) control mice and compared anti-tumor immune responses in PSGL-1KO (C57BL/6 background) mice. At 28 days post-injection of KPC.4662 PDAC tumor cells, tumor burden in PSGL-1KO mice was reduced by >50% compared to controls, with 45% of PSGL-1KO animals exhibiting >70% reduction. Total immune infiltration (CD45+) was 2-fold greater in tumors from PSGL-1KO mice, with significant increases in infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Detailed analyses revealed that infiltrating CD8+ T cells from PSGL-1KO mice were less terminally differentiated towards exhaustion. PSGL-1KO PD-1+ CD8+ T cells expressed less TOX expression and fewer cells co-expressed CD38 and CD101 while more expressed CX3CR1 compared to controls. Intratumoral PSGL-1KO CD8+ T cells also retained greater functionality as well as indicated by inflammatory cytokine production (IFNg, TNFa) and Granzyme B expression. Moreover, PSGL-1KO mice showed protection against metastatic disease to the lungs. We find that protection by PSGL-1KO mice is T cell dependent as transient depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells prior to tumor cell implantation results in the loss of PDAC tumor growth inhibition by PSGL-1KO mice. Less-differentiated, proliferation-competent precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX) are essential to PD-1 ICB responsiveness in patients and preclinical models. Given that PSGL-1-deficiency limits terminal differentiation of CD8+ T cells in PDAC, we hypothesized that PSGL-1-deficiency would promote responsiveness to PD-1 ICB, which is ineffective as a monotherapy in PDAC patients and mouse models. While therapeutic treatment with anti-PD-1 had no effect on the tumor growth in the control animals, PD-1 ICB resulted in tumor ablation in 85% of PSGL-1KO animals, demonstrating a profound synergistic effect of PD-1 inhibition in the absence of PSGL-1. From these studies, we conclude that PSGL- 1 is a critical inhibitor anti-tumor T cell immunity in PDAC and represents a novel ICB target with high translational potential for promoting immune responses to PDAC tumors.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a malignancy with significant immunosuppressive properties and limited immune activation. This immunosuppression is linked to reduced cytotoxic T-cell activity, impaired antigen presentation, and elevated levels of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules. Studies demonstrate that cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration correlates with improved survival, while increased regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are associated with worse outcomes and therapeutic resistance. Th1 cells are beneficial, whereas Th17 cells, producing interleukin-17 (IL-17), contribute to tumor progression. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1/PD-L1 and TIM-3 are also linked to advanced stages of PCa. Chemotherapy holds promise in converting the "cold" tumor microenvironment (TME) to a "hot" one by depleting immunosuppressive cells and enhancing tumor immunogenicity.


SUMMARY
This comprehensive review examines the immune microenvironment in PCa, focusing on the intricate interactions between immune and tumor cells in the TME. It highlights how TAMs, Tregs, cytotoxic T cells, and other immune cell types contribute to tumor progression or suppression and how PCa's low immunogenicity complicates immunotherapy.


KEY MESSAGES
The infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and Th1 cells correlates with better outcomes, while elevated Tregs and TAMs promote tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance. TANs and NK cells exhibit dual roles, with higher NK cell levels linked to better prognoses. Immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1, PD-L1, and TIM-3 are associated with advanced disease. Chemotherapy can improve tumor immunogenicity by depleting Tregs and MDSCs, offering therapeutic promise.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the leading causes of respiratory infections. The lack of efficient anti-influenza therapeutics requires a better understanding of how IAV interacts with host cells. Alveolar macrophages are tissue-specific macrophages that play a critical role in lung innate immunity and homeostasis, yet their role during influenza infection remains unclear. First, our review highlights an active IAV replication within alveolar macrophages, despite an abortive viral cycle. Such infection leads to persistent alveolar macrophage inflammation and diminished phagocytic function, alongside direct mitochondrial damage and indirect metabolic shifts in the alveolar micro-environment. We also discuss the “macrophage disappearance reaction”, which is a drastic reduction of the alveolar macrophage population observed after influenza infection in mice but debated in humans, with unclear underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we explore the dual nature of alveolar macrophage responses to IAV infection, questioning whether they are deleterious or protective for the host. While IAV may exploit immuno-evasion strategies and induce alveolar macrophage alteration or depletion, this could potentially reduce excessive inflammation and allow for the replacement of more effective cells. Despite these insights, the pathophysiological role of alveolar macrophages during IAV infection in humans remains understudied, urging further exploration to unravel their precise contributions to disease progression and resolution.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a pro-cancerous niche harboring immunosuppressive factors that are secreted by cancer cells and the surrounding cancer-supportive tissue, such as kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell-mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co-culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium-throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGFβ type I receptor (TGFβR-1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGFβR-1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGFβR-1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.">

        <tr id="Antigen-specific humoral responses are orchestrated through complex interactions among immune cells in lymphoid tissues, including the collaboration between B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Accumulating evidence indicates a crucial role for interleukin-9 (IL-9) in the formation of germinal centers (GCs), enhancing the generation of class-switched high-affinity antibodies. However, the exact function of IL-9 in Tfh cell regulation remains unclear. In this study, we examined the humoral immune responses of CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice, which lack an IL-9-specific receptor in Tfh cells. Upon intraperitoneal immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice displayed diminished levels of SRBC-specific IgG antibodies in their sera, along with reduced levels of GC B cells and plasma cells. Notably, Il9ra-deficient Tfh cells in the spleen exhibited decreased expression of their signature molecules such as B-cell lymphoma 6, C-X-C chemokine receptor 5, IL-4, and IL-21 compared to control mice. In models of allergic asthma induced by house dust mite (HDM) inhalation, CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice failed to elevate serum levels of HDM-specific IgE and IgG. This was accompanied by reductions in Tfh cells, GC B cells, and plasma cells in mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were identified as producers of IL-9 under immunizing conditions, possibly induced by leukotrienes released by activated IgD+ B cells around the T-B border. These observations may indicate the critical role of IL-9 receptor signaling in the activation of Tfh cells, with ILC2s potentially capable of supplying IL-9 in organized lymphoid tissues.">

They have recently emerged as targets for restoring an effective antitumor response and limiting tumor growth. In the present study, we investigated the potential of IL-27 neutralization to modify macrophage polarization and thus the tumor immune microenvironment. We monitored the effect of IL-27 neutralization on human macrophages and in vivo in a murine colon adenocarcinoma model. In this study, we demonstrated the importance of IL-27 in the generation of human immunoregulatory macrophages. Mechanistically, IL-27 neutralization reduced the immunosuppressive properties of macrophages. These modifications led to a reduction in the ability of macrophages to inhibit the function of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of IL-27 reduced MC38 tumor growth. Collectively, we uncovered the role of IL-27 in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. IL-27 neutralization thus appears as a promising strategy to target macrophages in immunosuppressive TME and improve the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy protocols.">

 Glioblastoma (GBM) has a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), largely mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we utilized a retroviral replicating vector (RRV) to deliver Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8), a master regulator of type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) development, in a syngeneic murine GBM model. We hypothesized that RRV-mediated delivery of IRF8 could “reprogram” intratumoral MDSCs into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby restore anti-tumor T-cell responses.



 Effects of RRV-IRF8 on survival and tumor growth kinetics were examined in the SB28 murine GBM model. Immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression assays. We assayed functional immunosuppression and antigen presentation by ex vivo T-cell-myeloid co-culture.



 Mice with RRV-IRF8 pre-transduced intracerebral tumors had significantly longer survival and slower tumor growth compared to controls. RRV-IRF8 treated tumors exhibited significant enrichment of cDC1s and CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, myeloid cells derived from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed decreased expression of the immunosuppressive markers Arg1 and IDO1 and demonstrated reduced suppression of naïve T-cell proliferation in ex vivo co-culture, compared to controls. Further, intra-tumoral and cervical lymph node DCs from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed increased antigen presentation compared to those from control tumors. To assess mechanism of action, mice were treated azidothymidine (AZT), a viral replication inhibitor. Untreated mice maintained a superior survival benefit, which demonstrated that viral replication through proliferating cells is necessary for tumor control. This showed that IRF8 transduction in both tumor and non-tumor cells is necessary for survival benefit, associated with a reprogrammed, cDC1- and CD8 T-cell-enriched TIME. Moreover, subset of mice with RRV-IRF8 treated tumors achieved complete tumor clearance and further rejected subcutaneous GBM tumors, indicating the presence of immunological memory.



 Our results indicate that reprogramming of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells by in vivo expression of IRF8 may reduce immunosuppression and enhance antigen presentation in situ, achieving improved tumor control and conferring a significant survival benefit.

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are immunocompromised and highly vulnerable to serious recurrent infections. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are principal sensors of infection and are essential in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses to resolve infection. This study identified significant deficiencies in six functionally distinct DC subsets in blood of untreated CLL (UT-CLL) patients and selective normalization of pDCs in response to acalabrutinib (a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. DCs are continuously replenished from hematopoiesis in bone marrow (BM). Four BM developmental intermediates that give rise to cDCs and pDCs were examined and significant reductions of these were identified in UT-CLL patients supporting a precursor/progeny relationship. The deficiencies in blood DCs and BM DC progenitors were significantly associated with alterations in the Flt3/FL signaling pathway critical to DC development and function. Regarding clinical parameter, cDC subset deficiencies are associated with adverse prognostic indicators of disease progression, including IGHV mutation, CD49d, CD38, and ZAP-70 status. Importantly, UT-CLL patients with shared DC subset deficiencies had shorter time-to-first treatment (TTFT), uncovering a profound alteration in innate immunity with the potential to instruct therapeutic decision-making.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The tumor microenvironment (TME) refers to the area immediately surrounding a cancerous tumor that influences the tumor’s behavior and how the immune system reacts to it. Central to the TME environment are special immune cells—tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)—that, rather than restrict the tumor, actually facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, targeting these TAMs can help to eliminate cancer. In this article, we review the biology of TAMs and delve into the signaling mechanisms underlying the polarization of macrophage phenotypes, their plasticity, and therapeutic implications. Abstract Within the tumor microenvironment, myeloid cells constitute a dynamic immune population characterized by a heterogeneous phenotype and diverse functional activities. In this review, we consider recent literature shedding light on the increasingly complex biology of M2-like immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), including their contribution to tumor cell invasion and metastasis, stromal remodeling (fibrosis and matrix degradation), and immune suppressive functions, in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review also delves into the intricate signaling mechanisms underlying the polarization of diverse macrophage phenotypes, and their plasticity. We also review the development of promising therapeutic approaches to target these populations in cancers. The expanding knowledge of distinct subsets of immunosuppressive TAMs, and their contributions to tumorigenesis and metastasis, has sparked significant interest among researchers regarding the therapeutic potential of TAM depletion or phenotypic modulation.">

 Background: Immunotherapy has promising anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the objective response rate of PD-L1 blockade is limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore resistance mechanisms in immunotherapy. Methods and Results: We used the anti-PD-L1 resistant trp53KO/c-mycOE mice to explore tumor immune microenvironment. Fresh isolated single cells were analysed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq), TCR sequencing and Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight (CyTOF). Gene expression of the tumors samples was tested by bulk RNA sequencing. In vivo efficacy studies were executed in trp53KO/c-mycOE mice induced by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. The function of immune cells was evaluated by multiple flow cytometry. Results: We found although anti-PD-L1 treatment significantly improved T cells infiltration and TCR clonal expansion. These T cells exhibited highly exhausted status with highly exhausted markers (CD39, LAG3, PD-1) expression. Targeting the exhausted markers by specific antibodies cannot unleash the function of T cells, which suggested the persistent immunosuppressive microenvironment existed. Bulk RNA sequencing showed significantly activation of IFNG related pathway. scRNA seq exhibited increased monocytes ratio and the IFNG score prominently upregulated in monocytes after anti- PD-L1 treatment. Subclusters analysis showed that CCL24+ monocytes were increased remarkably after treatment. CCL24+ monocytes showed significant response to IFNG and these cells also significantly expressed IL10, VEGFA, ARG1 etc. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated anti-PD-L1 blockade induced IFNG related pathways and increased the CCL24+ monocytes infiltration. These cells maybe the potential targets mediating the resistant mechanisms for immunotherapy. Further exploration could facilitate the development of new combination therapies that synergistically enhance treatment efficacy for patients with HCC.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a critical role in resistance to immunotherapy. In this study, we identified epidermal growth factor-like 6 (Egfl6) as a regulator of myeloid cell functions. Our analyses indicated that Egfl6, via binding with β3 integrins and activation of p38 and SYK signaling, acts as a chemotactic factor for myeloid cell migration and promotes their differentiation toward an immunosuppressive state. In syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer (OvCa), tumor expression of Egfl6 increased the intratumoral accumulation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) MDSCs and TAMs and their expression of immunosuppressive factors, including CXCL2, IL-10, and PD-L1. Consistent with this, in an immune ‘hot’ tumor model, Egfl6 expression eliminated response to anti-PD-L1 therapy, while Egfl6 neutralizing antibody decreased the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD206+ TAMs and PMN-MDSCs and restored the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. Supporting a role in human tumors, in human OvCa tissue samples, areas of high EGFL6 expression colocalized with myeloid cell infiltration. scRNA-Seq analyses revealed a correlation between EGFL6 and immune cell expression of immunosuppressive factors. Our data provide mechanistic insights into the oncoimmunologic functions of EGFL6 in mediating tumor immune suppression and identified EGFL6 as a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy in patients with OvCa.">

Defining the functional microglial sensome is critical to understand their function and cell state determination. Using intravital two-photon microscopy we show that microglia lacking the CD300f receptor fail to detect environmental damage cues after a laser ablation injury. After a mild traumatic brain injury or after the intracortical injection of apoptotic cells, CD300f-/- microglia showed reduced capacity for detecting and phagocytosing dyeing cells, leading to the accumulation of dead cells in the neural parenchyma. Moreover, at later timepoints, increased accumulation of dyeing cells was found inside CD300f-/- microglia in vivo and in bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro, suggesting that these cells display a reduced capacity for metabolizing phagocytosed cells. Finally, CD300f deficiency increased functional compromise after a contusive traumatic brain injury, associated to increased conservation of brain tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that CD300f function as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) receptor that coordinates microglial process reaction towards tissue debris and highlights its central role in microglial sensome machinery and in the modulation of in vivo microglial efferocytosis.">

EVs have been characterized in patients with solid and hematological tumors, where they play an important role in tumor progression and metastasis. EVs may express different surface proteins derived from the parental cells, including immunomodulatory molecules, such as HLA-G and PDL1.We isolated EV from bone marrow (BM) samples of patients with Neuroblastoma (NB) and healthy controls and we analyzed the expression of CD56, GD2 and immune checkpoints on EV by flow cytometry. Next, we analyzed the function of T cells in vitro in the presence or absence of NB patients' BM-derived EV, in terms of proliferation and cytokine production. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the expression of immune checkpoints on EV and the clinical outcome of patients.We found a higher expression of CD56 on EVs derived from BM of patients with NB than in those from healthy donors (HD). However, CD56 expression was not dependent on BM infiltration of NB cells. Moreover, the analysis of GD2 expression revealed that only a small fraction of EVs was released by infiltrating NB cells, whereas the majority may derive from BM-resident cells. BM-derived EVs from NB patients display a higher expression of HLA-G and PD-L1 than those derived from HD. Nonetheless, such EVs are able to modulate T cell immune responses. We measured a robust response, in vitro, towards a common bacterial antigen, including the release of GM-CSF and proinflammatory cytokines, like IFN-a and IL-6, from mononuclear cells. Some of these immunomodulatory features are dependent on the expression of HLA-G and PD-L1, whereas others may rely on other mechanism(s). Finally, a high expression of CD56, HLA-G and PD-L1 on BM-derived EVs may represent a good prognostic factor.We described the presence of HLA-G and PDL1-bearing EVs in the BM of NB patients, which may represent a mechanism performed by resident BM cells to counteract the inflammation occurring in the BM microenvironment of NB patients.">

        <tr id="Cancer is a major global health concern, with immune suppression hindering treatment. Immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint blockage on T cells, has revolutionized cancer treatment. T-cell exhaustion is an abnormal activation state that develops when continuous exposure to antigens, like cancer. In this context, recent evidence suggests that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) plays a previously underappreciated role in fostering an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Further, blocking PTHrP activity reduces primary tumor growth, prevents metastasis, and prolongs survival in mice with various cancers. Here, we confirm that administration of anti-PTHrP monoclonal antibodies can reduce the growth of B16-PDL1 melanoma tumors and that although the therapy did not alter the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs, we noted that all stages of T-cell exhaustion were reduced. Further, the expression of cytolytic proteins PERFORIN and GZMB also increased. By contrast, anti-PTHrP therapy increased the relative presence of pre-pro B cells with a decline in mature B cells in the bone marrow. Overall, our data indicates that anti-PTHrP therapy acts by reducing T-cell exhaustion and by affecting B-cell development. These provide further mechanistic evidence to support the application of anti-PTHrP blockade as an alternate therapeutic approach to boost anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Alemtuzumab induction with belatacept/rapamycin-based maintenance immunotherapy (ABR) prevents kidney allograft rejection and specifically limits early costimulation blockade-resistant rejection (CoBRR). To evaluate the mechanisms by which this regimen alters CoBRR, we characterized the phenotype and functional response of preexisting memory cells to allogeneic endothelial cells using intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. IL-7-induced lymphocyte proliferation in the presence or absence of rapamycin was assessed to characterize the phenotype of proliferating cells. Lymphocytes from 40 recipients who underwent transplant using the ABR regimen were studied longitudinally. The rapid immunoresponses of preexisting alloreactive cells to allogeneic endothelial cells were predominantly CD8+TNF-α+/IFN-γ+ cells. These cells were effector memory (TEM) and terminally differentiated effector memory cells lacking CD28 expression, and most were CD57+PD1-. Neither rapamycin nor belatacept directly inhibited these cells. IL-7, a cytokine induced during lymphopenia postdepletion, provoked dramatic CD8+ TEM cell proliferation and a low level of CD8+CD57+PD1- cell expansion in vitro. The IL-7 stimulation induced CD8+ cell mTOR phosphorylation, and rapamycin treatment markedly inhibited IL-7-induced TEM and CD57+PD1- cell expansion. This effect was evident in patients receiving the ABR in that the repopulation of CD8+CD57+PD1- TEM cells was substantially suppressed for at least 36 mo after transplant. These findings help define one mechanism by which a costimulation blockade/rapamycin-based therapy following alemtuzumab induction minimizes CoBRR, namely that in the presence of rapamycin, costimulation-resistant alloreactive cells are disproportionately ineffective at repopulating following post-transplant T cell depletion.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are abundant and influential elements of the tumor microenvironment (TME), giving support to tumor development in multiple ways. Among other mechanisms, CAFs are important regulators of immunological processes occurring in tumors. However, CAF-mediated tumor immunomodulation in the context of radiotherapy remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore effects of radiation on CAF-derived immunoregulatory signals to the TME. Methods Primary CAF cultures were established from freshly collected human NSCLC lung tumors. CAFs were exposed to single-high or fractionated radiation regimens (1x18Gy or 3x6Gy), and the expression of different immunoregulatory cell-associated and secreted signaling molecules was analyzed 48h and 6 days after initiation of treatment. Analyses included quantitative measurements of released damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), interferon (IFN) type I responses, expression of immune regulatory receptors, and secretion of soluble cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. CAFs are able to survive ablative radiation regimens, however they enter into a stage of premature cell senescence. Results Our data show that CAFs avoid apoptosis and do not contribute by release of DAMPs or IFN-I secretion to radiation-mediated tumor immunoregulation. Furthermore, the secretion of relevant immunoregulatory cytokines and growth factors including TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IL-1β, VEGF, CXCL12, and CXCL10 remain comparable between non-irradiated and radiation-induced senescent CAFs. Importantly, radiation exposure modifies the cell surface expression of some key immunoregulatory receptors, including upregulation of CD73 and CD276. Discussion Our data suggest that CAFs do not participate in the release of danger signals or IFN-I secretion following radiotherapy. The immune phenotype of CAFs and radiation-induced senescent CAFs is similar, however, the observed elevation of some cell surface immunological receptors on irradiated CAFs could contribute to the establishment of an enhanced immunosuppressive TME after radiotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background: Breast cancer represents one of the leading causes of death among women. Surgery can be effective, but once breast cancer has metastasized, it becomes extremely difficult to treat. Conventional therapies are associated with substantial toxicity and poor efficacy due to tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance and disease relapse. Moreover, immune checkpoint blockade appears to offer limited benefit in breast cancer. The poor tumor immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment result in scarce T-cell infiltration, leading to a low response rate. Thus, there is considerable interest in the development of improved active immunotherapies capable of sensitizing a patient’s immune system against tumor cells. Methods: We evaluated the in vitro anti-tumor activity of a personalized vaccine based on dendritic cells generated in the presence of interferon (IFN)-α and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (IFN-DC) and loaded with an oxidized lysate from autologous tumor cells expanded as 3D organoid culture maintaining faithful tumor antigenic profiles. Results: Our findings demonstrate that stimulation of breast cancer patients’ lymphocytes with autologous IFN-DC led to efficient Th1-biased response and the generation in vitro of potent cytotoxic activity toward the patients’ own tumor cells. Conclusions: This approach can be potentially applied in association with checkpoint blockade and chemotherapy in the design of new combinatorial therapies for breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Introductions Identifying patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are optimal candidates for immunotherapy is a cornerstone in clinical decision-making. The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is intricately linked with both the prognosis of the malignancy and the efficacy of immunotherapeutic interventions. CD8+ T cells, and more specifically, tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells [CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells] are postulated to be pivotal in orchestrating the immune system's assault on tumor cells. Nevertheless, the accurate quantification of immune cell infiltration—and by extension, the prediction of immunotherapeutic efficacy—remains a significant scientific frontier. Methods In this study, we introduce a cutting-edge non-invasive radiomic model, grounded in TIME markers (CD3+ T, CD8+ T, and CD8+ TRM cells), to infer the levels of immune cell infiltration in NSCLC patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors and ultimately predict their response to immunotherapy. Data from patients who had surgical resections (cohort 1) were employed to construct a radiomic model capable of predicting the TIME. This model was then applied to forecast the TIME for patients under immunotherapy (cohort 2). Conclusively, the study delved into the association between the predicted TIME from the radiomic model and the immunotherapeutic outcomes of the patients. Result For the immune cell infiltration radiomic prediction models in cohort 1, the AUC values achieved 0.765, 0.763, and 0.675 in the test set of CD3+ T, CD8+ T, and CD8+ TRM, respectively. While the AUC values for the TIME-immunotherapy predictive value were 0.651, 0.763, and 0.829 in the CD3-immunotherapy response model, CD8-immunotherapy response model, and CD8+ TRM-immunotherapy response model in cohort 2, respectively. The CD8+ TRM-immunotherapy model exhibited the highest predictive value and was significantly better than the CD3-immunotherapy model in predicting the immunotherapy response. The progression-free survival (PFS) analysis based on the predicted levels of CD3+ T, CD8+ T, and CD8+ TRM immune cell infiltration showed that the CD8+ T cell infiltration level was an independent factor (P=0.014, HR=0.218) with an AUC value of 0.938. Discussion Our empirical evidence reveals that patients with substantial CD8+ T cell infiltration experience a markedly improved PFS compared with those with minimal infiltration, asserting the status of the CD8+ T cell as an independent prognosticator of PFS in the context of immunotherapy. Although CD8+ TRM cells demonstrated the greatest predictive accuracy for immunotherapy response, their predictive strength for PFS was marginally surpassed by that of CD8+ T cells. These insights advocate for the application of the proposed non-invasive radiomic model, which utilizes TIME analysis, as a reliable predictor for immunotherapy outcomes and PFS in NSCLC patients.">

        <tr id="T cell accumulation within the aorta promotes endothelial dysfunction and the genesis of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and atherosclerosis. Viral infection during pregnancy is also known to mediate marked acute endothelial dysfunction, but it is not clear whether T cells are recruited to the aorta and whether the dysfunction persists post-partum. Here, we demonstrate that influenza A virus (IAV) infection during pregnancy in a murine model resulted in endothelial dysfunction of the aorta, which persisted for up to 60 days post-infection and was associated with higher levels of IFN-g mRNA expression within the tissue. In the absence of infection, low numbers of naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, central memory T cells and effector memory T cells were observed in the aorta. However, with IAV infection these T cell subsets were significantly increased with a notable accumulation of IAV-specific CD8+ effector memory T cells. Critically, this increase was maintained out to at least 60 days. In contrast, IAV infection in non-pregnant female mice resulted in modest endothelial dysfunction with no accumulation of T cells within the aorta. These data therefore demonstrate that the aorta is a site of T cell recruitment and retention after IAV infection during pregnancy. Whilst IAV-specific memory T cells could theoretically confer protection against future influenza infection, non-specific memory T cell activation and IFN-g production in the aorta could also contribute to future endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has led to unprecedented success in treating relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The most common CAR-T cell products currently in the clinic for DLBCL differ in their co-stimulation moiety, containing either CD28 or 4-1BB, which initiate distinct signalling pathways. Previous work has highlighted the importance of T cell metabolism in fuelling anti-cancer function. We have studied the metabolic characteristics induced by CD28 versus 4-1BB co-stimulation in patient CAR-T cells ex vivo. Our data show that in patients, CD28 and 4-1BB drive significantly divergent metabolic profiles. CD28 signalling endows T cells with a preferentially glycolytic metabolism supporting an effector phenotype and increased expansion capacity, while 4-1BB co-stimulation preserves mitochondrial fitness and results in memory-like differentiation. Despite this divergent programming, T cells in patients responding successfully to therapy were metabolically similar, irrespective of co-stimulator, suggesting that efficient fuelling of CAR-T cells in lymphoma requires a ‘balanced’ metabolism. In contrast, CAR-T cells in non-responders were pushed to their metabolic extremes. One sentence summary CD28 and 4-1BB signalling drive divergent metabolic profiles in patient CAR-T cells, however patients that respond to therapy have CAR-T cells that maintain metabolic balance.">

With Type-I interferon (IFN) signalling being an important first line cellular defence mechanism against VZV infection by the peripheral tissues, we here investigated the triggering of innate immune responses in a human neural-like environment. For this, we established and characterised 5-month matured hiPSC-derived neurospheroids (NSPHs) containing neurons and astrocytes. Subsequently, NSPHs were infected with reporter strains of VZV (VZVeGFP-ORF23) or Sendai virus (SeVeGFP), with the latter serving as an immune-activating positive control. Live cell and immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated VZVeGFP-ORF23 infection throughout the NSPHs, while SeVeGFP infection was limited to the outer NSPH border. Next, NanoString digital transcriptomics revealed that SeVeGFP-infected NSPHs activated a clear Type-I IFN response, while this was not the case in VZVeGFP-ORF23-infected NSPHs. Moreover, the latter displayed a strong suppression of genes related to IFN signalling and antigen presentation, as further demonstrated by suppression of IL-6 and CXCL10 production, failure to upregulate Type-I IFN activated anti-viral proteins (Mx1, IFIT2 and ISG15), as well as reduced expression of CD74, a key-protein in the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway. Finally, even though VZVeGFP-ORF23-infection seems to be immunologically ignored in NSPHs, its presence does result in the formation of stress granules upon long-term infection, as well as disruption of cellular integrity within the infected NSPHs. Concluding, in this study we demonstrate that 5-month matured hiPSC-derived NSPHs display functional innate immune reactivity towards SeV infection, and have the capacity to recapitulate the strong immune evasive behaviour towards VZV.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous malignant hemopathy, and although new drugs have emerged recently, current treatment options still show limited efficacy. Therapy resistance remains a major concern due to its contribution to treatment failure, disease relapse, and increased mortality among patients. The underlying mechanisms of resistance to therapy are not fully understood, and it is crucial to address this challenge to improve therapy. Macrophages are immune cells found within the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME), of critical importance for leukemia development and progression. One defining feature of macrophages is their plasticity, which allows them to adapt to the variations in the microenvironment. While this adaptability is advantageous during wound healing, it can also be exploited in cancer scenarios. Thus, clinical and preclinical investigations that target macrophages as a therapeutic strategy appear promising. Existing research indicates that targeting macrophages could enhance the effectiveness of current AML treatments. This review addresses the importance of macrophages as therapeutic targets including relevant drugs investigated in clinical trials such as pexidartinib, magrolimab or bexmarilimab, but also provides new insights into lesser-known therapies, like macrophage receptor with a collagenous structure (MACRO) inhibitors and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists.">

        <tr id="Background. Kidney transplantation significantly improves the quality of life for those with end-stage renal failure, yet allograft rejection resulting from immune cell interactions remains a persistent challenge. Although T cell–directed immunosuppressive drugs effectively contain graft rejection in most patients, a notable proportion still experiences acute T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR). Despite an emphasis on suppressing T cell–mediated immune responses, successful control over TCMR is not always achieved, suggesting the potential involvement of factors beyond T cells. Methods. Biopsy samples from suspicious (borderline) for acute TCMR (borderline TCMR) and non-TCMR patients were obtained 9 d postsurgery, and spatial transcriptomics profiling was conducted using the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler platform. Regions of interest in the glomerulus and interstitium were selected on the basis of immunohistochemistry staining anti-CD3 to identify areas with T-lymphocyte infiltration. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using unpaired t tests. Results. Unbiased clustering of transcriptional profiles across all regions of interest showed distinct transcriptional profiles between glomeruli and interstitium in non-TCMR samples, whereas borderline TCMR samples displayed no distinct transcriptional profiles between these regions. Contrary to the prevailing T cell–centric view, we observed pathways and genes associated with innate immunity-related inflammatory conditions expressed in glomerular regions of borderline TCMR biopsies. Immunofluorescence staining for CD68 confirmed the presence of macrophages in the glomeruli of the post-TCMR sample in a validation cohort, indicating macrophage involvement in the glomerular response after TCMR. Conclusions. Activation of the innate immune response in borderline TCMR appears to impact not only the interstitium but also the glomerulus. Glomerulus-specific immune signatures suggest the role of the innate immune system in rejection. This nuanced understanding proposes the necessity for tailored therapeutic interventions targeting both innate and adaptive immune pathways to enhance transplant outcomes.">

        <tr id="Tumors often evolve to engage numerous strategies to circumvent detection by the immune system. Our group recently discovered elevated neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (nsGSL) surface levels as a possible immune evasion mechanism of tumors. We demonstrated a direct disruption of both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity in vitro when expression of nsGSLs was upregulated on established target cells. It remains unclear however, whether in vivo nsGSLs play an active role in tumor development and can aid tumors in evading immune responses. To investigate whether nsGSLs facilitate tumor progression in vivo, we first established a murine model system using MC38-OVA cell lines with varying cell surface levels of nsGSLs. In vitro analysis revealed reduced MHC-I accessibility on tumor cells with elevated nsGSLs profiles, leading to diminished activation of OVA-specific OT-I T cells as evidenced by decreased expression of CD25, CD69, and production of IFNγ, which subsequently resulted in decreased tumor cell death. Subsequent in vivo experiments investigating tumor outgrowth after engraftment of subcutaneously injected MC38-OVA cell lines with low or high cell surface levels of nsGSLs demonstrated better growth of nsGSL-rich tumor cells compared to nsGSL-poor tumors which could be controlled. Together these results suggest that nsGSLs expressed by tumors can facilitate immune evasion and subsequent tumor progression. These data pave the way to explore whether targeting of the GSL pathway with specific inhibitors could be advantageous as a therapy against tumors with high nsGSL levels.">

 The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is ground zero for the massive and sustained CD4 T cell depletion during acute HIV-1 infection. To date, the molecular mechanisms governing this fundamental pathogenic process remain unclear. HIV-1 infection in the GI tract is associated with chronic inflammation due to a disrupted epithelial barrier that results in microbial translocation. Here, we utilized the Lamina Propria Aggregate Culture model to demonstrate that the profound induction of Granzyme B (GZB) by bacteria in primary gut CD4 T cells ex vivo significantly contributes to HIV-1-mediated CD4 T cell death. Counterintuitively, a substantial fraction of gut GZB+ CD4 T cells harboring high levels of HIV-1 infection survive via a pathway linked to CD120b/TNFR2. Our findings underscore novel mechanisms governing the death and survival of gut CD4 T cells during HIV-1 infection that could inform strategies to counter HIV-1 pathogenesis and persistence in this critical tissue compartment.">

 OBJECTIVE: KRAS-driven inflammatory signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) promotes cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) polarization and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (iTME), driving therapeutic resistance. IL1α, a downstream product of KRAS signaling, activates the pro-inflammatory CAF (iCAF) phenotype and correlates with worse survival. Using patient and PDAC mouse model single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data, we have shown that the IL1 Receptor (IL1R1) is highly enriched in the fibroblast compartment. However, the role of IL1R1 in modulating iCAFs and the iTME remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that CAF-specific disruption of IL1R1 signaling will reprogram cellular components of the PDAC TME to overcome the immunosuppressive milieu and therapeutic resistance. METHODS: The effects of IL1R1 inhibition on iCAF modulation in vivo were determined in Ptf1aCre/+, LSL-KrasG12D/+, Tgfbr2flox/flox (PKT) mice treated with IL1R1 antagonist. To determine if CAF-specific silencing of IL1R1 recapitulates the TME remodeling after IL1R1 inhibition, we generated a fibroblast-specific IL1R1KO mouse model Col1a2Cre/+;Il1r1flox/flox (CAF-Il1r1KO) and orthotopically injected KPC tumor cells for endpoint analysis. Flow cytometry was performed in primary tumors of CAF-Il1r1KO and littermate controls. Functional experiments evaluating myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) trafficking were performed using ex vivo bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) co-cultured with CAF/tumor-conditioned media (CM) with/without IL1R1 inhibition in a transwell system. MDSC contribution to iTME was assessed by co-culturing MDSCs from CAF-Il1r1KO tumors and splenic T cells from naïve C57BL/6 mice. To investigate the effects of IL1R1 deletion in overcoming therapeutic resistance, survival studies in CAF-Il1r1KO mice with chemotherapy were conducted. RESULTS: Treatment of PKT mice with IL1R1 antagonist diminished transcriptional levels of Il6 and Cxcl1, iCAF-associated cytokines, in the CAF compartment. Compared to littermate controls, orthotopic tumors in CAF-Il1r1KO showed significant reduction in tumor weights, increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, and overall reduction in polymorphonuclear (PMN) MDSC trafficking by flow cytometry. Moreover, migration of BMDCs was reduced when co-cultured with CAF/tumor CM and IL1R1 antagonist. In addition, co-culture of MDSCs from CAF-Il1r1KO mice with naïve T cells showed diminished inhibition of T cell functional activity. Chemotherapy treatment of orthotopic tumors in CAF-Il1r1KO mice showed significantly decreased tumor size and improved survival compared to tumors in littermate controls. CONCLUSION: Our findings illustrate a novel mechanism of CAF-specific disruption of IL1R1 signaling inhibiting trafficking of immunosuppressive MDSCs and increased infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the PDAC TME. These data pave the way for novel combinatorial treatment strategies targeting IL1R1 to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance through reprogramming of the stromal compartment in PDAC.

 Background: Identification of effective immunomodulatory strategies remains a major unmet need in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (aCD40) exhibits direct cytotoxicity on tumor cells and augments antigen presentation. Subasumstat(SUB), a sumoylation inhibitor, augments innate and adaptive immune responses by increasing interferon signaling. We hypothesized that SUB+aCD40 combination would promote an effective antitumor immune response in an aggressive orthotopic model of PDAC. Methods: 2000 KPC 46 cells were implanted in the pancreas of four groups of F1 hybrid (initial survival, CD8+ T-cell depletion, and clodronate liposome depletion) and nude mice, enrolled when tumors had reached 3-5mm. The vehicle (veh) group received 80ul SUB vehicle (q48 hrs) and 100 ug blank IgG (qwk); SUB only group received 15mg/kg q48h; aCD40 only group received 100ug qwk; SUB+aCD40 group received 15mg/kg SUB q48h and 100 ug aCD40 qwk. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) was conducted on n=2 tumors from each group. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on veh and SUB+aCD40 tumors for macrophage infiltration using F4/80. Flow cytometry (FC) was employed for the presence of lymphoid and myeloid markers in veh, SUB+aCD40, and clodronate depleted SUB+aCD40 (SUB+aCD40+clod) groups. Results: Mice receiving SUB+aCD40 had a significantly improved median survival over those receiving monotherapy or vehicle (24.5d vs. SUB:15.5d, aCD40:20d, veh: 19d). scRNASeq revealed increased tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cell and myeloid populations when comparing veh and monotherapy to SUB+aCD40. F4/80 IHC confirmed increased macrophage infiltration in SUB+aCD40 vs veh (p = 0.01). The survival advantage conferred by SUB+aCD40 was preserved in both CD8+ T-cell depleted mice (p=0.025) and nude mice (p=0.037), while clodronate eliminated the treatment survival advantage (p=0.39). FC showed increased tumor macrophage/monocyte infiltration in SUB+aCD40 vs veh (veh:11.9%, SUB+aCD40:22.5%, p=0.03) and reduction in SUB+aCD40+clod (12.6%, p=0.01). CD8+ T-cell CD69 expression decreased in the SUB+aCD40+clod group (SUB+aCD40:19%, SUB+aCD40+clod:6%, p< 0.01). CD8 T-cell infiltration (SUB+aCD40:4.95%, SUB+aCD40+clod:3.85%, p=0.27) and CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio (veh: 1.26, SUB+aCD40:0.52, SUB+aCD40+clod:0.69, p=0.09) were not affected by clodronate. Conclusion: SUB+aCD40 therapy confers a survival advantage in the KPC46 model of PDAC in a T-cell independent manner by increasing macrophage/monocyte infiltration. SUB+aCD40 promotes CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activation, but they do not contribute to survival advantage, possibly due to exhaustion. Future work will include addition of therapeutics to mitigate/reverse T-cell exhaustion to harness both innate and adaptive immunity in treating PDAC.

        <tr id="The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a crucial role in modulating the proliferation, activation, and normal functioning of immune cells through the regulation of protein degradation and function. By influencing the expression of immune checkpoint-associated proteins, the UPS modulates T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and can potentially facilitate the immune escape of tumor cells. Additionally, the UPS contributes to the remodeling of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME) by regulating B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and Treg cells. Targeting the UPS in conjunction with immune checkpoint-associated proteins, and combining these with other therapeutic approaches, may significantly enhance the efficacy of combination therapies and pave the way for novel cancer treatment strategies. In this review, we first summarize the composition and alterations of the TIME, with a particular emphasis on the role of the UPS in TIME and its interactions with various immune cell types. Finally, we explore the potential of combining UPS-targeted therapies with immunotherapy to substantially improve the effectiveness of immunotherapy and enhance patient survival outcomes.">

        <tr id="T cell surveillance of tissues is spatially organized: circulating memory T cells perform surveillance of secondary lymphoid organs while tissue-resident memory T cells act as sentinels in barrier tissues. In the context of infection, tissue-resident memory T cells survive long term in barrier tissues and are poised to respond to re-encounter of infectious agents. The activity of such tissue-resident T cells is regulated by the PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitory receptors targeted by cancer immunotherapies. This review investigates the hypothesis that T cells with a tissue residency program play an important role in both protective anti-tumor immunity and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). A series of translational studies have demonstrated that a higher density of tissue-resident T cells within tumors is associated with favorable survival outcomes in a diverse range of cancer types. Tissue-resident T cells have also been implicated in clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade, and dynamic tracking of T cell populations in pre- and on-treatment tumor samples demonstrated that T cells with a tissue residency program responded early to ICB. Investigation of colitis and dermatitis as examples of irAEs demonstrated that tissue-resident memory T cells were reactivated at these epithelial sites, resulting in a highly cytotoxic state and secretion of inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNFα. It will therefore be important to consider how a tissue residency program can be enhanced to promote T cell-mediated tumor immunity while preventing the development of irAEs.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease with a strong chronic inflammatory component. One possible strategy for the treatment of T1D is to stimulate the regulatory arm of the immune response, i.e. to promote the function of tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC) and regulatory T cells (Treg). Since both cell types have been shown to be responsive to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation, we used a recently characterized member of a new class of fluorescent AHR ligands, AGT-5, to modulate streptozotocin-induced T1D in C57BL/6 mice. Prophylactic oral administration of AGT-5 reduced hyperglycemia and insulitis in these mice. Phenotypic and functional analysis of cells in the pancreatic infiltrates of AGT-5-treated mice (at the early phase of T1D) revealed a predominantly anti-inflammatory environment, as evidenced by the upregulation of tolDC and Treg frequency, while CD8+ cell, Th1 and Th17 cells were significantly reduced. Similarly, AGT-5 enhanced the proportion of Treg and tolDC in small intestine lamina propria and suppressed the activation status of antigen-presenting cells through down-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86. The expression levels of Cyp1a1, controlled by the AHR, were increased in CD4+, CD8+ and Treg, confirming the AHR-mediated effect of AGT-5 in these cells. Finally, AGT-5 stimulated the function of regulatory cells in the pancreatic islets and lamina propria by upregulating indoleamine 2,3-dioxigenase 1 (IDO1) in tolDC. These findings were supported by the abrogation of AGT-5-mediated in vitro effects on DC in the presence of IDO1 inhibitor. AGT-5 also increased the expression of CD39 or CD73 ATP-degrading ectoenzymes by Treg. The increase in Treg is further supported by the upregulated frequency of IL-2-producing type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in the lamina propria. Anti-inflammatory effects of AGT-5 were also validated on human tonsil cells, where in vitro exposure to AGT-5 increased the proportion of immunosuppressive dendritic cells and ILC3.

        <tr id="Dormant cancer stem cells (DCSCs) exhibit characteristics of chemotherapy resistance and immune escape, and they are a crucial source of tumor recurrence and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. We demonstrate that enriched Gzmk+ CD8+ T cells within the niche of esophageal DCSCs restrict the outgrowth of tumor mass. Nonetheless, DCSCs can escape immune elimination by enhancing PD-L1 signaling, thereby maintaining immune equilibrium. Quiescent fibroblast-derived quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) promotes the expression of PD-L1 and its own expression in DCSCs by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, high QSOX1 in the dormant tumor niche contributes to the exclusion of CD8+ T cells. Conversely, blocking QSOX1 with Ebselen in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy can effectively eradicate residual DCSCs by reducing PD-L1 expression and promoting CD8+ T cell infiltration. Clinically, high expression of QSOX1 predicts a poor response to anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with esophageal cancer. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism whereby QSOX1 promotes PD-L1 upregulation and T cell exclusion, facilitating the immune escape of DCSCs, and QSOX1 inhibition, combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, represents a promising therapeutic approach for eliminating DCSCs and preventing recurrence.">

While multiple infiltrated immune cells have been reported to mediate disease progress, knowledge of HPV-reactive T-cell subsets in papillomas remains elusive. Through single-cell RNA sequencing and RNA microarray, we found that CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ TRM) cells with strong interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production expanded, and were negatively correlated to the disease severity in the frequency of surgery. These IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells were readily activated and expanded in vitro by autologous dendritic cells loaded with HPV11 E7 peptide pool. Moreover, T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion was observed in JORRP papilloma tissues, indicating a biased TCR repertoire toward HPV-specific recognition. Finally, we identified and characterized HPV11 E7-specific candidate TCR clonotypes from IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells, suggesting their potential application in TCR-engineered T cells (TCR-T) therapy for HPV11-related diseases. Our findings provided insights into the specific local immune response to HPV6/11 infection and highlighted the importance of IFN-γ+ CD8+ TRM cells in anti-HPV6/11 T-cell immunity.IMPORTANCEThe persistent recurrence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 6/11 infection in papillomas underscores the failure of local immune responses in patients with juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP). Our previous study demonstrated that T cells constitute the predominant immune cell population in JORRP papilloma tissues. Understanding the T-cell-mediated immune responses within JORRP papilloma tissues is crucial for disease control. In the present study, we characterized CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ TRM) cells as the primary T-cell subset responsible for local anti-HPV6/11 immunity. Moreover, we identified two HPV11 E7-specific candidate T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes out of IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells. Overall, our findings provided insights into the local immune responses to HPV6/11 infection and offered information for developing more effective immunotherapeutic strategies against JORRP.">

        <tr id="Purpose Type I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) play a key role in priming anti-tumor cytotoxic T cells and inducing immune tolerance for self-antigens and tumor antigens. However, it remains unclear whether cDC1 has a protective or pathogenic role in multiple myeloma. We investigated a role of cDC1 in myeloma progression. Methods A myeloma mouse model was performed by intravenous transplantation of Vk*MYC myeloma cells into XCR1-Diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) knock-in or wild-type mice. Following injection with Diphtheria toxin (DT), monoclonal (M)-proteins and myeloma cells were analyzed by ELISA and flow cytometry. Results Here we show that inducible depletion of cDC1 after myeloma transplantation markedly suppressed the progression of myeloma in the bone marrow and extramedullary sites, such as the spleen. cDC1 appeared in the bone marrow and spleen of myeloma-transplanted mice, which highly expressed CD103 and lowly produced interleukin (IL)-12. Consequently, the frequencies of exhausted CD8 T cells and regulatory T cells significantly decreased in the bone marrow of cDC1-depleted mice. Conclusions cDC1 supports the progression of myeloma inducing exhausted CD8 T cells and regulatory T cells.">

        <tr id="Extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) shows a high rate of recurrence after chemoradiotherapy. Drug resistance can be mediated by the cargo of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Here, we show that high abundance of the transmembrane glycoprotein CD98hc in tumor cells and serum sEVs was associated with ENKTL progression and drug resistance. Mechanistically, PEGylated-asparaginase (PEG-asp) treatment, a common therapy against ENKTL, promoted the translocation of the transcription factor ATF4 to the nucleus, where it was stabilized by USP1 and subsequently increased CD98hc expression. CD98hc delivered in tumor cell–derived sEVs increased tumor cell proliferation and drug resistance in a cultured human NK lymphoma cell line, animal models, and samples from patients with refractory/relapse ENKTL. Moreover, inhibiting both USP1 and EV secretion synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity of PEG-asp. These data suggest that targeting CD98hc in the treatment of ENKTL may be beneficial in overcoming drug resistance. Targeting a vesicle-secreted glycoprotein may prevent drug resistance in a type of lymphoma. Editor’s summary Extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is treated with PEGylated asparaginase (PEG-asp), but drug resistance is common. Liao et al. found that limiting the trafficking of a glycoprotein could overcome drug resistance. Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (USP1) stabilized the transcription factor ATF4, which promoted CD98hc expression. Knocking out CD98hc in tumor cells and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) sensitized cells to PEG-asp treatment, whereas CD98hc-enriched sEVs suppressed the effects of PEG-asp in mice, suggesting that targeting CD98hc may be explored in the treatment of ENKTL. —Amy E.

A notable manifestation of immunosenescence is the diminished efficacy of adaptive immunity. The excessive senescence of immune cells, particularly T cells, leads to marked immune deficiency, consequently escalating the risk of infections, tumors, and age-associated disorders. Lymphocytes, especially T cells, are subject to both replicative and premature senescence. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase have multifaceted roles in regulating cellular behavior, possessing the ability to counteract both replicative and premature senescence in lymphocytes.

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a major health risk during pregnancy. Whilst vaccination and antiviral agents are widely employed and reduce IAV-induced symptoms, they are not sufficient to control IAV infections in pregnancy, especially during pandemics. Respiratory viruses like IAV, exploit immune alterations that occur during pregnancy, including the upregulation of immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs) like PDL1, PD1 and CTLA4. We hypothesize that blocking expression of PDL1 on innate immune cells will improve maternal immunity following IAV infection. We utilized murine models of IAV infection during pregnancy with and without treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), a-PDL1. Pregnant and non-pregnant mice were infected with mouse adapted IAV (A/PR/8) and assessed at 3 days post infection (3dpi). Lung cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. Lung mRNA expression of inflammatory and antiviral markers and histology was measured. Protein concentrations of inflammatory and antiviral markers, as well as viral titers was measured from lung bronchiolar lavage fluid (BALF). Lung function was also assessed. Following IAV infection, immune cells from pregnant mice had significant increases in the ICPs, PDL1, PD1 and CTLA4. a-PDL1 treatment effectively suppressed these ICPs and increased the activation marker, CD86. A-PDL1 treatment also reduced lung inflammatory cell infiltration and viral titres, increased antiviral responses, and improved lung function. Overall, IAV infection in pregnancy activates key inhibitory ICPs, leading to worsened disease outcomes. a-PDL1 treatment during IAV infection in pregnancy is an effective method to reduce ICP expression and improve overall immune cell responses.">

        <tr id="Background Dysregulated innate immune responses underlie multiple inflammatory diseases, but clinical translation of preclinical innate immunity research in mice is hampered by the difficulty of studying human inflammatory reactions in an in vivo context. We therefore sought to establish in vivo human inflammatory responses in NSG-QUAD mice that express four human myelopoiesis transgenes to improve engraftment of a human innate immune system. Methods We reconstituted NSG-QUAD mice with human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), after which we evaluated human myeloid cell development and subsequent human responses to systemic and local lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges. Results NSG-QUAD mice already displayed engraftment of human monocytes, dendritic cells and granulocytes in peripheral blood, spleen and liver at 6 weeks after HSPC reconstitution, in which both classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes were present. These huNSG-QUAD mice responded to intraperitoneal and intranasal LPS challenges with production of NF-κB-dependent human cytokines, a human type I interferon response, as well as inflammasome-mediated production of human IL-1β and IL-18. The latter were specifically abrogated by the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950, while LPS-induced human monocyte death was not altered. Besides providing proof-of-principle for small molecule testing of human inflammatory reactions in huNSG-QUAD mice, this observation suggests that LPS-induced in vivo release of human NLRP3 inflammasome-generated cytokines occurs in a cell death-independent manner. Conclusion HuNSG-QUAD mice are competent for the NF-κB, interferon and inflammasome effectors of human innate immunity, and can thus be utilized to investigate signaling mechanisms and pharmacological targeting of human inflammatory responses in an in vivo setting.">

This review delineates the pivotal role of scRNA-seq in elucidating the functions of innate immune cells within the context of ocular pathologies. Recent advancements in scRNA-seq have revealed that innate immune cells, both from the periphery and resident in the retina, are actively engaged in various stages of multiple eye diseases. Notably, resident microglia and infiltrating neutrophils exhibit swift responses during the initial phase of injury, while peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages exhibit transcriptomic profiles akin to those of activated microglia, suggesting their potential for long-term residence within the retina. The scRNA-seq analyses have underscored the cellular heterogeneity and gene expression alterations within innate immune cells, which, while sharing commonalities, exhibit disease-specific variations. These insights have not only broadened our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms in eye diseases but also paved the way for the identification of candidate targets for targeted therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="A key mediator of T cell impairment during respiratory virus infection is the inhibitory receptor PD-1. PD-1 is induced on T cells following antigen exposure, whereas proinflammatory cytokines upregulate the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Respiratory virus infection leads to upregulation of PD-L1 on airway epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and alveolar macrophages. However, the role of PD-L1 on different cell types in acute respiratory virus infections is not known. We sought to determine the role of PD-L1 on different cell types in CD8+ T cell impairment. We found that PD-L1-/- mice challenged with human metapneumovirus or influenza showed a similar level of CD8+ T cell impairment compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, virus clearance was delayed in PD-L1-/- mice compared to WT. CD8+ T cells from PD-L1-deficient mice expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors both at baseline and after respiratory virus infection. The antibody blockade of PD-L2 failed to restore function to the impaired cells. While reciprocal bone marrow chimeras between WT and PD-L1-/- mice did not restore CD8+ T cell function after the respiratory virus challenge, mice that received the PD-L1-/- bone marrow had higher inhibitory receptor expression on CD8+ cells. This discrepancy in the inhibitory receptor expression suggests that cells of the hematopoietic compartment contribute to T cell impairment on CD8+ T cells.IMPORTANCEThe phenomenon of pulmonary CD8+ T cell impairment with diminished antiviral function occurs during acute respiratory virus infection mediated by Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) signaling. Moreover, PD-1 blockade enhances T cell function to hasten viral clearance. The ligand PD-L1 is expressed in many cell types, but which cells drive lung T cell impairment is not known. We used genetic approaches to determine the contribution of PD-L1 on lung T cell impairment. We found that PD-L2 cannot compensate for the loss of PD-L1, and PD-L1-deficient mice exhibit increased expression of other inhibitory receptors. Bone marrow chimeras between PD-L1-deficient and wild-type mice indicated that hematopoietic PD-L1 expression is associated with inhibitory receptor upregulation and impairment.">

        <tr id="The onset of malaria causes the induction of various inflammatory markers in the host’s body, which in turn affect the body’s homeostasis and create several cerebral complications. Polarization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) from the classically activated M1 to alternatively activated M2 phenotype increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules. Treatment with recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) not only alters this MDSC’s polarization but also targets the glycolysis pathway of the metabolism in MDSCs, rendering them less immunosuppressive. Along with that, the Helper T-cells subset 17 (Th17)/T regulatory cells (Tregs) ratio is skewed towards Th17, which increases inflammation by producing more IL-17. However, treating with rIL-33 also helps to restore this ratio, which brings back homeostasis. During malaria infection, there is an upregulation of IL-12 production from dendritic cells along with a distorted myeloid dendritic cells (mDC)/plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) ratio towards mDCs promoting inflammation. Administering rIL-33 will also subvert this IL-12 production and increase the population of pDC in the host’s immune system during malaria infection, thus restoring mDC/pDC to homeostasis. Therefore, treatment with rIL-33 to reduce the pro-inflammatory signatures and maintenance of immune homeostasis along with the increase in survivability could be a potential therapeutic approach for cerebral malaria.">

        <tr id="Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease with a variable clinical course. The induction of a generalized state of immunosuppression, leading to susceptibility to infections and the failure of anti-tumor immune responses, is a key feature of the clinical course of CLL. In addition to B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in CLL, several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been reported to be constitutively active in leukemic B cells, resulting in promoted survival and resistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy. Several treatment options are available for CLL, including a watch-and-wait strategy, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapies such as adoptive cellular therapy (CAR T-Cell Therapy), stem cell transplantation (allogeneic transplantation), radiation therapy and surgery. The identification of Tumor-Associated Antigens (TAAs) is the bottleneck of tumor immunology and immunotherapy, serving as promising targets for precise diagnosis, monitoring, or therapeutic approaches. Numerous TAAs have been identified, and their application in immunotherapy holds promise for the treatment of CLL. Furthermore, extensive ongoing research aims to identify new cancer TAAs. In this review, our objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of CLL immunology and recent findings regarding advances in TAAs with therapeutic applications in CLL.">

 Immunotherapy has had very limited success in pancreatic cancer, due to its low mutational burden and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Our approach consists in redirecting pre- existing antiviral immunity against pancreatic tumors by delivering viral antigens using the tumor penetrating peptide iRGD .This peptide, targets the tumor vasculature through av integrins and neuropilin-1, delivering conjugated or co-administered cargo to tumors. Here we used mouse cytomegalovirus (CMV) as an infection model. CMV is a β-herpesvirus that induces a strong T-cell response in mice and humans, comprising >10% of all circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells mostly with effector-memory phenotype. Importantly, human CMV infects over 60% of the world’s population rendering it a suitable candidate for translation. Methods: Mice latently infected with CMV were orthotopically implanted with KPC pancreatic tumor cells and treated with systemic injections of vehicle or iRGD plus CMV class I and II binding peptides. Another cohort of age matched uninfected mice was used as a control. Tumor growth and mouse weight were monitored twice a week and CMV specific immune responses were measured in spleen, liver and tumor by flow cytometry, using tetramer staining and CMV specific peptide recall. Results: CMV infected mice receiving iRGD+CMV peptides responded to treatment as evidenced by delayed tumor growth associated with increased tumor necrosis and T cell infiltration. In addition, flow cytometry analysis of tumor, liver and spleen showed a significant increase in CMV specific T cells preferentially in the tumor. Surprisingly, these T cells preferentially infiltrated tumors regardless of the use of iRGD for tumor targeting of CMV peptides. Survival studies showed a marked increase in median survival, reaching 42 days in the infected and treated group, compared to 25 days in the vehicle treated one. The survival benefit was very similar in the presence or absence of iRGD. Combining this strategy with anti- PD1 and or anti-IL10R did not significantly improve the benefits of CMV therapy alone. On the other hand, combination with low dose gemcitabine (5mg/kg) significantly improved tumor growth delay and survival in the combination compared to either therapy alone. The median survival reached 49 days in the combination, compared to 39 for gemcitabine or CMV therapy alone and 32 for vehicle.Conclusions: We have recently performed single cell RNA sequencing in tumors from infected and CMV peptide or vehicle treated mice and will analyze the transcriptional profile and TCR sequence of the tumor infiltrating T cells. Preliminary analysis of this data shows a massive T cell infiltration and an increase in dendritic cells and macrophages in infected and treated mice. Taken together, this data shows we can deliver antigens to pancreatic tumors and elicit an anti-tumor immune response that results in delayed tumor growth and has a survival benefit. This is a mutation agnostic approach with high translational value, since more than 60% of the population has previous CMV immunity.

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have shown promising immunomodulatory capabilities for a variety of clinical conditions. However, the potential regulatory mechanisms of MSC-EVs in allergic rhinitis (AR) remain unexplored. The present study was designed to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of MSC-EVs in patients with AR. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from AR patients. The number of peripheral CD4+Foxp3+IL-17+, CD4+Foxp3+IL-17- and CD4+Foxp3-IL-17+ T cells in healthy controls and AR patients were evaluated using flow cytometry. Therapeutic effect of MSC-EVs was determined by detecting IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17 and IL-10 cytokines in supernatant by ELISA and flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated in PBMCs for IL-10, IL-17 and TGF-β on T cells after MSC-EVs treatment. Bioinformatic analysis of microRNA was performed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. CD4+Foxp3+IL-17+ T cells expression in PBMCs was higher in the AR group and the balance of Treg/Th17 was tilted towards Th17 cells. Supernatant from AR patients revealed that MSC-EVs treatment upregulated IL-10 and IFN-γ, and downregulated IL-4 and IL-17. EVs treatment effectively re-established Th1(CD4+IFN-γ+cells)/Th2(CD4+IL-4+cells) balance, reduced CD4+IL-17+ and increased CD4+IL-10+ and CD4+TGF-β+ cells. The MFI of IL-10 and TGF-β in CD4+CD25+CD127- T cells were higher, whereas lower levels of IL-17 were observed. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the TGF-β, Wnt signalling pathways and STAT5 transcription factor might mechanistically support the immunomodulatory effect of MSC-EVs. This study presents the immunomodulatory effect of MSC-EVs in PBMCs from AR patients. The results provide a new therapeutic strategy for AR.">

        <tr id="The vascular endothelium, a specialized monolayer of endothelial cells (ECs), is crucial for maintaining vascular homeostasis by controlling the passage of substances and cells. In the tumor microenvironment, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF-A) drives tumor angiogenesis, leading to endothelial anergy and vascular immunosuppression—a state where ECs resist cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration, hindering immune surveillance. Immunotherapies have shown clinical promise. However, their effectiveness is significantly reduced by tumor EC anergy. Anti-angiogenic treatments aim to normalize tumor vessels and improve immune cell infiltration. Despite their potential, these therapies often cause significant systemic toxicities, necessitating new treatments. The small GTPase Rap1B emerges as a critical regulator of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling in ECs. Our studies using EC-specific Rap1B knockout mice show that the absence of Rap1B impairs tumor growth, alters vessel morphology, and increases CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation. This indicates that Rap1B mediates VEGF-A’s immunosuppressive effects, making it a promising target for overcoming vascular immunosuppression in cancer. Rap1B shares structural and functional similarities with RAS oncogenes. We propose that targeting Rap1B could enhance therapies’ efficacy while minimizing adverse effects by reversing endothelial anergy. We briefly discuss strategies successfully developed for targeting RAS as a model for developing anti-Rap1 therapies.">

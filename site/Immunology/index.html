        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections such as influenza A virus. This response leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells required for viral clearance. Some of these recruited cells remain within the lung following infection and contribute to enhanced viral control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells can also display long-term changes following infection or insults. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection and find that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes associated with communication with T cells. Lung epithelial cells from IAV-infected mice display functional changes by more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells could be effective targets for vaccines to boost durable protective immunity.">

        <tr id="Yellow fever vaccination provides long-lasting protection and is a unique model for studying the immune response to an acute RNA virus infection in humans. To elucidate the early innate immune events preceding the rapid generation of protective immunity, we performed transcriptome analysis of human blood dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte subpopulations before and 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after vaccination. We detected temporary upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in all DC and monocyte subsets on day 3 and 7 after vaccination as well as cell type specific responses and temporal dynamics. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed rapid appearance of activated DC and monocyte clusters dominated by ISGs, inflammatory chemokines and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation. This was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in a large cohort of vaccinees. We identified SIGLEC1/CD169 upregulation as a sensitive indicator of the transient IFN-induced activation state elicited in DCs and monocytes by YF17D vaccination correlating with early protective IgM antibody responses.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis, caused by M.tuberculosis (Mtb), remains an enduring global health challenge, especially given the limited efficacy of current therapeutic interventions. Much of existing research has focused on immune failure as a driver of tuberculosis. However, the crucial role of host macrophage biology in controlling the disease remains underappreciated. While we have gained deeper insights into how alveolar macrophages (AMs) interact with Mtb, the precise AM subsets that mediate protection and potentially prevent tuberculosis progression have yet to be identified. In this study, we employed multi-modal scRNA-seq analyses to evaluate the functional roles of diverse macrophage subpopulations across different infection timepoints, allowing us to delineate the dynamic landscape of controller and permissive AM populations during the course of infection. Our analyses at specific time-intervals post-Mtb challenge revealed macrophage populations transitioning between distinct anti- and pro-inflammatory states. Notably, early in Mtb infection, CD38− AMs showed a muted response. As infection progressed, we observed a phenotypic shift in AMs, with CD38+ monocyte-derived AMs (moAMs) and a subset of tissue-resident AMs (TR-AMs) emerging as significant controllers of bacterial growth. Furthermore, scATAC-seq analysis of naïve lungs demonstrated that CD38+ TR-AMs possessed a distinct chromatin signature prior to infection, indicative of epigenetic priming and predisposition to a pro-inflammatory response. BCG intranasal immunization increased the numbers of CD38+ macrophages, substantially enhancing their capability to restrict Mtb growth. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal, dynamic roles of different macrophage subsets in TB infection and reveal rational pathways for the development of improved vaccines and immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus. Previous studies have shown antibody Fc effector functions are critical for optimal monoclonal antibody-mediated protection against alphaviruses; however, the requirement of Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) for protection during natural infection has not been evaluated. Here, we showed mice lacking activating FcγRs (FcRγ-/-) developed prolonged clinical disease with more virus in joint-associated tissues. Viral clearance was associated with anti-MAYV cell surface binding rather than neutralizing antibodies. Lack of Fc-FcγR engagement increased the number of monocytes through chronic timepoints. Single cell RNA sequencing showed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory monocytes in joint-associated tissue with increased MAYV RNA present in FcRγ-/- monocytes and macrophages. Transfer of FcRγ-/- monocytes into wild type animals was sufficient to increase virus in joint-associated tissue. Overall, this study suggests that engagement of antibody Fc with activating FcγRs promotes protective responses during MAYV infection and prevents monocytes from being potential targets of infection.">

        <tr id="The adjuvant AS01 plays a key role in the immunogenicity of several approved human vaccines with demonstrated high efficacy. Its adjuvant effect relies on activation of the innate immune system. However, specific effects of AS01-adjuvanted vaccines on innate cell function and epigenetic remodeling, as described for Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and influenza vaccines, are still unknown. We assessed the long-term functional and epigenetic changes in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells induced by a model vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen and AS01 in healthy adults (NCT01777295). The AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, but not an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine, increased the number of circulating monocytes and their expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–DR, which correlated with the magnitude of the memory CD4+ T cell response. Single-cell analyses revealed epigenetic alterations in monocyte and dendritic cell subsets, affecting accessibility of transcription factors involved in cell functions including activator protein-1 (AP-1), GATA, C/EBP, and interferon regulatory factor. The functional changes were characterized by a reduced proinflammatory response to Toll-like receptor activation and an improved response to interferon-γ, a cytokine critical for the adjuvant’s mode of action. Epigenetic changes were most evident shortly after the second vaccine dose in CD14+ monocytes, for which accessibility differences of some transcription factors could persist for up to 6 months postvaccination. Together, we show that reprogramming of monocyte subsets occurs after vaccination with an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, an effect that may contribute to the impact of vaccination beyond antigen-specific protection. An AS01-adjuvanted vaccine for hepatitis B virus modifies the epigenetic landscape of monocytes isolated from clinical study participants. Editor’s summary Most vaccines based on recombinant antigens rely on coadministration with an adjuvant to elicit a robust immune response. Although adjuvants are needed for many vaccines, it is less clear which adjuvant(s) should be paired with each immunogen. In two papers, Bechtold et al. and Arunachalam et al. performed comparative analyses to assess the effect of different adjuvants on the immune response. Bechtold et al. showed that an AS01-adjuvanted hepatitis B virus vaccine, which induces robust CD4+ T cell responses against the vaccine antigen, also elicited trained immunity in human recipients, which was not observed in an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine. Arunachalam et al. found that Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum adjuvantation induced robust immune responses to the R21 malaria vaccine in nonhuman primates, but a third comparator, GLA-LSQ, elicited a lower magnitude of response that was short lived. Although Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum induced robust and durable antibody responses, they elicited distinct innate immune responses, demonstrating that multiple innate immune mechanisms can program durable vaccine-induced immunity. These head-to-head comparisons in both humans and nonhuman primates demonstrate that selecting an adjuvant should be done carefully and that different adjuvants have distinct effects on both innate and adaptive immunity. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="The severity of COVID-19 is linked to excessive inflammation. Neutrophils represent a critical arm of the innate immune response and are major mediators of inflammation, but their role in COVID-19 pathophysiology remains poorly understood. We conducted transcriptomic profiling of neutrophils obtained from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, as well as from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, in comparison to non-infected healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the inflammasome formation potential in neutrophils from patients and mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), consisting mainly of mature neutrophils, revealed a striking type I interferon (IFN-I) gene signature in severe COVID-19 patients, contrasting with mild COVID-19 and healthy controls. Notably, low-density granulocytes (LDGs) from severe COVID-19 patients exhibited an immature neutrophil phenotype and lacked this IFN-I signature. Moreover, PMNs from severe COVID-19 patients showed heightened nigericin-induced caspase1 activation, but reduced responsiveness to exogenous inflammasome priming. Furthermore, IFN-I emerged as a priming stimulus for neutrophil inflammasomes. These findings suggest a potential role for neutrophil inflammasomes in driving inflammation during severe COVID-19. Altogether, these findings open promising avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate the pathological processes associated with the disease.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity (TI) is the process wherein innate immune cells gain functional memory upon exposure to specific ligands or pathogens, leading to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.">

        <tr id="Immune cells from the adaptive and innate immune systems coexist in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) to mediate tumor cell immunosurveillance and prevent tumor relapse. Relapse-free survival after surgical resection is heterogeneous in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), the two major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. Yet, little is known about the composition and spatial organisation of the TME that could explain the different prognoses for lung cancer patients. Using spatial multi-omics analyses, we show that LUAD and LUSC have distinct TMEs and that neutrophil-enriched tumors are associated with worse survival, while the accumulation of myeloid-instructed CD14+ T cells in the tumor core was associated with prolonged patient survival. CD14+CD4+ T cells express prototypic markers of myeloid cells and were found to be clonally expanded tumor-specific activated T cells. TNFα signaling was activated in tumors with high infiltration of CD14+CD4+ T cells in the tumor core.

        <tr id="The lung is constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and particles that can cause alveolar damage. Hence, appropriate repair responses are essential for gas exchange and life. Here, we deciphered the spatiotemporal trajectory and function of an atypical population of macrophages after lung injury. Post–influenza A virus (IAV) infection, short-lived monocyte-derived Ly6G-expressing macrophages (Ly6G+ Macs) were recruited to the alveoli of lung perilesional areas. Ly6G+ Macs engulfed immune cells, exhibited a high metabolic potential, and clustered with alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AT2s) in zones of active epithelial regeneration. Ly6G+ Macs were partially dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 receptor signaling and were essential for AT2-dependent alveolar regeneration. Similar macrophages were recruited in other models of injury and in the airspaces of lungs from patients with suspected pneumonia. This study identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G+ Macs as a spatially restricted, short-lived macrophage subset promoting epithelial regeneration postinjury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target for treating lung damage. Short-lived perilesional Ly6G+ macrophages license alveolar epithelial regeneration after viral-triggered lung injury. Editor’s summary Respiratory virus infections can cause long-lasting lung damage, but how specific lung myeloid cell populations contribute to postinfection recovery is not fully understood. Using a mouse model of influenza A virus infection, Ruscitti et al. identified a distinct population of Ly6G+ monocyte-derived macrophages that emerges during the early recovery phase after viral-triggered lung injury. Ly6G+ lung macrophages were short lived and highly phagocytic and populated the alveoli within perilesional areas undergoing regeneration. Genetically engineered mice lacking lung Ly6G+ macrophages displayed impaired epithelial regeneration after influenza infection. Together, these findings identify a previously unappreciated population of reparative lung macrophages that could be targeted therapeutically to treat lung damage. —Claire Olingy">

In particular, SCA1+ fibroblasts were enriched for numerous chemokines, including CCL2, CCL7, and IL33 compared to SCA1-fibroblasts. Genetic deletion of Ccl2 in fibroblasts resulted in fewer wound bed macrophages and monocytes during injury-induced inflammation with reduced revascularization and re-epithelialization during the proliferation phase of healing.

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside in the lower airways and play a crucial role in lung health and response to sterile inflammation and infections. AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of trained immunity by reprogramming hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow generating trained innate cells with enhanced responsiveness. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung via neutrophils and IFNγ signalling, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (LPS) or viral (polyI:C) challenges. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.">

        <tr id="Postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) represent an urgent public health challenge and are estimated to affect more than 60 million individuals globally. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that dysregulated immune reactions may be linked with PASC symptoms, most investigations have primarily centered around blood-based studies, with few focusing on samples derived from affected tissues. Furthermore, clinical studies alone often provide correlative insights rather than causal mechanisms. Thus, it is essential to compare clinical samples with relevant animal models and conduct functional experiments to understand the etiology of PASC. In this study, we comprehensively compared bronchoalveolar lavage fluid single-cell RNA sequencing data derived from clinical PASC samples and a mouse model of PASC. This revealed a pro-fibrotic monocyte-derived macrophage response in respiratory PASC, as well as abnormal interactions between pulmonary macrophages and respiratory resident T cells, in both humans and mice. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) emerged as a key node mediating the immune anomalies in respiratory PASC. Neutralizing IFN-γ after the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced lung inflammation and tissue fibrosis in mice. Together, our study underscores the importance of performing comparative analysis to understand the cause of PASC and suggests that the IFN-γ signaling axis might represent a therapeutic target. Comparative scRNA-seq analysis, combined with functional experiments in an animal model, identified IFN-γ as a target for respiratory PASC. Editor’s summary The term “Long Covid” covers a myriad of symptoms that a person may experience after an acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is also referred to as postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). The specific drivers of these symptoms are unclear, complicating the development of therapeutics for those suffering from this condition. Here, Li et al. used comparative analysis to interrogate a potential driver of respiratory PASC, one of the most debilitating types of PASC. The authors found that humans with respiratory PASC had evidence of an enhanced monocyte-derived macrophage response in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A similar phenotype was observed in aged C57BL/6 mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. This phenotype in mice could be reduced by anti–interferon-γ (anti–IFN-γ) treatment initiated after the resolution of acute disease, suggesting that the IFN-γ signaling pathway may represent a potential therapeutic target for humans. —Courtney Malo">

However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR1 has been implicated in maintaining self-tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and mediating antiviral immunity. Foreign viral double-stranded RNA triggers rapid interferon response and activates ADAR1 in the host immune system. Emerging data points to a role of ADAR1 A-to-I editing in the inflammatory response associated with severe COVID-19 disease. We identify A-to-I editing events within human whole transcriptome data from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, non-infected individuals, and individuals with other viral illnesses from nasopharyngeal swabs. High levels of RNA editing in host cells are associated with low SARS-CoV-2 viral load (p = 9.27 E-06), suggesting an inhibitory effect of ADAR1 on viral infection. Additionally, we find differentially expressed genes associated with RNA-modifications and interferon response. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected nasopharyngeal swabs reveals that cytotoxic CD8 T cells upregulate ADAR1 in COVID-19 positive samples (p = 0.0269). We further reveal ADAR1 expression increases with CD4 and CD8 T cell activation, and knockdown of ADAR1 leads to apoptosis and aberrant IL-2 secretion. Together, our data suggests A-to-I RNA editing is required to maintain healthy homeostasis of activated T cells to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in virus control. However, it has remained largely unclear whether NK cell mobilization in SARS-CoV-2 infections is beneficial or pathologic. To address this deficit, we employed a validated experimental NK cell depletion non-human primate (NHP) model with SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant B.1.617.2 challenge. Viral loads (VL), NK cell numbers, activation, proliferation, and functional measures were evaluated in blood and tissues. In non-depleted (control) animals, infection rapidly induced NK cell expansion, activation, and increased tissue trafficking associated with VL. Strikingly, we report that experimental NK cell depletion leads to higher VL, longer duration of viral shedding, significantly increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, and overt lung damage. Overall, we find the first significant and conclusive evidence for NK cell-mediated control of SARS-CoV-2 virus replication and disease pathology. These data indicate that adjunct therapies for infection could largely benefit from NK cell-targeted approaches.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Exhaustion represents a collection of programmed T cell differentiation states and an important mode of T cell dysfunction. T cell progression from progenitor to terminal exhaustion is associated with upregulation of the transcription factor TOX and expression of TIM3. Our understanding of factors regulating TOX expression and the transition from progenitor to terminal exhaustion, however, remains incomplete. We reveal here that T cell upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor type II (TNFR2) coincides with the gain of phenotypic markers and functions reflective of terminal exhaustion. Meanwhile, knocking out TNFR2 affords a novel population of T cells that express TIM3 but possess diminished TOX levels and functional characteristics of both progenitor and terminally exhausted cells. TIM3+ TNFR2 KO T cells exhibit reduced exhaustion transcriptional programs and enhanced AP1 pathway signatures. Finally, TNFR2 KO mice demonstrate improved T cell-dependent control of tumor and chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis viral (cLCMV) infection, while pharmacologic antagonism of TNFR2 licenses responses to checkpoint blockade in multiple tumor models.">

        <tr id="Secondary bacterial infection, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is one of the most frequent and severe complications of influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pneumonia. Phenotyping of the pulmonary innate immune landscape after IAV infection revealed a significant depletion of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophage (TR-AM) population at day 7, which was associated with increased susceptibility to Spn outgrowth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TR-AM depletion, and to define putative targets for treatment, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and cell-specific PCR profiling in an unbiased manner, using in vivo models of IAV infection and IAV/Spn co-infection. The TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) ligand-receptor axis was revealed as the driving force behind post-influenza TR-AM death during the early infection phase, enabling the transition to pneumococcal pneumonia, while intrapulmonary transfer of genetically modified TR-AMs and antibody-mediated neutralization of specific pathway components alleviated disease severity. With a mainly neutrophilic expression and a high abundance in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of patients with severe virus-induced ARDS, TNFSF14 emerged as a novel determinant of virus-driven lung injury. Targeting the TNFSF14-mediated intercellular communication network in the virus-infected lung can, therefore, improve host defense, minimizing the risk of subsequent bacterial pneumonia, and ameliorating disease outcome.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Understanding the immune mechanisms associated with liver transplantation (LT), particularly the involvement of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs), represents a significant challenge. Methods: This study employs a multi-omics approach to analyse liver transplant samples from both human (n = 17) and mouse (n = 16), utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and immunological techniques. Results: Our findings reveal a comprehensive T cell-centric landscape in LT across human and mouse species, involving 235,116 cells. Notably, we found a substantial increase in CD8+ TRMs within rejected grafts compared to stable ones. The elevated presence of CD8+ TRMs is characterised by a distinct expression profile, featuring upregulation of tissue-residency markers (CD69, CXCR6, CD49A and CD103+/-,), immune checkpoints (PD1, CTLA4, and TIGIT), cytotoxic markers (GZMB and IFNG) and proliferative markers (PCNA and TOP2A) during rejection. Furthermore, there is a high expression of transcription factors such as EOMES and RUNX3. Functional assays and analyses of cellular communication underscore the active role of CD8+ TRMs in interacting with other tissue-resident cells, particularly Kupffer cells, especially during rejection episodes. Conclusions: These insights into the distinctive activation and interaction patterns of CD8+ TRMs suggest their potential utility as biomarkers for graft rejection, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing graft tolerance and improving overall transplant outcomes.">

        <tr id="Disease tolerance is an evolutionarily conserved host defence strategy that preserves tissue integrity and physiology without affecting pathogen load. Unlike host resistance, the mechanisms underlying disease tolerance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether an adjuvant (β-glucan) can reprogram innate immunity to provide protection against Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here we observe that β-glucan treatment reduced the morbidity and mortality against IAV infection, independent of host resistance (viral load). Increased survival of β-glucan treated mice against IAV is associated with the accumulation of neutrophils via RoRγt+ T cells in the lung tissue. Using gain-and-loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that β- glucan reprogrammed neutrophils are essential for promoting disease tolerance, limiting pulmonary tissue damage, and enhancing survival against IAV infection. β-glucan treatment promotes granulopoiesis in a type 1 interferon-dependent manner that leads to the generation of a unique subset of neutrophils, which are less mature with higher mitochondrial mass utilizing mitochondrial oxidative (OXPHOS) metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that β-glucan reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate neutrophils with a novel “regulatory” function, which is required for promoting disease tolerance and maintaining lung tissue integrity against viral infection.">

        <tr id="This study addresses the molecular mechanisms behind JAK inhibitors’ (JAKi) epigenetic regulation of IFN-γ-induced genes in macrophages, key players in controlling inflammation in chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and COVID-19. Utilizing transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches, we reveal that JAKi selectively regulate gene programs in IFN-γ-activated human macrophages. Our single-cell analysis identified high expression of IFN-γ signature genes in macrophages from RA and severe COVID-19 patients. JAKi suppressed some inflammatory genes, while a subset remained unresponsive to JAK-STAT inhibition. We discovered that JAKi selectively target IRF-STAT-dependent open chromatin regions, leaving AP-1-C/EBP-regulated genes with open chromatin unaffected. Some JAKi-insensitive genes could be inhibited by JNK inhibitors in IFN-γ-primed macrophages. Our analysis also identified JAKi-sensitive and - insensitive IFN-γ signature genes in RA patients resistant to MTX treatments and COVID-19 vaccinated donors, highlighting JAKi’s therapeutic potential and risks. These findings uncover new JAKi responsiveness mechanisms through epigenomic changes in IFN-γ-primed macrophages, advancing our understanding of inflammation regulation in chronic diseases.

        <tr id="Current rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatments do not restore immune tolerance. Investigating dendritic cell (DC) populations in human synovial tissue (ST) may reveal pathways to re-instate tolerance in RA. With single-cell and spatial-transcriptomics of synovial tissue biopsies, validated by micro co-culture systems, we identified condition and niche-specific myeloid DC clusters with distinct differentiation trajectories and functions. Healthy synovium contains a unique tolerogenic AXLpos DC2 cluster in the superficial sublining layer. In active RA, a macrophage-rich lining-layer niche becomes populated with inflammatory DC3 clusters that specifically activate memory CCL5pos TEM and CCL5posCXCL13pos TPH, promoting synovitis. In the sublining lymphoid niche, CCR7pos DC2 mReg specifically interact with naïve-T-cells, potentially driving the local expansion of new effector T-cells. Sustained remission sees the resolution of these niches but lacks the recovery of tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, indicating latent potential for disease flare. A human RA disease-flare model showed that the activation of blood predecessor of ST-DC3 clusters precedes the onset of inflammation in joints. Therapeutic strategies targeting pathogenic ST-DC3 clusters, or reinstating tolerogenic AXLpos DC2, may restore immune homeostasis in RA. In brief Deconstruction of human RA synovium, using single-cell spatial transcriptomics and micro-culture systems, reveals distinct neighbourhoods within the synovial architecture across health, and RA patients with active disease or sustained remission. Discrete niches are identified that contain distinct myeloid DC clusters that differ in frequency, differentiation trajectories, and effector functions. Highlights Human RA synovium exhibits condition and niche specific myeloid DC clusters that vary in their tissue differentiation trajectories and functions. ST-CD14pos DC3 (iDC3) support inflammatory CCL5pos TEM and CCL5pos TPH cell activation in the hyperplastic lining layer.

Although single-cell transcriptomics have revealed Trm heterogeneity in various diseases, the molecular mechanisms behind this diversity are unclear. To investigate this, we used Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection, which persists in the central nervous system (CNS) and is controlled by brain CD8+ Trm. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of brain CD8+ T cells from T. gondii-infected mice showed heterogeneous expression of the transcriptional regulator Id2, correlating with different functional states. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we found that Id2-deficiency in T cells caused parasite-specific Trm to develop an altered phenotype with diminished effector functions and reduced expression of CD49a. Furthermore, loss of Id2 in brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells led to the accumulation of exhausted PD1+Tox+CD8+ Trm cells, while Id2 overexpression repressed T cell exhaustion. Overall, our study shows that Id2 levels dictate the acquisition of effector vs. exhausted phenotypes in CD8+ Trm during chronic CNS infection.

        <tr id="Aims/hypothesis Immunotherapeutics targeting T cells are crucial for inhibiting autoimmune disease progression proximal to disease onset in type 1 diabetes. A growing number of T cell-directed therapeutics have demonstrated partial therapeutic efficacy, with anti-CD3 (α-CD3) representing the only regulatory agency-approved drug capable of slowing disease progression through a mechanism involving the induction of partial T cell exhaustion. There is an outstanding need to augment the durability and effectiveness of T cell targeting by directly restraining proinflammatory T helper type 1 (Th1) and type 1 cytotoxic CD8+ T cell (Tc1) subsets, while simultaneously augmenting regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Here, we present a novel strategy for reducing diabetes incidence in the NOD mouse model using a blocking monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 diabetes-risk associated T cell co-stimulatory receptor, CD226. Methods Female NOD mice were treated with anti-CD226 between 7-8 weeks of age and then monitored for diabetes incidence and therapeutic mechanism of action. Results Compared to isotype-treated controls, anti-CD226 treated NOD mice showed reduced insulitis severity at 12 weeks and decreased disease incidence at 30 weeks. Flow cytometric analysis performed five weeks post-treatment demonstrated reduced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells in spleens of anti-CD226 treated mice. Phenotyping of pancreatic Tregs revealed increased CD25 expression and STAT5 phosphorylation following anti-CD226, with splenic Tregs displaying augmented suppression of CD4+ T cell responders in vitro. Anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited reduced frequencies of islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit related protein (IGRP)-reactive CD8+ T cells in the pancreas, using both ex vivo tetramer staining and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) approaches. 51Cr-release assays demonstrated reduced cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells by anti-CD226-treated autoreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Conclusions/interpretation CD226 blockade reduces T cell cytotoxicity and improves Treg function, representing a targeted and rational approach for restoring immune regulation in type 1 diabetes. Research in Context What is already known about this subject? The co-stimulatory receptor CD226 is upregulated upon activation and is highly expressed on NK cell subsets, myeloid cells, and effector T cells. A single nucleotide polymorphism in CD226 (rs763361; C>T) results in a Gly307Ser missense mutation linked to genetic susceptibility for type 1 diabetes. Global knockout of Cd226 and conditional Cd226 knockout in FoxP3+ Tregs reduced insulitis severity and diabetes incidence in NOD mice, indicating a crucial role for CD226 in disease pathogenesis. What is the key question? Can CD226 blockade reduce T cell cytotoxicity and improve Treg function to diminish diabetes incidence in NOD mice? What are the new findings? Anti-CD226 treatment reduced insulitis, decreased disease incidence, and inhibited splenic CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cell proliferation. Pancreatic Tregs from anti-CD226 treated mice exhibited increased CD25 expression; splenic Tregs displayed augmented STAT5 phosphorylation and suppressive capacity in vitro. Anti-CD226 treatment reduced IGRP-specific pancreatic CD8+ T cell frequencies, and reduced autoreactive CD8+ T cell-mediated lysis of beta-cells in vitro. How might this impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future? CD226 blockade could reduce autoreactive T cell cytotoxicity, enhance Treg function, and slow disease progression in high-risk or recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases.">

        <tr id="The cytokine interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a pivotal T cell-derived signal crucial for germinal center (GC) responses, but the precise mechanisms by which IL-21 influences B cell function remain elusive. Here, we investigated the B cell-intrinsic role of IL-21 signaling by employing a novel IL-21 receptor (Il21r) conditional knock-out mouse model and ex vivo culture systems and uncovered a surprising duality of IL-21 signaling in B cells. While IL-21 stimulation of naïve B cells led to Bim-dependent apoptosis, it promoted robust proliferation of pre-activated B cells, particularly class-switched IgG1+ B cells ex vivo. Consistent with this, B cell-specific deletion of Il21r led to a severe defect in IgG1 responses in vivo following immunization. Intriguingly, Il21r-deleted B cells are significantly impaired in their ability to transition from a pre-GC to a GC state following immunization. Although Il21r-deficiency did not affect the proportion of IgG1+ B cells among GC B cells, it greatly diminished the proportion of IgG1+ B cells among the plasmablast/plasma cell population. Collectively, our data suggest that IL-21 serves as a critical regulator of B cell fates, influencing B cell apoptosis and proliferation in a context-dependent manner.">

Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

Our data show that vaccine-elicited T cells represent a transcriptionally unique subset of activated T cells with high proliferative capacity and a memory cell fate.

Here, using a mouse model of intranasal house dust mite (HDM) exposure, we showed that short-lived IgE PCs emerge in lung draining lymph nodes (dLNs) during early exposure (<3 weeks) and long-lived IgE PCs accumulate in the bone marrow (BM) with prolonged exposure (>7 weeks). IgE PCs had distinct surface and gene expression profiles in these different tissues compared with other Ig isotypes. IgE BMPCs up-regulated genes associated with prosurvival and BM homing, whereas IgE dLN PCs expressed genes associated with recent class switching and differentiation. IgE PCs also exhibited higher expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein coding genes and higher antibody secretion rate when compared with IgG1. Overall, this study highlights the unique developmental path and transcriptional signature of short-lived and long-lived IgE PCs. IgE plasma cells are unique. Editor’s summary Immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated allergic diseases can be fatal, yet our understanding of IgE-producing plasma cells (PCs) is limited. Vecchione et al. used a transgenic mouse reporter strain to characterize IgE PCs during chronic house dust mite exposure. IgE PCs were transcriptionally and phenotypically unique compared with other immunoglobulin isotypes, with higher levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress and increased antibody production. Short-lived IgE PCs appeared early in the lung draining lymph nodes post–allergen exposure, whereas long-lived bone marrow (BM) IgE PCs were not detected until much later. IgE BMPCs from humans with allergy also had unique transcriptional signatures. These findings demonstrate that IgE PCs are developmentally, transcriptionally, and functionally unique. —Hannah Isles">

This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="In murine models of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), parasitization of resident Kupffer cells (resKCs) is responsible for early growth of Leishmania infantum in the liver, which leads to granuloma formation and eventual parasite control. We employed the chronic VL model, and revealed an open niche established by KCs death and their migration outside of the sinusoids, resulting in their gradual replacement by monocyte-derived KCs (moKCs). While early granulomas were composed of resKCs, late granulomas were found outside of the sinusoids and contained resKC-derived macrophages, and monocyte-derived macrophages (momacs). ResKCs and moKCs within the sinusoids were identified as homeostatic/regulatory cells, while resKC-derived macrophages and momacs within late granulomas were pro-inflammatory. Despite the infection being largely confined to the resKC-derived macrophages, in the absence of monocyte recruitment, parasite control was strongly compromised. Macrophage heterogeneity, involving migration and reprogramming of resKCs, along with recruitment of monocyte-derived cells, is a hallmark of granuloma maturation and hepatic immunity in VL.">

However, the ability of CD4+ T cells to suppress Mtb growth cannot be fully explained by IFN-γ or other known T cell products. In this study, we show that CD4+ T cell-derived IFN-γ promoted the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to the lungs of Mtb-infected mice. Although the recruited MDMs became quickly and preferentially infected with Mtb, CD4+ T cells rapidly disinfected the MDMs. Clearance of Mtb from MDMs was not explained by IFN-γ, but rather by MHCII-mediated cognate interactions with CD4+ T cells. These interactions promoted MDM expression of glycolysis genes essential for Mtb control. Thus, by recruiting MDMs, CD4+ T cells initiate a cycle of bacterial phagocytosis, Mtb antigen presentation and disinfection in an attempt to clear the bacteria from the lungs.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

Despite lower Ag+ B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+ T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+ CD4+ T cells and a high proportion of Ag+ CD8+ T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.">

        <tr id="Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which coexists as four genetically and immunologically distinct serotypes (DENV1-4). In secondary heterologous DENV infection, pre-existing immunity is believed to contribute to severe disease through antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). Although the elevated pathology observed in ADE conditions has been described, the cell intrinsic mechanisms governing this process remain unclear. Using scRNAseq, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of human monocyte-derived macrophages infected by DENV via ADE compared to conventional infection conditions. Unsupervised analysis of scRNAseq data enabled the identification and differentiation of infected and bystander/uninfected cells in a heterogeneous cell culture. Differential gene expression and Ingenuity Pathway analyses revealed a number of significantly up- and down-regulated genes and gene networks between cells infected by ADE compared to conventional infection. Specifically, these pathways indicated mechanisms such as suppressed interferon signaling and inflammatory chemokine transcription in cells infected via ADE. Further analysis revealed that transcriptomic changes were independent of viral RNA within infected cells, suggesting that the observed changes are reflective of cell-intrinsic responses and not simply a function of per-cell viral burden. Bystander cells in ADE conditions also demonstrated distinct profiles, indicating an immunologically activated phenotype enriched for the expression of gene networks involved with protein translation, cytokine production, and antigen presentation. Together, these findings support the concept that DENV infection via ADE induces a qualitatively different transcriptomic response in infected and bystander cells, contributing to our understanding of ADE as a mechanistic driver of disease and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne human pathogen with a significant and growing global health burden. Although correlates of severe dengue disease are poorly understood, pre-existing immunity to DENV has been associated with severe disease risk and known to contribute to an alternative route of viral entry termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Using single cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct transcriptomic processes involved in antibody-mediated DENV entry compared to conventional receptor mediated entry. These data provide meaningful insight into the discrete processes contributing to DENV pathogenesis in ADE conditions.">

        <tr id="Type I and III interferons (IFNs) are robustly induced during infections and protect cells against viral infection. Both type I and III IFNs are also produced at low levels in the thymus at steady state; however, their role in T cell development and immune tolerance is unclear. Here, we found that both type I and III IFNs were constitutively produced by a very small number of AIRE+ murine thymic epithelial cells, independent of microbial stimulation. Antigen-presenting cells were highly responsive to thymic IFNs, and IFNs were required for the activation and maturation of thymic type 1 conventional dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Loss of IFN sensing led to reduced regulatory T cell selection, reduced T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity, and enhanced autoreactive T cell responses to self-antigens expressed during peripheral IFN signaling. Thus, constitutive exposure to IFNs in the thymus is required for generating a tolerant and diverse TCR repertoire. IFN shapes the thymic microenvironment by promoting distinct APC responses and is required for selection of a diverse, self-tolerant TCR repertoire. Editor’s summary Induction of type I and III interferons (IFNs) is critical for antimicrobial innate immune responses, but IFNs are also constitutively produced at low levels in the absence of infection. Using IFN reporter mice and mice lacking various IFN receptors, Ashby et al. investigated the function of type I and III IFNs produced in the thymus during homeostasis. Sterile IFNs were produced by a subset of AIRE+ medullary thymic epithelial cells, with sensing of type III IFN required for the maturation of thymic antigen-presenting cells. Loss of IFN sensing reduced T cell repertoire diversity and impaired central tolerance to inflammation-associated self-antigens, highlighting the importance of sterile thymic IFN production in generating a self-tolerant TCR repertoire. —Claire Olingy and Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a significant public health problem leading to permanently disfiguring skin lesions caused by Leishmania parasites. Lesion severity stems from an excessive host inflammatory response that prevents healing. Here, we characterized the transcriptional and translational responses of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) during murine CL using historical single-cell RNA sequencing data combined with flow cytometry and in vivo puromycin incorporation to assess translational activity. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation pathways including MHC-I, MHC-II, and immunoproteasome transcripts in dermal LECs from Leishmania major-infected mice compared to naive controls. LECs also exhibited increased expression of guanylate binding proteins and interferon-inducible genes, indicative of immune activation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that LECs in leishmanial lesions displayed heightened translational activity relative to LECs from uninflamed ears, and LEC translational activity was highest in activated LECs. Furthermore, LEC translational activity exceeded that of other cell types within the lesion microenvironment. Validating the transcriptomic data, LECs in lesions expressed elevated MHC-II and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1), supporting their potential role in antigen presentation. Functional assays using DQ-OVA confirmed that LECs from leishmanial lesions efficiently uptake and process antigens, highlighting their capability as antigen presenting cells in the inflamed dermal microenvironment. Overall, our study reveals the activation status of LECs in leishmanial lesions, shedding light on their potential role in shaping local immunity and inflammation in a variety of skin diseases.">

In a study of a perforin-deficient mouse model of HLH with a viral trigger, we aimed to determine if CD8+ T cell behaviour could be modulated by targeted interleukin (IL)-2 treatment. We observed a paradoxical benefit that contrasted with IL-2’s typical role in boosting T cell activity: targeted IL-2 delivery to CD8+ T cells led to reduced hyperinflammation and disease severity. Our results demonstrated that IL-2 induced exhaustion in overactive CD8+ T cells, thus mitigating hyperinflammation. These findings highlight the context-dependency of cytokine treatment and suggest new therapeutic strategies for HLH and other inflammatory diseases by leveraging cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled intricate disease- specific and common immune cell chemoattraction and extravasation patterns. Our findings delineate disease-specific L-R networks and shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Insights gleaned from this analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Dysregulated T-cell immune response-mediated inflammation plays critical roles in the pathology of diverse liver diseases, but the underlying mechanism of liver immune homeostasis control and the specific therapies for limiting T-cell overactivation remain unclear. Methods: The metabolic changes in concanavalin A (ConA) mice and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) patients and their associations with liver injury were analyzed. The expression of purine catabolism nucleases (e.g., CD39 and CD73) on liver cells and immune cells was assessed. The effects of MCregs and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and the underlying mechanism were also explored. Results: Our findings revealed significant alterations in purine metabolism in ConA mice and AIH patients, which correlated with liver injury severity and therapeutic response. CD39 and CD73 were markedly upregulated on CD11b+Gr-1+ MCs under liver injury conditions. The naturally expanded CD39+CD73+Gr-1highCD11b+ MCreg subset during early liver injury effectively suppressed CD4+ T-cell hyperactivation and liver injury both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MCregs released CD73high EVs, which converted extracellular AMP to immunosuppressive metabolites (e.g., adenosine and inosine), activating the cAMP pathway and inhibiting glycolysis and cytokine secretion in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the mechanism controlling immune homeostasis during the early liver injury phase and highlights that MCreg or MCreg-EV therapy may be a specific strategy for preventing diverse liver diseases induced by T-cell overactivation.">

        <tr id="The transcription factor BATF plays critical roles in the differentiation of various immune cells, including CD8+ T cells. Here, we demonstrated that BATF controls epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming of CD8+ T cells at an early phase of acute viral infection, thereby promoting the differentiation of cytolytic effector CD8+ T cells. Loss of BATF drastically perturbed gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and the bindings of key transcription factors including Jun, T-bet, and IRF4. The direct interaction with IRF4 was essential for BATF-mediated effector differentiation, as the BATF mutant lacking this interaction failed to induce proper chromatin remodeling and proliferation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Notably, IRF4 binding was exhaustively dependent on BATF, whereas BATF retained binding capacity even in IRF4-deficient CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, BATF initiated chromatin remodeling in the absence of IRF4, whereas subsequent dynamic epigenomic reorganization required IRF4. Our data proposed that BATF serves as a “pioneer transcription factor” spearheading the reorganization of chromatin architecture upon antigen encounter, followed by further rearrangement of epigenomic and transcriptomic landscapes through the cooperation with IRF4.">

        <tr id="In chronic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), tissue-resident self-reactive T cells perpetuate disease. The specific tissue factors governing the persistence and continuous differentiation of these cells remain undefined but could represent attractive therapeutic targets. In a model of chronic CNS autoimmunity, we find that oligodendrocyte-derived interleukin-33 (IL-33), an alarmin, is key for locally regulating the pathogenicity of self-reactive CD8+ T cells. The selective ablation of IL-33 from neo-self-antigen-expressing oligodendrocytes mitigates CNS disease. In this context, fewer self-reactive CD8+ T cells persist in the inflamed CNS, and the remaining cells are largely locked into a stem-like precursor program, failing to form TCF-1low effector progeny. Importantly, interventional IL-33 blockade by locally administered somatic gene therapy reduces T cell infiltrates and improves the disease course. Our study identifies oligodendrocyte-derived IL-33 as a druggable tissue factor regulating the differentiation and survival of self-reactive CD8+ T cell in the inflamed CNS. This finding introduces tissue factors as a novel category of immune targets for treating chronic CNS autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Soil-transmitted helminths are one of the most common infections across the world, yet how to promote an effective humoral response to helminths is not well understood. To ensure the most effective response, molecular programs underpin the specialization of antibody effector subtype to microenvironmental signals. Here, we identify the methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) as a key target to promote IgA-driven responses. Mll1 was increased in germinal center (GC) B cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissues, and the absence of MLL1 in mature B cells led to significant reductions in GCs, IgG1 and IgE in response to the helminth Trichuris muris. Yet, worm expulsion occurred more rapidly in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice compared to control mice in the first two weeks of infection. Accelerated worm clearance correlated with significantly elevated IgA+ plasma cells (PC), serum IgA and fecal IgA in in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice. Stimulation of B cells in vitro confirmed that Mll1-deficiency accelerated the formation of IgA+ PC and that this effect was B cell-intrinsic. CCR9 was identified as a key MLL1-regulated molecule by RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry. Correspondingly, Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice infected with either T. muris or the bacterium C. rodentium significant increased IgA+CCR9+ PC localized in the large intestine. This tailoring of the B cell response to promote IgA-secreting PC correlated to a healthier microbiome in Mll1f/fCd23cre/+ mice, compared to control mice. Thus, this study reveals MLL1 as a key target to tailor B cell responses to helminth infections, which may aid the development of effective mucosal vaccines or new targeted treatments. Significance statement Diseases caused by infections, such as soil-transmitted helminth infections or bacterial infections, continue to pose a major human health problem worldwide. One key reason why soil-transmitted helminths continue to cause long-term health and economic burdens is the lack of an effective vaccine for human use. Antibody responses underpin most successful vaccine designs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how B cell responses are regulated to produce tailored antibody to different pathogens is critical for the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines. This study uncovered MLL1 as a novel therapeutic target to promote IgA-producing plasma cells, opening new avenues of investigation into how effective and tailored antibody responses may be produced in response to bacterial or helminth infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract A comprehensive immune landscape for Brucella infection is crucial for developing new treatments for brucellosis. Here, we utilized single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) of 290,369 cells from 35 individuals, including 29 brucellosis patients from acute (n = 10), sub‐acute (n = 9), and chronic (n = 10) phases as well as six healthy donors. Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays were applied for validation within this cohort. Brucella infection caused a significant change in the composition of peripheral immune cells and inflammation was a key feature of brucellosis. Acute patients are characterized by potential cytokine storms resulting from systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, primarily due to classical monocytes. Cytokine storm may be mediated by activating S100A8/A9‐TLR4‐MyD88 signaling pathway. Moreover, monocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells were the probable contributors to immune paralysis in acute patients. Chronic patients are characterized by a dysregulated Th1 response, marked by reduced expression of IFN‐γ and Th1 signatures as well as a high exhausted state. Additionally, Brucella infection can suppress apoptosis in myeloid cells (e.g., mDCs, classical monocytes), inhibit antigen presentation in professional antigen‐presenting cells (APCs; e.g., mDC) and nonprofessional APCs (e.g., monocytes), and induce exhaustion in CD8+ T/NK cells, potentially resulting in the establishment of chronic infection. Overall, our study systemically deciphered the coordinated immune responses of Brucella at different phases of the infection, which facilitated a full understanding of the immunopathogenesis of brucellosis and may aid the development of new effective therapeutic strategies, especially for those with chronic infection.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial in initiating and shaping both innate and adaptive immune responses. Clinical studies and experimental models have highlighted their significant involvement in various autoimmune diseases, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets. Nicotinamide (NAM), a form of vitamin B3, with its anti-inflammatory properties, has been suggested, while the involvement of NAM in DCs regulation remains elusive. Here, through analyzing publicly available databases, we observe substantial alterations in NAM levels and NAM metabolic pathways during DCs activation. Furthermore, we discover that NAM, but not Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN), significantly inhibits DCs over-activation in vitro and in vivo. The suppression of DCs hyperactivation effectively alleviates symptoms of psoriasis. Mechanistically, NAM impairs DCs activation through a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs)-NF-κB dependent manner. Notably, phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) and PARPs are significantly upregulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated DCs and psoriasis patients; elevated NAMPT and PARPs expression in psoriasis patients correlates with higher psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) scores. In summary, our findings underscore the pivotal role of NAM in modulating DCs functions and autoimmune disorders. Targeting the NAMPT-PARP axis emerges as a promising therapeutic approach for DC-related diseases.">

We found that participants who produce bNAbs, termed neutralizers, have a superior LN-associated B cell follicle architecture compared with PLWH who do not. The latter was associated with a significantly higher in situ prevalence of Bcl-6hi follicular helper CD4 T cells (TFH), expressing a molecular program that favors their differentiation and stemness, and significantly reduced IL-10 follicular suppressor CD4 T cells. Furthermore, our data reveal possible molecular targets mediating TFH-B cell interactions in neutralizers.

        <tr id="The successful development of germinal centers (GC) relies heavily on innate mechanisms to amplify the initial inflammatory cascade. In addition to their role in antigen presentation, innate cells are essential for the redirection of circulating lymphocytes toward the draining lymph node (dLN) to maximize antigen surveillance. Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) and its receptors (S1PR1-5) affect various aspects of immunity; however, the role of S1PR4 in regulating an immune response is not well understood. Here we use a footpad model of localized TH1 inflammation to carefully monitor changes in leukocyte populations within the blood, the immunized tissue, and the dLN. Within hours of immunization, neutrophils failed to adequately mobilize and infiltrate into the footpad tissue of S1PR4-/- mice, thereby diminishing the local vascular changes thought to be necessary for redirecting circulating cells toward the inflamed region. Neutrophil depletion with anti-Ly6G antibodies significantly reduced early tissue edema as well as the redirection and initial accumulation of naïve lymphocytes in dLN of WT mice, while the effects were less prominent or absent in S1PR4-/- dLN. Adoptive transfer experiments further demonstrated that the lymphocyte homing deficiencies in vivo were not intrinsic to the donor S1PR4-/- lymphocytes, but were instead attributed to differences within the S1PR4-deficient host. Reduced cell recruitment in S1PR4-/- mice would seed the dLN with fewer antigen-respondent lymphocytes and indeed, dLN hypertrophy at the peak of the immune response was severely diminished, with attenuated GC and activation pathways in these mice. Histological examination of the S1PR4-/- dLN also revealed an underdeveloped vascular network with reduced expression of the leukocyte tethering ligand, PNAd, within high endothelial venule regions, suggesting inadequate growth of the dLN meant to support a robust GC response. Thus, our study reveals that S1PR4 may link early immune modulation by neutrophils to the initial recruitment of circulating lymphocytes and downstream expansion and maturation of the dLN, thereby contributing to optimal GC development during an adaptive response.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cancer can create a shield of suppressive innate immune cells that stop our body’s natural defenses from tumors. VTX-0811 is a new drug that targets these cells and turns them from allies of cancer to fighters against it. Preclinical tests show that it works in the lab on human cells and tumors and is safe and efficacious in animals. The results are promising and pave the way for human trials to see if VTX-0811 can become a new powerful weapon against cancer. Abstract Omnipresent suppressive myeloid populations in the tumor microenvironment limit the efficacy of T-cell-directed immunotherapies, become more inhibitory after administration of T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, and are overall associated with worse survival of cancer patients. In early clinical trials, positive outcomes have been demonstrated for therapies aimed at repolarizing suppressive myeloid populations in the tumor microenvironment. We have previously described the key role of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in maintaining an inhibitory state of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), most of which express high levels of PSGL-1. Here we describe a novel, first-in-class humanized high-affinity monoclonal antibody VTX-0811 that repolarizes human macrophages from an M2-suppressive phenotype towards an M1 inflammatory phenotype, similar to siRNA-mediated knockdown of PSGL-1. VTX-0811 binds to PSGL-1 of human and cynomolgus macaque origins without inhibiting PSGL-1 interaction with P- and L-Selectins or VISTA. In multi-cellular assays and in patient-derived human tumor cultures, VTX-0811 leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators. RNAseq data from VTX-0811 treated ex vivo tumor cultures and M2c macrophages show similar pathways being modulated, indicating that the mechanism of action translates from isolated macrophages to tumors. A chimeric version of VTX-0811, consisting of the parental murine antibody in a human IgG4 backbone, inhibits tumor growth in a humanized mouse model of cancer. VTX-0811 is exceptionally well tolerated in NHP toxicology assessment and is heading into clinical evaluation after successful IND clearance.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Throughout history, the influenza A virus has caused numerous devastating global pandemics. Macrophages, as pivotal innate immune cells, exhibit a wide range of immune functions characterized by distinct polarization states, reflecting their intricate heterogeneity. In this study, we employed the time-resolved single-cell sequencing technique coupled with metabolic RNA labelling to elucidate the dynamic transcriptional changes in distinct polarized states of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) upon infection with the influenza A virus. Our approach not only captures the temporal dimension of transcriptional activity, which is lacking in conventional scRNA-seq methods, but also reveals that M2-polarized Arg1_macrophage cluster is the sole state supporting successful replication of influenza A virus. Furthermore, we identified distinct antigen presentation capabilities to CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells across diverse polarized states of macrophages. Notably, the M1 phenotype, exhibited by (BMDMs) and murine alveolar macrophages (AMs), demonstrated superior conventional and cross-presentation abilities for exogenous antigens, with a particular emphasis on cross-presentation capacity. Additionally, as CD8+ T cell differentiation progressed, M1 polarization exhibited an enhanced capacity for cross-presentation. All three phenotypes of BMDMs, including M1, demonstrated robust presentation to CD4+ regulatory T cells, while displaying limited ability to present to naive CD4+ T cells. These findings offer novel insights into the immunological regulatory mechanisms governing distinct polarized states of macrophages, particularly their roles in restricting the replication of influenza A virus and modulating antigen-specific T cell responses through innate immunity.">

        <tr id="Fibrosis in the lung is thought to be driven by epithelial cell dysfunction and aberrant cell-cell interactions. Unveiling the molecular mechanisms of cellular plasticity and cell-cell interactions is imperative to elucidating lung regenerative capacity and aberrant repair in pulmonary fibrosis. By mining publicly available RNA-Seq data sets, we identified loss of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) as a candidate contributor to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We used conditional KO mice, scRNA-Seq, lung organoids, small-molecule inhibition, and potentially novel gene manipulation methods to investigate the role of CEBPA in lung fibrosis and repair. Long-term (6 months or more) of Cebpa loss in AT2 cells caused spontaneous fibrosis and increased susceptibility to bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Cebpa knockout (KO) in these mice significantly decreased AT2 cell numbers in the lung and reduced expression of surfactant homeostasis genes, while increasing inflammatory cell recruitment as well as upregulating S100a8/a9 in AT2 cells. In vivo treatment with an S100A8/A9 inhibitor alleviated experimental lung fibrosis. Restoring CEBPA expression in lung organoids ex vivo and during experimental lung fibrosis in vivo rescued CEBPA deficiency–mediated phenotypes. Our study establishes a direct mechanistic link between CEBPA repression, impaired AT2 cell identity, disrupted tissue homeostasis, and lung fibrosis.">

However, the roles of additional donor and host cells in this process are not fully understood. We conducted multiplexed imaging on 59 biopsies from patients with gastrointestinal GVHD and 10 healthy controls, revealing key pathological changes, including fibrosis, crypt alterations, loss of Paneth cells, accumulation of endocrine cells, and disrupted immune organization, particularly a reduction in IgA-secreting plasma cells. Interestingly, CD8T cells were enriched only in a subset of patients, while others exhibited non-canonical enrichments of macrophages and neutrophils. Post-transplantation time significantly influenced immune composition, with host cells dominating plasma and T cell compartments long after transplantation.

Iron is an essential micronutrient for multiple immunologic processes and nutritional deficiency is a common problem worldwide. Despite its prevalence, the impact of nutritional iron deficiency on the establishment of memory T cell responses is not fully understood. In this study we investigate the impact of nutritional iron deficiency on the generation, phenotype, and function of memory T cell responses using a murine model of dietary iron modulation in the context of influenza infection. Iron deficient mice have decreased systemic iron levels and develop significant anemia. Increased T cell expression of the transferrin receptor (CD71) is seen in iron deficient mice at baseline. During primary influenza infection, iron deficient mice experience increased weight loss and phenotypic evidence of impairments in T cell activation. Following recovery from infection, iron deficient mice generate increased influenza specific memory T cells which exhibit impaired ability to produce IFNγ, most notably within the lung. Importantly, the ability to produce IFNγ and TNFα is not recovered by co-culture with iron replete dendritic cells, suggesting a T cell intrinsic alteration in functional memory formation. Altogether, these results isolate a critical effect of nutritional iron deficiency on T cell memory development and function.">

The underlying causes of IBD are not fully understood, but genetic factors have implicated in genome-wide association studies, including CTLA-4, an essential negative regulator of T cell activation. However, establishing a direct link between CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 knockout mice. In this study, we identified zebrafish Ctla-4 homolog and investigated its role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by generating a Ctla-4-deficient (ctla-4-/-) zebrafish line. These mutant zebrafish exhibit reduced weight, along with impaired epithelial barrier integrity and lymphocytic infiltration in their intestines. Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation-related genes, disturbing immune system homeostasis. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated increased Th2 cells and interleukin 13 expression, along with decreased innate lymphoid cells and upregulated proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited reduced diversity and an altered composition of the intestinal microbiota. All these phenotypes closely resemble those found in mammalian IBD. Lastly, supplementation with Ctla-4-Ig successfully alleviated intestinal inflammation in these mutants. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the pivotal role of Ctla-4 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Additionally, they offer substantial evidence linking CTLA-4 to IBD and establish a novel zebrafish model for investigating both the pathogenesis and potential treatments.">

Cytokines and chemokines are cell signaling proteins used by immune cells to communicate with each other as well as with other cell types in the body. These proteins control systemic and local immune responses and levels of cytokines/chemokines in the TME have been associated with tumor outcomes. However, cytokines and chemokines have varied expression across cell types, tumors, and host conditions. Therefore, approaches to effectively study the production of these proteins at the single-cell level in the TME are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms governing the anti-cancer immune response. Here, we detail a protocol to assess the production of cytokines/chemokines across leukocyte populations in mouse tumors using RNA flow cytometry. Importantly, this method can be adapted with minimal changes to study various mouse and human tumors, other RNA analytes, and non-tumor tissues. With this approach, we characterize single-cell production of Ifnb1, Xcl1 and Ccl5 in mouse tumors and identify monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages as the main producers of type I interferon transcript Ifnb1 consistent across 4 different syngeneic tumor models.">

        <tr id="Background In some patients, persistent gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea occur as part of long COVID-19 syndrome following acute respiratory symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2. However, the characteristics of immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract of COVID-19 patients and their association with these symptoms remain unclear. Methodology Data were collected from 95 COVID-19 patients. Among this cohort, 11 patients who exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms and underwent gastroscopy were selected. Using imaging mass cytometry, the gastrointestinal tissues of these patients were thoroughly analyzed to identify immune cell subgroups and investigate their spatial distribution. Results Significant acute inflammatory responses were found in the gastrointestinal tissues, particularly in the duodenum, of COVID-19 patients. These alterations included an increase in the levels of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+CD4+ T-cells, which was more pronounced in tissues with nucleocapsid protein (NP). The amount of CD68+ macrophages positively correlates with the number of CD3+CD4+ T-cells (R = 0.783, p < 0.001), additionally, spatial neighborhood analysis uncovered decreased interactions between CD68+ macrophages and multiple immune cells were noted in NP-positive tissues. Furthermore, weighted gene coexpression network analysis was employed to extract gene signatures related to clinical features and immune responses from the RNA-seq data derived from gastrointestinal tissues from COVID-19 patients, and we validated that the MEgreen module shown positive correlation with clinical parameter (i.e., Total bilirubin, ALT, AST) and macrophages (R = 0.84, p = 0.001), but negatively correlated with CD4+ T cells (R = −0.62, p = 0.004). By contrast, the MEblue module was inversely associated with macrophages and positively related with CD4+ T cells. Gene function enrichment analyses revealed that the MEgreen module is closely associated with biological processes such as immune response activation, signal transduction, and chemotaxis regulation, indicating its role in the gastrointestinal inflammatory response. Conclusion The findings of this study highlight the role of specific immune cell groups in the gastrointestinal inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. Gene coexpression network analysis further emphasized the importance of the gene modules in gastrointestinal immune responses, providing potential molecular targets for the treatment of COVID-19-related gastrointestinal symptoms.">

Unresolved inflammation can lead to liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is influenced by various immune cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which exhibit both innate and adaptive immunity traits. Here, we examined iNKT cell dynamics in a diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in iNKT cell numbers in HCC livers due to apoptosis and impaired cytokine production. CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, displayed delayed tumor initiation and lower tumor and foci number. However, these tumors were larger in size and characterized by enhanced proliferation and immunosuppression. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of healthy iNKT cells post-tumor establishment reduced tumor burden, highlighting their potential therapeutic role. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells contribute to early HCC development, while in later stages they help to control tumor growth, thus underscoring their complex role in liver carcinogenesis. Further understanding of iNKT cell functions may inform novel immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC management.">

In this study, we report the novel finding that co-infection with influenza/A/X31 protects mice from death by Plasmodium berghei NK65-Edinburgh, a model of severe malarial pulmonary leak which underpins malaria-associated acute lung injury (MA-ALI) and malaria-associated acute respiratory distress (MA-ARDS). Co-infected mice exhibit equivalent parasitemia as mice with malaria only, suggesting that the survival phenotype is due to differences in immune kinetics. We demonstrated that the pulmonary leak typical of PbE is attenuated in co-infected mice without alteration in CD8 T cell activation and recruitment to the lung. Upon further examination of the immune response to influenza/A/X31 we identified a population of arginase 1-expressing alveolar macrophages that traffic to the lungs early during infection. In vitro these macrophages inhibit CD8 T cell activation and proliferation better than non-arginase expressing cells. Removal of arginase-1 expressing alveolar macrophages in vivo via administration of the antimetabolite gemcitabine removed the protective effects of influenza/A/X31co-infection on MA-ALI. This study opens a route to better understanding of how to modulate the immunopathology observed in pulmonary leak associated with severe malaria, which must be achieved to rationally design therapeutic interventions for MA-ARDS / MA-ALI.">

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which boosts the anti-tumor immune response by inhibiting negative regulators of T cell activation1–3, is remarkably successful in a subset of cancer patients, yet a significant proportion do not respond to treatment, emphasizing the need to understand factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy of ICB4–9. The gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a critical determinant of immune function and response to cancer immunotherapy, with multiple studies demonstrating association of microbiota composition with clinical response10–16. However, a mechanistic understanding of how gut commensal bacteria influence the efficacy of ICB remains elusive. Here we utilized a gut commensal microorganism, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induces an antigen-specific Th17 cell effector program17, to investigate how colonization with it affects the efficacy of ICB in restraining distal growth of tumors sharing antigen with SFB. We find that anti-PD-1 treatment effectively inhibits the growth of implanted SFB antigen-expressing melanoma only if mice are colonized with SFB. Through T cell receptor clonal lineage tracing, fate mapping, and peptide-MHC tetramer staining, we identify tumor-associated SFB-specific Th1-like cells derived from the homeostatic Th17 cells induced by SFB colonization in the small intestine lamina propria. These gut-educated ex-Th17 cells produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, and promote expansion and effector functions of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby controlling tumor growth. A better understanding of how distinct intestinal commensal microbes can promote T cell plasticity-dependent responses against antigen-sharing tumors may allow for the design of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.">

The fitness of the involved cells is constrained by their replicative potential, which is reflected in the cellular telomere content. Method We apply TelomereHunter to scATAC-seq data to determine telomere content on single-cell level, in a hematopoietic dataset consisting of 35,139 cells from samples of basal cell carcinoma patients receiving programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade treatment. Integrating information from open-chromatin-based signatures to assess cell identity, we characterize the heterogeneity of telomere length for individual cell populations pre- and post-immunotherapy. Results The extracted telomeric reads reflect the expected telomereome-to-genome fraction. Telomere content distributions differ significantly between cell populations, and the median telomere content in intermediate and terminal exhausted CD8+ T-cells pre-treatment is significantly correlated to response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Likewise, telomere content correlates with post-treatment cell proliferation in terminally exhausted and T follicular helper cells from responding patients. Conclusion Telomere content measurement from scATAC-seq data has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to detect significant differences between cell types. Furthermore, the telomere content of CD8+ exhausted T-cells pre-treatment is a putative biomarker for successful PD-1-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Venous thromboembolism is common in individuals with chronic inflammatory diseases, but the pathogenic basis for this increased thrombotic risk remains poorly understood. Myeloid cell ‘trained immunity’ describes persistent innate immune cell memory arising from prior exposure to an inflammatory stimulus, leading to an enhanced immune response to subsequent unrelated stimuli. We identify enhanced myeloid cell prothrombotic activity as a novel maladaptive consequence of trained immunity. LPS stimulation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages trained previously with either β-glucan or free haem exhibited significantly enhanced procoagulant and antifibrinolytic gene expression and activity compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone. The β-glucan training-mediated increase in activated myeloid cell procoagulant activity was mediated by enhanced acid sphingomyelinase-mediated tissue factor (TF) functional decryption. Furthermore, pre-treatment with methyltransferase and acetyltransferase inhibitors to erase epigenetic marks associated with innate immune memory diminished trained macrophage TF gene expression in β-glucan-trained macrophages. Functional analysis of splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan-trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Remarkably, monocyte procoagulant activity increased proportionately with time since β-glucan administration, before plateauing at 4 weeks. Furthermore, haematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid isolated from β-glucan-trained mice possessed enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice. Trained immunity and associated metabolic perturbations may therefore represent novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in immunothrombotic disease development, opening new avenues for targeted intervention.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The interleukin (IL)-1-family receptor antagonist IL-38 has emerged as a negative regulator of auto-inflammation. Given the intricate interplay between antitumor immunity and auto-inflammation, we hypothesized that blocking IL-38 may enhance tumor immune control. Methods Our hypothesis was tested in the transgenic polyoma virus middle T oncoprotein mammary carcinoma model that is suitable for identifying strong immunomodulators. To investigate the effect of acute IL-38 blockade, we used a neutralizing antibody, alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Immune cell composition and location in tumors were determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The role of γδ T cells was studied using an antibody blocking γδ T-cell receptor signaling. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing and RNA expression analysis were employed to determine mechanisms downstream of IL-38 neutralization. Additionally, in vitro assays with γδ T cells, CD8+ T cells and cDC1, followed by in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion, were performed to study the underlying mechanistic pathways. Results Both, genetic ablation of IL-38 and neutralization with the antibody, reduced tumorigenesis, and IL-38 blockade improved chemotherapy efficacy. This was accompanied by an augmented lymphocyte infiltrate dominated by γδ T cells and CD8+ T cells, and signaling through the γδ-T-cell receptor was required for CD8+ T cell infiltration. Rather than directly interacting with CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells recruited conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) into tumors via the chemokine Xcl1. cDC1 in turn activated CD8+ T cells via the Notch pathway. Moreover, IL-38 negatively correlated with cDC1, XCL1-producing γδ T cells, T-cell infiltrates and survival in patients with mammary carcinoma. Conclusions These data suggest that interfering with IL-38 improves antitumor immunity even in immunologically cold tumors.">

        <tr id="Due to the historical dogma, that host defense against intracellular pathogens is mediated by cell-mediated immunity, B cells have been considered unimportant in providing protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and remained understudied for decades. However, emerging evidence suggests a more complex and multifaceted role for B cells in tuberculosis (TB) immunity. They accumulate at the side of infection in both animal models and human TB patients, suggesting a potential link to protective immunity. Still, the diverse roles of B cells in TB immunity continue to be unraveled. Apart from antibodies, B cells produce a wide range of cytokines, which can influence the local immune response. Here we addressed the relevance of interleukin 10 (IL-10) secreting B cells in long-term control of the Mtb Beijing strain HN878. Our research highlights the previously unknown role of B cell-derived IL-10 as a negative regulator of protective immunity in TB. For the first time, we demonstrate that mice lacking B cell-derived IL-10 show increased resistance to aerosol Mtb infection, as evidenced by a delayed onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged survival. Notably, this effect was significantly more pronounced in males compared to females, and was accompanied by male-specific immune alterations, indicating a previously unknown sex-specific regulatory role of B cell-derived IL-10 during Mtb infection.">

        <tr id="Background Increases in GPNMB are detectable in FTD-GRN cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-mortem brain, and brains of aged Grn-deficient mice. Although no upregulation of GPNMB is observed in the brains of young Grn-deficient mice, peripheral immune cells of these mice do exhibit this increase in GPNMB. Importantly, the functional significance of GPNMB upregulation in progranulin-deficient states is currently unknown. Given that GPNMB has been discussed as a potential therapeutic target in GRN-mediated neurodegeneration, it is vital for the field to determine what the normal function of GPNMB is in the immune system, and whether targeting GPNMB will elicit beneficial or deleterious effects. Methods The effects of GPNMB knock-down via antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) were assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 25 neurologically healthy controls (NHCs) and age- and sex-matched FTD-GRN patients, as well as peritoneal macrophages (pMacs) from progranulin-deficient (Grn-/-) and B6 mice. Lysosomal function, antigen presentation and MHC-II processing and recycling were assessed, as well as cytokine release and transcription. Results We demonstrate here that ASO-mediated knockdown of GPNMB increases lysosomal burden and cytokine secretion in FTD-GRN carrier and neurologically healthy controls (NHCs) monocytes. ASO-mediated knockdown of GPNMB in Grn-deficient macrophages decreased lysosomal pan-cathepsin activity and protein degradation. In addition, ASO-mediated knockdown of GPNMB increased MHC-II surface expression, which was driven by decreased MHC-II uptake and recycling, in macrophages from Grn-deficient females. Finally, ASO-mediated knockdown of GPNMB dysregulated IFNγ-stimulated cytokine transcription and secretion by mouse macrophages due to the absence of regulatory actions of the GPNMB extracellular fragment (ECF). Conclusions Our data herein reveals that GPNMB has a regulatory effect on multiple immune effector functions, including capping inflammation and immune responses in myeloid cells via secretion of its ECF. Therefore, in progranulin-deficient states, the drastic upregulation in GPNMB transcript and protein may represent a compensatory mechanism to preserve lysosomal function in myeloid cells. These novel findings indicate that targeted depletion in FTD-GRN would not be a rational therapeutic strategy because it is likely to dysregulate important immune cell effector functions.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key effectors in co-ordinating inflammatory and immune responses to threats to the host. How macrophages decipher diverse danger signals to tailor inflammatory responses remains an unanswered question. Cell volume control is critical for normal cellular function. Disturbances in extracellular and intracellular homeostasis induce changes in cell volume, but the impact of disruptions in cell volume in controlling macrophage inflammatory responses is poorly understood. Here, we discover that macrophages use cell volume control as a bona fide danger sensing mechanism to promote and augment inflammatory responses. Using macrophages deficient in the volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), which lack cell volume control under hypo-osmotic conditions, we show that disruptions in cell volume are sensed by macrophages to drive a large transcriptomic response and induction of inflammation. Cell volume disruption, particularly loss of cell volume control, induces type I interferon signalling through a DNA– and STING-dependent mechanism, but independent of cGAS and 2’3’cGAMP transport. Further, we found that cell volume changes synergise with diverse pathogen-mediated signalling to augment type I interferon responses and exacerbate the cytokine storm in a mouse model of hyperinflammation. Our findings highlight cell volume as an important regulator in shaping inflammatory responses, adding to our understanding of how macrophages sense complex danger signals and threats.">

        <tr id="Objective: The immune response initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is poorly elucidated. We aimed to access and compare the antiviral cellular responses and lymphocytes activation between healthy pregnancies and pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We detected the immunological changes of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of healthy non-pregnant women, non-pregnant women with COVID-19, healthy pregnant women, pregnant women with COVID-19 and convalescent group by flow cytometry. In vitro blockade was used to identify NKT-like cell activation through ICOS-ICOSL pathway. Results: We found that CD3+CD56+ NKT-like cells decreased significantly in COVID-19 positive pregnant women compared to healthy pregnant women. NKT-like cells of pregnant women expressed higher level of activating receptors CD69 and NKp46 after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly, they also increased the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule ICOS. NKT-like cells of pregnant women with COVID-19 up-regulated the expression of IFN-γ, CD107a and Ki67. Meanwhile, we found that ICOSL expression was significantly increased on pDCs in pregnant women with COVID-19. Blocking ICOS in vitro significantly decreased the antiviral activity of NKT-like cells in COVID-19 positive pregnant women, suggesting that ICOS-ICOSL may play an important role in the virus clearance by NKT-like cells. Conclusions: During SARS-CoV-2 infection, NKT-like cells of pregnant women activated through ICOS-ICOSL pathway and played an important role in the antiviral response.">

        <tr id="The ability of an organism to overcome infectious diseases has traditionally been linked to killing invading pathogens. Accumulating evidence, however, indicates that, apart from restricting pathogen loads, organismal survival is coupled to an additional yet poorly understood mechanism called disease tolerance. Here we report that p16High immune cells play a key role in establishing disease tolerance. We found that the FDA-approved BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is a potent and rapid inducer of p16High immune subsets both in mice and humans. In turn, p16High immune cells were indispensable for counteracting different lethal conditions, including LPS-induced sepsis, acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and ionizing irradiation. Mechanistically, we propose that activation of TLR7 or a low physiological activity of STING is sufficient to induce p16High immune subset that, in turn, establishes a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance. Furthermore, containing these signals within a beneficial range by deleting MDA5 that appeared sufficient to maintain a low activity of STING, induces p16High immune cells and delays organ deterioration upon aging with improved healthspan. Our data highlight the beneficial role of p16High immune subsets in establishing a low adenosine environment and disease tolerance.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against β-coronaviruses (β-CoVs), a family of viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2. Viral sensing via pattern recognition receptors triggers inflammation and cell death, which are essential components of the innate immune response that facilitate viral clearance. However, excessive activation of the innate immune system and inflammatory cell death can result in uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in cytokine storm and pathology. PANoptosis, innate immune, inflammatory cell death initiated by innate immune sensors and driven by caspases and RIPKs through PANoptosome complexes, has been implicated in the pathology of viral infections. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PANoptosis in response to β-CoV infection is critical for identifying new therapeutic targets that can mitigate disease severity. In the current study, we analyzed findings from a cell death-based CRISPR screen with archetypal β-CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as the trigger to characterize host molecules required for inflammatory cell death. As a result, we identified SMARCA4, a chromatin regulator, as a putative host factor required for PANoptosis in response to MHV. Furthermore, we observed that gRNA-mediated deletion of Smarca4 inhibited MHV-induced PANoptotic cell death in macrophages. These findings have potential translational and clinical implications for the advancement of treatment strategies for β-CoVs and other infections.">

        <tr id="In sepsis, the liver functions as a central filter organ, where hepatic macrophages form a primary antimicrobial defense layer by eliminating bacteria and regulating immune responses. Therefore, precise regulation of the immune response in hepatic macrophages is crucial for triggering effective defense mechanisms. We aim to modulate the defense immune response by delivering transcription factor HIF1α, a key regulator of monocyte/macrophage reprogramming in sepsis. Transcription factors are promising candidates because they dynamically modulate gene expression across diverse conditions, though delivering them remains challenging. In this study, we suggest a novel method for loading HIF1α into extracellular vesicles (EVs) to enhance immune defense and resolve sepsis. By delivering HIF1α to macrophages during sepsis, we promoted the differentiation of Nr1h3-dependent pro-efferocytic MoMFs and C/ebpβ-dependent pro-survival MoMFs. Pro-efferocytic MoMFs eliminate damaged hepatocytes and immune cells and pro-survival MoMFs withstand inflammatory conditions and trigger innate memory responses. Particularly, the zonation of these macrophages in the periportal region ensures effective pathogen clearance and minimizes tissue damage. These findings suggest that EV-mediated HIF1α delivery could be a promising therapeutic option for managing sepsis.">

We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), an enzyme implicated in inflammatory pathways in β cells and macrophages, using a mouse model in which the endogenous mouse Alox15 gene is replaced by the human ALOX12 gene. Our findings demonstrate that VLX-1005, a potent 12-LOX inhibitor, effectively delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes in human gene replacement non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. By spatial proteomics analysis, VLX-1005 treatment resulted in marked reductions in infiltrating T and B cells and macrophages with accompanying increases in immune checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and PD-1, suggesting a shift towards an immune-suppressive microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of isolated islets from inhibitor-treated mice revealed significant alteration of cytokine-responsive pathways. RNA sequencing of polarized proinflammatory macrophages showed that VLX-1005 significantly reduced the interferon response. Our studies demonstrate that the ALOX12 human replacement gene mouse provides a platform for the preclinical evaluation of LOX inhibitors and supports VLX-1005 as an inhibitor of human 12-LOX that engages the enzymatic target and alters the inflammatory phenotypes of islets and macrophages to promote the delay of autoimmune diabetes.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Stem-like progenitors are a critical subset of cytotoxic T cells that self-renew and give rise to expanded populations of effector cells critical for successful checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Emerging evidence suggests that the tumor-draining lymph nodes can support the continuous generation of these stem-like cells that replenish the tumor sites and act as a critical source of expanded effector populations, underlining the importance of understanding what factors promote and maintain activated T cells in the stem-like state. Using advanced 3D multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, here we identified antigen-presentation niches in tumor-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance, and affinity evolution of a unique population of TCF-1+PD-1+SLAMF6hi stem-like CD8+ T cells. Our results show that contrary to the prevailing view that persistent TCR signaling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement well beyond the initial priming phase sustained the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway plays a central role in this process by mediating the fine-tuning of TCR and co-stimulatory signal input that enables selective expansion of high affinity TCR stem-like clones, enabling them to act as a renewable source of high affinity effector cells. PD-1 checkpoint blockade disrupts this fine tuning of input signaling, leading to terminal differentiation to the effector state or death of the most avid anti-tumor stem-like cells. Our results thus reveal an unexpected relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative feedback regulatory loop, and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumor effect that comes at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high affinity stem-like precursors.">

T cells are major IL-32 producers in these diseases and key mediators of pathogen and tumor elimination but also autoimmune destruction. However, their contribution to IL-32 biology during immune responses is hardly understood due to several isoforms with divergent inflammatory properties. Here, we identified IL-32β as the predominant isoform in various T cell subsets of healthy individuals and breast cancer patients with the highest levels detected in intratumoral regulatory T cells. We show that IL-32β is induced by IL-2 but IL-32β release requires T Cell Receptor rather than IL2R stimulation. Using inhibitors of protein secretion pathways and serial (ultra)centrifugation of T cell supernatants, we demonstrate that T cells actively secrete IL-32β unconventionally, as a free protein and, to a minor degree, through exosomes. Thus, our data identify activated T cells as major IL-32β secretors in health and cancer.">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) act as gatekeepers of the lung's immune responses, serving essential roles in recognizing and eliminating pathogens. The transcription factor (TF) Early Growth Response 2 (EGR2) has been recently described as required for mature AMs in mice; however, its mechanisms of action have not been explored. Here, we identified EGR2 as an epigenomic regulator and likely direct proximal transcriptional activator in AMs using epigenomic approaches (RNA-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and CUT&RUN). The predicted direct proximal targets of EGR2 included a subset of AM identity genes, and ones related to pathogen recognition, phagosome maturation, and adhesion, such as Clec7a, Atp6v0d2, Itgb2, Rhoc, and Tmsb10. We provided evidence that EGR2 deficiency led to impaired zymosan internalization and reduced the capacity to respond to Aspergillus fumigatus. Mechanistically, the lack of EGR2 altered the transcriptional response, secreted cytokines (i.e., CXCL11), and inflammation-resolving lipid mediators (i.e., RvE1) of AMs during in vivo zymosan-induced inflammation, which manifested in impaired resolution. Our findings demonstrated that EGR2 is a key proximal transcriptional activator and epigenomic bookmarker in AMs responsible for select, distinct components of cell identity and a protective transcriptional and epigenomic program against fungi.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells often become dysfunctional during tumor progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain unclear. To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs.">

        <tr id="The gastrointestinal tract is continuously exposed to foreign antigens in food and commensal microbes with potential to induce adaptive immune responses. Peripherally induced T regulatory (pTreg) cells are essential for mitigating inflammatory responses to these agents1–4. While RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells (RORγt-APCs) were shown to program gut microbiota-specific pTregs5–7, understanding of their characteristics remains incomplete, and the APC subset responsible for food tolerance has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that RORγt-APCs are similarly required for differentiation of food antigen-specific pTregs and establishment of oral tolerance. The ability of these cells to direct both food and microbiota-specific pTreg cell differentiation is contingent on expression of RORγt and on a unique cis-regulatory element within the Rorc gene locus (Rorc(t) +7kb). Absent this +7kb element, there was a notable increase in food antigen-specific T helper 2 (Th2) cells in lieu of pTregs, leading to compromised tolerance in a mouse asthma model. By employing single-cell analyses across these models, as well as freshly resected mesenteric lymph nodes from a human organ donor, we identified a rare subset of evolutionarily conserved APCs that are dependent on RORγt, uniquely express the Prdm16 transcription factor, and are endowed with essential mediators for inducing pTreg cell differentiation. Our findings suggest that a better understanding of how RORγt-APCs develop and how they regulate T cell responses to food and microbial antigens could offer new insights into developing therapeutic strategies for autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as organ transplant tolerance.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) show signs of low-grade inflammation, which is related to the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the underlying triggers remain unknown. The gut microbiota is a plausible source as it comprises pro-inflammatory bacteria, bacterial metabolites and viruses, including (bacterio)phages. These prokaryotic viruses have been shown to mediate inflammatory responses in gastrointestinal disease. Given the differences in phage populations in healthy individuals versus those with cardiometabolic diseases such as T2D, we here questioned whether phages from T2D individuals would have increased immunogenic potential. To address this, we isolated intestinal phages from a fresh stool sample of healthy controls and individuals with newly diagnosed, treatment-naive T2D. Phages were purified using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation and incubated with healthy donor dendritic cells (DCs) and autologous T cells. Donors with T2D had slightly higher free viral particle numbers compared to healthy controls (p = .1972), which has been previously associated with disease states. Further, phages from T2D induced a higher inflammatory response in DCs and T cells than phages from HC. For example, the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on DCs (p < .001) and interferon-y secretion from T cells (p < .01) were increased when comparing the two groups. These results suggest that phages might play a role in low-grade inflammation in T2D individuals.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath, leading to irreversible and progressive functional deficits in patients. Pre-clinical studies involving the use of neural stem cells (NSCs) have already demonstrated their potential in neuronal regeneration and remyelination. However, the exclusive application of cell therapy has not proved sufficient to achieve satisfactory therapeutic levels. Recognizing these limitations, there is a need to combine cell therapy with other adjuvant protocols. In this context, extracellular vesicles (EVs) can contribute to intercellular communication, stimulating the production of proteins and lipids associated with remyelination and providing trophic support to axons. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of NSCs and EVs derived from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. OPCs were differentiated from NSCs and had their identity confirmed by gene expression analysis and immunocytochemistry. Exosomes were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and characterized by Western, transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Experimental therapy of C57BL/6 mice induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were grouped in control, treated with NSCs, treated with OPC-derived EVs and treated with a combination of both. The treatments were evaluated clinically using scores and body weight, microscopically using immunohistochemistry and immunological profile by flow cytometry. The animals showed significant clinical improvement and weight gain with the treatments. However, only the treatments involving EVs led to immune modulation, changing the profile from Th1 to Th2 lymphocytes. Fifteen days after treatment revealed a reduction in reactive microgliosis and astrogliosis in the groups treated with EVs. However, there was no reduction in demyelination. The results indicate the potential therapeutic use of OPC-derived EVs to attenuate inflammation and promote recovery in EAE, especially when combined with cell therapy.">

Adoptive transfer of naïve adult T cells into neonates did not protect due to a blockade of CD8 but not of CD4 effector T cell differentiation. Early-life deficiency of critical signal 3 cytokines during T cell priming resulted in the appearance of non-cytotoxic CD8 effector T cells whereas the effector phase of adult-primed T cells was not disrupted in neonates. Accordingly, we found an overall low number of antiviral human CD8 T cells in newborns with congenital CMV. Together, this study suggests defective CD8 T cell immunity as an important factor explaining the higher risk for CMV disease in the early-life phase.">

        <tr id="Radiotherapy (RT) serves as the primary treatment for solid tumors. Its potential to incite an immune response against tumors both locally and distally profoundly impacts clinical outcomes. However, RT may also promote the accumulation of immunosuppressive cytokines and immunosuppressive cells, greatly impeding the activation of antitumor immune responses and substantially limiting the effectiveness of RT. Therefore, regulating post-RT immunosuppression to steer the immune milieu toward heightened activation potentially enhances RT’s therapeutic potential. Cytokines, potent orchestrators of diverse cellular responses, play a pivotal role in regulating this immunosuppressive response. Identifying and promptly neutralizing early released immunosuppressive cytokines are a crucial development in augmenting RT’s immunomodulatory effects. To this end, we conducted a screen of immunosuppressive cytokines following RT and identified macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) as an early up-regulated and persistent immune suppressor. Single-cell sequencing revealed that the main source of up-regulated MCSF derived from tumor cells. Mechanistic exploration revealed that irradiation-dependent phosphorylation of the p65 protein facilitated its binding to the MCSF gene promoter, enhancing transcription. Knockdown and chemical inhibitor experiments conclusively demonstrated that suppressing tumor cell-derived MCSF amplifies RT’s immune-activating effects, with optimal results achieved by early MCSF blockade after irradiation. Additionally, we validated that MCSF acted on macrophages, inducing the secretion of a large number of inhibitory cytokines. In summary, we propose a novel approach to enhance the immune activation effects of RT by blocking the MCSF-CSF1R signaling pathway early after irradiation.">

However, Th2 responses are notably absent from known host-microbiota intestinal immune circuits. Notably, the commensal protist Tritrichomonas induces a transient innate ILC2 circuit rather than a chronic Th2 circuit. Canonical Th2 responses rely on the induction of IL-4 production by innate cells. This study shows that the absence of Tet2, a DNA demethylase, reprograms naïve T cells to autonomously produce IL-4 upon T cell receptor stimulation, bypassing the need for IL-4 from innate cells for Th2 differentiation. Loss of this checkpoint induces chronic Th2 responses to Tritrichomonas, associated with IL-25-dependent barrier dysfunction and increased susceptibility to allergic pathology in response to dietary antigens. Sentence Summary Regulation of cell autonomous IL-4 in T cells is critical to prevent dysregulated Th2 immunity to commensals and predisposition to allergy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Perivascular macrophages (PVMs) and, to a lesser degree, microglia are targets and reservoirs of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in the brain. Previously, we demonstrated that colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) in PVMs was upregulated and activated in chronically SIV-infected rhesus macaques with encephalitis, correlating with SIV infection of PVMs. Herein, we investigated the role of CSF1R in the brain during acute SIV infection using BLZ945, a brain-penetrant CSF1R kinase inhibitor. Apart from three uninfected historic controls, nine Indian rhesus macaques were infected acutely with SIVmac251 and divided into three groups (n = 3 each): an untreated control and two groups treated for 20–30 days with low- (10 mg/kg/day) or high- (30 mg/kg/day) dose BLZ945. With the high-dose BLZ945 treatment, there was a significant reduction in cells expressing CD163 and CD206 across all four brain areas examined, compared with the low-dose treatment and control groups. In 9 of 11 tested regions, tissue viral DNA (vDNA) loads were reduced by 95%–99% following at least one of the two doses, and even to undetectable levels in some instances. Decreased numbers of CD163+ and CD206+ cells correlated significantly with lower levels of vDNA in all four corresponding brain areas. In contrast, BLZ945 treatment did not significantly affect the number of microglia. Our results indicate that doses as low as 10 mg/kg/day of BLZ945 are sufficient to reduce the tissue vDNA loads in the brain with no apparent adverse effect. This study provides evidence that infected PVMs are highly sensitive to CSF1R inhibition, opening new possibilities to achieve viral clearance.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Human and mouse natural killer (NK) cells have been shown to develop memory-like function after short-term exposure to the cocktail of IL-12/15/18 or to overnight co-culture with some tumor cell lines. The resulting cells retain enhanced lytic ability for up to 7 days as well as after cryopreservation, and memory-like NK cells (mlNK) have been shown to induce complete remissions in patients with hematological malignancies. No single phenotype has been described for mlNK and the physiological changes induced by the short-term cytokine or tumor-priming which are responsible for these enhanced functions have not been fully characterized. Here, we have generated mlNK by cytokine and tumor-priming to find commonalities to better define the nature of NK cell “memory” in vitro and, for the first time, in vivo. Methods We initiated mlNK in vitro from healthy donors with cytokines (initiated cytokine-induced memory-like (iCIML)-NK) and by tumor priming (TpNK) overnight and compared them by high-dimensional flow cytometry, proteomic and metabolomic profiling. As a potential mechanism of enhanced cytolytic function, we analyzed the avidity of binding of the mlNK to NK-resistant tumors (z-Movi). We generated TpNK from healthy donors and from cancer patients to determine whether mlNK generated by interaction with a single tumor type could enhance lytic activity. Finally, we used a replication-incompetent tumor cell line (INKmune) to treat patients with myeloid leukaemias to potentiate NK cell function in vivo. Results Tumor-primed mlNK from healthy donors and patients with cancer showed increased cytotoxicity against multiple tumor cell lines in vitro, analogous to iCIML-NK cells. Multidimensional cytometry identified distinct memory-like profiles of subsets of cells with memory-like characteristics; upregulation of CD57, CD69, CD25 and ICAM1. Proteomic profiling identified 41 proteins restricted to mlNK cells and we identified candidate molecules for the basis of NK memory which can explain how mlNK overcome inhibition by resistant tumors. Finally, of five patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or refractory acute myeloid leukemia treated with INKmune, three responded to treatment with measurable increases in NK lytic function and systemic cytokines. Conclusions NK cell “memory” is a physiological state associated with resistance to MHC-mediated inhibition, increased metabolic function, mitochondrial fitness and avidity to NK-resistant target cells.">

Interleukin-33 promotes the expansion of tissue-resident Tregs and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s); however, how Tregs locally coordinate their function within the inflammatory niche is not understood. Here, we show that ILC2s are critical orchestrators of Treg function. Using spatial, cellular, and molecular profiling of the type 2 inflamed niche, we found that ILC2s and Tregs engage in a direct (OX40L-OX40) and chemotaxis-dependent (CCL1-CCR8) cellular dialogue that enforces the local accumulation of Gata3high Tregs, which are transcriptionally and functionally adapted to the type 2 environment. Genetic interruption of ILC2-Treg communication resulted in uncontrolled type 2 lung inflammation after allergen exposure. Mechanistically, we found that Gata3high Tregs can modulate the local bioavailability of the costimulatory molecule OX40L, which subsequently controlled effector memory T helper 2 cell numbers. Hence, ILC2-Treg interactions represent a critical feedback mechanism to control adaptive type 2 immunity. Treg-mediated constraint of adaptive type 2 inflammation is contingent on local dialogue with ILC2. Editor’s summary Regulatory T cells (Tregs) maintain the balance between protective and harmful inflammation, yet the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated restraint of type 2 immunity remain to be determined. Stockis et al. investigate how cross-talk between ILC2) and Tregs constrains adaptive type 2 immunity in mice. ILC2 were required for the expansion of tissue-resident Gata3high Tregs after IL-33 exposure. These Gata3high Tregs directly controlled the availability of the costimulatory molecule OX40L on ILC2, which facilitated the expansion of effector memory TH2 cells and promoted type 2 airway inflammation. These findings identify that ILC2 locally regulate both effector and regulatory T cells during type 2 inflammation. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant aggravating factor in individuals living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for TB, and HIV-1 target macrophages. Understanding how Mtb subverts these cells may facilitate the identification of new druggable targets. Here, we explored how TB can induce macrophages to form tunneling nanotubes (TNT), promoting HIV-1 spread. We found that TB triggers metabolic rewiring of macrophages, increasing their glycolytic ATP production. Using pharmacological inhibitors and glucose deprivation, we discovered that disrupting aerobic glycolysis significantly reduces HIV-1 exacerbation in these macrophages. Glycolysis is essential for tunneling nanotubes (TNT) formation, which facilitates viral transfer and cell-to-cell fusion and induces the expression of the sialoadhesin Siglec-1, enhancing both HIV-1 binding and TNT stabilization. Glycolysis did not exacerbate HIV-1 infection when TNT formation was pharmacologically prevented, indicating that higher metabolic activity is not sufficient per se to make macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1. Overall, these data might facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting glycolytic activity in TB-induced immunomodulatory macrophages to ultimately halt HIV-1 dissemination in co-infected patients.">

        <tr id="Biliary atresia (BA) is a leading cause of liver failure in infants. Despite effective surgical drainage, patients with BA exhibit attenuated immune responses to childhood vaccines, suggesting there are long-lasting alterations to immune function. The perinatal liver is home to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and serves as the epicenter for rapidly progressive and significantly morbid inflammatory diseases like BA. We have previously established the role of neonatal myeloid progenitors in the pathogenesis of perinatal liver inflammation (PLI) and hypothesize that PLI leads to long-term changes to HSPCs in mice that recovered from PLI. To test this hypothesis, we compared the changes that occur to HSPCs and mature myeloid populations in the bone marrow of adult mice during homeostasis and during PLI. Our results demonstrate that HSPCs from animals that recover from PLI (“PLI-recovered”) undergo long-term expansion with a reduced proliferative capacity. Notably, PLI leads to persistent activation of common myeloid progenitors through the involvement of CXCL10 and its canonical receptor, CXCR3. Our data suggests that the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis may mediate the changes in HSPCs that lead to altered immune function observed in BA, providing support for a targetable pathway to mitigate the detrimental long-term immune effects observed in patients with BA.">

        <tr id="Liver fibrosis associated with increased mortality is caused by activation of hepatic stellate cells and excessive production and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to fibrotic insults. It has been shown that in addition to liver inflammation, systemic inflammation also contributes to liver fibrogenesis. A deeper understanding of mechanisms that control liver fibrotic response to intra- and extra-hepatic inflammation is essential to develop novel clinical strategies against this disease. Extracellular vesicles (EV) have been recognized as immune mediators that facilitate activation of hepatic stellate cells. In inflammatory diseases, activated neutrophils release neutrophil elastase (NE) bound to EV, which has been identified as a significant contributor to inflammation by promoting immune cell activation. Here, we aimed to explore the role of inflammation derived plasma EV-associated NE in liver fibrogenesis and its potential mechanisms. We show EV-associated NE induces activation, proliferation and migration of hepatic stellate cells by promoting activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This effect did not occur through EV without surface NE, and Sivelestat, a NE inhibitor, inhibited activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway mediated by EV-associated NE. Moreover, we found plasma EV-associated NE increases deposition of collagen1 and α-smooth muscle actin in the liver of a mouse model of liver fibrosis (Mdr2-/-). Notably, this effect does not occur in control mice without preexisting liver disease. These data suggest that EV-associated NE is a pro-fibrogenic factor for hepatic stellate cell activation via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway in pre-existing liver injuries. Inhibition of the plasma EV-associated NE in inflammatory conditions may be a therapeutic target for liver fibrosis in patients with inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="NKT cells are innate-like T cells, recruited to the skin during viral infection, yet their contributions to long-term immune memory to viruses are unclear. We identified granzyme K, a product made by cytotoxic cells including NKT cells, is linked to induction of Th1-associated antibodies during primary dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. We examined the role of NKT cells in vivo using DENV-infected mice lacking CD1d-dependent (CD1ddep) NKT cells. In CD1d-KO mice, Th1-polarized immunity and infection resolution were impaired, which was dependent on intrinsic NKT cell production of IFN-γ, since it was restored by adoptive transfer of WT but not IFN-γ-KO NKT cells. Furthermore, NKT cell deficiency triggered immune bias, resulting in higher levels of Th2-associated IgG1 than Th1-associated IgG2a, which failed to protect against a homologous DENV re-challenge and promoted antibody-dependent enhanced disease during secondary heterologous infections. Similarly, Th2-immunity, typified by a higher IgG4:IgG3 ratio, was associated with worsened human disease severity during secondary infections. Thus, CD1ddep NKT cells establish Th1 polarity during the early innate response to DENV, which promotes infection resolution, memory formation and long-term protection from secondary homologous and heterologous infections. These observations illustrate how early innate immune responses during primary infections can influence secondary infection outcomes.">

However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Given the involvement of the CD27 pathway in the pathophysiology of various T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory, autoimmune, and lymphoproliferative diseases, we examined the impact of AZM on CD27 regulation and potential consequences on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotypes. Using cellular immunology approaches on healthy donors’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we demonstrate AZM-mediated downregulation of surface CD27 expression as well as its extracellular release as soluble CD27. Notably, AZM-exposed CD27high (hi) cells were defective in their ability to expand compared to CD27intermediate (Int) and CD27low (lo) subsets. The defective CD27hi subset expansion was found to be associated with impaired cell proliferation and cell division. At the molecular level, the CD27hi subset exhibited lower mTOR activity than other subsets. Functionally, AZM treatment resulted in marked depletion of helper CD4+ (Th1) and cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte (Tc1)-associated CXCR3+CD27hi effector cells and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ production. These findings provide mechanistic insights on immunomodulatory features of AZM on T-lymphocyte by altering the CD27 pathway. From a clinical perspective, this study also sheds light on potential clinical benefits observed in patients on prophylactic AZM regimens against various respiratory diseases and opens avenues for future adjunct therapy against Th1- and Tc1-dominated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Immune-surveillance depends in part on the recognition of peptide variants by T cell antigen receptors. Given that both normal B cells and malignant B cells accumulate mutations we chose a murine model of multiple myeloma to test conditions to induce cell-mediated immunity targeting malignant plasma cell (PC) clones but sparing of normal PCs. Revealing a novel function for intracellular C3d, we discovered that C3d engaged T cell responses against malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow of mice that had developed multiple myeloma spontaneously. Our results show that C3d internalized by cells augments immune surveillance by several mechanisms. In one, C3d induces a master transcription regulator, E2f1, to increase the expression of long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, to generate peptides for MHC-I presentation and increase MHC-I expression. In another, C3d increases expression of RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins linked to processing of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) that arise from non-canonical translation and known to promote immunosurveillance. Cancer cells are uniquely susceptible to increased expression and presentation of mutant peptides given the extent of protein misfolding and accumulation of somatic mutations. Accordingly, although C3d can be internalized by any cell, C3d preferentially targets malignant clones by evoking specific T cell mediated immunity (CMI) and sparing most non-transformed polyclonal B cells and plasma cells with lower mutation loads. Malignant plasma cell deletion was blocked by cyclosporin or by CD8 depletion confirming that endogenous T cells mediated malignant clone clearance. Besides the potential for therapeutic application our results highlight how intracellular C3d modifies cellular metabolism to augment immune surveillance. One Sentence Summary We show that intracellular soluble fragment 3d of complement (C3d) induces regression of spontaneous multiple myeloma in mice reducing tumor burden by 10 fold, after 8 weeks. C3d enables cell-mediated immunity to target multiple myeloma clones sparing non-transformed polyclonal B cells and plasma cells with lower mutation loads. We show that C3d increases the expression of ribosomal subunits associated with the translation of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). C3d also decreases expression of protein arginine methyl transferase (PRMT) 5 which in turn relieves E2f1 repression increasing the expression of Lnc RNAs and derived peptides that evoke anti-tumor cellular immunity. The approach increases MHC-I expression by tumor cells and generates a CMI response that overcomes tumor immune-evasion strategies. Significance Tumors are immunogenic in part because of somatic mutations that originate novel peptides that once presented on MHC engage cell-mediated immunity (CMI). However, in spite of the higher mutation load most tumors evade immunity. We discovered that a component of the complement system (C3d) overcomes tumor immune evasion by augmenting expression of ribosomal proteins and lncRNAs linked to the presentation of novel peptides by tumor cells. C3d induced CMI targets cancer cells sparing non transformed cells uncovering a novel function for complement in immune surveillance.">

Besides its symbiotic lifestyle at the host interface, this commensal yeast has also been associated with diverse inflammatory skin diseases in humans and pet animals. Stable colonization is maintained by antifungal type 17 immunity. The mechanisms driving Th17 responses to Malassezia remain, however, unclear. Here, we show that the C-type lectin receptors Mincle, Dectin-1, and Dectin-2 recognize conserved patterns in the cell wall of Malassezia and induce dendritic cell activation in vitro, while only Dectin-2 is required for Th17 activation during experimental skin colonization in vivo. In contrast, Toll-like receptor recognition was redundant in this context. Instead, inflammatory IL-1 family cytokines signaling via MyD88 were also implicated in Th17 activation in a T cell-intrinsic manner. Taken together, we characterized the pathways contributing to protective immunity against the most abundant member of the skin mycobiome. This knowledge contributes to the understanding of barrier immunity and its regulation by commensals and is relevant considering how aberrant immune responses are associated with severe skin pathologies.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is highly heterogeneous in terms of disease severity and tissue damage extent. Improving myelin restoration is essential to prevent neurodegeneration and the associated disability in MS patients. However, remyelinating therapies are failing in clinical trials, in part, due to the absence of classifying biomarkers of different endogenous regenerative capacities amongst enrolled patients. We previously reported that circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) at the onset of the murine model of MS experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are associated with milder disease courses and less degree of demyelination and axonal damage in spinal cord lesions, while at peak are indicative of a better symptom recovery. Moreover, M-MDSCs are able to promote in vitro oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and differentiation towards mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) through the release of the soluble factor osteopontin. Results Here, we show a relationship between disease severity and a gradient of OPCs between the rim and the core in mixed active-inactive lesions of MS patients, along with a positive correlation between M-MDSC density and OPC abundance in the same lesions. We also show that EAE disease severity negatively influences the density of total and newly generated OPCs found associated to the demyelinated lesions of the spinal cord at the peak of the disease. In addition, disease severity also impacts the abundance of newly generated OLs originated either during the effector phase or during the early recovery phase. We also demonstrate the positive association between infiltrated M-MDSCs and the abundance of OPCs in the periplaque of demyelinating lesions at the peak of EAE. Interestingly, circulating M-MDSCs at EAE onset and peak of the disease are directly associated to a higher density of newly generated OLs in the plaque and periplaque, respectively. Conclusion Disease severity clearly impacts oligodendrocyte generation during a neuroinflammatory insult like EAE. Our results set the basis for further studies on M-MDSCs as a promising new biomarker that identify a CNS prone to the generation of new OLs that may contribute to restore myelin.">

        <tr id="The mechanism by which interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) mutation contributes to lymphomagenesis is unknown. We modeled IRF8 variants in B cell lymphomas and found that they affected the expression of regulators of antigen presentation. Expression of IRF8 mutants in murine B cell lymphomas suppressed CD4, but not CD8, activation elicited by antigen presentation and downmodulated CD74 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DM, intracellular regulators of antigen peptide processing/loading in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II. Concordantly, mutant IRF8 bound less efficiently to the promoters of these genes. Mice harboring IRF8 mutant lymphomas displayed higher tumor burden and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, typified by depletion of CD4, CD8, and natural killer cells, increase in regulatory T cells and T follicular helper cells. Deconvolution of bulk RNA sequencing data from IRF8-mutant human diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) recapitulated part of the immune remodeling detected in mice. We concluded that IRF8 mutations contribute to DLBCL biology by facilitating immune escape.">

        <tr id="Respiratory viral infections pose a significant public health threat, particularly in children and older adults, with high mortality rates. Some of these pathogens are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza viruses (IV), human parvovirus B19 (B19V), and human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1). These viruses cause various respiratory symptoms, including cough, fever, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Notably, these viruses can also impact the central nervous system (CNS), leading to acute manifestations such as seizures, encephalopathies, encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and long-term complications. The precise mechanisms by which these viruses affect the CNS are not fully understood. Glial cells, specifically microglia and astrocytes within the CNS, play pivotal roles in maintaining brain homeostasis and regulating immune responses. Exploring how these cells interact with viral pathogens, such as hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IVs, B19V, and HBoV1, offers crucial insights into the significant impact of respiratory viruses on the CNS. This review article examines hRSV, SARS-CoV-2, IV, B19V, and HBoV1 interactions with microglia and astrocytes, shedding light on potential neurological consequences.">

        <tr id="Aberrant activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway causes autoimmunity in humans and mice; however, the exact mechanism by which the cGAS-STING pathway initiates adaptive immunity and tissue pathology is still not fully understood. Here, we used a cGAS knockin (KI) mouse model that develops systemic autoimmunity. In the lungs of cGAS-KI mice, blood vessels were enclosed by organized lymphoid tissues that resemble tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). Cell-intrinsic cGAS induction promoted up-regulation of CCR5 in CD8+ T cells and led to CCL5 production in vascular endothelial cells. Peripheral CD8+ T cells were recruited to the lungs and produced CXCL13 and interferon-γ. The latter triggered endothelial cell death, potentiated CCL5 production, and was essential for TLS establishment. Blocking CCL5 or CCR5, or depleting CD8+ T cells, impaired TLS formation. cGAS-mediated TLS formation also enhanced humoral and antitumor responses. These data demonstrate that cGAS signaling drives a specialized lymphoid structure that underlies autoimmune tissue pathology. cGAS initiates pulmonary TLS formation, which is dependent on the CCL5-CCR5 axis between endothelial cells and T cells. Editor’s summary Overactivation of the innate immune sensing cGAS-STING pathway can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. To investigate how cGAS hyperactivation drives lung inflammation, Zhao et al. generated a cGAS conditional knockin mouse model. Hyperactivation of cGAS resulted in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the lung, which enhanced antibody responses and antitumor immunity. CCL5-producing endothelial cells in the lung promoted CD8+ T cell recruitment to TLSs via CCR5 signaling, which was induced by T cell–intrinsic cGAS expression. Blocking CCR5/CCL5 impaired TLS formation, suggesting that CCR5/CCL5 could be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity or to enhance antitumor immunity. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus and the leading cause of infectious disease related birth defects worldwide. How the immune response modulates the risk of intrauterine transmission of HCMV after maternal infection remains poorly understood. Maternal T cells likely play a critical role in preventing infection at the maternal-fetal interface and limiting spread across the placenta, but concerns exist that immune responses to infection may also cause placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a guinea pig model of primary cytomegalovirus infection. Monoclonal antibodies specific to guinea pig CD4 and CD8 were used to deplete T cells in non- pregnant and in pregnant guinea pigs after mid-gestation. CD4+ T cell depletion increased the severity of illness, caused significantly elevated viral loads, and increased the rate of congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection relative to animals treated with control antibody. CD8+ T cell depletion was comparably well tolerated and did not significantly affect the weight of infected guinea pigs or viral loads in their blood or tissue. However, significantly more viral genomes and transcripts were detected in the placenta and decidua of CD8+ T cell depleted dams post-infection. This study corroborates earlier findings made in nonhuman primates that maternal CD4+ T cells play a critical role in limiting the severity of primary CMV infection during pregnancy while also revealing that other innate and adaptive immune responses can compensate for an absent CD8+ T cell response in α-CD8-treated guinea pigs. Author Summary Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is a leading cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes and preventable disability in children. Using guinea pigs, a well-established small animal model of congenital infection and intrauterine development, this study tested how depleting T cells affects the course of primary cytomegalovirus infections. Severe illness and high rates of congenital infection were observed when helper CD4+ T cells were depleted. The depletion of killer CD8+ T cells did not affect the severity of disease or the rate of congenital infection but did increase the amount of virus that was detected in the placenta. A greater understanding how an immune response can prevent the infection of the placenta and developing offspring is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic development. This study not only describes a new reagent that can be used to study the guinea pig immune system but also sheds new light in how adaptive immunity regulates congenital viral infection.">

The initial site of virus replication is the mosquito biting site in the host skin, yet the role of host skin bacteria remains unclear. Here, we observed accelerated progression of Zika virus (ZIKV)-induced disease in mice with depleted skin bacteria by topical antibiotic treatment prior to ZIKV infection. Increased viral loads in the blood, draining lymph node, spleen and brain of antibiotic-treated mice suggested faster ZIKV dissemination. Flow cytometry revealed increased frequencies of T cells in the lymph nodes, along with enhanced activation of T cells in the brain upon antibiotic treatment. The antibiotic-induced phenotype was rescued by restoring the skin bacteria prior to infection.

        <tr id="Measles virus (MeV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus transmitted via aerosols. To understand how MeV exits the airways of an infected host, we use unpassaged primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAE). MeV typically remains cell-associated in HAE and forms foci of infection, termed infectious centers, by directly spreading cell-to-cell. We previously described the phenomenon in which infectious centers detach en masse from HAE and remain viable. Here we investigate the mechanism of this cellular detachment. Via immunostaining, we observed loss of tight junction and cell adhesion proteins within infectious centers. These morphological changes indicate activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT can contribute to wound healing in respiratory epithelia by mobilizing nearby cells. Inhibiting TGF-β, and thus EMT, reduced infectious center detachment. Compared to uninfected cells, MeV-infected cells also expressed increased levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a regulator of live cell extrusion. Live cell extrusion encourages cells to detach from respiratory epithelia by contracting the actomyosin of neighboring cells. Inhibition or induction of live cell extrusion impacted infectious center detachment rates. Thus, these two related pathways contributed to infectious center detachment in HAE. Detached infectious centers contained high titers of virus that may be protected from the environment, allowing the virus to live on surfaces longer and infect more hosts. This mechanism may contribute to the highly contagious nature of MeV. IMPORTANCE Measles virus (MeV) is an extremely contagious respiratory pathogen that continues to cause large, disruptive outbreaks each year. Here, we examine a phenomenon that may help explain the contagious nature of MeV: detachment of MeV-infected cells. MeV spreads cell-to-cell in human airway epithelial cells (HAE) to form groups of infected cells, termed “infectious centers”. We reported that infectious centers ultimately detach from HAE as a unit, carrying high titers of virus. Viral particles within cells may be more protected from environmental conditions, such as ultraviolet radiation and desiccation. We identified two host pathways, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and live cell extrusion, that contribute to infectious center detachment. Perturbing these pathways altered the kinetics of infectious centers detachment. These pathways influence one another and contribute to epithelial wound healing, suggesting infectious center detachment may be a usurped consequence of the host’s response to infection that benefits MeV by increasing its transmissibility between hosts.">

        <tr id="The aim of our study was to determine whether granzyme B-expressing regulatory B cells (GZMB+ B cells) are enriched in the blood of transplant patients with renal graft tolerance. To achieve this goal, we analysed two single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets: (1) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including GZMB+ B cells from renal transplant patients, i.e., patients with stable graft function on conventional immunosuppressive treatment (STA, n = 3), drug-free tolerant patients (TOL, n = 3), and patients with antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR, n = 3), and (2) ex-vivo-induced GZMB+ B cells from these groups. In the patient PBMCs, we first showed that natural GZMB+ B cells were enriched in genes specific to Natural Killer (NK) cells (such as NKG7 and KLRD1) and regulatory B cells (such as GZMB, IL10, and CCL4). We performed a pseudotemporal trajectory analysis of natural GZMB+ B cells and showed that they were highly differentiated B cells with a trajectory that is very different from that of conventional memory B cells and linked to the transcription factor KLF13. By specifically analysing GZMB+ natural B cells in TOLs, we found that these cells had a very specific transcriptomic profile associated with a reduction in the expression of HLA molecules, apoptosis, and the inflammatory response (in general) in the blood and that this signature was conserved after ex vivo induction, with the induction of genes associated with migration processes, such as CCR7, CCL3, or CCL4. An analysis of receptor/ligand interactions between these GZMB+/− natural B cells and all of the immune cells present in PBMCs also demonstrated that GZMB+ B cells were the B cells that carried the most ligands and had the most interactions with other immune cells, particularly in tolerant patients. Finally, we showed that these GZMB+ B cells were able to infiltrate the graft under inflammatory conditions, thus suggesting that they can act in locations where immune events occur.">

        <tr id="Introduction Exosomes produced by the protozoan parasite Leishmania (LeishEXO) are well-established drivers of virulence, though mechanisms underlying their exacerbation of experimental leishmaniasis remain elusive. Expression of Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a protein implicated in exosome-mediated pathologies and viral internalization, has been shown to correlate with cutaneous leishmaniasis severity. Given ANXA1’s regulation of myeloid cells – the canonical hosts for Leishmania – we studied the potential role of ANXA1 and its receptors FPR1/2 in exerting LeishEXO’s effects. Methods Murine and in vitro ANXA1-/- models were used to study the generation of protective TH1 responses during experimental L. major infection with and without LeishEXO. Recruitment of inflammatory cells was assessed using a peritoneal cell recruitment assay and immunophenotyping, and production of inflammatory mediators was measured using a cytokine and chemokine array. Treatment of experimental models with FPR2 antagonist WRW4 and FPR1/2 agonist WKYMVm was used to delineate the role of the FPR/ANXA1 axis in LeishEXO-mediated hyperpathogenesis. Results We established that ANXA1 deficiency prohibits LeishEXO-mediated pathogenesis and myeloid cell infection, with minimal alterations to adaptive and innate immune phenotypes. FPR2 blockade with WRW4 similarly inhibited leishmanial hyperpathogenesis, while direct activation of FPRs with WKYMVm enhanced infection and recapitulated the LeishEXO-mediated phenotype. This research describes LeishEXO’s utilization of the ANXA1/FPR axis to facilitate parasitic internalization and pathogenesis, which may be leveraged in the development of therapeutics for leishmaniasis.">

Trm cells are also capable of mediating autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, wherein autoreactive Trm cells are aberrantly activated. To quickly combat infections, activated Trm cells can stimulate the influx and activation of memory T cells and innate immune cells. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the inflammatory responses that Trm cell populations can induce, specifically in the activation of the innate profile. Most studies to date have utilized a reductionist approach to examine single Trm populations, specific pathogens, and defined tissues. Herein, we adopted a more holistic approach utilizing barrier-free ‘dirty’ mice to profile activated innate cells attracted to the skin in the presence of quiescent cutaneous Trm cells. Notably, dirty mice are a more human predictive model due to having a diverse microbial experience that leads to the development of a complete complement of Trm cells in the skin. We demonstrate that in the dirty mouse model mice have a significant reduction in cutaneous neutrophils and monocytes compared to SPF mice following local treatment with two separate innate stimuli. These findings reveal that cutaneous Trm cells have the capacity to temper the innate immune response and further substantiate the implication that Trm cells are heterogenous in their functions depending in large part on their tissue residency. However, in an autoimmune microenvironment Trm cells are capable of recruiting innate cells to the site of an exposure to a damage-associated molecular pattern. Likely due to the imbalance of IL-17 and IFN-γ.">

        <tr id="Most patients treated with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells eventually experience disease progression. Furthermore, CAR T cells have not been curative against solid cancers and several hematological malignancies such as T cell lymphomas, which have very poor prognoses. One of the main barriers to the clinical success of adoptive T cell immunotherapies is CAR T cell dysfunction and lack of expansion and/or persistence after infusion. In this study, we found that CD5 inhibits CAR T cell activation and that knockout (KO) of CD5 using CRISPR-Cas9 enhances the antitumor effect of CAR T cells in multiple hematological and solid cancer models. Mechanistically, CD5 KO drives increased T cell effector function with enhanced cytotoxicity, in vivo expansion, and persistence, without apparent toxicity in preclinical models. These findings indicate that CD5 is a critical inhibitor of T cell function and a potential clinical target for enhancing T cell therapies. Deleting CD5 with CRISPR-Cas9 enhances T cell activation and proliferation, boosting their antitumor effects in multiple tumor models. Editor’s summary The currently available chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have had limited efficacy for a wide range of solid cancers and hematological malignancies, due in part to CAR T cell dysfunction. The scavenger receptor CD5 associates with the T cell receptor (TCR) and inhibits T cell function. Patel et al. show that genetic deletion of CD5 in CAR and TCR T cells enhances expansion, persistence, and cytotoxicity and is effective in preclinical solid tumor and hematological malignancy models. These results suggest that CD5 may be a critical negative regulator of CAR T cells that can be therapeutically targeted. —Christiana Fogg">

EOMES+type-1 regulatory (EOMES+Tr1-like) T-cells had a dysregulated homeostasis in multiple sclerosis (MS), which was related to their activation in the central nervous system (CNS). EOMES+Tr1-like cells were strongly enriched in patient’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and were the main IL-10-producing T-cells in the CSF. IL-10+EOMES+Tr1-like were present in MS brain lesions, and some were found close to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-infected B-cells. EOMES+Tr1-like cells and FOXP3+Tregs produced IL-10 with EBV-derived antigens, but not with major myelin antigens. EOMES+Tr1-like cells responded selectively to the latency-associated antigen EBNA1, whereas FOXP3+Tregs responded also to lytic antigens. EBNA1-specific EOMES+Tr1-like cells were associated with anti-EBNA1 IgG, disappeared upon therapeutic B-cell depletion and were relatively abundant in patients with the HLA-DRB1*15 risk haplotype. The aberrant anti-viral specificities of Tregs in MS could undermine their protective functions and anti-EBV immune surveillance.">

Gamma delta (γδ) T cells in the context of HIV/Mtb coinfection have been understudied in children, despite in vitro evidence suggesting γδ T cells assist with Mtb control. We investigated whether boosting a specific subset of γδ T cells, phosphoantigen-reactive Vγ9+Vδ2+ cells, could improve TB outcome using a nonhuman primate model of pediatric HIV/Mtb coinfection. Juvenile Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM), equivalent to 4–8-year-old children, were infected intravenously (i.v.) with SIV. After 6 months, MCM were coinfected with a low dose of Mtb and then randomized to receive zoledronate (ZOL), a drug that increases phosphoantigen levels, (n=5; i.v.) at 3- and 17-days after Mtb accompanied by recombinant human IL-2 (s.c.) for 5 days following each ZOL injection. A similarly coinfected MCM group (n=5) was injected with saline as a control. Vγ9+Vδ2+ γδ T cell frequencies spiked in the blood, but not airways, of ZOL+IL-2-treated MCM following the first dose, however, were refractory to the second dose. At necropsy eight weeks after Mtb, ZOL+IL-2 treatment did not reduce pathology or bacterial burden. γδ T cell subset frequencies in granulomas did not differ between treatment groups. These data show that transiently boosting peripheral γδ T cells with ZOL+IL-2 soon after Mtb coinfection of SIV-infected MCM did not improve Mtb host defense.">

        <tr id="Native banana lectin (BanLec) is antiviral but highly mitogenic, which limits its therapeutic value. In contrast, the genetically engineered H84T BanLec (H84T) is not mitogenic but remains effective against influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mouse models. However, the potency and effect of H84T on human immune cells and IAV-specific immune responses is undetermined. We found that H84T efficiently inhibited IAV replication in human dendritic cells (DCs) from blood and tonsils, which preserved DC viability and allowed acquisition and presentation of viral antigen. Consequently, H84T-treated DCs initiated effective expansion of IAV-specific CD8 T cells. Furthermore, H84T preserved the capacity of IAV-exposed DCs to present a second non-IAV antigen and induce robust CD8 T cell expansion. This supports H84T as a potent antiviral in humans as it effectively inhibits IAV infection without disrupting DC function, and preserves induction of antigen-specific adaptive immune responses against diverse antigens, which likely is clinically beneficial.">

        <tr id="Hypomethylating agents are used as frontline therapy for myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS), but clinical response is unpredictable. To determine whether response was associated with in vivo dynamics of DNA hypomethylation, we conducted a phase 2 trial for MDS using both injection and oral azacitidine (AZA). We established that global DNA methylation levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells were comparable in AZA responders and non-responders during their course of treatment. However, there were distinct baseline and early drug induced differences in CpG methylation in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in responders compared to non-responders that overlapped with regulatory regions of genes associated with tissue patterning, cell migration and myeloid differentiation. Following six cycles of therapy when clinical response typically manifests, differential hypomethylation in responder HSPCs pointed to marrow adaptation as a driver of enhanced haematopoiesis. Taken together, CpG methylation differences in HSPCs may explain variable response to AZA.">

        <tr id="Concurrent KRAS LKB1 (STK11, KL) mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC) is particularly difficult to treat and does not respond well to current immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This is due to numerous mechanisms including low antigen presentation limiting T cell mediated killing. To activate anti-tumor immunity, we targeted tumor cell – natural killer (NK) cell interactions. We tested whether a novel antibody based therapeutic strategy that predominantly activates natural killer (NK) cells demonstrates efficacy in pre-clinical mouse models of KL NSCLC. NK cells rely on binding of ligands, such as Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I-related chain A or B (MICA/B), to the activating receptor NKG2D. Importantly MICA and MICB are widely expressed in elevated levels across NSCLC subtypes including KL lung cancers. Proteases with the tumor microenvironment (TME) can cleave these proteins rendering tumor cells less visible to NK cells. We therefore developed a MICA monoclonal antibody, AHA-1031, which utilizes two NK cell activating receptors. AHA1031 prevents ligand shedding without interfering with binding to NKG2D while targeting cancer cells to antibody mediated cell dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our therapeutic novel antibody has significant monotherapy activity in KL cancer models including xenografts of human cell lines and patient derived xenografts. Activating NK cells through MICA/B stabilization and inducing ADCC offers an alternative and potent therapy option in KL tumors. MICA/B are shed across different tumors making this therapeutic strategy universally applicable.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are the first immune cells to reach inflamed sites and contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Yet, little is known about the pattern of neutrophil infiltration in inflamed skin in vivo and the mechanisms mediating their recruitment. Here, we provide insight into the dynamics of neutrophil infiltration in skin in response to acute or repeated inflammatory stress, highlighting a novel keratinocyte- and keratin 17 (K17)-dependent mechanism that regulates neutrophil recruitment to inflamed skin. We used the phorbol ester TPA and UVB, alone or in combination, to induce sterile inflammation in mouse skin. A single TPA treatment results in a neutrophil influx in the dermis that peaks at 12 h and resolves within 24 h. A subsequent TPA treatment or a UVB challenge, when applied 24 h but not 48 h later, accelerates, amplifies, and prolongs neutrophil infiltration. This transient amplification response (TAR) is mediated by local signals in inflamed skin, can be recapitulated in ex vivo culture, and involves the K17-dependent sustainment of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activity and release of chemoattractants by stressed keratinocytes. K17 binds RACK1, a scaffold protein essential for PKCα activity. The N-terminal head domain of K17 is crucial for its association with RACK1 and regulation of PKCα activity. Analysis of RNAseq data reveals a signature consistent with TAR and PKCα activation in inflammatory skin diseases. These findings uncover a novel, keratin-dependent mechanism that amplifies neutrophil recruitment in skin under stress, with direct implications for inflammatory skin disorders.">

        <tr id="Introduction Herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) is a blinding disease caused by corneal infection of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Effective clearance of HSV-1 from the infected cornea is crucial for HSK management. Macrophages play an important part in the innate immune defense against viral infections. This study investigates the immunomodulatory role of NLRP12 in macrophage immune response during HSV-1 infection. Methods NLRP12 expression post-infection was assessed in various macrophage cell lines. Overexpression of NLRP12 was achieved by lentiviral transfection, and its effect on HSV-1 replication and immune responses were examined. Mechanistic insights into the role of NLRP12 were explored using immunofluorescence and Western Blot. For in vivo studies, ocular adoptive transfer of NLRP12-overexpressing bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) was performed. HSV-1 viral loads, HSK symptoms, and macrophage-mediated immune responses were investigated. Results A significant decrease in NLRP12 expression post-infection was observed in various macrophage cell lines. Overexpression of NLRP12 in macrophages reduced HSV-1 replication. Mechanistically, overexpression of NLRP12 triggered early and robust pyroptosis in response to HSV-1 infection, inducing interleukin (IL)-18 production and activating downstream antiviral responses through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In vivo, ocular adoptive transfer of NLRP12-overexpressing BMDMs to mouse corneas alleviated HSK damage and reduced HSV-1 viral loads. NLRP12-overexpressing BMDMs improved antiviral responses in the cornea and promoted the maturation of corneal-infiltrating macrophages and dendritic cells. Additionally, NLRP12-overexpressing BMDMs amplified the adaptive immune response in the submandibular draining lymph nodes. Discussion These findings highlight the role of NLRP12 in macrophage-mediated immune response against HSV-1 infection and suggest its potential for possible immunotherapy for HSK.">

        <tr id="Unconventional T cells, including mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT), natural killer T (NKT), and gamma-delta T (γδT) cells, comprise distinct T-bet+, IFN-γ+ and RORγt+, IL-17+ subsets which play differential roles in health and disease. NKT1 cells are susceptible to ARTC2-mediated P2X7 receptor (P2RX7) activation, but the effects on other unconventional T-cell types are unknown. Here, we show that MAIT, γδT, and NKT cells express P2RX7 and are sensitive to P2RX7-mediated cell death. Mouse peripheral T-bet+ MAIT1, γδT1, and NKT1 cells, especially in liver, co-express ARTC2 and P2RX7, which can be further upregulated by retinoic acid. Blocking ARTC2 or inhibiting P2RX7 protected MAIT1, γδT1, and NKT1 cells from cell death, enhanced their survival in vivo, and increased the number of IFN-γ-secreting cells without affecting IL-17 production. Importantly, this revealed the existence of IFN-γ and IL-4 co-producing unconventional T-cell populations normally lost upon isolation due to ARTC2/P2RX7-induced death. Administering extracellular NAD in vivo activated this pathway, depleting P2RX7-sensitive unconventional T cells. Our study reveals ARTC2/P2RX7 as a common regulatory axis modulating the unconventional T-cell compartment, affecting the viability of IFN-γ- and IL-4-producing T cells, offering important insights to facilitate future studies into how these cells can be regulated in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects a wide range of cell types in the body, including a variety of epithelial cell types. Despite the significance of epithelial cells during infection, HCMV has been difficult to study in epithelial cells. In this study, we examined HCMV infection in mammary and prostate epithelial cell lines, finding that the virus establishes a semi-permissive, biosynthetically abortive state. Building on previous work, we hypothesized that shifting epithelial cells to a mesenchymal cell state would restore HCMV biosynthesis and progeny production. To test this hypothesis, we induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using TGF-β and the EMT-transcription factor (EMT-TF) SNAIL. We found that shifting strongly epithelial cell lines to a mesenchymal cell state shifted HCMV infection from a semi-permissive to fully permissive state. This effect appeared to involve two distinct mechanisms: EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral entry and EMT-sensitive enhancement of viral mRNA translation. Although the precise mechanisms remain elusive, our findings identify the epithelial-mesenchymal cell state axis as an important regulator of HCMV infection and provide new insights into how cellular differentiation states influence viral replication. They also raise the possibility that the EMT pathway, a fundamental pathway involved in development and cancer metastasis, could regulate HCMV infection in-vivo, potentially contributing to viral persistence or pathogenesis in epithelial tissues.">

        <tr id="Nearly six million people worldwide have died from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Although COVID-19 vaccines are largely successful in reducing the severity of the disease and deaths, the decline in vaccine-induced immunity over time and the continuing emergence of new viral variants or mutations underscore the need for an alternative strategy for developing broad-spectrum host-mediated therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. A key feature of severe COVID-19 is dysregulated innate immune signaling, culminating in a high expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and a lack of antiviral interferons (IFNs), particularly type I (alpha and beta) and type III (lambda). As a natural host defense, the myeloid differentiation primary response protein, MyD88, plays pivotal roles in innate and acquired immune responses via the signal transduction pathways of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a type of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). However, recent studies have highlighted that infection with viruses upregulates MyD88 expression and impairs the host antiviral response by negatively regulating type I IFN. Galectin-3 (Gal3), another key player in viral infections, has been shown to modulate the host immune response by regulating viral entry and activating TLRs, the NLRP3 inflammasome, and NF-κB, resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributing to the overall inflammatory response, the so-called “cytokine storm”. These studies suggest that the specific inhibition of MyD88 and Gal3 could be a promising therapy for COVID-19. This review presents future directions for MyD88- and Gal3-targeted antiviral drug discovery, highlighting the potential to restore host immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infections.">

        <tr id="Cell plasticity (CP), describing a dynamic cell state, plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis during organ morphogenesis, regeneration and damage-to-repair biological process. Single-cell-omics datasets provide unprecedented resource to empowers analysis on CP. Hematopoiesis offers fertile opportunities to develop quantitative methods for understanding CP with rich supports from experimental ground-truths. In this study we generated high-quality lineage-negative (Lin−) single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets under various conditions and introduced a working pipeline named Snapdragon to interrogate naïve and disturbed plasticity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with mutational or environmental challenges. Utilizing embedding methods UMAP or FA, a continuum of hematopoietic development is visually observed in wildtype where the pipeline confirms a very low Proportion of hybrid-cells (Phc, with bias range: 0.4-0.6) on a transition trajectory. Upon Tet2 mutation, a driver of leukemia, or treatment of DSS, an inducer of colitis, Phc is increased and plasticity of HSPCs was enhanced. Quantitative analysis indicates that Tet2 mutation enhances HSC self-renewal capability while DSS treatment results in an enhanced myeloid-skewing trajectory, suggesting their similar but different consequences. We prioritized several transcription factors (i.e the EGR family) and signaling pathways (i.e. receptors IL1R1 and ADRB, inflammation and sympathy-sensing respectively) which are responsible for Phc alterations. CellOracle-based simulation suggests that knocking-out EGR regulons or pathways of IL1R1 and ADRB partially reverses Phc promoted by Tet2 mutation and inflammation. In conclusion, the study provides high-quality datasets with single-cell transcriptomic matrices for diversified hematopoietic simulations and a computational pipeline Snapdragon for quantifying disturbed Phc and CP.

        <tr id="Background Gamma-delta (γδ) T cells are a major immune cell subset in pigs. Approximately 50% of circulating T cells are γδ T cells in young pigs and up to 30% in adult sows. Despite this abundance, the functions of porcine γδ T cells are mostly unidentified. In humans and mice, activated γδ T cells exhibit broad innate cytotoxic activity against a wide variety of stressed, infected, and cancerous cells through death receptor/ligand-dependent and perforin/granzyme-dependent pathways. However, so far, it is unknown whether porcine γδ T cells have the ability to perform cytotoxic functions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of porcine γδ T cells isolated from blood, lung, and nasal mucosa. To further analyze the cytolytic potential of γδ T cells, in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed using purified γδ T cells as effector cells and virus-exposed or mock-treated primary porcine alveolar macrophages as target cells. Results Our results show that only CD2+ γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers (CD16, NKp46, perforin) with higher perforin and NKp46 expression in γδ T cells isolated from lung and nasal mucosa. Moreover, we found that γδ T cells can exhibit cytotoxic functions in a cell-cell contact and degranulation-dependent manner. However, porcine γδ T cells did not seem to specifically target Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus or swine Influenza A Virus-infected macrophages, which may be due to viral escape mechanisms. Conclusion Porcine γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers and can exhibit cytotoxic activity in vitro. The specific mechanisms by which porcine γδ T cells recognize target cells are not fully understood but may involve the detection of cellular stress signals.">

They are TCF1+ PD-1+ and important for the expansion of tumor specific CD8+ T cells in response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. In acute infections, naïve CD8+ T cells differentiate into effector and memory CD8+ T cells; in cancer and chronic infections, persistent antigen stimulation can lead to T cell exhaustion. Recent studies have highlighted the dichotomy between late dysfunctional (or exhausted) T cells (TLD) that are TCF1– PD-1+ and self-renewing TCF1+ PD-1+ TSL from which they derive. TCF1+ TSL cells are considered to have stem cell-like properties akin to memory T cell populations and can give rise to cytotoxic effector and transitory T cell phenotypes (TTE) which mediate tumor control. In this review, we will discuss recent advances made in research on the formation and expansion of TSL, as well as distinct niches required for their differentiation and maintenance in the setting of cancer. We will also discuss potential strategies to generate these cells, with clinical implications for stemness enhancement in vaccine design, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and adoptive T cell therapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process that gets skewed toward myelopoiesis. This restrains lymphopoiesis, but the role of lymphocytes in this process is not well defined. To unravel the intricacies of neutrophil responses in COVID-19, we performed bulk RNAseq on neutrophils from healthy controls and COVID-19 patients. Principal component analysis revealed distinguishing neutrophil gene expression alterations in COVID-19 patients. ICU and ward patients displayed substantial transcriptional changes, with ICU patients exhibiting a more pronounced response. Intriguingly, neutrophils from COVID-19 patients, notably ICU patients, exhibited an enrichment of immunoglobulin (Ig) and B cell lineage-associated genes, suggesting potential lineage plasticity. We validated our RNAseq findings in a larger cohort. Moreover, by reanalyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data on human bone marrow (BM) granulocytes, we identified the cluster of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP) enriched with Ig and B cell lineage-associated genes. These cells with lineage plasticity may serve as a resource depending on the host’s needs during severe systemic infection. This distinct B cell subset may play a pivotal role in promoting myelopoiesis in response to infection. The scRNAseq analysis of BM neutrophils in infected mice further supported our observations in humans. Finally, our studies using an animal model of acute infection implicate IL-7/GM-CSF in influencing neutrophil and B cell dynamics. Elevated GM-CSF and reduced IL-7 receptor expression in COVID-19 patients imply altered hematopoiesis favoring myeloid cells over B cells. Our findings provide novel insights into the relationship between the B-neutrophil lineages during severe infection, hinting at potential implications for disease pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE This study investigates the dynamics of hematopoiesis in COVID-19, focusing on neutrophil responses. Through RNA sequencing of neutrophils from healthy controls and COVID-19 patients, distinct gene expression alterations are identified, particularly in ICU patients. Notably, neutrophils from COVID-19 patients, especially in the ICU, exhibit enrichment of immunoglobulin and B cell lineage-associated genes, suggesting potential lineage plasticity. Validation in a larger patient cohort and single-cell analysis of bone marrow granulocytes support the presence of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors with B cell lineage-associated genes. The findings propose a link between B-neutrophil lineages during severe infection, implicating a potential role for these cells in altered hematopoiesis favoring myeloid cells over B cells. Elevated GM-CSF and reduced IL-7 receptor expression in stress hematopoiesis suggest cytokine involvement in these dynamics, providing novel insights into disease pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="The symbiotic relationship between host and microbiota plays a pivotal role in training and development of the host’s innate and adaptive immune systems. Antigen-specific recognition of microbiota by T cells enforces tolerance at homeostasis. Conversely, dysbiosis—characterized by alterations in microbiota diversity and abundance—leads to imbalanced T cell responses and triggering of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Despite their significance, the identities of immunogenic microbial antigens are still largely enigmatic. Here, we leveraged an in-house developed antigen screening platform, the MCR system 1, to delineate CD4+ T cell reactivity against Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT), —two prominent members of the gut microbiota. T-cell hybridomas reactive to AKK and BT bacteria showed polyreactivity to select microbiota-derived peptides in MCR co-cultures. We discovered 13 novel antigenic epitopes from AKK and 14 from BT. Steady-state T cells recognized these epitopes in an MHC-restricted fashion. Ex vivo stimulation of peptide-specific T cells revealed induction of type 1 and type 17 immune responses, albeit with non-overlapping specificities, contrary to MCR system results. Our findings further demonstrated that most identified epitopes are broadly conserved within the given phylum and originate from both membrane and intracellular proteins. Our work showcases the potential of the MCR system for identifying immunogenic microbial epitopes, providing a valuable resource. Additionally, it indicates the existence of mucosal T cells with a tropism toward broadly conserved bacterial epitopes. Overall, our study forms the basis for decoding antigen specificity in immune system-bacterial interactions, with applications in understanding both microbiome and pathogenic bacterial immunity.">

Unraveling the mechanisms underlying treatment response for targeted therapeutics in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients is challenging due to the limited understanding of diverse responses of circulating immune cells, particularly B cells. We investigated B lymphocyte dynamics during anti-BAFF treatment, utilizing longitudinal single-cell transcriptome data.


METHODS
We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on PBMCs in four Korean SLE patients before and after belimumab treatment at the following time points: 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.


RESULTS
Analyzing over 73 000 PBMCs, we identified 8 distinct subsets of B cells and plasmablasts and analyzed dynamic changes within these cell subsets: initial declines in naive and transitional B cells followed by an increase at three months, contrasted by an initial increase and subsequent decrease in memory B cells by the third month. Meanwhile, plasmablasts exhibited a consistent decline throughout treatment. B cell activation pathways, specifically in naive and memory B cells, were downregulated during the third and sixth months. These findings were validated at the protein level throughout the first four weeks of treatment using flow cytometry. Comparative analysis with bulk transcriptome data from 22 Japanese SLE patients showed increased NR4A1 expression six months post-belimumab treatment, indicating its role in restricting self-reactive B cells, thereby contributing to the biological responses of anti-BAFF treatment.


CONCLUSION
The observed B cell dynamics provided insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of anti-BAFF in SLE patients. Furthermore, it underscores the need for research in predicting drug responses based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a challenging hematological malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) contribute to therapeutic failure, relapse, and adverse outcome. This study investigates the role of quiescence and related molecular mechanisms in AML pathogenesis and LSC functions to identify potential therapeutic targets. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the LSC-enriched quiescent cell population has a distinct gene signature with prognostic relevance in patients with AML. Mechanistically, quiescent blasts exhibit increased autophagic activity, which contributes to their sustained viability. Proteomic profiling uncovered differential requirements for iron metabolism between quiescent and cycling cells, revealing a unique dependence of quiescent cells on ferritinophagy, a selective form of autophagy mediated by nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), which regulates iron bioavailability. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of inhibiting NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy using genetic knockdown and chemical inhibition approaches. In vitro assays showed that suppression of NCOA4 was toxic to leukemic blasts, particularly the CD34+CD38− LSC-enriched population, without affecting normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. In vivo studies using murine patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of AML confirmed that NCOA4 inhibition reduced tumor burden and impaired LSC viability and self-renewal, indicating a specific vulnerability of these cells to ferritinophagy disruption. Our findings underscore the role of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in maintaining LSC quiescence and function and suggest that targeting this pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy for AML. This study highlights the potential of NCOA4 inhibition to improve AML outcomes and paves the way for future research and clinical development. Targeting quiescent leukemic stem cells through NCOA4-dependent ferritinophagy inhibition may improve therapeutic outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia. Editor’s summary Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are thought to be a main contributor to relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, Larrue et al. identified a reliance on ferritinophagy, a form of autophagy that relies on nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), in LSCs and demonstrated that inhibition reduced tumor growth in primary patient samples and mouse models. This represents a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with AML that will require further study. —Dorothy Hallberg">

Memory T cells have an important role in the resolution of COVID-19, and they are key pillars of immunological memory. In this review, we summarize the main findings regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells after infection, after vaccination, and after the combination of these two events ("hybrid immunity"), and analyze how these cells can contribute to long-term protection against the infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants.">

        <tr id="Introduction Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important tropical and neglected disease and represents a serious global health problem. The initial interaction between the phagocytes and the parasite is crucial to determine the pathogen’s capacity to initiate infection and it shapes the subsequent immune response that will develop. While type-1 T-cells induce IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-12 production by monocytes/macrophages to fight the infection, type-2 T-cells are associated with a regulatory phenotype (IL-10 and TGF-β) and successful infection establishment. Recently, our group demonstrated the role of an important Th1/Th17 T-cell population, the mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, in VL. MAIT cells can respond to L. infantum by producing TNF-α and IFN-γ upon MR1-dependent activation. Objective and methods Here, we describe the impact of the MR1-blockage on L. infantum internalization on the functional profile of circulating neutrophils and monocytes as well as the impact of the MR1-blockage on the soluble mediator signatures of in vitro whole blood cultures. Results Overall, our data showed that VL patients presents higher percentage of activated neutrophils than asymptomatic and non-infected controls. In addition, MR1 blockade led to lower TNF-α and TGF-β production by non-activated neutrophils from asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, TNF-α and IL-10 production by monocytes was higher in VL patients. In the analysis of soluble mediators produced in vitro, MR1-blockade induced a decrease of IFN-γ and an increase of IL-10, IL-27 and IL-33 in the cell cultures of AS group, a cytokine pattern associated with type 2 deleterious response. Discussion and conclusion These data corroborate the hypothesis that MR1-restricted responses are associated to a protective role during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Coinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a significant public health concern. Individuals infected with Mtb who acquire HIV are approximately 16 times more likely to develop active tuberculosis. T cells play an important role as both targets for HIV infection and mediators of the immune response against both pathogens. This review aims to synthesize the current literature and provide insights into the effects of HIV/Mtb coinfection on T cell populations and their contributions to immunity. Evidence from multiple in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that T helper responses are severely compromised during coinfection, leading to impaired cytotoxic responses. Moreover, HIV’s targeting of Mtb-specific cells, including those within granulomas, offers an explanation for the severe progression of the disease. Herein, we discuss the patterns of differentiation, exhaustion, and transcriptomic changes in T cells during coinfection, as well as the metabolic adaptations that are necessary for T cell maintenance and functionality. This review highlights the interconnectedness of the immune response and the pathogenesis of HIV/Mtb coinfection.">

        <tr id="Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the severity of COVID-19, since the respiratory, thrombotic and myocardial complications of the disease are closely linked to vascular endothelial damage. To address this issue, we evaluate here the effect of conditioned media from spike S1-activated macrophages (CM_S1) on the proliferation of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), focusing on the specific role of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Results obtained demonstrate that the incubation with CM_S1 for 72 h hinders endothelial cell proliferation and induces signs of cytotoxicity. Comparable results are obtained upon exposure to IFN-γ + TNF-α, which are thus postulated to play a pivotal role in the effects observed. These events are associated with an increase in p21 protein and a decrease in Rb phosphorylation, as well as with the activation of IRF-1 and NF-kB transcription factors. Overall, these findings further sustain the pivotal role of a hypersecretion of inflammatory cytokines as a trigger for endothelial activation and injury in the immune-mediated effects of COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Lung transplantation (LTx) outcomes are impeded by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and subsequent chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). We examined the undefined role of MerTK (receptor Mer tyrosine kinase) on monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) in efferocytosis to facilitate resolution of lung IRI. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from post-LTx patients were analyzed. Murine lung hilar ligation and allogeneic orthotopic LTx models of IRI were used with Balb/c (WT), Cebpb-/- (MDSC-deficient), Mertk-/- or MerTK-CR (cleavage resistant) mice. A significant downregulation in MerTK-related efferocytosis genes in M-MDSC populations of CLAD patients was observed compared to healthy subjects. In the murine IRI model, significant increase in M-MDSCs, MerTK expression, efferocytosis and attenuation of lung dysfunction was observed in WT mice during injury resolution that was absent in Cebpb-/- and Mertk-/- mice. Adoptive transfer of M-MDSCs in Cebpb-/- mice significantly attenuated lung dysfunction and inflammation. Additionally, in a murine orthotopic LTx model, increases in M-MDSCs were associated with resolution of lung IRI in the transplant recipients. In vitro studies demonstrated the ability of M-MDSCs to efferocytose apoptotic neutrophils in a MerTK-dependent manner. Our results suggest that MerTK-dependent efferocytosis by M-MDSCs can substantially contribute to the resolution of post-LTx IRI.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite the considerable progress in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment, relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is still frequent and associated with a poor prognosis. Relapse has been shown to be correlated with an incomplete eradication of CD34+ leukemic stem cells prior to HSCT. Previously, we have shown that a novel CD34-directed, bispecific T-cell engager (BTE) can efficiently redirect the T-cell effector function toward cancer cells, thus eliminating leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. However, its impact on γδ T-cells is still unclear. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the CD34-specific BTE using in vitro expanded γδ T-cells as effectors. We showed that the BTEs bind to γδ T-cells and CD34+ leukemic cell lines and induce target cell killing in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, γδ T-cell mediated killing was found to be superior to αβ T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we observed that only in the presence of BTE the γδ T-cells induced primary AML blast killing in vitro. Importantly, our results show that γδ T-cells did not target the healthy CD34intermediate endothelial blood–brain barrier cell line (hCMEC/D3) nor lysed CD34+ HSCs from healthy bone marrow samples.">

        <tr id="Objective: To investigate the expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in circulating exosomes, and to define the role of exosomal PD-L1 in promoting immune escape mechanism during chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) and related liver diseases. Methods: The levels of PD-L1 expressed in exosomes were detected by ELISA. CD8+T cells were sorted and cytotoxicity test was assessed by flow cytometry. PD-L1 protein expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and normal adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. Results: Circulating exosomal PD-L1 levels were significantly higher in patients with CHB and HCC than in healthy controls (F =7.46, P=0.001). Levels of CD107a on CD8+T cells in patients with CHB receiving PD-L1 blocking antibody were significantly lower than in patients receiving isotype blocking antibody (t = 4.96, P < 0.01). Levels of TNF-α in cell culture supernatants of the PD-L1 blocking antibody group were significantly higher than in the isotype blocking antibody group (t =5.92, P < 0.01). Compared with patients receiving isotype blocking antibody, levels of CD107a on CD8+T cells significantly increased in patients with HCC receiving anti-PD-L1 antibody (t = 3.51, P<0.05). Compared with adjacent tissues, the levels of PD-L1 protein expression in HCC tissues were slightly higher; however, no significant difference between the two groups was observed. Conclusions: PD-L1 blockade in exosomes might promote the cytotoxic function of CD8+T cells and inhibit immune evasion during progression of HCC. Blocking PD-L1 in exosomes reduced the cytotoxic function of CD8+T cells in patients with CHB while enhancing the production of proinflammatory cytokines.">

        <tr id="Influenza infections result in a significant number of severe illnesses annually, many of which are complicated by secondary bacterial super-infection. Primary influenza infection has been shown to increase susceptibility to secondary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection by altering the host immune response, leading to significant immunopathology. Type III interferons (IFNs), or IFNλs, have gained traction as potential antiviral therapeutics due to their restriction of viral replication without damaging inflammation. The role of IFNλ in regulating epithelial biology in super-infection has recently been established; however, the impact of IFNλ on immune cells is less defined. In this study, we infected wild-type and IFNLR1-/- mice with influenza A/PR/8/34 followed by S. aureus USA300. We demonstrated that global IFNLR1-/- mice have enhanced bacterial clearance through increased uptake by phagocytes, which was shown to be cell-intrinsic specifically in myeloid cells in mixed bone marrow chimeras. We also showed that depletion of IFNLR1 on CX3CR1 expressing myeloid immune cells, but not neutrophils, was sufficient to significantly reduce bacterial burden compared to mice with intact IFNLR1. These findings provide insight into how IFNλ in an influenza-infected lung impedes bacterial clearance during super-infection and show a direct cell intrinsic role for IFNλ signaling on myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune cell populations in the intestinal muscularis propria during colitis are poorly resolved. Maintaining homeostasis in this niche is critical, highlighted by the poorer prognosis of inflammatory bowel disease associated with muscularis propria inflammation.


METHODS
This study utilizes single-cell RNA sequencing to survey the immune cell populations within the muscularis propria of normal colon and dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Findings are validated by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and cell-lineage tracing in vivo, and in vitro assays with muscularis macrophages (MMφ).


RESULTS
In naïve conditions, transcriptional duality is observed in MMφs with 2 major subpopulations: conventional resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs and Lyve1+ MMφs. The Lyve1+ population is phagocytic and expresses several known MMφ markers in mouse and human, confirming their identity as a bona fide MMφ subset. Single-cell transcriptomics indicate that resident MMφs are retained during colitis and exhibit plasticity toward an inflammatory profile. Lyve1+ MMφs, which express anti-inflammatory marker CD163, are absent during colitis, as confirmed by flow cytometry. In contrast, lineage tracing finds that resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs remain during colitis and are not completely replaced by the inflammatory infiltrating monocytes. In vitro studies provide biological evidence of the plasticity of resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), mirroring transcriptional observations in vivo of their inflammatory plasticity. Potential markers for colitic MMφs, validated in animal models and in individuals with ulcerative colitis, are identified.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings contribute to the understanding of the immune system in the muscularis propria niche during colitis by resolving the heterogeneity and origins of colitic MMφs.">

        <tr id="Human alveolar type I (AT1) cells are specialized epithelial cells that line the alveoli in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. The primary function of AT1 cells is not only to facilitate efficient gas exchange between the air and the blood in the lungs, but also to contribute to the structural integrity of the alveoli to maintain lung function and homeostasis. Aging has notable effects on the structure, function, and regenerative capacity of human AT1 cells. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving these age-related changes in AT1 cells remains limited. Leveraging a recent single-cell transcriptomics dataset we generated on healthy human lungs, we identified a series of significant molecular alterations in AT1 cells from aged lungs. Notably, the aged AT1 cells exhibited increased cellular senescence and chemokine gene expression, alongside diminished epithelial features such as decreases in cell junctions, endocytosis, and pulmonary matrisome gene expression. Gene set analyses also indicated that aged AT1 cells were resistant to apoptosis, a crucial mechanism for turnover and renewal of AT1 cells, thereby ensuring alveolar integrity and function. Further research on these alterations is imperative to fully elucidate the impact on AT1 cells and is indispensable for developing effective therapies to preserve lung function and promote healthy aging.">

        <tr id="To efficiently absorb nutrients and facilitate microbial commensalism, the host establishes tolerogenic immune programs against dietary and commensal antigens, promoted by peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs)1,2. Previous research into which antigen-presenting cells (APCs) initiate dietary pTreg responses focused on type 1 DCs (cDC1)3. However, we now report that food-specific pTreg cells are exclusively induced by the recently identified RORγt+ APCs4–8, and not by cDC1. Instead, pTregs interact with cDC1 to regulate the response of food-specific CD8αβ T cells that accumulate in the lamina propria (LP) and epithelial layer of the small intestine (SI) and express memory markers. Upon infection with pathogens that mimic dietary antigens, food-specific CD8αβ cells activate an effector program to potentially guard against ‘Trojan horse’ attacks. Uniquely, after the infection resolves, these cells do not respond to their corresponding dietary antigens, allowing for safe food consumption. Based on our findings, we propose that in response to dietary antigens, dedicated antigen-presenting cells direct a unique CD8αβ response that is coupled to the pTreg program to facilitate protective acute effector responses within the overall strategy of tolerance.">

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in infants presents distinctive challenges due to their developing immune systems and unique viral-host interactions compared to adults. This review examines current knowledge on viral-host interactions and immune responses in HIV-infected infants, focusing on immune development, viral dynamics, and therapeutic implications. The immune system of infants undergoes rapid maturation during early life, influencing their susceptibility to HIV infection and responses to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Key aspects include thymic function, cytokine profiles, and the establishment of immune memory, which collectively shape immune responses against HIV. Viral dynamics in HIV-infected infants differ markedly from those in adults, characterized by high viral loads, diverse viral subtypes, and the early establishment of viral reservoirs within immune cells. These reservoirs, particularly in sanctuary sites like the central nervous system, pose challenges for achieving viral eradication and long-term remission. Effective management requires strategies to characterize and target these reservoirs, alongside early intervention to mitigate viral replication and preserve immune function. Advances in viral monitoring technologies and treatment regimens are essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing the global burden of pediatric HIV infection.

        <tr id="Purpose: Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) inhibitors (BETi) have demonstrated epigenetic modulation capabilities, specifically in transcriptional repression of oncogenic pathways. Preclinical assays suggest that BETi potentially attenuates the PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis, supporting its combination with immunomodulatory agents. Patients and Methods: A Phase 1b clinical trial was conducted to elucidate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the BET inhibitor RO6870810, as monotherapy and in combination with the PD-L1 antagonist atezolizumab, in patients with advanced ovarian carcinomas and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Endpoints included maximum tolerated dosages, adverse event profiling, pharmacokinetic evaluations, and antitumor activity. Pharmacodynamic and immunomodulatory effects were assessed in tumor tissue (by immunohistochemistry and RNA-seq) and in peripheral blood (by flow cytometry and cytokine analysis). Results: The study was terminated prematurely due to a pronounced incidence of immune-related adverse effects in patients receiving combination of RO6870810 and atezolizumab. Anti-tumor activity was limited to 2 patients (5.6%) showing partial response. Although target engagement was confirmed by established BETi pharmacodynamic markers in both blood and tumor samples, BETi failed to markedly decrease tumor PD-L1 expression and had a suppressive effect on anti-tumor immunity. Immune effector activation in tumor tissue was solely observed with the atezolizumab combination, aligning with this checkpoint inhibitor's recognized biological effects. Conclusions: The combination of BET inhibitor RO6870810 with the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab presents an unfavorable risk-benefit profile for ovarian cancer and TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) patients due to the increased risk of augmented or exaggerated immune reactions, without evidence for synergistic anti-tumor effects.">

        <tr id="Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) represents endogenous mechanisms of negative immunoregulation. While the modulation of effector functions has been the major focus of PD-1 research, quick PD-1 upregulation in naïve T cells starting 1 h after priming raised a possibility that PD-1 also affects the development of effector T cells. The role of PD-1 in functional differentiation into Th1 and Th2 has been unclear. In murine naïve CD4+ T cell activation, we found that PD-1 stimulation during the early stage of T cell activation strongly impaired Th2 cell development, while Th1 cell induction was relatively resistant to this immunosuppressive signaling. The steep decline in Th2 cell induction suggested the significance of PD-1 in allergic inflammation. Treatment with anti-human PD-1 agonist antibody inhibited allergic inflammation in human PD-1-knock-in mice as shown by the reduction of Th2 cells, IgE levels and eosinophilic infiltration. This study shows that PD-1 regulates not only the intensity but also the quality of immune response by deviating Th differentiation. PD-1 stimulators are projected to be valuable in suppressing various forms of inflammatory activities, but the efficacy against Th2-dominant immune response may be particularly high.">

        <tr id="Viruses capable of causing persistent infection have developed sophisticated mechanisms for evading host immunity, and understanding these processes can reveal novel features of the host immune system. One such virus, human pegivirus (HPgV), infects ~15% of the global human population, but little is known about its biology beyond the fact that it does not cause overt disease. We passaged a pegivirus isolate of feral brown rats (RPgV) in immunodeficient laboratory mice to develop a mouse-adapted virus (maPgV) that established persistent high-titer infection in a majority of wild-type laboratory mice. maRPgV viremia was detected in the blood of mice for >300 days without apparent disease, closely recapitulating the hallmarks of HPgV infection in humans. We found a pro-viral role for type-I interferon in chronic infection; a lack of PD-1-mediated tolerance to PgV infection; and multiple mechanisms by which PgV immunity can be achieved by an immunocompetent host. These data indicate that the PgV immune evasion strategy has aspects that are both common and unique among persistent viral infections. The creation of maPgV represents the first PgV infection model in wild-type mice, thus opening the entire toolkit of the mouse host to enable further investigation of this persistent RNA virus infections.">

        <tr id="Our understanding of T-cell-dependent humoral responses has been largely shaped by studies involving model antigens such as recombinant proteins and viruses 1,2. In these contexts, B cells internalize the entire antigen or pathogen, and present a range of antigens to helper CD4+ T cells to initiate the humoral response. However, this model does not account for large pathogens (such as parasites) that are too large to be taken up by individual B cells, and the mechanisms by which B cells acquire and present antigens from large complex pathogens to T cells remain poorly understood. Here we used Plasmodium, the causative parasite of malaria, as a model to investigate the requirements for T cell help for B cells targeting the Plasmodium surface circumsporozoite protein (CSP). Upon Plasmodium sporozoite (SPZ) immunization, CSP-specific B cells can form a synapse-like structure with SPZs and take up CSP and non-CSP surface antigens. As a result, CSP-specific B cells can receive help from CD4+ T cells specific to antigens that are located on the surface but not cytosol of the Plasmodium SPZ. Therefore, B cells can obtain help, not only from T cells with the same protein specificity, but also from T cells specific for spatially linked antigens. This flexibility in T cell help may enhance the initiation and maintenance of humoral immune responses to complex pathogens.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis and AIDS remain two of the most relevant human infectious diseases. The pathogens that cause them, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV, individually elicit an immune response that treads the line between beneficial and detrimental to the host. Co-infection further complexifies this response since the different cytokines acting on one infection might facilitate the dissemination of the other. In these responses, the role of type I interferons is often associated with antiviral mechanisms, while for bacteria such as Mtb, their importance and clinical relevance as a suitable target for manipulation are more controversial. In this article, we review the recent knowledge on how these interferons play distinct roles and sometimes have opposite consequences depending on the stage of the pathogenesis. We highlight the dichotomy between the acute and chronic infections displayed by both infections and how type I interferons contribute to an initial control of each infection individually, while their chronic induction, particularly during HIV infection, might facilitate Mtb primo-infection and progression to disease. We expect that further findings and their systematization will allow the definition of windows of opportunity for interferon manipulation according to the stage of infection, contributing to pathogen clearance and control of immunopathology.">

        <tr id="TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a member of the IKK family and plays a crucial role in the activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling and type I interferon responses. The aberrant activation of TBK1 contributes to the proliferation and survival of various types of tumor cells, particularly in specific mutational or tumorous contexts. Inhibitors targeting TBK1 are under development and application in both in vivo and in vitro settings, yet their clinical efficacy remains limited. Numerous literatures have shown that TBK1 can exhibit both tumor promoting and tumor inhibiting effects. TBK1 acts as a pivotal node within the innate immune pathway, mediating anti-tumor immunity through the activation of innate immune responses. Facilitating interferon-I (IFN-I) production represents a critical mechanism through which TBK1 bridges these processes. IFN has been shown to exert both beneficial and detrimental effects on tumor progression. Hence, the paradoxical role of TBK1 in tumor development may necessitate acknowledgment in light of its downstream IFN-I signaling cascade. In this paper, we review the signaling pathways mediated by TBK1 in various tumor contexts and summarize the dual roles of TBK1 and the TBK1-IFN pathways in both promoting and inhibiting tumor progression. Additionally, we highlight the significance of the TBK1-IFN pathway in clinical therapy, particularly in the context of immune response. We anticipate further advancements in the development of TBK1 inhibitors as part of novel cancer treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Epithelial injury calls for a regenerative response from a coordinated network of epithelial stem cells and immune cells. Defining this network is key to preserving the repair process for acute resolution, but also for preventing a remodeling process with chronic dysfunction. We recently identified an immune niche for basal-epithelial stem cells using mouse models of injury after respiratory viral infection. Niche function depended on an early sentinel population of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) that provided ligand GPNMB to basal-ESC receptor CD44 for reprogramming towards chronic lung disease. These same cell and molecular control points worked directly in mouse and human basal-ESC organoids, but the findings were not yet validated in vivo in human disease. Further, persistence of GPNMB expression in moDCs and M2-macrophages in mouse models suggested utility as a long-term disease biomarker in humans. Here we show increased expression of GPNMB localized to moDC-macrophage populations in lung tissue samples from long-term Covid, asthma, and COPD. The findings thereby provide initial evidence of a persistent and correctable pathway from acute injury to chronic disease with implications for cellular reprogramming and inflammatory memory.">

        <tr id="A central signal that marshals host defense against many infections is the lymphocyte-derived cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNγ). The IFNγ receptor is expressed on most human cells and its activation leads to the expression of antimicrobial proteins that execute diverse cell-autonomous immune programs. One such immune program consists of the sequential detection, ubiquitylation, and destruction of intracellular pathogens. Recently, the IFNγ-inducible ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF213 was identified as a pivotal mediator of such a defense axis. RNF213 provides host protection against viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens. To establish infections, potentially susceptible intracellular pathogens must have evolved mechanisms that subdue RNF213-controlled cell-autonomous immunity. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that a causative agent of bacillary dysentery, Shigella flexneri, uses the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector IpaH1.4 to induce the degradation of RNF213. S. flexneri mutants lacking IpaH1.4 expression are bound and ubiquitylated by RNF213 in the cytosol of IFNγ-primed host cells. Linear (M1-) and lysine-linked ubiquitin is conjugated to bacteria by RNF213 independent of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). We find that ubiquitylation of S. flexneri is insufficient to kill intracellular bacteria, suggesting that S. flexneri employs additional virulence factors to escape from host defenses that operate downstream from RNF213-driven ubiquitylation. In brief, this study identified the bacterial IpaH1.4 protein as a direct inhibitor of mammalian RNF213 and highlights evasion of RNF213-driven immunity as a characteristic of the human-tropic pathogen Shigella.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma IDH-wildtype is highly immune suppressive and is characterized by a strong component of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). To interfere with the immune suppressive functions of MDSCs, a comprehensive understanding on how MDSCs acquire their suppressive phenotype is essential. Previously, we and others have shown a distinct Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptor expression profile for MDSCs in glioblastoma. Siglec receptors can transmit inhibitory signals comparable to PD-1 and are suggested to act as glyco-immune checkpoints. Here, we investigated how glioma specific Siglec-sialic acid interactions influence myeloid immune suppressive functions. Co-culturing monocytes with glioblastoma cells induced CD163 expression on the monocytes. Upon desialylation of the glioblastoma cells, this induction of CD163 was hampered, and furthermore, the monocytes were now able to secrete higher amounts of IL-6 and TNFα compared to fully sialylated glioblastoma cells. Additionally, Siglec-specific triggering using anti-Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 antibodies displayed a decreased TNFα secretion by the monocytes, validating the role of the Siglec–Sialic axis in the co-culture experiments. Together, our results demonstrate that glioblastoma cells induce a myeloid immune-suppressive phenotype that could be partly rescued by lowering the glioblastoma-associated sialic acid levels. This manuscript supports further research of the Siglec–Sialic acid axis in the context of glioblastoma and its potential to improve clinical outcome.">

        <tr id="Cystatin F (CstF) is a protease inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins, including those involved in activating the perforin/granzyme cytotoxic pathways. It is targeted at the endolysosomal pathway but can also be secreted to the extracellular milieu or endocytosed by bystander cells. CstF was shown to be significantly increased in tuberculous pleurisy, and during HIV coinfection, pleural fluids display high viral loads. In human macrophages, our previous results revealed a strong upregulation of CstF in phagocytes activated by interferon γ or after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). CstF manipulation using RNA silencing led to increased proteolytic activity of lysosomal cathepsins, improving Mtb intracellular killing. In the present work, we investigate the impact of CstF depletion in macrophages during the coinfection of Mtb-infected phagocytes with lymphocytes infected with HIV. The results indicate that decreasing the CstF released by phagocytes increases the major pro-granzyme convertase cathepsin C of cytotoxic immune cells from peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes. Consequently, an observed augmentation of the granzyme B cytolytic activity leads to a significant reduction in viral replication in HIV-infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Ultimately, this knowledge can be crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches to control both pathogens based on manipulating CstF.">

        <tr id="Certain somatic mutations confer a fitness advantage in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) over normal HSPCs, resulting in the clonal expansion of mutant blood cells1, otherwise known as clonal haematopoiesis (CH). CH is frequently observed among healthy elderly people and is closely associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The most frequently mutated genes of CH include DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL12. Among them, even though ASXL1 mutations are clinically associated with the highest risk for developing CVDs, little is known whether and how the mutations contribute to CVDs. Here we show accelerated development of atherosclerosis and increased inflammatory monocytes in mice transplanted with the bone marrow cells (BMCs) from the mice expressing mutant ASXL1 (ASXL1-MT) selectively in hematopoietic cells. RNA sequencing analysis of the plaque-macrophages derived from BMCs expressing ASXL1-MT showed more inflammatory signatures than those from control BMCs. Mechanistically, wild-type ASXL1 inhibited innate immune signalling through direct interactions with IRAK1/TRAF6/TAK1 in the cytoplasm, while ASXL1-MT, which only interacted with TAK1, lost this regulatory function, leading to NF-κB activation. This mechanism is unique and distinct from those of CH with Tet2 or Dnmt3a mutations, where overactivation of the IL-1β/NLRP3 inflammasome plays critical roles3–5. Intriguingly, IRAK1/4 inhibition decreased the number of inflammatory monocytes and attenuated the development of atherosclerosis driven by ASXL1-MT. The present work connects the mutations of an epigenetic factor, ASXL1, with inflammation and CVDs and gives an indication for the prevention of CVDs in CH.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cervical cancer has the second-highest mortality rate among malignant tumors of the female reproductive system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade are promising therapeutic agents, but their efficacy when combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has not been fully tested, and how they alter the tumor microenvironment has not been comprehensively elucidated. Methods In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing using 46,950 cells from nine human cervical cancer tissues representing sequential different stages of NACT and PD-1 blockade combination therapy. We delineated the trajectory of cervical epithelial cells and identified the crucial factors involved in combination therapy. Cell–cell communication analysis was performed between tumor and immune cells. In addition, THP-1-derived and primary monocyte-derived macrophages were cocultured with cervical cancer cells and phagocytosis was detected by flow cytometry. The antitumor activity of blocking CD74 was validated in vivo using a CD74 humanized subcutaneous tumor model. Results Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that NACT activated cytokine and complement-related immune responses. Cell–cell communication analysis revealed that after NACT therapy, interaction strength between T cells and cancer cells decreased, but intensified between macrophages and cancer cells. We verified that macrophages were necessary for the PD-1 blockade to exert antitumor effects in vitro. Additionally, CD74-positive macrophages frequently interacted with the most immunoreactive epithelial subgroup 3 (Epi3) cancer subgroup during combination NACT. We found that CD74 upregulation limited phagocytosis and stimulated M2 polarization, whereas CD74 blockade enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, decreasing cervical cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions Our study reveals the dynamic cell–cell interaction network in the cervical cancer microenvironment influenced by combining NACT and PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, blocking tumor-associated macrophage-derived CD74 could augment neoadjuvant therapeutic efficacy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Mucosal enrichment of the Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC) pathotype and the expansion of pathogenic IFNγ-producing Th17 (pTh17) cells have been linked to Crohn’s Disease (CD) pathogenesis. However, the molecular pathways underlying the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell transdifferentiation in CD patients remain elusive. To this aim, we created and functionally screened a transposon AIEC mutant library of 10.058 mutants to identify the virulence determinants directly implicated in triggering IL-23 production and pTh17 cell generation. pTh17 cell transdifferentiation was assessed in functional assays by co-culturing AIEC-infected human dendritic cells (DCs) with autologous conventional Th17 (cTh17) cells isolated from blood of Healthy Donors (HD) or CD patients. AIEC triggered IL-23 hypersecretion and transdifferentiation of cTh17 into pTh17 cells selectively through the interaction with CD-derived DCs. Moreover, the chronic release of IL-23 by AIEC-colonized DCs required a continuous IL-23 neutralization to significantly reduce the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell differentiation. The multi-step screenings of the AIEC mutant’s library revealed that deletion of ybaT or rfaP efficiently hinder the IL-23 hypersecretion and hampered the AIEC-dependent skewing of protective cTh17 into pathogenic IFNγ-producing pTh17 cells. Overall, our findings indicate that ybaT (inner membrane transport protein) and rfaP (LPS-core heptose kinase) represent novel and attractive candidate targets to prevent chronic intestinal inflammation in CD.">

        <tr id="Many chronic inflammatory diseases are attributed to disturbances in host-microbe interactions, which drive immune-mediated tissue damage. Depending on the anatomic setting, a chronic inflammatory disease can exert unique local and systemic influences, which provide an exceptional opportunity for understanding disease mechanism and testing therapeutic interventions. The oral cavity is an easily accessible environment that allows for protective interventions aiming at modulating the immune response to control disease processes driven by a breakdown of host-microbe homeostasis. Periodontal disease (PD) is a prevalent condition in which quantitative and qualitative changes of the oral microbiota (dysbiosis) trigger nonresolving chronic inflammation, progressive bone loss, and ultimately tooth loss. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of local sustained delivery of the myeloid-recruiting chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in murine ligature-induced PD using clinically relevant models as a preventive, interventional, or reparative therapy. Local delivery of CCL2 into the periodontium inhibited bone loss and accelerated bone gain that could be ascribed to reduced osteoclasts numbers. CCL2 treatment up-regulated M2-macrophage and downregulated proinflammatory and pro-osteoclastic markers. Furthermore, single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing indicated that CCL2 therapy reversed disease-associated transcriptomic profiles of murine gingival macrophages via inhibiting the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) signaling in classically activated macrophages and inducing protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in infiltrating macrophages. Finally, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing showed mitigation of microbial dysbiosis in the periodontium that correlated with a reduction in microbial load in CCL2-treated mice. This study reveals a novel protective effect of CCL2 local delivery in PD as a model for chronic inflammatory diseases caused by a disturbance in host-microbe homeostasis.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, is a promising treatment modality in oncology that involves augmenting the tumor-attacking capabilities of the immune system. Several preclinical and clinical studies have underscored the transformative potential of ICBs in the context of malignancies. 1 However, the efficacy of ICB therapy is often impeded by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in solid tumors, which are commonly due to a paucity of tumor neoantigens, checkpoint targets, and the inflammatory presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is profoundly immunosuppressive, which is the key reason for the limited clinical efficacy of ICB therapy. Within this milieu, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant myeloid cell subset, and their high infiltration levels have been implicated in mediating resistance to ICB therapy, thereby correlating with adverse prognosis across a spectrum of cancers. 3 Recent advances reported in Nature Cancer have shed light on specific TAM subpopulations that are instrumental in facilitating tumor immune evasion and resistance to ICB therapy. Two recent studies have delineated the roles of Sirp α + TAMs in colorectal cancer (CRC) 4 and Siglec-9 + TAMs in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. The role of plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in pediatric COVID-19 patients remains unclear.


METHODS
We isolated EVs from healthy controls (n = 13) and pediatric COVID-19 patients (n = 104) with varying severity during acute and convalescent phases using serial ultracentrifugation. EV effects on healthy PBMCs, naïve CD4+ T cells, and monocytes were assessed through in vitro assays, flow cytometry, and ELISA.


RESULTS
Our findings indicate that COVID-19 severity correlates with diverse immune responses. Severe acute cases exhibited increased cytokine levels, decreased IFNγ levels, and lower CD4+ T cell and monocyte counts, suggesting immunosuppression. EVs from severe acute patients stimulated healthy cells to express higher PDL1, increased Th2 and Treg cells, reduced IFNγ secretion, and altered Th1/Th17 ratios. Patient-derived EVs significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production by monocytes (p < .001 for mild, p = .0025 for severe cases) and decreased CD4+ T cell (p = .043) and monocyte (p = .033) populations in stimulated healthy PBMCs.


CONCLUSION
This study reveals the complex relationship between immunological responses and EV-mediated effects, emphasizing the impact of COVID-19 severity. We highlight the potential role of plasma-derived EVs in early-stage immunosuppression in severe COVID-19 patients.">

        <tr id="Background Cell energy metabolism controls the activation and function of dendritic cells (DCs). Inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells (IDECs) in skin lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD) express high-affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI) and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which mediate the generation and maintenance of inflammation. However, cellular energy metabolism and effector function of IDECs mediated by FcϵRI and TLR2 have not been fully elucidated. Methods IDECs in vitro were treated with TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 and anti-IgE alone or in combination for 24 h. Further, we analyzed the expression of cell surface activation markers, production of inflammatory factors, and cellular energy metabolism profiles of IDECs by using flow cytometry, multiplex assay, RNA sequencing, targeted energy metabolism, and seahorse assays. Results Compared to the unstimulated or anti-IgE groups, Pam3CSK4 alone or combined with anti-IgE groups significantly increased the expression of CD80, CD83, and CD86 on IDECs, but did not affect the expression of the above markers in the anti-IgE group. The release of inflammatory cytokines increased in the Pam3CSK4 alone or combined with anti-IgE groups, while there was a weak increasing trend in the anti-IgE group. The glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway of carbon metabolism was affected in all treatment groups. Furthermore, compared to the control group, we found a decrease in pyruvic acid, upregulation of PFKM, downregulation of FBP1, and increase in extracellular lactate, glycolysis rate, and glycolysis capacity after all treatments, while there was no difference between each treatment group. However, there was no difference in glycolytic reserve and mitochondrial basic and maximum respiration among all groups. Conclusion Our results indicate that glycolysis of IDECs may be activated through FcϵRI and TLR2 to upregulate inflammatory factors, suggesting that danger signals from bacteria or allergens might evoke an inflammatory response from AD through the glycolysis pathway.">

        <tr id="Introduction Chagas disease, caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite infection, is a potentially life-threatening neglected tropical disease with a worldwide distribution. During the chronic phase of the disease, there exists a fragile balance between the host immune response and parasite replication that keeps patients in a clinically-silent asymptomatic stage for years or even decades. However, in 40% of patients, the disease progresses to clinical manifestations mainly affecting and compromising the cardiac system. Treatment is recommended in the chronic phase, although there are no early markers of its effectiveness. The aim of this study is to identify differential expression changes in genes involved in the immune response in antigen-restimulated PBMC from chronic patients with Chagas disease due to benznidazole treatment. Methods Thus, high-throughput real-time qPCR analysis has been performed to simultaneously determine global changes in the expression of 106 genes involved in the immune response in asymptomatic (IND) and early cardiac manifestations (CCC I) Chagas disease patients pre- and post-treatment with benznidazole. Results and discussion The results revealed that 7 out of the 106 analyzed genes were differentially expressed (4 up- and 3 downregulated) after treatment in IND patients and 15 out of 106 (3 up- and 12 downregulated) after treatment of early cardiac Chagas disease patients. Particularly in CCC I patients, regulation of the expression level of some of these genes towards a level similar to that of healthy subjects suggests a beneficial effect of treatment and supports recommendation of benznidazole administration to early cardiac Chagas disease patients. The data obtained also demonstrated that both in asymptomatic patients and in early cardiac chronic patients, after treatment with benznidazole there is a negative regulation of the proinflammatory and cytotoxic responses triggered as a consequence of T. cruzi infection and the persistence of the parasite. This downregulation of the immune response likely prevents marked tissue damage and healing in early cardiac patients, suggesting its positive effect in controlling the pathology.">

        <tr id="The PD-1-PD-L1 immune checkpoint helps to maintain self-tolerance and prevent the development of autoimmune diseases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are successful immunotherapeutics for several cancers, but responding patients can develop immune-mediated adverse events. It is well established that PD-1 regulates CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, but its role in controlling the activation of pathogenic γδ T cells is less clear. Here we examined the role of PD-1 in regulating γδ T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. We found that PD-1 was highly expressed on CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells in the lymph node (LN) and CNS of mice with EAE. Treatment of mice with anti-PD-1 significantly augmented IL-17A-producing CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells in the LN and CNS and enhanced the severity of EAE. The exacerbating effect of anti-PD-1 on EAE was lost in Tcrd-/- mice. Conversely, ligation of PD-1 suppressed Il17a and Rorc gene expression and IL-17A production by purified Vγ4 γδ T cells stimulated via the TCR, but not with IL-1β and IL-23. Our study demonstrates that PD-1 regulates TCR-activated CD27- Vγ4 γδ T cells, but that cytokine-activated IL-17A producing γδ T cells escape the regulatory effects of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Melioidosis is a tropical infection caused by the intracellular pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, an underreported and emerging global threat. As melioidosis-associated mortality is frequently high despite antibiotics, novel management strategies are critically needed. Therefore, we sought to determine whether functional changes in the host innate and adaptive immune responses are induced during acute melioidosis and are associated with outcome. Using a unique whole blood stimulation assay developed for use in resource-limited settings, we examined induced cellular functional and phenotypic changes in a cohort of patients with bacteremic melioidosis prospectively enrolled within 24 h of positive blood culture and followed for 28 days. Compared to healthy controls, melioidosis survivors generated an IL-17 response mediated by Th17 cells and terminally-differentiated effector memory CD8+ T cells (P < .05, both), persisting to 28 days after enrolment. Furthermore, melioidosis survivors developed polyfunctional cytokine production in CD8+ T cells (P < .01). Conversely, a reduction in CCR6+ CD4+ T cells was associated with higher mortality, even after adjustments for severity of illness (P = 0.004). Acute melioidosis was also associated with a profound acute impairment in monocyte function as stimulated cytokine responses were reduced in classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes. Impaired monocyte cytokine function improved by 28-days after enrolment. These data suggest that IL-17 mediated cellular responses may be contributors to host defense during acute melioidosis, and that innate immune function may be impaired. These insights could provide novel targets for the development of therapies and vaccine targets in this frequently lethal disease.">

        <tr id="The stress kinase MAPK13 (aka p38δ-MAPK) is an attractive entry point for therapeutic intervention because it regulates the structural remodeling that can develop after epithelial barrier injury in the lung and likely other tissue sites. However, a selective, safe, and effective MAPK13 inhibitor is not yet available for experimental or clinical application. Here we identify a first-in-kind MAPK13 inhibitor using structure-based drug design combined with a screening funnel for cell safety and molecular specificity. This inhibitor (designated NuP-4) down-regulates basal-epithelial stem cell reprogramming, structural remodeling, and pathophysiology equivalently to Mapk13 gene-knockout in mouse and mouse organoid models of post-viral lung disease. This therapeutic benefit persists after stopping treatment as a sign of disease modification and attenuates key aspects of inflammation and remodeling as an indication of disease reversal. Similarly, NuP-4 treatment can directly control cytokine-stimulated growth, immune activation, and mucinous differentiation in human basal-cell organoids. The data thereby provide a new tool and potential fix for long-term stem cell reprogramming after viral injury and related conditions that require MAPK13 induction-activation. New and noteworthy This study identifies a small-molecule inhibitor for MAPK13 with efficacy and safety in models of the long-term disease that features epithelial stem cell reprogramming towards inflammation and structural remodeling. The present model has direct implications for respiratory disease triggered by viral infection and other inhaled toxins, but the tissue distribution of MAPK13 implies related actions at other epithelial barrier sites. The findings also refine a hypothesis for therapeutic intervention based on proper adjustment of MAPK13 function with a selective kinase inhibitor.">

        <tr id="Rhinovirus C (RV-C) infects airway epithelial cells and is an important cause of acute respiratory disease in humans. To interrogate the mechanisms of RV-C-mediated disease, animal models are essential. Towards this, RV-C infection was recently reported in wild-type (WT) mice, yet, titers were not sustained. Therefore, the requirements for RV-C infection in mice remain unclear. Notably, prior work has implicated human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as essential host factors for virus uptake and replication, respectively. Here, we report that even though human (h) and murine (m) CDHR3 orthologs have similar tissue distribution, amino acid sequence homology is limited. Further, while RV-C can replicate in mouse lung epithelial type 1 (LET1) cells and produce infectious virus, we observed a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of dsRNA-positive cells following hSTING expression. Based on these findings, we sought to assess the impact of hCDHR3 and hSTING on RV-C infection in mice in vivo. Thus, we developed hCDHR3 transgenic mice, and utilized adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver hSTING to the murine airways. Subsequent challenge of these mice with RV-C15 revealed significantly higher titers 24 h post-infection in mice expressing both hCDHR3 and hSTING—compared to either WT mice, or mice with hCDHR3 or hSTING alone, indicating more efficient infection. Ultimately, this mouse model can be further engineered to establish a robust in vivo model, recapitulating viral dynamics and disease.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug used in transplant recipients, inhibits graft rejection by binding to cyclophilins and competitively inhibiting calcineurin. While concerns about respiratory infections in immunosuppressed patients exist, contradictory data emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic, prompting investigations into CsA's impact on viral infections. This study explores CsA's antiviral effects on SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron BA.1, Delta variants, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) using an ex vivo model of human airway epithelium (HAE). CsA exhibited a dose‐dependent antiviral effect against the SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta variant, reducing viral load over 10 days. However, no significant impact was observed against SARS‐CoV‐2 Omicron or HPIV3, indicating a virus‐specific effect. At high concentrations, CsA was associated with an increase of IL‐8 and a decrease of IFNλ expression in infected and noninfected HAE. This study highlights the complexity of CsA's antiviral mechanisms, more likely involving intricate inflammatory pathways and interactions with specific viral proteins. The research provides novel insights into CsA's effects on respiratory viruses, emphasizing the need for understanding drug–virus interactions in optimizing therapeutic approaches for transplant recipients and advancing knowledge on immunosuppressive treatments' implications on respiratory viral infections. Limitations include the model's inability to assess T lymphocyte activation, suggesting the necessity for further comprehensive studies to decipher the intricate dynamics of immunosuppressive treatments on respiratory viral infections.">

While the exact mechanisms underlying PASC remain to be defined, hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of long COVID are varied and include (but are not limited to) dysregulated local or systemic inflammatory responses, autoimmune mechanisms, viral-induced hormonal imbalances, skeletal muscle abnormalities, complement dysregulation, novel abzymes, and long-term persistence of virus and/or fragments of viral RNA or proteins. This review article is based on a comprehensive review of the wide range of symptoms most often observed in long COVID and an attempt to integrate that information into a plausible hypothesis for the pathogenesis of PASC. In particular, it is proposed that long-term dysregulation of the gut in response to viral persistence could lead to the myriad of symptoms observed in PASC.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by immune dysregulation, including alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations and aberrant cytokine signaling. Methotrexate (MTX) is the preferred first-line treatment for RA, yet its precise mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. This study employed a multi-omics strategy—combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunophenotyping—to identify key effector peripheral immune cells and their cellular responses in RA patients over 12 weeks of MTX treatment. In our study, MTX was associated with significant immune modulation, including the restoration of naïve T and B cells and reductions in T cell memory subsets with these effects detectable as early as three weeks post-treatment. Plasmablast levels also emerged as a potential biomarker for early therapeutic response, reflecting MTX’s impact on immune homeostasis. Transcriptional analysis revealed modulation of key pathways, including TNF-α signaling, B cell receptor signaling, and T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis. Network analysis identified critical regulatory hubs, such as EGR1, JAK2, and SOCS1, in monocytes and CD4 memory T cells, highlighting these cell types as key mediators of MTX’s effects. In conclusion, these findings advance our understanding of MTX’s effects on immune cell dynamics at different stages of treatment, showing for the first time the early cellular changes leading to immune modulation in RA. Altogether, our results provide the foundation for further mechanistic investigations into MTX.">

        <tr id="While immune checkpoint inhibition (CPI) has reshaped cancer treatment, the majority of cancer patients do not benefit from this approach, which can also cause immune-related adverse events. Induction of IFNγ responses is thought be necessary for anti-tumor immunity, but growing evidence also implicates IFNγ as a tumor-intrinsic mediator of CPI resistance. CPI-induced IFNγ mediates activation-induced cell death in T cells as an immune-intrinsic mechanism of resistance. In this study, we show that transient block of IFNγ signaling through administration of the JAK1 inhibitor ABT-317 enhances anti-tumor T cell responses with CPI in pre-clinical models. Importantly, sequential but not concomitant ABT-317 treatment led to significantly reduced toxicity and improved tumor efficacy. Sequential treatment reduced activation-induced T cell death and enhanced expansion of tumor-reactive T cell subsets with increased effector function in vivo and ex vivo. Only CPI in combination with ABT-317 also enhanced memory responses by protecting mice from tumor rechallenge. These results demonstrate that JAK inhibition within a discrete time window following CPI addresses an immune-intrinsic mechanism of therapeutic resistance.">

        <tr id="Self-antigens that are obscure to immune cells under homeostasis, are exposed following tissue damage and can trigger autoimmunity. Our previous work showed that conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) mediate immunoregulation after traumatic skeletal muscle injury. Here, we found that, immune responses to injury in cDC1-depleted mice (Batf3-/-) mirror those of autoimmune mice (Aire-/-). Mechanistically, we determined that cDC1s prime killer regulatory T cells (CD8+/-Ly49+Tregs) which express Ly49 inhibitory receptors and HELIOS. These killer-like Tregs are clonally diverse and carry T cell receptors associated with self-reactivity and response to hydrophobicity. cDC1 or CD8 deletion promoted CD62L+CCR7+ naïve T cell retention and B cell recruitment to injured muscle. These naïve T cells, which are implicated in autoimmunity, strongly correlate with B cell abundance in the muscle and are selectively pruned by CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs. Furthermore, clinically used materials that promote wound healing enrich CD8+/-Ly49+ Treg function whereas those that are associated with pathology promote naïve T cell and B cell accumulation. We hypothesize that CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs maintain self-tolerance after tissue damage and avert autoimmunity by eliminating naive T cells and preventing pathogenic B cell activation.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. HPV-negative HNSCC, which arises in the upper airway mucosa, is particularly aggressive, with nearly half of patients succumbing to the disease within five years and limited response to immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to other cancers. There is a need to further explore the complex immune landscape in HPV-negative HNSCC to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here, we integrated two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from 29 samples and nearly 300,000 immune cells to investigate immune cell dynamics across tumor progression and lymph node metastasis. Notable shifts toward adaptative immune cell populations were observed in the 14 distinct HNSCC-associated peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) and 21 tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) considering disease stages. All PBMCs and TICs revealed unique molecular signatures correlating with lymph node involvement; however, broadly, TICs increased ligand expression among effector cytokines, growth factors, and interferon-related genes. Pathway analysis comparing PBMCs and TICs further confirmed active cell signaling among Monocyte-Macrophage, Dendritic cell, Natural Killer (NK), and T cell populations. Receptor-ligand analysis revealed significant communication patterns shifts among TICs, between CD8+ T cells and NK cells, showing heightened immunosuppressive signaling that correlated with disease progression. In locally invasive HPV-negative HNSCC samples, highly multiplexed immunofluorescence assays highlighted peri-tumoral clustering of exhausted CD8+ T and NK cells, alongside their exclusion from intra-tumoral niches. These findings emphasize cytotoxic immune cells as valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets, shedding light on the mechanisms by which the HNSCC sustainably evades immune responses.">

Methods We performed single-cell transcriptome coupled with T-cell/B-cell receptor (TCR/BCR) sequencing in 15 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from Omicron infection and naïve with booster vaccination. Results We found that after breakthrough infection, multiple cell clusters showed activation of the type I IFN pathway and widespread expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs); T and B lymphocytes exhibited antiviral and proinflammatory-related differentiation features with pseudo-time trajectories; and large TCR clonal expansions were concentrated in effector CD8 T cells, and clonal expansions of BCRs showed a preference for IGHV3. In addition, myeloid cells in the BA.5.2 breakthrough infection with the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV were characterized by enhanced proliferation, chemotactic migration, and antigen presentation. Discussion Collectively, our study informs the comprehensive understandings of immune characterization for Omicron breakthrough infection, revealing the positive antiviral potential induced by booster doses of vaccine and the possible "trained immunity" phenomenon in the fourth dose of aerosolized Ad5-nCoV, providing a basis for the selection of vaccination strategies.">

        <tr id="Steroid-resistant acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGVHD) is the leading life-threatening complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Novel therapeutics development is impeded by scares knowledge on biological pathways leading to steroid resistance at time of aGVHD diagnosis. To gain insight into our understanding on circulating immune cell subsets and functions at time of aGVHD, a single cell deep phenotyping and transcriptome analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with aGVHD before steroid treatment or without aGVHD. We aimed at identifying biological patterns associated with steroid resistance at early onset of aGVHD. First, circulating immune cell subsets were associated with increased incidence of aGVHD, but not with steroid sensitivity. Then, pathway analysis and inferred ligand/receptor interactions revealed major functional divergences between steroid-sensitive (SS-) and SR-aGVHD, including enrichment of TNFα activation in SR-GVHD, as well as TNF/TNFR, CCL3, CCL4 and IL18 signaling, and decreased interferon α and γ signaling pathways, suggesting that steroid resistance in an intrinsic property of immune cells before any treatment. To go deeper into the understanding of mechanisms at play during SR-aGVHD, we modeled immune trajectories within CD8+ T cells and evidenced specific direct transition, from an early naive state to a highly activated one. By contrast, SS-aGVHD involved specific gene signatures across multiple intermediate differentiation stages during cell-to-cell transitions. These findings provide evidence that steroid resistance is driven by intrinsic mechanisms already present at the onset of alloimmune response, that may serve as potential new therapeutic targets.">

To investigate the cellular and molecular aspects of inter-tissue communication during infection we established a percutaneous infection model with the tissue-migrating nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. High-dimension profiling of the initial cutaneous immune response revealed that dermal γδ T cells become activated, engage cell motility-associated transcriptional pathways and leave the skin after parasite invasion. Chemical and genetic inhibition of leukocyte migration prevents the accumulation of IL-17-producing γδ T cells in the lungs. Notably, bypassing the skin phase of infection, and therefore preventing dermal γδ T cell migration, dampens the increase in early IL-17 production in the lungs, and, instead, leads to enhanced IFN-γ responses together with increased lung damage. Collectively, our data highlights a critical skin–lung axis regulating host-parasite interactions and safeguarding lung health.">

        <tr id="Arming T cells with a synthetically orthogonal IL-9 receptor (o9R) permits facile engraftment and potent anti-tumor functions. We considered whether the paucity of natural IL-9R expression could be exploited for T cell immunotherapy given that, in mice, high doses of IL-9 were well-tolerated without discernible immune modulation. Compared to o9R, T cells engineered with IL-9R exhibit superior tissue infiltration, stemness, and anti-tumor activity. These qualities are consistent with a stronger JAK/STAT signal, which in addition to STAT1/3/5, unexpectedly includes STAT4 (canonically associated with IL-12 but not common γ-chain cytokines). IL-9R T cells are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations of proximal signaling, including structure-guided attenuation, amplification, and rebalancing of JAK/STAT signals. Biased IL-9R mutants uncover STAT1 as a rheostat between proliferative stem-like and terminally differentiated effector states. In summary, we identify native IL-9/IL-9R as a natural cytokine-receptor pair with near-orthogonal qualities and an optimal JAK/STAT signaling profile for engineered T cell therapy.">

Metabolic and immunologic dysfunction are archetypal findings in critically ill patients with sepsis, but whether these factors are mechanistically linked remains incompletely defined. We characterized functional metabolic properties of human CD4 T cells from critically ill patients with and without sepsis and healthy adults. CD4 T cells in critical illness showed increased subset-specific metabolic plasticity, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) acquiring glycolytic capacity that stabilized suppressive markers FOXP3 and TIGIT and correlated with clinical illness severity. Single-cell transcriptomics identified differential kynurenine metabolism in Tregs, which was validated ex vivo as a mechanism of Treg glycolytic adaptation and suppressive rewiring. These findings underscore immunometabolic dysfunction as a driver of CD4 T cell remodeling in sepsis and suggest therapeutic avenues to restore an effective immune response.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells play a critical role in antiviral humoral and cellular immune responses. We have previously reported that subcutaneous lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (s.c. LCMV) infection is characterized by a stark compartmentalization of CD4+ T cells, leading to strong TH1 polarization but virtually absent T follicular helper (TFH) cells, a key driver of humoral immunity. Here, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for this impaired TFH differentiation. We found that T-bet+ cells induced by s.c. LCMV infection encompass a TH1 subset expressing Granzyme-B (GzmB) and a Tcf-1+ subset that retains the potential for TFH differentiation without expressing mature TFH markers. Interestingly, IFN-γ blockade enables full differentiation of Tcf-1+ cells into TFH, formation of germinal centers and increased antibody production. Of note, the suppression of TFH cells by IFN-γ is not directly mediated through CD4+ T cells but rather involves another cell type, likely dendritic cells (DCs). Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms directing early CD4+ T cell polarization and affecting humoral responses to viruses, laying a foundation for the development of effective vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="Cells of the myeloid lineage, particularly monocytes and macrophages, play a key role in HIV infection by contributing to viral replication, immune response, and maintaining immune balance during suppressive therapy. We hypothesized that metabolic reprogramming and altered chemokine signaling in people living with HIV (PWH) on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) affect monocyte transport and polarization due to ongoing inflammation. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the mechanism of impaired monocyte/macrophage function in PWH on well-treated ART that can lead to clinical intervention strategies to improve health. Single-cell RNA sequencing, immune-phenotyping, and metabolic modeling identified altered expression of chemokine and metabolite receptors and altered metabolic flux in PWH monocytes that decreased monocyte migration. The plasma secretome revealed a nonclassical inflammatory microenvironment in PWH. Integrative multi-omics and single-cell proteomics of differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) detected metabolic reprogramming orchestrated by α-ketoglutarate (AKG) that affected macrophage function and HIV infection. Increased levels of AKG in plasma were shown to occur in PWH under ART. Therefore, when differentiating MDM with serum from PWH or AKG, macrophage function was found polarized towards an M2-like state. AKG alone was shown to increase CCR5 levels and increase HIV-1 infection in MDM. Here, we utilize systems biology-driven identification and ex vivo assays to show impaired macrophage polarization, due to metabolic training, can leads to a low-grade nonclassical inflammatory environment in well-treated PWH.">

Here, we uncover a distinct cytotoxic signature of tonsil-resident NK cells essential for targeting HIV-infected CD4⁺ T cells. Using a human tonsillar model of HIV infection and extracellular matrix-based functional assays, we identify a subset of NK cells co-expressing CD69, CD49a, CD103, and the adaptive marker NKG2C as potent effectors against autologous HIV-infected tissue CD4⁺ T cells. Both CD16⁺ and CD16⁻ NK subsets exhibited cytotoxic antiviral activity. However, HIV infection induced profound functional alterations in these NK cells, including dysregulated expression of CD9, TRAF2, ITGA1, suggesting disrupted activation, signaling, and tissue residency. Functional assays corroborated a significant impairment in the cytotoxic capacity, indicating HIV-driven NK cell dysfunction. Intriguingly, a subset of immature CD16⁻CD69⁺ NK cells underwent functional reprogramming, transitioning into a migration-competent, and metabolically primed state, driven by the upregulation of NUMAI, LCP1, SLC38A1, MT-ND2, NUMA1, MYH9, and CD44. Functional assays confirmed this transition, revealing changes in the expression of immune checkpoint receptors and a gain of cytotoxic function in these reprogrammed cells. These findings advance our understanding of NK cell biology in HIV infection and highlight novel avenues for NK-cell-based therapeutic strategies.">

Notably, CD56+CD20+ NK cells are enriched in multiple inflammatory conditions, including multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B infection, hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung cancer. Treatment with rituximab depletes this population, suggesting potential therapeutic implications. Our findings establish CD20+ NK cells as a functionally distinct lymphocyte subset with enhanced effector capabilities and tissue-homing properties, providing new insights into immune regulation in inflammatory diseases.

        <tr id="Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), either due to inherited or somatic mutation, is prevalent in colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers. While anti-PD-1 therapy is utilized in both local and advanced disease, up to 50% of MMRd CRC fail to respond. Using animal and human models of MMRd, we determined that interactions between MHC+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and TCF+ BHLHE40+ PRF1+ T cell subsets are associated with control of MMRd tumor growth, during anti-PD-1 treatment. In contrast, resistance is associated with upregulation of TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, and PD-1 expression on T cells, and infiltration of the tumor with immunosuppressive TREM2+ macrophages and monocytes. By combining anti-PD-1 with anti-LAG3/CTLA4/TREM2, up to 100% tumor eradication was achieved in MMRd CRC and remarkably, in >70% in MMRp CRC. This study identifies key T cell and macrophage subsets mediating the efficacy of immunotherapy in overcoming immune escape in both MMRd and MMRp CRC settings. Highlights Anti-PD-1 therapy leads to the accumulation and colocalization of MHCI/II+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and DCs with TCF+ CCL5+ T cells that have high TCR diversity. Resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy involves multiple T cell checkpoints, TREM2+ macrophages, IL1B+ TREM1+ monocytes and neutrophils, and IFITM+ tumor cells. Simultaneous blockade of PD-1, LAG3, CTLA-4 and TREM2 dramatically prevents progression of both MMRd and MMRp tumors. Combination therapy completely eliminates tumors by leveraging MHC+ macrophage, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell interactions, facilitating durable anti-tumor effects.">

        <tr id="Introduction Bryostatin-1, a potent agonist of the protein kinase C, has been studied for HIV and cancer therapies. In HIV research, it has shown anti-HIV effects during acute infection and reactivation of latent HIV in chronic infection. As effective CD8+ T cell responses are essential for eliminating reactivated virus and achieving a cure, it is important to investigate how bryostatin-1 affects HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. HIV-specific CD8+ T cells often become exhausted, showing reduced proliferative potential and impaired cytokine production, a dysfunction also observed in cancer. Therefore, we further investigated how bryostatin-1 directly impacts exhausted CD8+ T cells. Methods PBMCs from people with HIV (PWH) were treated with bryostatin-1 and tracked with proliferation dye for cell expansion. One day 6, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected by tetramers staining and examined by flow cytometry. By utilizing an established in vitro murine T cell exhaustion system, changes in inhibitory receptors, transcription factors, cytokine production and killing capacity of bryostatin-1 treated exhausted CD8+ T cells were determined by flow cytometry. RNA-seq analysis was performed to study transcriptional changes in these cells. Results We found that bryostatin-1 improved the expansion and decreased PD-1 expression of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Bryostatin-1 enhanced the functionality and proliferation while decreasing inhibitory receptor expression of in vitro generated exhausted CD8+ T cells. Bryostatin-1 upregulated TCF-1 and decreased TOX expression. These changes were confirmed through RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) 11 was significantly downregulated in exhausted CD8+ T cells, however, it greatly upregulated after bryostatin-1 treatment. Inhibition of MAPK11 in bryostatin-1-treated cells blocked the increased proliferation and IFN-γ production induced by bryostatin-1, but did not affect other bryostatin-1 induced effects, such as the reduction of inhibitory receptors. Discussion Our data demonstrate that bryostatin-1 induces a MAPK 11-dependent improvement in the proliferative and functional capacity of exhausted T cells. This study provides a rationale for bryostatin-1's potential to help eradicate the HIV reservoir during treatment, and it may also contribute to cancer immunotherapy by functionally improving exhausted CD8+ T cells.">

        <tr id="The identification of immune environments and cellular interactions in the colon microenvironment is essential for understanding the mechanisms of chronic inflammatory disease. Despite occurring in the same organ, there is a significant gap in understanding the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Our study aims to address the distinct immunopathological response of UC and CRC. Using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we analyzed the profiles of immune cells in colorectal tissues obtained from healthy donors, UC patients, and CRC patients. The colon tissues from patients and healthy participants were visualized by immunostaining followed by laser confocal microscopy for select targets. Natural killer (NK) cells from UC patients on medication showed reduced cytotoxicity compared to those from healthy individuals. Nonetheless, a UC-specific pathway called the BAG6-NCR3 axis led to higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and increased the cytotoxicity of NCR3+ NK cells, thereby contributing to the persistence of colitis. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), both NK cells and CD8+ T cells exhibited significant changes in cytotoxicity and exhaustion. The GALECTIN-9 (LGALS9)-HAVCR2 axis was identified as one of the CRC-specific pathways. Within this pathway, NK cells solely communicated with myeloid cells under CRC conditions. HAVCR2+ NK cells from CRC patients suppressed NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating a reduction in immune surveillance. Overall, we elucidated the comprehensive UC and CRC immune microenvironments and NK cell-mediated immune responses. Our findings can aid in selecting therapeutic targets that increase the efficacy of immunotherapy.">

Objective: To investigate the role of T cells in the immunopathology of CL by characterizing the immune landscape of skin lesions using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods: We performed scRNA-seq to profile T cells from PBMC and skin lesions of CL patients. Results: We analyzed the transcriptional profile of distinct populations of CD4+ and CD8+ migratory T cells in CL lesions. CD8+ resident T cells displayed expression of exhaustion markers and were categorized into progenitor, transitional, and terminal stages, with HAVCR2 (TIM-3) identified as a potential driver of dysfunction. Compared to psoriasis and healthy skin, CL lesions showed a reduced frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), potentially linked to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased apoptosis. We also detected double-negative (DN) gd T cells, suggesting their potential role in antigen presentation via MHC class II through TGF-b signaling. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into immune evasion mechanisms in CL, identifying TIM-3, Treg modulation, and the functional role of DN gd T cells as distinct potential targets for future immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8 T cells typically exhibit improved effector functions compared to their naive counterparts. However, under certain activation conditions, such as chronic viral infections or cancer, these cells may develop functional defects. In this study, we compared the functional quality of memory CD8 T cells generated following tumor rejection with those arising from an acute viral infection. We found that tumor-induced (Tum-CD8) memory cells exhibited a distinct phenotype and transcriptomic profile compared with viral-induced (Vir-CD8) memory cells. These memory cells are characterized by the expression of inhibitory receptors and displayed altered functions including reduced IFNγ and TNFα production as well as changes in integrin expression. Additionally, the protective capacity of Tum-CD8 memory cells was flawed relative to that of Vir-CD8 memory cells. Importantly, the functional defects of Tum-CD8 persisted upon viral recall. Together, these findings indicate that transient tumoral stimulation can imprint a stable partial exhaustion-like program on memory CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major global cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for over a million deaths annually. Despite this burden, natural immunity prevents disease in more than 90% of exposed individuals. Previous studies have identified interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as a key regulator of innate immune defense against MTB. Here, we investigate the impact of IFN-γ timing on macrophage-mediated control of MTB infection. We demonstrate that IFN-γ exposure before infection enhances macrophage antibacterial activity, whereas post-infection exposure does not. Further investigation into this phenotype revealed a strong association between c-Myc signaling and macrophage function in MTB control, as identified using unbiased in vitro systems approaches. Given the challenge of perturbing c-Myc in primary cells, we developed a lentiviral system for c-Myc inhibition and overexpression. Using a tetracycline-inducible Omomyc system - a small peptide inhibitor of c-Myc - we show that c-Myc inhibition promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype with enhanced anti-mycobacterial activity. Mechanistically, c-Myc inhibition induces metabolic reprogramming via increased mTORC1 activity, leading to upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase and improved bacterial clearance. In vivo analyses, including murine models and human clinical histopathology, reveal a strong correlation between c-Myc expression and MTB persistence, as well as active tuberculosis (TB), suggesting a role for c-Myc in immune evasion. These findings reveal c-Myc as a potential mediator of immune privilege in MTB infection and highlight its role as a promising target for novel TB therapies aimed at enhancing macrophage function. Author Summary Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), remains a major global health threat. While most people exposed to MTB successfully fight off the infection, some individuals develop active disease. Understanding how the bacteria evade immune defenses is key to developing better treatments. In this study, we identify a new role for c-Myc, a protein well-known in cancer research, in suppressing the ability of immune cells called macrophages to fight MTB. Macrophages are responsible for engulfing and killing bacteria, but we found that c-Myc interferes with this process, allowing MTB to survive. Using a small peptide inhibitor called Omomyc, we were able to block c-Myc activity, which restored macrophages’ ability to kill MTB. This effect is linked to changes in cellular metabolism, leading to the increased production of molecules essential for bacterial destruction. We also discovered that high c-Myc levels are associated with persistent MTB infection in both mouse models and human tissues. This suggests that c-Myc helps the bacteria evade immune attack, contributing to long-term infection. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism exploited by MTB to survive in the body and suggest that targeting c-Myc could be a promising approach to enhancing immune defenses against TB. By bridging insights from cancer biology and infectious disease research, our work provides a new perspective on tackling TB and highlights c-Myc as a potential therapeutic target for boosting immunity against this deadly infection.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are critical regulators of HIV immunity, but the mechanisms behind their expansion and value as a therapeutic target remain unclear. We investigated MDSC function in HIV using a humanized mouse model. Acute HIV-1 infection triggered the systemic expansion of polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), with their frequency correlating positively with plasma viral load. Notably, PMN-MDSC expansion increased further when natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were depleted, suggesting these immune cells restrain MDSC proliferation. We identified Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis as a regulatory mechanism, as MDSCs expressed high levels of TRAIL receptor 2 (R2), while NK cells and CTLs upregulated TRAIL expression during HIV infection. Treating HIV-1-infected mice with a TRAIL-R2 agonist significantly reduced MDSC levels to those of uninfected mice and significantly improved NK cell and CTL immune function. Crucially, in viremic humanized mice, the treatment prevented CD4+ T cell loss, a hallmark of HIV-1 pathogenesis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting MDSC apoptosis to mitigate CD4+ T cell depletion and enhance HIV-specific immunity, offering a new clinical target to prevent AIDS and insights into MDSC– NK/CTL cross-regulation during HIV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Attempts to activate an anti-tumor immune response in glioblastoma (GBM) have been met with many challenges due to its inherently immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The degree and mechanisms by which molecularly and phenotypically diverse tumor-propagating glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to this state are poorly defined. In this study, our multifaceted approach combining bioinformatics analyses of clinical and experimental datasets, single-cell sequencing, and molecular and pharmacologic manipulation of patient-derived cells identified GSCs expressing immunosuppressive effectors mimicking regulatory T cells (Tregs). We show that this Immunosuppressive Treg-Like (ITL) GSC state is specific to the mesenchymal GSC subset and is associated with and driven specifically by TGF-β type II receptor (TGFBR2) in contrast to TGFBR1. Transgenic TGFBR2 expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres promoted a mesenchymal transition and induced a 6-gene ITL signature consisting of CD274 (PD-L1), NT5E (CD73), ENTPD1 (CD39), LGALS1 (galectin-1), PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2), and TGFB1. This TGFBR2-driven ITL signature was identified in clinical GBM specimens, patient-derived GSCs and systemic mesenchymal malignancies. TGFBR2High GSCs inhibited CD4+ and CD8+ T cell viability and their capacity to kill GBM cells, effects reversed by pharmacologic and shRNA-based TGFBR2 inhibition. Collectively, our data identify an immunosuppressive GSC state that is TGFBR2-dependent and susceptible to TGFBR2-targeted therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Natural resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in some people with HIV (PWH) is unexplained. We performed single cell RNA-sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells, unstimulated or ex vivo stimulated with Mtb, for 7 PWH who were TST & IGRA positive (called LTBI) and 6 who were persistently TST & IGRA negative (called resisters). Alveolar macrophages (AM) from resisters displayed a baseline M1 macrophage phenotype while AM from LTBI did not. Resisters displayed alveolar lymphocytosis, with enrichment of all T cell subpopulations including IFNG-expressing cells. In both groups, mycobactericidal granulysin was expressed almost exclusively by a T cell subtype that co-expressed granzyme B, perforin and NK cell receptors. These poly-cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) over-expressed activating NK cell receptors and were increased in resister BAL. Following challenge with Mtb, only Intraepithelial Lymphocytes-like cells from LTBI participants responded with increased transcription of IFNG. AM from resisters responded with a stronger TNF signature at 6h post-infection while at 24h post-infection AM from LTBI displayed a stronger IFN-γ signature. Conversely, at 24h post-infection only AM from resisters displayed a significant upregulation of MICA transcripts which encode an activating ligand for poly-CTL. These results suggest that poly-CTL and AM mediate the resister phenotype in PWH.">

        <tr id="Background Targeting glutamine metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer therapy. However, several barriers, such as in vivo anti-tumor efficacy, drug toxicity, and safety, remain to be overcome to achieve clinical utility. Prior preclinical in vivo studies had generated encouraging data showing promises of cancer metabolism targeting drugs, although most were performed on immune-deficient murine models. It is being recognized that aside from tumor cells, normal cells such as immune cells in the tumor microenvironment may also utilize glutamine for maintaining physiological functions. To provide an in-depth view of glutamine antagonist (GLNi) treatment on the tumor immune microenvironment, the current study made several unique approaches. Method First, to evaluate GLNi treatment modality that potentially involves immune cells, the study was performed on immunocompetent murine models of gynecological cancers. Second, to enhance safety and reduce potential off-target effects, we developed a GLNi prodrug, JHU083, which is bio-activated restrictively in cancer tissues. Third, to unbiasedly decode the response of single cells in the tumor microenvironment to GLNi treatment, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on cells prepared from tumors of the JHU083 or vehicle control-treated mice. Results In both immunocompetent murine tumor models, we observed a significant anti-tumor efficacy, resulting in reduced tumor burden and impeded tumor progression. Similarly, in both tumor models, scRNA-seq revealed significantly impeded immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages by JHU083, while the treatment spared pro-inflammatory M1-like tumor macrophages. In many tumor microenvironment (TME) cells, JHU083 downregulated genes regulated by Myc and hypoxia. M2 macrophages’ greater sensitivity to glutamine antagonism when compared to M1 macrophages or monocytes was further validated on ex vivo cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages. Conclusion Our findings support a converged mechanism of glutamine metabolism antagonists. JHU083 exerted its anti-tumor efficacy through not only direct targeting of glutamine-addicted cancer cells but also by suppressing glutamine-dependent M2 macrophages, leading to a shift in the M1/M2 macrophage landscape in favor of an immune-stimulatory microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Gamma delta (γδ) T cells are innate-like lymphocytes that in humans can be broadly classified into two main subtypes based on their unique TCRδ chain, Vδ1 and Vδ2. Both subsets have potent anti-tumor properties and the presence of Vδ1 cells in the tumor is often associated with positive prognosis. Herein, we investigated the molecular interplay between immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs), IC blockade (ICB) therapy and γδ T cells. We show that ICRs display differential expression and regulation by the JAK-STAT pathway in circulating Vδ1 and Vδ2 cells and identify constitutive (e.g. TIGIT, PD-1) and inducible (e.g. TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4) ICRs. In melanoma, Vδ1 cells, especially in patients who did not respond to ICB or required combination therapy, expressed high levels of ICR, TOX and inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) transcripts, reminiscent of an exhaustion transcriptional signature. At the same time all γδ T cells had a prominent downregulation in AP-1 transcription factors. Patient derived cells were functionally competent, although induction of LAG-3 and CTLA-4 was impaired. In the context of anti-PD-1 monotherapy, Vδ1 cells specifically bound high levels of therapeutic antibody but only in patients who responded to treatment, revealing a potential new prognostic marker for evaluating the efficacy of ICB therapy. Finally, expression of KIR genes in Vδ1 cells was downregulated in response to successful ICB therapy. Collectively, our data indicate an intricate relationship between ICRs, putatively also KIRs, and γδ T cells and reveal novel approaches by which these cells can be harnessed in order to discern or improve cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia remains a major contributor to clinical complications in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, including organ injury, morbidity and mortality. Given their critical role in antiviral defense, CD8+ T cells are essential for protective immunity against CMV. Methods Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated the transcriptional signatures and developmental lineages of CD8+ T cells in eight immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who received organs from CMV-seropositive donors. Results were validated in a cohort of 62 KTRs using immunophenotyping. Results Our data revealed a significant influence of CMV serostatus on transcriptional variance of CD8+ memory T cells, associating with the first principal component from a global analysis of CD8+ T cells (p =0.0406), forming a continuum with five principal differentiation trajectories driven by CMV primary infection or reactivation. Following CMV primary infection, CD8+ T cells were hallmarked by restrained effector-memory differentiation. CD8+ T cells during CMV reactivation diverged non-linearly into senescent-like cells with signatures of arrested cell cycle, diminished translational activity and downregulated ZNF683 and longitudinally expanding effector cells with robust cytotoxic potential and upregulated ZNF683, acting as a reservoir for long-lived effector cells supporting long-term protection. Notably, CD28lo KLRG1hi IL-7R (CD127)lo HLA-DRhi CD8+ T cells present prior to the detection of viremia in CMV-seropositive patients emerged as a key feature distinguishing patients who did or did not undergo CMV reactivation after prophylaxis discontinuation (p =0.0163). Frequencies of these cells were also positively correlated with CMV-stimulated secretion of IFN-γ (p =0.0494), TNF-α (p =0.0358), MIP-1α (p =0.0262), MIP-1β (p =0.0043). Discussion These results provide insights into the transcriptional regulation that influences the generation of CD8+ T cell immunity to CMV and may inform strategics for monitoring host immune response to CMV to better identify and introduce therapeutic intervention to patients at risk of developing clinically significant CMV viremia.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors can elicit deep and durable immune responses although most cancer patients fail to experience long-term remission. There is consensus that tumor hypoxia coordinates a multitude of underlying resistance mechanisms that contribute to treatment failure. Here we show that the clinical-stage hypoxia-activated prodrug tarloxotinib lowers tumor hypoxia 8-fold in the EGFR-dependent MB49 syngeneic tumor model, attracting a effector CD8+ T cell infiltrate into an oxygen enriched tumor microenvironment, leading to potentiation of checkpoint inhibitor activity. Various methodologies, including CD8+ T cell depletion and exogenous T cell priming confirmed that tarloxotinib has a positive impact on the function of activated CD8+ T cells. Whilst anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 treatments all benefited from the remodeled tumor microenvironment, anti-PD-L1 was most responsive to tarloxotinib coadministration, providing a 100% complete response rate and >360% improvement in tumor growth delay (day 19; p<0.0001). This robust interaction was associated with MB49 tumor enrichment of CD8+ T cell infiltrate from 8% to 43% of the total CD45+ population. To further understand these promising observations, comparative RNA transcript analysis of 770 cancer/immune related genes in naïve and tarloxotinib treated tumors highlighted the strong induction of gene clusters related to co-stimulatory signaling, cytokine/chemokine signaling, interferon signaling, immune cell adhesion/migration, antigen presentation and the lymphoid/myeloid compartments. Serum protein analysis confirmed upregulation of a mixture of cytokines/chemokines, including IL-6, IL-12p40, IFNγ, G-CSF and MIP-1β, amongst others. The source of this broad immunogenic response was identified as toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) dependent, with the positive interaction between anti-PD-L1 and tarloxotinib blocked in MyD88 or TLR9 knockout mice. Further, the observed therapeutic interaction was still evident in MC38 and EG7.OVA syngeneic tumor models, both refractory to tarloxotinib by virtue of EGFR-signal independence. Consistent with the clinical experience of minimal systemic toxicities related to EGFR inhibition (e.g. diarrhea), mouse body weight loss was minimal across all in vivo studies and histopathology screening for evidence of lung fibrosis proved negative. Tarloxotinib therefore represents a systemically administered small molecule with an established clinical safety profile that is capable of activating TLR9 signaling within tumors whilst remodeling the microenvironment to facilitate efficacy of checkpoint blockade. What is already known on this topic Solid tumor resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is orchestrated through a diverse collection of hypoxia-driven mechanisms. In preclinical models modifying the tumor microenvironment (TME) to lessen hypoxia typically improves responses to ICI. What this study adds Tarloxotinib is a hypoxia-activated prodrug (HAP) of an irreversible EGFR/HER2 TKI that profoundly remodels the TME, both eliminating tumor hypoxia and elevating cytokine/chemokine production via a TLR9 dependent effect. Together, this results in a marked tumor influx of activated CD8+ T cells (and other TILs), that results in major improvements in the efficacy of ICIs, particularly anti-PD-L1. How this study might affect research, practice or policy Tarloxotinib is the first example of a tumor-targeted small molecule TLR9 stimulant that restores ICI sensitivity in a range of syngeneic tumor models. Phase I/II data has demonstrated that tarloxotinib is well tolerated, with few EGFR-dependent (on-target) side-effects, reflecting minimization of normal tissue exposure with the tumor-targeted HAP approach. Importantly, it also optimizes tumor selective exposure, offering a compelling clinical rationale for evaluation of this combination in cancer patients experiencing ICI relapse or resistance.">

However, evidence of T cell plasticity and its pathological role in human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is missing due to the lack of a reporter system. Here we utilized T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data as a molecular signatures alongside transcriptomic dataset. Using a large-scale ImmuNexUT database of autoimmune disease patients including 117 SLE cases, we quantified T cell plasticity across 13 fine-grained T cell-types. We analyzed 6,392 samples in total and identified two orthogonal signatures of repertoire and transcriptome, the cell-type and disease signatures, allowing us to investigate CD4+ T cell plasticity comprehensively. Among all possible patterns, the plasticity level was the highest in effector regulatory T cells (eTreg) to Th1 plasticity, which was replicated in an independent cohort. Moreover, eTreg-to-Th1 plasticity positively correlated with SLE disease activity. Our study provides novel evidence that Treg plasticity is involved in SLE pathology.">

        <tr id="Durable T cell immunity against cancer depends on the continual replenishment of effector CD8+ T cells. Thymic output has been correlated with favorable prognosis in cancer patients across a range of ages, suggesting that the thymus is an important source for replenishing T cells capable of controlling cancer progression. However, the effector potential of thymic mature CD8+ T cells and their regulation have not been clearly defined. In this study, we identified the ability of thymic single positive CD8+ T cells to gain effector potential after thymic selection, but they are subject to the regulation of PD-1. We found a previously undisclosed role of PD-1 in limiting both the cytotoxic and exhaustion potential of thymic and peripheral CD8+ T cells. Our results show that although PD-1 inhibition facilitates the expansion of effector CD8+ T cells, effector CD8+ cells gradually lose their antitumor activity within tumor tissues due to advanced exhaustion in the absence of PD-1. Thus, although the preset effector potential in thymic mature CD8+ T cells allows them to rapidly respond to malignant cells in the periphery, PD-1, as a checkpoint, is embedded in the thymic mature CD8+ T cells after positive selection to balance their effector function from exaggeration and exhaustion. Therefore, we propose that a strategy capable of upholding the cytotoxic capacity and avoiding exhaustion of CD8+ T cells during the early stages of PD-1 inhibition therapy is needed to achieve durable antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Radiation is used to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the locally-advanced setting. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), in particular, has shown improved outcomes against conventional RT in a number of clinical trials. One key cell type involved in the response to RT are neutrophils. These innate immune cells are the first responders to tissue damage and infiltrate irradiated tumors in high numbers to rectify injury. Neutrophils typically possess an immunosuppressive, wound healing phenotype in this scenario, which allows the tumor to recover and actively suppress immunological efforts to eradicate the disease. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of neutrophils in a murine model of PDAC treated with SBRT. Mice harboring PDAC tumors were treated with targeted SBRT and neutrophils were determined to be significantly increased in the tissue when compared to unirradiated controls. Additionally, phenotypic analysis determined that these cells were largely immunosuppressive and depletion studies confirmed they played a key role in acquired radioresistance in our model. In order to establish whether these infiltrating cells could be re-wired to contribute to anti-tumor immunity, we utilized a novel combination therapy consisting of SBRT and microspheres containing recombinant IL-12 to attempt to repolarize these cells. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed intratumoral neutrophils underwent considerable changes indicative of an immunostimulatory, anti-tumor phenotype following treatment. Moreover, depleting these cells resulted in a loss of treatment efficacy, suggesting that neutrophil re-wiring was vital for the therapeutic outcome. This study highlights neutrophils as key players in SBRT and IL-12 treatment and confirms they can act as a double-edged sword depending on the treatment employed.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8 T cells play a vital role in providing lasting immune protection, yet their origins remain incompletely understood. Contrary to classical models, emerging evidence suggests that heterogeneity within the naïve T cell pool may influence fate decisions prior to antigen encounter. However, the markers of naïve T cell heterogeneity have not yet been clearly defined. Here, we describe intraclonal heterogeneity within the naïve T cell population marked by the protein Dapl1. Using novel monoclonal antibodies and a reporter-knockout mouse model, we found that Dapl1-positive naïve CD8 T cells exhibit distinct phenotypes compared to their Dapl1-negative counterparts. Furthermore, this population includes a subset of pre-programmed precursors biased toward memory lineage fate. The differentiation of these precursors is independent of Dapl1 but relies on the transcription factor Bcl11b, resulting in the generation of Dapl1-positive central memory-like CD8 T cells in response to infection, and stem-like memory cells in response to cancer. Notably, naïve Dapl1-positive T cells originate among mature thymocytes and gradually appear in the periphery within several days after birth. Our findings suggest that committed memory precursors in the Dapl1-positive population may represent an alternative pathway for memory CD8 T cell generation, offering new avenues for therapeutic application.

Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1-/- mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1-/- animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng-/- mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1-/- animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

In people with HIV-1 (PWH), CMV is associated with persistence of the HIV-1 reservoir and particular inflammatory related co-morbidities. The true causative role of CMV in HIV-associated pathologies remains unclear given that nearly all PWH are coinfected with CMV. In this study, we examined acute phase SIV dynamics in cohorts of rhesus macaques that were seropositive or -negative for rhesus CMV (RhCMV). We observed expansion of CCR5+ target CD4+ T cells in gut and lymph nodes (LN) that existed naturally in RhCMV-seropositive animals, the majority of which did not react to RhCMV lysate. These cells expressed high levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and a ligand for this receptor, CXCL9, was systemically elevated in RhCMV-seropositive animals. RhCMV+ RMs also exhibited higher peak SIV viremia. CCR5 target memory CD4 T cells in the gut of RhCMV+ RMs were maintained during acute SIV and this was associated with greater seeding of SIV DNA in the intestine. Overall, our data suggests the ability of RhCMV to regulate chemotactic axes that direct lymphocyte trafficking and promote seeding of SIV in a diverse, polyclonal pool of memory CD4+ T cells.">

While designed for application to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the inclusion of CD45 coupled with the ability to extract cellular autofluorescence spectral signatures enables the application of this panel to other tissue types. Of the 30 total markers, this panel employs 18 markers to profile T cell subsets consisting of different memory subsets and T helper polarities, > 10 markers to profile B cell subsets including double-negative B cells, and a total of 8 lineage markers to identify immune lineages including monocyte and natural killer cell subsets, conventional dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and basophils. This panel reproducibly identifies target populations with excellent resolution over several months of data acquisition with minimal batch effects, offering investigators a practical approach to sort immune cell subsets of interest for downstream applications while simultaneously collecting high parameter immunophenotypic information using a limited sample quantity.">

        <tr id="Uncertainty persists regarding the contribution of tissue macrophages to HIV reservoirs, largely due to insufficient characterization of these reservoirs within their native tissue microenvironments. This study aimed to characterize and quantify macrophage reservoirs in human lymph node (LN) tissues in terms of their phenotype, location, and their potential for sustained productive infection during suppressive antiretroviral therapy. We examined the topology, nature, and size of macrophage reservoirs in lymph nodes (LNs) from 45 PLWH subtype C on suppressive ART and 14 matched controls using in situ imaging and multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy. Germinal center CD68+ macrophages harbored HIV gag-pol DNA, HIV gag-pol RNA and Gagp24 protein. Digital droplet PCR confirmed the presence of proviral reservoirs in myeloid cells within LNs. High-resolution imaging techniques revealed that infected macrophages within GCs displayed distinct morphological characteristics, featuring larger and irregular shapes. In contrast, phagocytic macrophages exhibited intracellular staining for CD4+ T cells, had regular shapes, and were predominantly found outside the GCs. Our findings provide detailed quantitative, spatial, and phenotypic characterization of macrophage reservoirs in LNs, offering a clear estimation of the extent to which macrophages contribute to persistent HIV reservoirs in these tissues. These findings establish a basis for developing targeted strategies aimed at the elimination of these reservoirs in LN tissues. Author summary HIV hides in reservoirs within immune cells across the body in the blood and various tissues, making it a complex challenge to cure. Therefore, it is essential to identify and understand all sources of HIV reservoirs aid the development of an HIV cure. Macrophages are increasingly recognized as key contributors of viral reservoir persistence. However, the role of macrophages as latent HIV reservoirs remains unclear due to limited studies in human tissues. In this study we investigated macrophage reservoirs in human lymph nodes to answer key questions: where do they hide, how can we identify them, what is their contribution to the lymph node reservoir burden, and are they truly able to support productive viral replication? We found that macrophages residing within lymph node germinal centers, identified by CD68 expression, contained HIV DNA, RNA, and Gagp24 protein. Moreover, using high resolution microscopy, we were able to distinguish between productively infected macrophages from those that engulfed T cells. By unveiling these unique features of macrophage reservoirs, our research paves the way for the design of targeted therapy aimed at eliminating these reservoirs, towards an HIV cure.">

        <tr id="The CD2-CD58 pathway has been highlighted as a major player in anti-tumour T cell immunity. Our study reveals that CD2 costimulation strength significantly correlates with T cell activation, the average number of cell divisions, fold expansion, and IFN-γ production. Our findings suggest that the correlation of CD2 strength with the level of CD25 expression is a potential regulatory mechanism by which CD2 strength enhances above proliferation parameters. We find that human brain cancer tumour-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells exhibit reduced levels of CD2, suggestive of a compromised CD2 strength upon CD2 engagement. Through a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, we identified two epigenetic regulators, SUZ12 and BAP1, as positive modulators of CD2 expression. We demonstrate that BAP1 is crucial for the upregulation and sustained high expression of CD2 following T cell activation. We reveal that CD2 is co-regulated with other co-stimulatory/inhibitory receptors, and factors associated with T cell stemness and exhaustion, in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, we rescue the loss of CD2 due to BAP1 knockout by pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylases making this a harnessable regulatory pathway. The insight from our study enhance our understanding of CD2-mediated T cell regulation and identify essential regulators of this pathway.">

        <tr id="LAIR1 is an inhibitory receptor broadly expressed on human immune cells, including B cells. LAIR1 has been shown to modulate BCR signaling, however, it is still unclear whether its suppressive activity can be a negative regulator for autoreactivity. In this study, we demonstrate the LAIR1 expression profile on human B cells and prove its regulatory function and relationships to B cell autoreactivity. We show that both the frequency and level of LAIR1 expression decreases during B cell differentiation. LAIR1 expressing (LAIR1+) switched memory (SWM) B cells have a transcriptional profile less differentiated toward a plasma cell (PC) phenotype, harbor more autoreactive B cells and exhibit less PC differentiation in vitro than the LAIR1 negative (LAIR1-) counterpart. These data suggests that LAIR1 functions as a B cell tolerance checkpoint. We confirm previous data showing that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) express less LAIR1 on B cells, implying a breakdown of the checkpoint, consistent with the enhanced PC differentiation seen in SLE. We further demonstrate that LAIR1 expression is down-regulated through the IL-21/STAT3 pathway which is known to be upregulated in SLE. These data suggest therapeutic targets that might decrease the aberrant PC differentiation observed in SLE.">

        <tr id="Malaria causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, disproportionately impacting sub-Saharan Africa. Disease phenotypes associated with Plasmodium falciparum infection can vary widely, from asymptomatic to life-threatening. To date, prevention efforts, particularly those related to vaccine development, have been hindered by an incomplete understanding of which factors impact host immune responses resulting in these divergent outcomes. Here, we conducted a field study of 224 individuals to determine host-parasite factors associated with symptomatic malaria “patients” compared to asymptomatic malaria-positive “controls” at both the community and healthy facility levels. We further performed comprehensive immune profiling to obtain deeper insights into differences in response between the pair. First, we determined the relationship between host age and parasite density in patients (n = 134/224) compared to controls (n = 90/224). Then, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the immunological phenotypes of 18,176 peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from a subset of the participants (n = 11/224), matched on age, sex, and parasite density. Patients had higher parasite densities compared to the controls, although the levels had a negative correlation with age in both groups, suggesting that they are key indicators of disease pathogenesis. On average, patients were characterized by a higher fractional abundance of monocytes and an upregulation of innate immune responses, including those to type I and type II interferons and tumor necrosis factor-alpha signaling via NFκB. Further, in the patients, we identified more putative interactions between antigen-presenting cells and proliferating CD4 T cells, and naïve CD8 T cells driven by MHC-I and MHC-II signaling pathways, respectively. Together, these findings highlight transcriptional differences between immune cell subsets associated with disease phenotypes that may help guide the development of improved malaria vaccines and new therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Current immunosuppressants effectively suppress adaptive and innate immune responses, but their broad, antigen-non-specific effects often result in significant complications. Here, we conducted a systematic investigation of drug effects on gut microbiome, metabolic pathways, lymphoid architecture and lymphocyte trafficking of four major immunosuppressants classes including tacrolimus, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and Fingolimod (FTY). We show that immunosuppressants induced progressive alterations in the gut microbiome and metabolic pathways, where initial drug-specific effects converged by day 30 into a common dysbiotic state enriched in Muribaculaceae. Gut transcriptome analyses revealed minimal overlap in differentially expressed genes between early and late time points, indicating transient early effects and marked late-stage changes induced by these drugs. These microbiome and metabolic shifts were accompanied by time-dependent changes in lymph node (LN) organization and cellular composition, transitioning between pro-tolerogenic and pro-inflammatory states. Under alloantigen-stimulated conditions, MMF and FTY suppressed inflammation through dual regulation of regulatory T cells and LN remodeling, mediated through LN stromal cell-derived laminins. Together, our findings highlight previously underappreciated temporal dynamics in immunosuppressant mechanisms, linking immune tissue organization, gut microbiome and intestinal responses to long-term immunosuppression and metabolic complications in transplant patients.">

The nutrient-limited conditions of the TME, particularly the scarcity of glucose, amino acids, and lipids, challenge cancer cell survival1–4. However, the metabolic constraints faced by immune and stromal cells in comparison to cancer cells, and how these limitations affect therapeutic outcomes, remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce Dual Ribosome Profiling (DualRP), a method that allows for simultaneous analysis of translation and identification of ribosome stalling, revealing amino acid shortages in different cell types within tumors. Using DualRP, we uncover that interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts trigger an inflammatory response, mitigating amino acid limitations during glucose starvation. In immunocompetent mouse models, we observe that immune checkpoint blockade therapy induces serine and glycine restrictions specifically in T cells, but not in cancer cells. We further demonstrate that these amino acids are essential for optimal T cell function both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting their critical role in effective immunotherapy. Our findings show that therapeutic interventions create distinct metabolic demands across different tumor cell types, with nutrient availability significantly influencing the success of immunotherapy. DualRP’s ability to explore cell type-specific metabolic vulnerabilities offers a promising tool for advancing our understanding of tumor biology and improving therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is a debilitating pulmonary disorder that occurs due to persistent exposure to beryllium (Be) particles in the workplace. Be-exposure causes activation of the innate immune system, resulting in the secretion of interleukins and chemokines that drive the accumulation of B and T cells in the lungs. However, the mechanisms by which innate molecules influence the recruitment of B cells and B cell-mediated protection in CBD are poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiple approaches to examine the role of innate immune signaling and CD4+ T cells in B cell recruitment and function in the lungs. We show that the absence or blocking of IL-1R1 signaling prevents the recruitment of B cells to the lungs of BeO-exposed mice. Additionally, we show that B cell recruitment to the lungs depends on the chemokine receptor, CXCR5, and CD4+ T cells. In BeO-exposed mice, lung B cells down-regulate IgM but showed an increased IgD and CD44 surface expression. Further, RNA sequencing of pulmonary tissue-specific B cells in CBD revealed distinct gene signatures compared to splenic B cells, with increased expression of pathways involved in antigen presentation, tight junction interactions, and interferon signaling. Overall, our study shows that B cell recruitment and aggregate formation during CBD depend on sequential activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.">

As NLRC5 deficiency does not abrogate CD8+ T cell development, we investigated whether NLRC5-dependent antitumor immune mechanisms are required for immune surveillance. Development of 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced endogenous fibrosarcoma was studied in Nlrc5-/- mice with Nlrc5+/+ and Rag1-/- mice serving as controls. Nlrc5-/- and Rag1-/- mice showed increased propensity to develop MCA-induced tumors with elevated growth rate compared to Nlrc5+/+ mice, and displayed significantly reduced survival. Tumors from Nlrc5+/+ and Nlrc5-/-mice, but not from Rag1-/- mice, contained necrotic areas and displayed T cell infiltration. Tumor cell lines established from MCA- induced tumors were evaluated for their sensitivity to immune-mediated growth control following implantation into immunocompetent C57BL/6 and immunodeficient Rag1-/- hosts. Tumors formed by Nlrc5+/+ tumor cell lines progressed unhindered in C57BL/6 hosts that reflected their immunoedited status, whereas cell lines from Nlrc5-/- and Rag1-/-tumors were efficiently controlled, indicating their non-immunoedited status. Proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry followed by pathway analysis revealed enrichment of granzyme-mediated cytolytic pathway in Nlrc5+/+ tumors that were absent in Nlrc5-/- tumors, which showed enrichment of humoral and innate immune pathways. Overall, our findings show that NLRC5 is required for robust tumor immune surveillance and tumor immunoediting and that compensatory humoral and innate immune mechanisms activated by the loss of NLRC5 are insufficient for cancer immune surveillance and cancer immunoediting.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes (CTL) are crucial in antiviral immune responses. However, their recruitment to infection sites renders them at risk of viral infection that could modulate their effector activity. CTL express RIG-I that detects cytosolic viral RNA and subsequently induce antiviral gene expression. Here, we investigated how influenza A virus (IAV) infection influence TCR-dependent effector responses. IAV infection of CTL stimulated RIG-I, and activated downstream pathways including TBK1 and NF-⍰B, resulting in type-I interferon secretion. Transfection of CTL with a pure RIG-I ligand, tri-phosphorylated double stranded RNA(3p-dsRNA), not only stimulated these pathways but also enhanced CTL proliferation in vitro and protected them from IAV infection. Analogous with a positive effect on CD8 effector function, both IAV infection and RIG-I ligand transfection enhanced CTL degranulation and cytokine secretion. Conversely, activation of CTL via CD3/CD28-crosslinking increased their susceptibility to IAV infection. Altogether, RIG-I stimulation either by IAV infection or 3p-dsRNA transfection promoted cell intrinsic antiviral pathways and enhanced CD8 effector functions. These findings suggest that RIG-I agonists could enhance and prolong CTL effector function in immunotherapy.">

The abundance of γδ T cell infiltration is linked to a positive prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. The tumor-inhibiting role of γδ T cells was played through intrinsic lineage evolution, acquiring cytotoxic functions and engaging in signal transduction with antigen-presenting cells. Furthermore, patients with higher γδ T cells infiltration abundance might be more favorable for immunotherapy. Lastly, we established a predictive model using CT images based on radiomics, providing a non-invasive strategy to assess γδ T cells infiltration in LUAD patients.

        <tr id="Neutrophils are the major cellular constituent of blood leukocytes and play a central role in the inflammatory response, producing an array of destructive molecules and antimicrobial proteases that characterise the cells as front-line defenders of the innate immune system, crucial to host defence. It is now appreciated that neutrophils produce and respond to a variety of inflammatory signals and are able to regulate both the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the mechanisms by which neutrophils respond to different inflammatory signals to regulate their own function and the functions of other immune cells are incompletely defined. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing with bioinformatics analysis of healthy human neutrophils exposed for 1h to a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. GM-CSF and TNFα induced significant changes in expression in the most transcripts including activation of genes regulating apoptosis and genes encoding cytokines and chemokines that can drive the differentiation and activation of CD4 T cells. Stimulation of neutrophils with G-CSF, IFNα, IFNγ, IL-1β, or IL-8 resulted in expression of discrete gene sets and differential activation of signalling pathways including changes in cell adhesion and migration, immune receptor expression, apoptosis, and production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. This work defines the differential gene expression patterns in neutrophils exposed to different regulatory cytokines. This is important in both increasing our understanding of the role of neutrophils in driving innate and adaptive immune responses and, importantly, for deconvoluting the neutrophil gene expression signatures observed in inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Asthma is orchestrated by an aberrant immune response involving a complex interplay between multiple inflammatory cell types. An increase in Th2 cells in the asthmatic airway is a hallmark of asthma, and biologics blocking their effector functions have been life‐changing for many severe asthma patients who poorly respond to immunosuppression by corticosteroids. However, studies in the past decade have highlighted not only other cell types that also produce Th2 cytokines boosting the Type 2/T2 phenotype but also a heightened IFN‐γ response, primarily from T cells, referred to as a Type 1/T1 immune response. Data derived from studies of immune cells in the airways and mouse models of severe asthma suggest a role of IFN‐γ in corticosteroid resistance, airway hyperreactivity, and also airway remodeling via effects on other cell types including mast cells, eosinophils, airway epithelial cells, and airway smooth muscle cells. The simultaneous presence of T1 and T2 immune responses is detectable in the sickest of asthma patients in whom corticosteroids suppress the T2 but not the T1 response. This article has reviewed our current understanding of the complex T1–T2 interplay in severe asthma highlighting mediators that impact both arms which may be targeted alone or in combination for disease alleviation.">

        <tr id="Staphylococcus aureus poses an enormous burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Making an efficacious vaccine has however proven extremely challenging. Due to colonizing interactions, pre-existing S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells are often found in the human population and yet a detailed characterization of their phenotypes and how they might in turn impact vaccine efficacy are thus far unknown. Using an activation induced marker assay to sort for S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells in an effector function-independent manner, single cell transcriptomic analysis was conducted. Remarkably, S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells consisted not only of a broader spectrum of conventional T cells (Tcon) than previously described but also of regulatory T cells (Treg). As compared to polyclonally-activated CD4+ T cells, S. aureus-specific Tcon were enriched for the expression of the Th17-type cytokine genes IL17A, IL22 and IL26, while higher percentages of S. aureus-specific Treg expressed the T Cell Immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), a pleiotropic immune checkpoint. Notably, the antagonistic anti-TIGIT mAb Tiragolumab increased IL-1β production in response to S. aureus in vitro. Therefore, these results uncover the presence of S. aureus-specific TIGIT+ Treg in the blood of healthy subjects that could blunt responses to vaccination and indicate TIGIT as a potential targetable biomarker to overcome pre-exposure-induced immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="The current approach to minimize transplant-associated complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) includes long-term pharmacological immune suppression frequently accompanied by unwanted side effects. Advances in targeted immunotherapies regulating alloantigen responses in the recipient continue to reduce the need for pan-immunosuppression. Here, in vivo targeting of the TNF superfamily receptor 25 (TNFRSF25) and the high affinity IL-2 receptor with a TL1A-Ig fusion protein and low dose IL-2, respectively, was used to pretreat recipient mice prior to allogeneic-HSCT (aHSCT). Pretreatment induced Treg expansion persisting early post-aHSCT leading to diminished GVHD and improved transplant outcomes. Expansion was accompanied by an increase in frequency of stable and functionally active Tregs as evidenced by in vitro assays using cells from major GVHD target tissues including colon, liver, and eye. Importantly, pretreatment supported epithelial cell function/integrity, a diverse microbiome including reduction of pathologic bacteria overgrowth and promotion of butyrate producing bacteria, while maintaining physiologic levels of obligate/facultative anaerobes. Notably, using a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor agonist to sequester T cells in lymphoid tissues, we found that the increased tissue Treg frequency included resident CD69+CD103+FoxP3+ hepatic Tregs. In contrast to infusion of donor Treg cells, the strategy developed here resulted in the presence of immunosuppressive target tissue environments in the recipient prior to the receipt of donor allo-reactive T cells and successful perseveration of GVL responses. We posit strategies that circumvent the need of producing large numbers of ex-vivo manipulated Tregs, may be accomplished through in vivo recipient Treg expansion, providing translational approaches to improve aHSCT outcomes.

        <tr id="Background Glioblastoma, associated with poor prognosis and impaired immune function, shows potential interactions between newly identified disulfidptosis mechanisms and T cell exhaustion, yet these remain understudied. Methods Key genes were identified using Lasso regression, followed by multivariate analysis to develop a prognostic model. Single-cell pseudotemporal analysis explored disulfidptosis T-cell exhaustion (Tex) signaling in cell differentiation. Immune infiltration was assessed via ssGSEA, while transwell assays and immunofluorescence examined the effects of disulfidptosis-Tex genes on glioma cell behavior and immune response. Results Eleven disulfidptosis-Tex genes were found critical for glioblastoma survival outcomes. This gene set underpinned a model predicting patient prognosis. Single-cell analysis showed high disulfidptosis-Tex activity in endothelial cells. Memory T cell populations were linked to these genes. SMC4 inhibition reduced LN299 cell migration and increased chemotherapy sensitivity, decreasing CD4 and CD8 T cell activation. Conclusions Disulfidptosis-Tex genes are pivotal in glioblastoma progression and immune interactions, offering new avenues for improving anti-glioblastoma therapies through modulation of T cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="Introduction Ovarian cancer (OC) is the sixth most common malignancy in women and the poor 5-year survival emphasises the need for novel therapies. NK cells play an important role in the control of malignant disease but the nature of tumour-infiltrating and peripheral NK cells in OC remains unclear. Methods Using flow cytometric analysis, we studied the phenotype and function of NK cells in blood, primary tumour and metastatic tissue in 80 women with OC. The cell type contexture of metastatic OC tissue was explored utilising scRNAseq analysis, with a focus on portraying an immunogenic tumour microenvironment and determining the characteristics of a dysfunctional NK cell population. Results The proportion of peripheral NK cells was markedly elevated with a highly activated profile and increased cytotoxicity. In contrast, NK cell numbers in primary tumour and metastasis were substantially reduced, with downregulation of activatory receptors together with elevated PD-1 expression. scRNA-Seq identified 5 NK cell subpopulations along with increased exhausted and immature NK cells within tumour tissue compared to normal tissue. These features were attenuated following chemotherapy where higher levels of activated and cytotoxic NK cells associated with improved disease-free survival. Correlation of NK cell phenotype with clinical outcomes revealed high levels of DNAM-1 expression on tissue-localised and peripheral NK cells to be associated with reduced survival. Expression of PVR, the DNAM-1 ligand, was significantly increased on tumours and DNAM-1 mediated NK cell lysis of primary tumour tissue was observed in vitro. Discussion These findings reveal profound modulation of the tumour tissue and systemic profile of NK cells which likely contributes to the high rates of local progression and metastasis seen with OC. Immunotherapeutic approaches that overcome local immune suppression and enhance DNAM-1-targeted lysis of OC offer the potential to improve disease control.">

        <tr id="The discovery of immune checkpoints and the rapid growth of immuno-oncology (IO) have sparked tremendous efforts to utilize the immune system to treat a wide range of cancer types/subtypes. While the major focus of IO over the past decades has been to manipulate the adaptive immune system, recent attention has been given to manipulating the innate immune system to treat cancer and/or to enhance adaptive responses. In this work we detail the intracellular protein, Dual Specificity Phosphatase 11 (DUSP11), as an innate immune checkpoint (iIC) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Expression of this atypical phosphatase is correlated with patient survival for multiple cancer types, and we show here that its activity is important for the viability of lung cancer cells in vitro. Specifically, we demonstrate that DUSP11 knockdown in LUAD cells induces apoptosis and an innate immune response capable of activating other cells in vitro, and we provide evidence that these phenotypes are primarily mediated by the pattern recognition receptor, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I). Finally, we show that expression of DUSP11 is important for tumor engraftment and growth of human LUAD in mice. Overall, these data are the first to establish DUSP11 as an immunosuppressive, pro-neoplastic, and potentially targetable protein in LUAD. In addition, our data suggests that the anti-cancer mechanisms induced by diminishing the activity of DUSP11 are likely to be generalizable to other cancer types such as breast cancer, warranting future investigation and therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potent NK cell-stimulating cytokine, but the presence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) can inhibit IL 12-induced NK-cell cytotoxicity. Thus, we hypothesized that trabectedin, a myeloid cell-depleting agent, would improve the efficacy of IL-12 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In vitro treatment of healthy donor NK cells with trabectedin increased expression of the activation marker CD69 and mRNA expression of T BET (Tbx21), the cytotoxic ligands TRAIL (TNFSF10) and Fas ligand (FASLG) and the dendritic cell (DC)-recruiting chemokine lymphotactin (XCL1). The combination of IL-12 and trabectedin increased NK-cell cytotoxicity, activation and production of IFN-γ, TNF-α and granzyme B in the presence of human TNBC cells. Treatment of 4T1 and EMT6 tumor-bearing mice with IL-12 and trabectedin led to a significant reduction in tumor burden compared to single-agent controls, and the highest levels of plasma IFN-γ, intratumoral CD8+ T cells and conventional type 1 DC. MDSC and M2-like macrophages were significantly decreased with combination therapy. NK-cell depletion abrogated the effects of combination therapy, as did elimination of CD8+ T cells. NK-cell depletion led to lower levels of the NK cell-derived chemokine CCL5 and the DC-derived chemokine CXCL10, higher tumor burden, and decreased intratumoral CD8+ T cells. IL 12 and trabectedin also significantly enhanced the response of TNBC to anti-PD-L1 therapy. These data suggest that MDSC depletion augments the ability of IL-12-activated NK cells to drive the infiltration of DC and CD8+ T cells into TNBC for an antitumor effect.">

        <tr id="While pediatric cancer patients receive intensive chemotherapy, its impact on peripheral T cells and subsequently to disease outcomes are not fully characterized. Here, we assessed T-cell dynamics during treatment, identifying associations with outcomes through immune phenotyping and T-cell Receptor (TCR) sequencing in pediatric solid and hematologic malignancies. We show that while levels of immune checkpoint proteins (PD-1, LAG3, and TIM3) at baseline were highest in lymphomas compared to other cancer groups, they increased significantly in response to therapy in all cancers. Levels of Central Memory (CM) T cells increased in leukemias and solid tumors, while naïve T cells and cell-free TCR diversity decreased in lymphomas. By combining immune cell and TCR repertoire features across all timepoints, we proposed the Dynamic Immunogenomic Score (DIS) to measure patient-specific effects of therapy on the peripheral T-cell population. Higher DIS was associated with high-risk cancer types and logistic regression analysis revealed it may predict incidence of relapse in leukemia patients. TCR specificity analysis revealed patient-specific clonal dynamics and differential detection of virally-associated TCRs in cancer patients compared to healthy individuals. Our results highlight the potential of early upfront immunogenomic profiling in identifying high-risk patients that may be predictive in light of emerging cellular immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Introduction We investigated the impact of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associated cytokines and standard of care (SOC) RA therapeutics on immune checkpoint receptor (IR) expression on T cells to gain insights to disease pathology and therapeutic avenues. Methods We assessed IR expression by flow cytometry on T cell receptor activated T cells cultured in the presence of exogenously added single cytokines or RA patient synovial fluid. We also assessed RA synovial fluid stimulated samples in the presence of various single cytokine neutralizing antibodies or SOC therapeutics, including glucocorticoids, TNF, IL-6 receptor and JAK inhibitors. In addition to IR expression, we measured the impact on cytokine secretion profiles. Results RA-associated cytokines modulated IR expression, suggesting a role for these cytokines in regulation of disease pathology. By dissecting the influence of various inflammatory drivers within the RA inflammatory milieu, we discovered distinct regulation of IR expression by various cytokines including IL-10, IFNα/β, and TNF. Specifically, increased expression of TIM-3, PD-1, LAG-3 and CD28 in response to RA synovial fluid was driven by key cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IFNs, and TNF. In addition, SOC RA therapeutics such as glucocorticoids and TNF inhibitors modulated IR and cytokine expression in the presence of RA synovial fluid. Conclusions This study points to an important and intricate relationship between cytokines and IRs in shaping immune responses in autoimmune pathology. The modulation of IR expression by RA-associated cytokines and SOC therapeutics provides new insights for the use of targeted treatments in managing RA pathology.">

        <tr id="HIV persists in diverse tissues, with distinct cellular reservoirs presenting a major barrier to a cure and requiring targeted therapeutic strategies to address this heterogeneity. Here, we developed tissue models of HIV latency using human tonsillar, intestinal and cervicovaginal tissues. These models revealed differential HIV infection across CD4+ T cell subpopulations, with ART partially restoring CD4+ T cells and reducing intact HIV DNA. T follicular helper cells (TFH CD69+ CCR7-) were the primary inducible reservoir in tonsils, while tissue-resident memory cells (TRM CD69+ CD49a+) dominated in the intestine. Identification of markers for inducible reservoirs revealed that CD69, CD45RO, and PD-1 were shared across tissues, while CXCR5 in the tonsils and CD49a in the intestine served as tissue-specific markers. Furthermore, using different latency reversal agents (LRAs) we found that Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDACis) failed to induce HIV in any tissue, the SMAC mimetic AZD5582 was effective only in a resident-memory CD4+ T cell subpopulation in the intestine, and IL15 exhibited the broadest reactivation potential across tissues and CD4+ T subsets. These models recapitulate key aspects of HIV infection providing insights into the inducible reservoir’s composition in different tissues and informing strategies for its elimination.">

        <tr id="Antibody production is central to protection against new pathogens and cancers, as well as to certain forms of autoimmunity. Antibodies often originate in the lymph node (LN), specifically at the extrafollicular border of B cell follicles, where T and B lymphocytes physically interact to drive B cell maturation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts. In vitro models of this process are sorely needed to predict aspects of the human immune response. Microphysiological systems (MPSs) offer the opportunity to approximate the lymphoid environment, but so far have focused primarily on memory recall responses to antigens previously encountered by donor cells. To date, no 3D culture system has replicated the engagement between T cells and B cells (T—B interaction) that leads to antibody production when starting with naïve cells. Here, we developed a LN-MPS to model early T—B interactions at the extrafollicular border built from primary, naïve human lymphocytes encapsulated within a collagen-based 3D matrix. Within the MPS, naïve T cells exhibited CCL21-dependent chemotaxis and chemokinesis as predicted. Naïve T and B cells were successfully skewed on chip to an early T follicular helper (pre-Tfh) and activated state, respectively, and co-culture of the latter cells led to CD38+ plasmablast cells and T cell dependent production of IgM. These responses required differentiation of the T cells into pre-Tfhs, physical cell-cell contact, and were sensitive to the ratio at which pre-Tfh and activated B cells were seeded on-chip. Dependence on T cell engagement was greatest at a 1:5 T:B ratio, while cell proliferation and CD38+ signal was greatest at a 1:1 T:B ratio. Furthermore, plasmablast formation was established starting from naïve T and B cells on-chip. We envision that this MPS model of primary lymphocyte physiology will enable new mechanistic analyses of human humoral immunity in vitro.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant neoplasm globally, with an increased death rate despite recent advancements in research and therapeutic options. Different molecular subtypes of GC have distinct interactions with the immune system, impacting the tumor microenvironment (TME), prognosis, and reaction to immunotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the TME are crucial for preventing tumor growth and metastasis, as evidenced by research showing that patients with GC who have a significant density of TILs have better survival rates. But cancer cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, both sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) playing a pivotal role in the development of an immunosuppressive TME. They prevent T cell activation and proliferation resulting in a decrease in the immune system’s capacity to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. These immune checkpoint molecules function via different but complementary mechanisms, the expression of Siglec-15 being mutually exclusive with PD-L1 and, therefore, providing a different therapeutic approach. The review explores how TILs affect tumor growth and patient outcomes in GC, with particular emphasis on their interactions within the TME and potential targeting of the PD-L1 and Siglec-15 pathways for immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Development of novel vaccines and treatment approaches against tuberculosis are hampered by limited knowledge of what constitutes a protective immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Granulomas are organized immune aggregates that form in the lung in response to mycobacterial infection and are an important site of pathogen-host interaction. The composition and cellular microenvironment within the granuloma impacts the bacterial control capacity. To identify protective responses in granulomas, imaging mass cytometry was used to study archived lung tissue from low dose Mtb-infected non-human primates presenting with various levels of disease. This approach revealed that granuloma composition is correlated with the severity of lung pathology. Granulomas of animals with limited lung pathology were enriched for NK cells showing increased interactions with tissue macrophages. This work improves our understanding of local immune interactions in the lung and how these correlate with severity of tuberculosis disease. Author summary Tuberculosis remains the deadliest infectious disease in the world with 10 million new infections and 1.5 million deaths annually. The existing vaccine is not effective enough to halt the tuberculosis epidemic. In order to develop an improved vaccine, more complete and detailed knowledge on the immune responses that can successfully protect against tuberculosis is required. Individuals that are exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes tuberculosis disease, fall along a spectrum, with some individuals showing a strong innate capacity to protect against disease, while others fall ill. By studying these differences in a model organism, namely non-human primates, we can learn about protective immune responses. In primates with limited disease, the immune cell aggregates surrounding the bacteria in the lung contained more NK cells than were found in severe disease. In addition, interactions between NK cells and macrophages, cells that can eat bacteria, were seen a lot more in protected animals. This suggests that the interaction between NK cell and macrophages contributes to controlling tuberculosis disease, this knowledge can contribute to improved vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="Mucosal-associated invariant T cells are highly conserved innate-like T cells in mammals recognized for their high baseline frequency in human blood and cytotoxic effector functions during infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer. While the majority of these cells express a conserved CD8αβ+ TRAV1-2 T cell receptor recognizing microbially-derived Vitamin B2 intermediates presented by the evolutionarily conserved major histocompatibility complex I-related molecule, MR1, there is an emerging appreciation for diverse subsets that may be selected for in humans with distinct functions, including subpopulations that co-express CD4. Prior work has not examined T cell receptor (TCR) heterogeneity in CD4+ MAIT cells, largely due to bias of identifying human MAIT cells as CD8+ TRAV1-2+ cells. In this study, we adopted an unbiased single-cell TCR-sequencing approach of total MR1-5-OP-RU-tetramer-reactive T cells and discovered that CD4+ MAIT cells express highly diverse TRAV1-2 negative TCRs. To specifically characterize this TCR repertoire, we analyzed VDJ sequences of single MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer+ MAIT cells across two datasets and identified distinct TCR usage among CD4+ MAIT cells including TRAV21, TRAV8 (TRAV8-1, TRAV8-2, TRAV8-3), and TRAV12 families (TRAV12-2, TRAV12-3), as well as more variable J chain and CDR3 sequences. Non-TRAV1-2 MAIT cell TCRs were also enriched after in vitro expansion, including with Mycobacterial tuberculosis. These results indicate that mature human CD4+ MAIT cells adopt distinct TCR usage from the canonical TRAV1-2+ CD8+ subset and suggest that alternative MR1 ligands in addition to riboflavin intermediates may select them.">

        <tr id="Many inflammatory stimuli can induce progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells as part of the process of emergency myelopoiesis. These events are associated with innate training and can have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27 deficient mice are pre-disposed towards the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.">

One of the manifestations is an atypical non-ulcerated cutaneous leishmaniasis (NUCL), which occurs in some locations of Central America with few cases of VL. We conducted a transcriptomic analysis of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) on blood samples from NUCL, AS, VL patients from Amapala, Honduras, and healthy controls. RNA-seq revealed a similar perturbation of gene expression in NUCL and AS. Eight gene signatures of CMI were found in NUCL involved in CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration, reactive oxygen species generation, PD-1 receptor ligand, inflammasome assembly, chemotaxis, complement receptor and suppressor immune cell infiltration. NUCL was distinguished from VL by its up-regulation of differently expressed genes (DEGs) related to T lymphocyte exhaustion, adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes, and down-regulation of oxidative stress genes. In contrast, VL exhibited up-regulated DEGs involved in antigen cross-presentation, and similar to VL from Brazil, down-regulated DEGs involved in innate immunity. Corroborating the transcriptome findings, both the Leishmanin skin test, and the immunopathology of NUCL skin lesion defined NUCL as a proinflammatory condition, intermediate between the AS and VL clinical outcomes. That condition may be the underlying element for the benign nature of the NUCL.">

Of note, the modulation of cytokine production and its release can significantly influence the immune response. Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are cytokines that play a crucial role in innate immunity due to their potent antiviral effects, regulation of IFN-stimulated genes essential for viral clearance, and the initiation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, an understanding of the dual role of IFN-I (protective versus harmful) during HIV-1 infections and elucidating its contributions to HIV pathogenesis is crucial for advancing HIV therapeutic interventions.

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint blockade is a standard-of-care treatment for mRCC patients, but the immune mechanisms driving clinical benefit remain underexplored. In the I-RENE trial (NCT04891055), we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) and lymphoid dynamics and their impact on the efficacy of nivolumab.
 Methods:
 The I-RENE study is a prospective, translational, real-world multicenter trial involving mRCC patients treated with nivolumab after failure of previous VEGFR-targeted therapies. Sixty patients were enrolled between December 2018 and August 2022. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected at baseline and at 2, 4, and 12 weeks, as well as at disease progression. PBMCs were analyzed by high-resolution flow cytometry (profiling 144 lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets), and plasma was assessed using multiplex analysis (69 soluble factors). CD14+ monocytes from PB and tumor tissue were subjected to RNA sequencing.
 Results:
 Significant immune modulations in PB were detectable as early as 2 weeks into treatment across all patients, regardless of clinical response, and persisted throughout the 3-month observation period. These changes included substantial alterations in the profiles of immune cells and plasma soluble factors. Responders to nivolumab exhibited a marked reduction in monocyte subsets associated with immune suppression, such as CD14+HLA-DR- cells, CD14+PD-L1+ cells, and intermediate monocytes. In contrast, non-responders showed a progressive increase in suppressive monocytes and a concomitant decrease in CD14+ cells involved in anti-tumor immunity, including non-classical monocytes and CD14+ cells expressing HLA-DR and CX3CR1. Lymphoid compartment analysis revealed that responders experienced an increase in CD8+ T cells and CD4+ effector memory T cells, along with a reduction in CD38+ T cells. Conversely, non-responders showed significant upregulation of senescent CD8+ T cells (KLRG1+CD28-CD57+) and CD38+ T cells. All progressing patients showed a notable resurgence of suppressive myeloid cells (HLA-DR-, PD-L1+), confirmed by an enriched MDSC gene signature, as well as an increase in PB CD38+ and senescent T cells. Notably, the detrimental role of myeloid-driven immune suppression in non-responders was further confirmed by an enriched MDSC gene signature in matched tumor samples.
 Conclusions:
 The pervasive and detrimental impact of myeloid cells committed to immune suppression is evident even before radiological progression in mRCC patients and persists despite immunotherapy. These findings highlight the need for early identification of immune-suppressive infiltrates and the development of strategies to overcome or reprogram these cells, both at the systemic and tumor level, following diagnosis.

In contrast, orthotopic tumours exhibited robust responses, with substantial reductions in tumour burden, enhanced immune infiltration, and increased CD4+ memory T cells, highlighting the critical role of anatomical site and tumour microenvironment in shaping immunotherapy outcomes.

We found that people with mild/moderate ME/CFS had increased expression of cytotoxic effector molecules alongside enhanced proportions of early-immunosenescence cells, determined by the CD28-CD57- phenotype. In contrast, people with severe ME/CFS had higher proportions of activated circulating lymphocytes, determined by CD69+ and CD38+ expression, and expressed more pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN{gamma}, TNF and IL-17, following stimulation in vitro. These changes were consistent across different cell types including CD8+ T cells, mucosal associated invariant T cells and Natural Killer cells, indicating generalised altered cytotoxic responses across the innate and adaptive immune system . These immunological differences likely reflect different disease pathogenesis mechanisms occurring in the two clinical groups, and opening up opportunities for the development of prognostic markers and stratified treatments.">

        <tr id="While durable antibody responses from long-lived plasma cell (LLPC) populations are important for protection against pathogens, LLPC may be harmful if they produce antibodies against self-proteins or self-nuclear antigens as occurs in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Thus, the elimination of autoreactive LLPC may improve the treatment of antibody-driven autoimmune diseases. However, LLPC remain a challenging therapeutic target. Here, we compare the matched bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PBL) plasma cell (PC) compartments of SLE and healthy donors (HD). We show a similar distribution of CD138- and CD138+ PC, including putative LLPC (CD19- CD138+ CD38+), between SLE and HD BM. For both SLE and HD, CD138+ PC are at a higher frequency in BM than PBL. Expression of Ki-67 associates with the PBL compartment where it is found on all PC subsets regardless of CD19 or CD138 expression. Transcriptomic analysis identifies an interferon (IFN) gene signature in transitional B cells in the SLE BM, but surprisingly also in the BM PC derived from SLE. BM PC and B cells phosphorylate STAT1 in response to type I IFN stimulation in vitro, but with decreased fold change compared to those from the PBL. While BM PC bind type I IFN receptor-blocking antibody anifrolumab, it is to a lesser degree than circulating B cells. Anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA) are found in the BM supernatant and PBL serum of SLE patients. Both SLE and HD BM-derived PC have increased survival compared to their PBL counterparts when treated with verdinexor. In summary, these findings show evidence of IFN activation in BM PC from SLE.">

        <tr id="The hallmark of HIV-1 infection is the progressive development of multicellular and systemic immune dysfunction, culminating in AIDS. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in HIV dissemination to CD4+ T cells, which are subsequently depleted by the virus leading to HIV disease progression. Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical for host defense during acute infection but contribute to chronic immune activation during the later stages of HIV disease. This persistent activation leads to immune cell exhaustion. HIV-1 can activate type I IFN responses via several pathways, including the STING pathway, which is activated by e.g., virus-derived oligonucleotides. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms creating HIV-1-mediated immune dysfunction and role of type I IFNs using a DC and T cell co-culture model. HIV-1 exposure in the DC-T cell co-culture promoted the expansion of suppressive T cells with diminished proliferation and effector functions. The impairment required type I IFNs and subsequent IFN-α/β receptor signaling, initiated by HIV-derived ssDNA activation of IFI16/cGAS followed by STING signaling in the DCs. Targeting IFNAR1 with Anifrolumab restored the immune functions of both DCs and T cells, as well as T cell proliferation and T cell effector functions, including their secretion of IL-2, IFN-γ, and granzyme B. Our findings support that the immune impairments existing in untreated or antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated HIV-infected individuals are mediated, if not fully in part by type I IFN’s negative effect on DC and T cells. Therapeutics targeting IFN-α/β receptors, such as Anifrolumab, hold potential as combination treatment alongside ART, to achieve a more complete immune restoration and contribute to improved quality of life among people living with HIV.">

        <tr id="MAPK pathway inhibitors (MAPKi) are increasingly used in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, but often produce short-lived responses in patients. Although acquired resistance by de novo mutations in tumors have been found to reduce response in some patients, additional mechanisms underlying the limited response durability of MAPK targeting therapy remain unknown. Here, we denote new contributory tumor biology and provide insight on the impact of tumor plasticity on therapy response. Analysis of MAPKi treated patients revealed activation of stemness programs and increased ASCL2 expression, which are associated with poor outcomes. Greater ASCL2 with MAPKi treatment was also seen in patient-derived CRC models, independent of driver mutations. We find ASCL2 denotes a distinct cell population, arising from phenotypic plasticity, with a proliferative, stem-like phenotype, and decreased sensitivity to MAPKi therapy, which were named adaptive plasticity tumor (APT) cells. MAPK pathway suppression induces the APT phenotype in cells, resulting in APT cell enrichment in tumors and limiting therapy response in preclinical and clinical data. APT cell depletion improved MAPKi treatment efficacy and extended MAPKi response durability in mice. These findings uncover a cellular program that mitigates the impact of MAPKi therapies and highlights the importance of addressing tumor plasticity to improve clinical outcomes.">

We identified Chlamydia muridarum, an intracellular bacterium and murine counterpart to the human sexually transmitted C. trachomatis, as necessary and sufficient to trigger disease manifestation in the ascending colon (AC), another common site of human CD. Disease manifestation in the AC depends on indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) activity induced by hypersensitive surface secretory cells in genetically susceptible hosts. Single-cell and microbial analyses of human specimens also implicates this pathobiont–epithelial IDO1 pathway in patients with a history of CD in the AC.

        <tr id="T cell exhaustion is important to protect the host from immunopathology during chronic viral infection, but it also impairs T cell anti-tumor immunity1–5. A fundamental unresolved question is whether and how T cell exhaustion is determined at the onset of TCR signaling6–8. Here we report an unexpected role of Themis, a TCR-proximal signaling molecule9, in T cell exhaustion. Chronic viral infection in mice usually leads to T cell exhaustion and survival of the host. Surprisingly, Themis T-cell conditional knockout mice died from severe CD8+-dependent lung immunopathology in chronic viral infection, showing Themis’ importance in establishing T cell exhaustion. We found that Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells were hyperactivated at the single-cell level - producing more TNF and IFNγ compared to wild-type counterparts - but defective in population-level expansion. Moreover, TCF-1 and TOX expression were inhibited in Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells, thereby impairing differentiation of exhausted T cell precursors (T-pex) and maintenance of terminally exhausted T cells (T-ex), respectively. Mechanistically, Themis initially promotes TCR signaling to induce PD-1 expression and subsequently mediates PD-1 signaling. In the latter, Themis binds to PD-1 and promotes PD-1 phosphorylation and its recruitment of SHP2, thereby acting as a negative regulator to inhibit T cell effector functions. Without Themis, the orderly regulation of TCR and PD-1 signaling, and therefore exhaustion, is disrupted. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that Themis-mediated early TCR signaling plays a decisive role in T cell exhaustion and provide a novel mechanism of PD-1 signaling through Themis.">

However, we observe MHC-I deficiency in human and murine urologic tumors, posing daunting challenges for successful immunotherapy. We herein report an unprecedented nanosonosensitizer of one-dimensional bamboo-like multisegmented manganese dioxide@manganese–bismuth vanadate (BMMBV) to boost multiple branches of immune responses targeting MHC-I–deficient tumors. BMMBV markedly augments sonodynamic activity contributed by manganese heteroatoms in the lattice of bismuth vanadate with narrowing bandgaps. Under sonoirradiation, BMMBV enhances tumor antigen spreading and emission of adjuvant signals, which potentiate dendritic cell maturation, thereby eliciting high aptitude of CTLs. This therapy substantially up-regulates MHC expression on tumor cells, which are reversely sensitive to CTLs. Alongside, extensive innate immune cells complement the cytolytic activity of CTLs for eliminating mouse urologic tumors.

        <tr id="Cancer stem cell (CSC)-targeted immunotherapy has emerged as a novel strategy in cancer treatment in the past decade. However, its efficacy is significantly limited due to the existence of host immune suppressive activity. Specifically, programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is overexpressed in CSCs, and PD-L1 overexpressed CSCs create immunosuppressive milieu via interacting with various immune cells in tumor microenvironments (TME). Hence, novel immunotherapeutic strategies targeting CSCs with concurrent immunosuppression interruption will be promising in enhancing anti-CSC effects. These include dendritic cell (DC) and nanodisc (ND)-based vaccines to present CSC antigens in the forms of CSC lysate, CSC-marker proteins, and CSC-derived peptides to induce anti-CSC immunity. In addition, CSC-directed bispecific antibodies (BiAbs) and antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have been developed to target CSCs effectively. Furthermore, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and natural killer (NK) cell-based therapy targeting CSCs have achieved progress in both solid and hematologic tumors, and inhibition of CSC associated signaling pathways has proven successful. In this review, we aimed to outline the roles and regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 in the properties of CSCs; the crosstalk between CSCs and immunosuppressive cells in TME, and recent progress and future promises of immunosuppression blockage to enhance CSC-targeted immunotherapy.">

They play double “edge-sward” by either supporting or suppressing the tumor growth, including driving angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling to promote tumor growth, participating in antitumor adaptive immunity, or killing tumor cells directly to inhibit the tumor growth. The complex role of neutrophils in various tumors depends on the tumor microenvironment (TME) they are located, and emerging evidence has suggested that neutrophils may determine the success of tumor immunotherapy in the context of the immune checkpoint blockade, innate immune training, or drug-loaded extracellular microvesicles therapy, which makes them become an exciting target for tumor immunotherapy, but still with challenges.

        <tr id="Background Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are characterized by impaired immune response that fails to eliminate HBV. Immune checkpoint molecules (ICMs) control the amplitude of the activation and function of immune cells, which makes them the key regulators of immune response. Methods We performed a multiparametric flow cytometry analysis of ICMs and determined their expression on intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets in untreated and treated patients with HBV in comparison with non-pathological liver tissue. Results The liver of untreated HBV patients exhibited a high accumulation of PD-1+CD8+ T cells, while the frequencies of 4-1BB+ T cells, 4-1BB+ natural killer (NK) cells, and TIM-3+CD8+ T cells were the highest in the chronic hepatitis phase. Our findings showed that the HBeAg status is linked to a distinct immune phenotype of intrahepatic CD8+ T cells and NK cells characterized by high expression of ICMs, particularly 4-1BB. Importantly, antiviral treatment partially restored the normal expression of ICMs. Finally, we described important differences in ICM expression between intrahepatic and circulating NK cells in HBV patients. Conclusions Our study shows clear differences in the intrahepatic expression of ICMs on NK cells and T cells in chronic HBV patients depending on their clinical stage.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of adaptive immunity, guiding T helper (Th) cell differentiation through antigen presentation, co-stimulation, and cytokine production. However, in steady-state conditions, certain DC subsets, such as Langerhans cells (LCs), induce T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and B cell responses without inflammatory stimuli. Using multiple mouse models and in vitro systems, we investigated the mechanisms underlying steady-state LC-induced adaptive immune responses. We found that LCs drive germinal center Tfh and B cell differentiation and antibody production independently of interleukin-6 (IL-6), type-I interferons, and ICOS ligand (ICOS-L) signaling, which are critical in inflammatory settings. Instead, these responses relied on CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation. Our findings challenge the conventional three-signal paradigm by demonstrating that cytokine signaling is dispensable for LC-mediated Tfh and B cell responses in steady-state. These insights provide a framework for understanding homeostatic immunity and the immune system’s role in maintaining tolerance or developing autoimmunity under non-inflammatory conditions.

Strikingly, chickens lacking γδ T cells had significantly higher bacterial loads in the liver and more extensive Salmonella invasion in the cecal wall during the early stages of infection compared to wild-type birds. In the blood, infected γδ T cell knockout chickens displayed a significantly increased percentage of CD25+ NK-like cells. In both blood and tissue, infected wild-type chickens demonstrated an increased absolute number of CD8αα++ γδ T cells. Conversely, γδ T cell knockout chickens exhibited an augmented cell count of a CD8αα++CD4- non-γδ T cell population after infection, which might include αβ T cells. At 7 days post infection (dpi), gene expression analysis revealed elevated transcription of the activation marker IL-2Rα and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IFN-γ) in CD8αα++CD4- non-γδ T cells from γδ T cell knockout chickens compared to CD8αα++ γδ T cells from wild-type birds. By 12 dpi, these differences diminished as transcription levels increased in γδ T cells of wild-type animals. Our findings demonstrate that γδ T cells play a role in early immune protection against Salmonella Enteritidis infection in chickens. In later stages of the infection, the γδ T cells and their functions appear to be replaced by other cells.">

In the urinary tract, TRM cells play critical roles in defending against infections, mediating tumor immunity, and influencing the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic potential is immense, with promising avenues for vaccine development, enhanced cancer immunotherapy, and targeted treatments for chronic inflammation. However, challenges remain in harnessing their protective roles while minimizing their pathological effects, particularly in immunosuppressive or inflammatory microenvironments. This review explores the diverse roles of TRM cells in urinary tract diseases, including infections, cancer, and chronic inflammation, and discusses therapeutic strategies and future directions for leveraging TRM cells to improve clinical outcomes. By advancing our understanding of TRM cell biology, we can develop innovative interventions that balance their immune-protective and regulatory functions.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents significant clinical challenges due to its limited treatment options and aggressive behavior, often associated with poor prognosis. This study focuses on Kindlin-2, an adaptor protein, and its role in TNBC progression, particularly in hematopoiesis-mediated immune evasion. TNBC tumors expressing high levels of Kindlin-2 induce a notable reshaping of hematopoiesis, promoting expansion of myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM) and spleen. This shift correlated with increased levels of neutrophils and monocytes in tumor-bearing mice over time. Conversely, genetic knockout of Kindlin-2 mitigated this myeloid bias and fostered T cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, indicating Kindlin-2's pivotal role in immune modulation. Further investigations revealed that Kindlin-2 deficiency led to reduced expression of PD-L1, a critical immune checkpoint inhibitor, in TNBC tumors. This molecular change sensitized Kindlin-2-deficient tumors to host anti-tumor immune responses, resulting in enhanced tumor suppression in immune-competent mouse models. Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA-seq, and immunohistochemistry data supported these findings by highlighting enriched immune-related pathways and increased infiltration of immune cells in Kindlin-2-deficient tumors. Therapeutically, targeting PD-L1 in Kindlin-2-expressing TNBC tumors effectively inhibited tumor growth, akin to the effects observed with genetic Kindlin-2 knockout or PD-L1-KO. Our data underscore Kindlin-2 as a promising therapeutic target in combination with immune checkpoint blockade to bolster anti-tumor immunity and counteract resistance mechanisms typical of TNBC and other immune evasive solid tumors. Implications: Kindlin-2 regulates tumor immune evasion through the systemic modulation of hematopoiesis and PD-L1 expression, which warrants therapeutic targeting of Kindlin-2 in TNBC patients.">

Here, we addressed this issue by developing pluripotent stem cell-derived NK lineage-committed progenitor (iNKP) cell therapy. For the first time, we generated abundant iNKP cells via an organoid culture system. The iNKP cells, engineered to express CXCR4 and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), efficiently migrated to the bone marrow and generated CAR-iNK cells persisting in peripheral blood (PB) for over 80 days. Notably, CAR-iNKP cell therapy durably protected animals from tumour occurrence. Furthermore, a single low-dose infusion of CAR-iNKP cells following conventional chemotherapy eradicated minimal residual disease (MRD), leading to long-term complete remission. Our findings present a novel strategy to overcome the limitations of traditional CAR-NK cell therapy and offer dural breakthroughs for the prevention of tumour occurrence and relapse.">

        <tr id="The combination of chemotherapeutic agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, its success is often limited by insufficient immune priming in certain tumors, including pediatric malignancies. In this report, we explore clinical trials currently investigating the use of immunogenic cell death (ICD)-inducing chemotherapies in combination with ICIs for both adult and pediatric cancers. Given the limited clinical data available for pediatric tumors, we focused on recent preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy of these combinations in neuroblastoma (NB). Finally, to address this gap, we propose an innovative strategy to assess the impact of ICD-inducing chemotherapies on antitumor immune responses in NB. Using tumor spheroids derived from a transgenic NB mouse model, we validated our previous in vivo findings concerning how anthracyclines, specifically mitoxantrone and doxorubicin, significantly enhance MHC class I surface expression, stimulate IFNγ and granzyme B production by CD8+ T cells and NK cells, and promote immune cell recruitment. Importantly, these anthracyclines also upregulated PD-L1 expression on NB spheroids. This screening platform yielded results similar to in vivo findings, demonstrating that mitoxantrone and doxorubicin are the most potent immunomodulatory agents for NB. These data suggest that the creation of libraries of ICD inducers to be tested on tumor spheroids could reduce the number of combinations to be tested in vivo, in line with the principles of the 3Rs. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of chemo-immunotherapy regimens to counteract the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in NB, paving the way for improved therapeutic strategies in pediatric cancers. They provide compelling evidence to support further clinical investigations of these combinations to enhance outcomes for children with malignancies.">

        <tr id="High-risk pediatric neuroblastoma patients have a dismal survival rate despite intensive treatment regimens. New treatment options are thus required. Even though HLA expression in neuroblastoma is low and immune cell infiltrates are limited, the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is indicative for better patient survival. Here, we show that most tumor lesions contain viable immune cell infiltrates after induction chemotherapy, with high percentages of CD3+ T cells. We therefore expanded the TILs and tested their anti-tumoral activity. With sufficient starting material, TIL expansion was as efficient as for adult solid tumors. However, whereas TIL products from adult tumors almost exclusively contained αβ T cells, in neuroblastoma-derived TILs, γδ T cells expanded with similar efficacy as αβ T cells. Importantly, the anti-tumor responses in response to autologous tumor digest primarily originated from (Vδ1- and Vδ3-expressing) γδ T cells, and not from αβ T cells. In conclusion, this finding creates a window of opportunity for immunotherapy for neuroblastoma patients, with γδ T cells as potential prime responders.">

Iron is an essential nutrient for immune cells, but it can also pose biochemical risks such as the production of reactive oxygen species. The importance of iron for the NK cell function has gained increasing recognition. We have previously shown that NK cells require iron to efficiently eliminate virus-infected target cells; however, the impact of nutritional iron deficiency on NK cell function and the therapeutic benefits of iron supplementation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that diet-related low iron levels lead to increased retroviral loads due to functional NK cell impairment, while iron supplementation enhances NK cell proliferation, as well as their cytotoxic efficacy. Notably, iron-treated NK cells exhibited significant metabolic changes, including mitochondrial reorganization. Interestingly, although iron supplementation decreased the NK cell’s cytokine production, it significantly improved NK cell degranulation and the expression of cytotoxicity-associated proteins. These findings highlight the critical role of iron in maintaining NK cell immunity and suggest that iron supplementation may hold therapeutic potential for supporting the treatment of viral infections and immunodeficiency disorders.">

Natural killer cells (NK cells) play a key role in liver immunosurveillance, but in the tumor microenvironment, NK cells are readily depleted, as evidenced by down-regulation of activating receptors, reduced cytokine secretion, and attenuated killing function. The up-regulation of inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3, further exacerbates the depletion of NK cells. Combined blockade strategies targeting these immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as the combination of PD-1 inhibitors with other inhibitory pathways (eg.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Non‐lymphoid tissue Tregs (NLT‐Tregs) are critical for tissue homeostasis, inflammation control, and induction of tissue repair. Recent single‐cell RNA sequencing data identified the expression of CD83 as part of an NLT‐Treg signature, which is an essential molecule for the stability and differentiation of lymphoid Tregs. However, the biological significance of CD83 expression for NLT Tregs has not yet been elucidated. The present study explores for the first time the role of CD83 expression by lung‐resident Tregs in the steady state and during asthma to understand its importance in barrier tissues. We evaluated the effect of Treg‐specific CD83 deletion (CD83cKO) on the lung‐resident T‐cell compartment and cytokine profile. CD83‐deficient lung Tregs are less differentiated but more activated, resulting in unrestrained T‐cell activation. Further, CD83cKO mice were challenged in an asthma model and showed an accelerated disease progression, driven by Th2‐biased T‐cell responses. CD83cKO Tregs exhibited enhanced responsiveness to IL‐4, leading to insufficient control of Th2‐differentiation from naïve T cells. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CD83 in the NLT‐Treg‐mediated modulation of Th2 responses. Overall, our results highlight CD83 as a key player in tissue homeostasis and inflammatory responses, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for inflammatory disorders such as asthma.">

        <tr id="In the realm of oncology, the tumor microenvironment (TME)—comprising extracellular matrix components, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells—plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, progression, and response to therapeutic interventions. Initially, the TME exhibits tumor-suppressive properties that can inhibit malignant transformation. However, as the tumor progresses, various factors induce immune tolerance, resulting in TME behaving in a state that promotes tumor growth and metastasis in later stages. This state of immunosuppression is crucial as it enables TME to change from a role of killing tumor cells to a role of promoting tumor progression. Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract with an alarmingly high mortality rate. While chemotherapy has historically been the cornerstone of treatment, its efficacy in prolonging survival remains limited. The emergence of immunotherapy has opened new therapeutic pathways, yet the challenge of immune tolerance driven by the gastric cancer microenvironment complicates these efforts. This review aims to elucidate the intricate role of the TME in mediating immune tolerance in gastric cancer and to spotlight innovative strategies and clinical trials designed to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches. By providing a comprehensive theoretical framework, this review seeks to advance the understanding and application of immunotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with increased rates of severe disease, hospitalization, and death in elderly individuals. Clearance of RSV is frequently delayed within this demographic, contributing to the more severe disease course. Geriatric cotton rats mimic this prolonged clearance kinetic and serve as a useful animal model for studying age-associated immunological deficits during RSV infection. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen restores RSV clearance, indicating that inflammation contributes to impaired clearance in geriatric cotton rats. Here, we further characterize a compromised immune response in geriatric cotton rats and identify an inflammatory pathway that contributes to this deficiency. Dendritic cell (DC) activation and migration to mediastinal lymph nodes are decreased during early infection in geriatric cotton rats, resulting in delayed generation of cytotoxic T cells and virus clearance. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which reduces DC migration through the elevation of D-type prostanoid 1 receptor (DP1 receptor), is elevated in the airways of infected geriatric cotton rats. Reducing PGD2 production by inhibiting COX-2 or PGD2 synthase improves RSV clearance kinetics through DC activation and RSV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in geriatric cotton rats, whereas activation of DP1 receptor through an agonist resulted in delayed viral clearance in adult cotton rats. These results indicate that PGD2 contributes to delayed antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell responses to RSV in geriatric cotton rats. Inhibiting PGD2 generation or signaling may be a useful mechanism of therapeutic intervention in elderly individuals. IMPORTANCE Elderly adults are at increased risk of severe disease resulting from infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), characterized in part by delayed clearance (removal of the virus from airways). Understanding the immunological factors that lead to this delayed clearance may allow for the development of therapies to improve disease outcomes in elderly individuals infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Here, we describe an inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats, the preferred small animal laboratory model for RSV, that impairs the generation of an effective immune response. We show that inhibiting this inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats improves immune parameters and speeds clearance of RSV. These results contribute to our understanding of delayed RSV clearance in elderly individuals with possible applications for improving immune responses to RSV in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="A diverse naive CD8 T cell repertoire is essential to provide broad protection against infection and cancer. Aging diminishes naive T cells, reducing potential diversity and leading to lymph node contraction. Here, we revealed that this decline occurs earlier in males, resulting in significant sex differences in immunity during middle age. Earlier in life, naive CD8 T cells in males become virtual memory cells prone to premature senescence. Due to androgen-driven thymic atrophy in males, naïve CD8 T cells are insufficiently replenished. Therapeutic thymus rejuvenation via testosterone ablation restored naive CD8 T cells in lymph nodes of middle-aged male mice, leading to enhanced tumor recognition. These findings show the crucial role of sex and age on lymph node T cell repertoires and suggest potential strategies to restore immune function in males during aging.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer is considered immunologically "cold", with low mutational burden, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and PD-L1 levels, culminating in poor response to immune checkpoint therapies. Bispecific CD3 redirection antibodies can elicit T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and hold promise for immune cell recruitment into prostate tumors. CD3 redirection antibodies in solid tumors are still in early phases of clinical development, and it is not yet understood whether these potential therapies will achieve the high response rates observed in hematological malignancies or result in durable T cell responses. Here we demonstrated that treatment with a PSMA targeted CD3 redirector resulted in efficacy against LnCaP.AR human prostate xenografts in CD34+ cord blood humanized mice. Efficacy correlated with T cell infiltration into tumors with an activated phenotype, but also increased PD-L1 expression. Engineered overexpression of PD-L1 in LNCaP.AR tumors resulted in resistance to PSMAxCD3 bispecific antibody treatment, whereas sensitivity was restored in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. PSMAxCD3 and anti-PD-1 combination treatment resulted in complete tumor responses in approximately 20% of mice, and elicited immune responses that delayed growth of rechallenged tumors. In a second prostate model, patient derived LuCaP 86.2 xenografts, PSMAxCD3 monotherapy treatment resulted in complete responses in 25% of mice. When PSMAxCD3-treated responder mice were rechallenged with LuCaP 86.2 tumors, partial control of tumor regrowth was associated with expansion of effector memory T cells. These studies show that PSMAxCD3 treatment elicits antitumor memory T cell responses, and that combination with PD-1 blockade can enhance these effects in tumors with immune suppressive tumor microenvironments.">

        <tr id="The functional plasticity of tumor-infiltrating B (TIL-B) cells spans from anti-tumor responses to non-canonical immune suppression. Yet, how tumor microenvironment (TME) influences TIL-B development is still underappreciated. Our current study integrated single cell transcriptomics and BCR (B cell receptor) sequencing to profile TIL-B phenotypes and clonalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using trajectory and gene regulatory network analysis, we were able to characterize plasma cells, memory and naïve B cells within the HCC TME and further revealed a downregulation of BCR-signaling genes in plasma cells and a subset of inflammatory TNF+ memory B cells. Within the TME, non-switch memory B cell subset acquires an age-associated B cell phenotype (TBET+, CD11c+) and expressed higher levels of PD-L1, CD25 and granzyme B. We further demonstrated that the presence of HCC tumor cells could confer suppressive functions on peripheral blood B cells which in turn, dampen T cell co-stimulation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent novel mechanisms of non-canonical immune suppression in HCC. While previous studies identified atypical memory B cells in chronic hepatitis and across several solid cancer types, we further highlighted their potential role as regulatory B cells (Bregs) within both the TME and peripheral blood of HCC patients.">

        <tr id="Introduction Burn-induced sepsis is a critical clinical challenge marked by systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and high mortality. Macrophage-driven inflammatory pathways are central to sepsis pathogenesis, while immune cell metabolic reprogramming plays a key role in both sepsis and cancer progression. Methods Bioinformatics analyses using GEO, TCGA, and GTEx datasets identified MLIP-modulated genes linked to immune responses and prognosis. In vitro, LPS-stimulated HUVEC cells were used to study MLIP’s effects on inflammation and macrophage function through cell viability, ROS levels, cytokine expression, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence assays. Results MLIP-modulated genes were associated with immune-related metabolic pathways in both sepsis and cancer. Epigenetic analysis showed MLIP expression is regulated by promoter methylation and chromatin accessibility. Prognostic analyses revealed MLIP’s impact on survival outcomes across cancer types. In vitro, MLIP reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and macrophage hyperactivation. Conclusions MLIP regulates immune-metabolic dynamics in burn-induced sepsis, influencing macrophage activity and oxidative stress. Its role in metabolic reprogramming suggests MLIP as a potential therapeutic target linking immune modulation and cancer progression. Further research on MLIP’s role in immune evasion and tumor metabolism may inform novel therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The occurrence of inflammation subsequent to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with an elevated risk of transplant‐related mortality (TRM). However, the duration of inflammation and the potential efficacy of anti‐inflammatory agents in reducing TRM remain uncertain. We performed a comprehensive investigation to examine the post‐transplantation alterations of inflammatory mediators and to ascertain the correlation between inflammation level and TRM through the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, ELISAs and cytometric bead array. The findings revealed that the 30‐day interval following transplantation is characterised by the most pronounced inflammatory response in both human and murine subjects, thereby elevating the risk of TRM. The inflammation is primarily caused by myeloid bias during haematopoietic reconstitution, which is a commonly overlooked aspect in clinical transplantation, additionally, a lesser extent of irradiation‐induced injury. The administration of the anti‐inflammatory agent resveratrol has the potential to reduce systemic inflammation and TRM by suppressing the NOD‐like receptor signalling pathway and slowing down granulocyte implantation in HSCT mice. This approach did not impair the differentiation potential of haematopoietic stem cells. These findings demonstrate that the 30‐day post‐transplant period represents an opportunity to facilitate HSCT colonisation, mitigate transplant‐related adverse effects, and potentially reap the benefits of anti‐inflammatory treatments.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells are pivotal in maintaining self-tolerance and controlling immune responses. In this study, we investigated potential Treg cell epitopes in human α-tubulin that were selected in silico for their promiscuous binding to class II human leukocyte antigens and full identity with antigens from enteric nematodes present in excretory-secretory products. We identified five Treg cell epitopes in α-tubulin that were capable of stimulating and expanding IL-10 and TGF-β-producing Foxp3+ Treg cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We also proved that a peptide pool containing the identified Treg cell epitopes (αTBL pool) suppressed the T cell responses elicited by different stimuli, including LPS, and class I and class II restricted T cell epitopes, as determined by intracellular cytokine staining assays. Similarly, this same peptide pool was able to suppress T cell responses in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Finally, we found that stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells with autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells in the presence of the αTBL pool promoted the differentiation of functional CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ T cells capable of suppressing the proliferation of CD3/CD28-activated T cells. α-tubulin Treg cell epitopes could be useful for treating autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases by inducing Treg cells and, given the ubiquitous and copious expression of α-tubulin, enable a general mechanism of immune homeostasis.">

Systemic administration of allogenic EVs derived from epithelial and mesenchymal cells has been shown to be safe, despite carrying an array of functional molecules, including thousands of proteins. To address whether epithelial cell-derived EVs can be modified to acquire the capacity to induce an immune response, we engineered 293T EVs to harbor the immunomodulatory molecules CD80, OX40L, and PD-L1. We demonstrated abundant levels of these proteins in the engineered cells and EVs. Functionally, the engineered EVs efficiently elicited positive and negative costimulation of human and murine T cells. In the setting of cancer and autoimmune hepatitis, the engineered EVs modulated T cell functions and altered disease progression. OX40L EVs also provided enhanced antitumor activity in combination with anti-CTLA-4 in melanoma-bearing mice. In addition, we added multiple immunomodulatory proteins in EVs (EVmIM), attempting to elicit an immune response in both lymphoid and myeloid compartments. The EVmIM containing CD80, 4-1BBL, CD40L, CD2, and CD32 engaged both T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) in melanoma tumors, demonstrating the capacity for EVmIM to elicit antitumor activity. Our work provides evidence that EVs can be engineered to induce specific immune responses with translational potential to modulate immune cell functions in pathological settings.">

Studies utilizing mouse models of respiratory infection, allergy, fibrosis, and cancer have been critical to reveal mechanisms of disease progression and identify therapeutic targets.

Here, we describe a method for preparing a comprehensive single-cell suspension of both immune and non-immune populations suitable for flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These populations include epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and a variety of myeloid cell subsets. This protocol entails bronchoalveolar lavage and subsequent inflation of the lungs with dispase. Lungs are then digested in a liberase mixture. This method of processing liberates a variety of diverse cell types and results in a single-cell suspension that does not require manual dissociation against a filter, promoting cell survival and yielding high numbers of live cells for downstream analyses. In this protocol, we also define gating schemes for epithelial and myeloid cell subsets in both naïve and influenza-infected lungs. Simultaneous isolation of live immune and non-immune cells is key for interrogating intercellular crosstalk and gaining a deeper understanding of lung biology in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Pregnancy involves significant immunological changes to support fetal development while protecting the mother from infections. A growing body of evidence supports the importance of immune checkpoint pathways, especially at the maternal–fetal interface, although limited information is available about the peripheral expression of these molecules by CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets during the trimesters of pregnancy. Understanding the dynamics of these immune cells and their checkpoint pathways is crucial for elucidating their roles in pregnancy maintenance and potential complications. This study aims to investigate the peripheral expression and functional characteristics of CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets throughout pregnancy, providing insights into their contributions to maternal and fetal health. A total of 34 healthy women were enrolled from the first, 30 from the second and 40 from the third trimester of pregnancy. At the same time, 35 healthy age-matched non-pregnant women formed the control group. From peripheral blood, mononuclear cells were separated and stored at −80 °C. CD8+ and CD8− NK cell subsets were analyzed from freshly thawed samples, and surface and intracellular staining was performed using flow cytometric analyses. The proportions of CD56+ NK cells in peripheral blood were similar across groups. While CD8− NKdim cells increased significantly in all trimesters compared to non-pregnant controls, CD8+ NKdim cells showed no significant changes. CD8− NKbright cells had higher frequencies throughout pregnancy, whereas CD8+ NKbright cells significantly increased only in the first and second trimesters. The expression levels of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1 and PD-L1, and cytotoxic-activity-related molecules were stable, with notable perforin and granzyme B increases in CD8− NKbright cells throughout pregnancy. Our study shows that peripheral NK cell populations, especially CD8− subsets, are predominant during pregnancy. This shift suggests a crucial role for CD8− NK cells in balancing maternal immune tolerance and surveillance. The stable expression of immune checkpoint molecules indicates that other regulatory mechanisms may be at work. These findings enhance our understanding of peripheral immune dynamics in pregnancy and suggest that targeting CD8− NKbright cell functions could help manage pregnancy-related immune complications. This research elucidates the stable distribution and functional characteristics of peripheral NK cells during pregnancy, with CD8− subsets being more prevalent. The increased activity of CD8− NKbright cells suggests their critical role in maintaining immune surveillance. Our findings provide a basis for future studies to uncover the mechanisms regulating NK cell function in pregnancy, potentially leading to new treatments for immune-related pregnancy complications.">

Improving drug targeting, blocking immune checkpoints, and promoting the activation of immune cells are crucial for reprogramming the TIM. Here, an intercellular adhesion molecule 1-targeted antibody‒drug conjugate in combination with a B7-H3-CD3 bispecific antibody is selected for TIM reprogramming, which improved the efficacy of triple-negative breast cancer immunotherapy. This combination therapy improves drug targeting, blocks immune checkpoint pathways, and activates effector T cells to release cytokines, leading to immunogenic cell death and the release of tumor-associated antigens. This effect promotes the maturation of dendritic cells, infiltration and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, repolarization of M1-type macrophages, and reduction of M2-type macrophages, immune suppressor Tregs, and MDS cells, thereby reprogramming the TIM. In addition, this innovative strategy promotes the accumulation of immune cells at metastasis sites and significantly impedes the progression of lung metastatic lesions. Overall, this study provides novel insights for reprogramming the TIM using novel immunotherapeutic strategies that leverage the synergistic effects of antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific antibodies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT MAIT cells are one of the largest unconventional T cell populations and, recruited to the site of infection, play both protective and pathogenic roles during pulmonary viral infections. MAIT cell activation patterns change significantly during COVID‐19, with a notable decrease in their frequency in peripheral blood of severe cases. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiles of various immune checkpoint pathways on MAIT, MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells in moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients undergoing cytokine storm. Despite numerous studies comparing MAIT cell characteristics based on COVID‐19 disease severity, none have delved into the critical differences in MAIT cell immune checkpoint profiles between moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients, all experiencing a cytokine storm. Flow cytometry was used to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 35 patients, comprising 18 moderate and 17 severe cases, alongside 14 healthy controls. Our investigation specifically focuses on severe COVID‐19 presentations, revealing a marked deletion of MAIT cells. Further exploration into the regulatory dynamics of MAIT cell functionality reveals shifts in the expression profiles of critical immune checkpoint receptors, notably PD‐1 and CD226. In severe COVID‐19 patients, MAIT cells showed a significant decrease in the expression of CD226, whereas MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of PD‐1 compared to healthy individuals. The expression of the TIGIT receptor remained unaltered across all investigated groups. Our findings contribute to the existing knowledge by elucidating the changes in MAIT cell subpopulations and their potential role in COVID‐19 disease severity.">

        <tr id="Memory T cells are critical for secondary immunity against pathogens, yet their persistence in the absence of antigen remains unclear. While memory CD8+ T cells are known to persist independently of their cognate antigen, the durability of memory CD4+ T cells in the absence of antigen remains controversial. Recovery from cutaneous leishmaniasis confers lifelong immunity, largely mediated by CD4+ T cells, but the necessity of persistent parasites for sustaining this immunity has not been empirically confirmed. We investigated immunity in mice infected with a dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts)-deficient Leishmania major, which cannot persist due to their thymidine salvage deficiency. These mice lost protection against wild-type challenge, correlating with a decline in Leishmania (PEPCK)-specific CD4+ T cells. To further dissect this relationship, we generated PEPCK-specific CD4+ TCR transgenic (PEG) mice, enabling precise tracking of Leishmania-specific memory CD4+ T cells. Both in vitro and in vivo-generated memory PEG cells gradually disappeared over time in the absence of antigen, irrespective of the host’s MHC II status, and this loss paralleled the erosion of infection-induced immunity. PEG and endogenous PEPCK-specific memory cells were not maintained in mice infected with dhfr-ts- or PEPCK-deficient L. major, resulting in loss of recall responses and secondary immunity. These findings demonstrate that continuous antigen presence is crucial for maintaining Leishmania-specific memory CD4+ T cells and highlight the role of persistent antigen in sustaining long-term immunity against chronic infections.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has brought hope for patients with cancer and showed promising results and a high cure rate in various types of hematological malignancies. However, cellular therapy can lead to profound immunodeficiency of the innate and adaptive immune systems, whether at the systemic or at the local cellular immune response, which is a major predisposing risk factor for invasive opportunistic infection, including fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogens. The role of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and their antigen specificity in humans remains largely unknown, but Tregs have been implicated in a wide range of modulating viral and fungal infections. Though there have been many advancements regarding the use of CAR T-cells in treating hematological malignancies, the intricate and homeostatic role of Tregs in influencing therapeutic outcomes and infection risk remains underexplored. Most published literature on this topic focuses on the role of Treg in the immunosuppression necessary for successful CAR T-cell therapy rather than the dual function of Treg in immunosuppression and immune recovery. We intend to bridge this gap with a specific focus on the contribution of Tregs in the modulation of CAR T-cell efficacy and their role in opportunistic infections after therapy. In this review, we described the potential role and dynamics of Tregs following CAR T-cell therapy, offering an expanded understanding of their impact on patient outcomes and highlighting areas for future research.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Statins, a class of HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors, exhibit prophylactic benefits against immune rejection induced by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo‐HSCT). Despite the protective function is confirmed, the precise mechanism to induce immune tolerance of statin in the initial stages of transplantation remains incompletely understood. Given that Treg cells play a critical role in preventing graft versus host response and Foxp3 as a transcription factor of Treg can be induced by statins, we hypothesize that the immunosuppressive effects of statins are partially mediated through regulation of Treg cells expansion. Methods T cells were stimulated in vitro under anti‐CD3/anti‐CD28/IL‐2/TGF‐β condition or allo‐reactive system with or without the addition of statins. The induction of Tregs were detected using flow cytometry. Allo‐HSCT models were established by transferring donor cells alone or combined with recipient treated by fluvastatin. The proportions of Treg and phenotypes of effector T cells were identified. Cytokine secretion and antigen‐presenting cell (APC) function were tested in irradiated mice. Results Statins induced higher Treg production in classical and allogeneic cell co‐culture conditions in vitro. In the early stage of models treated with fluvastatin only in donors or combined treatment of donors and recipients, a similar phenomenon was observed with elevated levels of Foxp3+ Treg along with increased expression of CCR7, CD62L, and S1P1 on allo‐reactive T cells. Fluvastatin treatment suppressed the secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines IFN‐γ and TNF‐α by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in irradiated mice. Furthermore, fluvastatin also contributed to restraining the numbers and activation of APCs, including dentritic cells (DCs) and macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Our finding demonstrated that statin exposure modulates immune responses during the initial phase of allo‐HSCT by promoting Treg expansion and suppressing inflammatory reactions, which supply a promising strategy for aGVHD prevention.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Although repeated exposure to HIV‐1 can result in infection, some individuals remain seronegative without clinical or serologic evidence of infection; these individuals are known as HIV‐1‐exposed seronegative individuals. This population has been extensively studied to understand the mechanisms associated with natural resistance to HIV infection. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain this resistance: some researchers associated resistance with a low activation phenotype characterized by a decrease in the activation and proliferation of immune system cells linked with infection control and decreased production of cytokines and pro‐inflammatory molecules, whereas others suggest that resistance is related to immune system activation and the expression of high levels of chemokines, pro‐inflammatory cytokines and antiviral molecules. Aims Our study aims to review and analyze the most relevant evidence supporting the role of the activation level of the immune system during natural resistance to HIV‐1 infection. Methods A search was conducted via the PubMed, SciELO and ScienceDirect databases. The literature search was performed in a nonsystematic manner. Articles published in the last five decades addressing immune activation mechanisms in natural resistance to HIV were reviewed. Results A low‐activation phenotype, characterized by a high frequency of Treg cells; reduced expression of CD25, CD38, and HLA‐DR; and lower production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in peripheral and mucosal tissues, plays a key role in reducing the number of activated cells susceptible to infection, but it minimizes chronic inflammation, facilitating viral entry and spread. In contrast, the activation phenotype is associated with high expression of markers such as CD25, CD38, and HLA‐DR, along with elevated high levels of interferon‐stimulated genes and pro‐inflammatory cytokines. This profile could promote infection control while increasing the number of virus‐susceptible cells. Conclusion The complexity of the immune response during HIV exposure, reflected in the conflicting evidence concerning whether low or high immune activation offers protection against infection, suggests that there may be multiple pathways to HIV‐1 resistance, influenced by factors such as the type of viral exposure, the immune environment, and individual genetics. Further research is needed to determine which immune states are protective and how these responses can be modulated to prevent infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The first evidence that Orthopoxvirus induced the expansion in vivo and the recall of effector innate Vδ2 T-cells was described in a macaque model. Although, an engagement of αβ T-cells specific response in patients infected with human monkeypox (Mpox) was demonstrated, little is known about the role of γδ T-cells during Mpox infection. IFN-γ-producing γδ T-cells in the resistance to poxviruses may a key role in inducing a protective type 1 memory immunity. We analyzed the kinetics of Vδ2 T-cell response from the acute phase up to three months after Mpox infection. Fourteen MSM subjects (5 PWH, 35.7%) were enrolled in a longitudinal study from May to July 2022. Blood samples were collected in the early phase of infection (T1, T2) and at 3 months (T3M) post-symptom onset. Vδ2 T-cell profiles (CD45RA/CCR7), activation/exhaustion markers (CD38/HLA-DR/CD57/PD-1/TIM-3), cytokine production (IFN-γ/TNF-α) and CD107a expression were assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry. Ten healthy donors (HD) were used as a control group. At T1, Vδ2 T-cell frequency of patients decreased, and effector memory Vδ2 T-cells increased with respect to HD. Activation/exhaustion markers were higher than HD. Vδ2 functionality decreased at T1 related to HD, and it was associated with CD38 and HLA-DR higher expression as well as TIM-3. Vδ2 T-cells restored their profile at T3M. The presence of effector/activated Vδ2 T-cells in the early stages of Mpox infection and their capability to activate quickly, producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, may be useful to enhance the early adaptive response to human Mpox, maintaining a protective memory/effector T-cell response.">

Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have shown clinical benefit in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) derived brain metastasis (BM), however, their efficacy in lung to leptomeningeal brain metastasis (LLBM) remains poor.


METHODS
A paired matched RNA expression dataset of patients with NSCLCs and BMs was analyzed to idenfiy BM specific suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) features. Next, we created immune-competent LLBM mouse models that mimic clinical LLBM. We evaluated the efficacy of intrathecal (IT) delivery of allogeneic stem cells (SCs) engineered to release single-chain variable fragment anti-PD-1 (scFvPD-1). To enhance tumor cell killing and subsequent modulation of the immune TME, we explored the therapeutic activity of dual SCs releasing oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) and scFvPD-1 and profiled immune and metabolic consequences.


RESULTS
RNA sequencing analysis of primary NSCLCs and BMs revealed an immune-suppressive TME with reduced immune cells and increased PD-1+ T cells in BMs. We showed significantly decreased immune cells and increased PD-1+ T cells in the TME of LLBM compared to primary NSCLC tumors in LLBM mouse tumor models. Next, we showed that locoregional IT treatment with SC releasing scFvPD-1, but not conventional systemic injection of anti-PD-1 antibody, suppressed tumor growth and improved survival in our immune-competent LLBM models. Furthermore, dual SCs releasing oHSV and scFvPD-1 (SC-oHSV/scFvPD-1) enhanced therapeutic outcomes by inducing oHSV-mediated immunogenic cell death, activating anti-tumor T cell signaling, and disrupting oxidative phosphorylation, which sensitized tumors to cisplatin.


CONCLUSION
Locoregional delivery of SC-oHSV/scFvPD-1 effectively targets the immune-suppressive TME in LLBM, providing a promising strategy for treating LLBM.">

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex system of immune cells, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix (ECM), and blood vessels that form a space conducive to cancer cell proliferation. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are abundant in tumors, and they drive immunosuppression through metabolic reprogramming in the TME. This review describes how metabolic pathways such as glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and adenosine metabolism have a significant impact on the function of MDSCs by regulating their immunosuppressive activity and promoting their survival and expansion in tumors. The review also explores key metabolic targets in MDSCs and strategies to modulate MDSC metabolism to improve the tumor immune microenvironment and enhance anti-tumor immune responses. Understanding these pathways can provide insight into potential therapeutic targets for modulating MDSC activity and improving outcomes of cancer immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) substantially limits long-term survival following lung transplantation. To identify potential targets for CLAD prevention, T cells from explanted CLAD lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes, as well as diseased and nondiseased controls were isolated and single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing were performed. TCR sequencing revealed a clonally expanded population of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) with high cytotoxic potential, including upregulation of KLRK1, encoding the co-receptor NKG2D. These cytotoxic CD8+ TRMs accumulated around the CLAD airways and had a 100-fold increase in clonal overlap with lung-draining lymph nodes when compared with non-CLAD lungs. Using a murine model of orthotopic lung transplantation, we confirmed that cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation was due to chronic rejection and not transplantation alone. Furthermore, blocking NKG2D in vivo attenuated the airway remodeling following transplantation and diminished airway accumulation of CD8+ T cells. Our findings support NKG2D as a potential therapeutic target for CLAD, affecting cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In the tumor microenvironment (TME), hypoxia stands as a significant factor that modulates immune responses, especially those driven by T cells. As T cell-based therapies often fail to work in solid tumors, this study aims to investigate the effects of hypoxia on T cell topo-distribution in the TME, gene expression association with T cell states, and clinical responses in melanoma.


METHODS
To generate detailed information on tumor oxygenation and T cell accessibility, we used mathematical modeling of human melanoma tissue microarrays that incorporate oxygen supply from vessels, intratumoral diffusion, and cellular uptake. We created tumor maps and derived plots showing the fraction of CD4 and CD8 T cells against the distance to the nearest vessel and oxygen pressure. To assess their function and transcriptional changes caused by hypoxia, effector T cells were generated and cultured under hypoxia (0.5% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen). The T cell hypoxia-transcriptional signature was compared against datasets from msigDB, iATLAS (clinical trials of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)), ORIEN AVATAR (real-world melanoma patients treated with ICIs), and a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.


RESULTS
We made three specific observations: (1) in melanoma T cells preferentially accumulated in oxygenated areas close to blood vessels (50-100 µm from the vasculature in the regions of high oxygen availability) but not in hypoxic areas far from blood vessels. (2) Our analysis confirmed that under hypoxia, T cell functions were significantly reduced compared with normoxic conditions and accompanied by a unique gene signature. Furthermore, this hypoxic gene signature was prevalent in resting and non-activated T cells. Notably and clinically relevant, the hypoxic T cell gene set was found to correlate with reduced overall survival and reduced progression-free survival in melanoma patients, which was more pronounced in non-responder patients undergoing ICI therapy. (3) Finally, compared with a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating T cells, our hypoxia signature aligned with a population of cells at a state termed stress response state (TSTR).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study highlights the critical role of hypoxia in shaping T cell distribution and its correlation with clinical outcomes in melanoma. We revealed a preferential accumulation of T cells in oxygenated areas. Moreover, hypoxic T cells develop a distinct hypoxic gene signature prevalent in resting, non-activated T cells and TSTR that was also associated with poorer outcomes, particularly pronounced among non-responders to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Brain metastasis (BM) is a poor prognostic factor in cancer patients. Despite showing efficacy in many extracranial tumors, immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or anti-CTLA-4 mAb appears to be less effective against intracranial tumors. Promisingly, recent clinical studies have reported that combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs has a potent antitumor effect on BM, highlighting the need to elucidate the detailed mechanisms controlling the intracranial tumor microenvironment (TME) to develop effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Here, we analyzed the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in murine models of BM that responded to anti-CTLA-4 mAb to anti-PD-1 mAb. Activated CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells with high CTLA-4 expression characteristically infiltrated the intracranial TME, which were activated by the combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 treatment. Loss of TFH cells suppressed the additive effect of CTLA-4 blockade on anti-PD-1 mAb. B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) produced by abundant myeloid cells, particularly CD80hiCD206lo pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages, in the intracranial TME, induced B cell and TFH cell infiltration and activation. Furthermore, the intracranial TME of patients with non-small cell lung cancer featured TFH and B cell infiltration as tertiary lymphoid structures. Together, these findings provide insights into the immune cell crosstalk in the intracranial TME that facilitates an additive anti-tumor effect of CTLA-4 blockade with anti-PD-1 treatment, supporting the potential of a combination immunotherapeutic strategy for BM.">

        <tr id="Trafficking of immune cells to the central nervous system is hypothesized to facilitate HIV entry and immune-induced neuronal injury and is mediated by surface proteins such as chemokine receptors and α4 integrin. We longitudinally assessed immune cell activation and surface marker expression in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood and their relationship with CSF HIV RNA beginning during primary HIV infection (PHI) before and after antiretroviral therapy (ART).Longitudinal paired blood and CSF were obtained in ART-naïve PHI (<12 month since infection) participants; some independently initiated ART during follow up. Multiparameter flow cytometry of fresh samples determined activation (% CD38+HLADR+) and chemokine receptor expression (% CCR5+ and CXCR3+) on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and subtype and α4 integrin expression (% and mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) of CD49d+) on monocytes. HIV RNA was quantified by PCR. Analyses employed Spearman correlation, within-subject correlation, and linear mixed models.51 participants enrolled at a median 3.2 months post HIV transmission with 168 total visits (113 pre-ART, 55 post-ART) and a median of 6.5 months of longitudinal follow up (range 0-40). In pre-ART PHI, frequencies of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were much higher in CSF than in blood, with levels similar to ART-naïve people with chronic HIV infection. Both CSF CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation increased longitudinally prior to initiation of ART. In multivariate analysis, CSF CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell activation independently predicted CSF HIV RNA. Neither CSF monocyte subtypes or α4 expression correlated with CSF HIV RNA. Blood monocyte α4 MFI correlated with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation (p<0.05). Following ART initiation, blood but not CSF T cell activation declined with days on treatment (slope=-0.06, p=0.001). During ART, blood and CSF monocyte α4 MFI correlated with T cell activation (p<0.05).In untreated early infection after PHI, immune activation increases over time, and CSF CD4+ T cell activation but not monocyte activation correlates with CSF HIV RNA. Intrathecal T cell activation does not decline during early follow up on ART. Immunomodulating therapies may be needed to prevent neuronal injury and HIV neuroinvasion during early HIV.">

Here, we generated TAK-500, an immune cell directed antibody drug conjugate (iADC), to deliver a STING agonist to CCR2+ human cells and drive enhanced antitumor activity relative to non-targeted STING agonists. Preclinically, TAK-500 triggered dose-dependent innate immune activation in vitro. In addition, a murine TAK-500 iADC surrogate enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses both in vitro and in murine tumor models. Spatially resolved analysis of CCR2 and immune cell markers in the TME of >1,000 primary human tumors showed the CCR2 protein was predominantly expressed in intratumoral myeloid cells.

 Over 50% of GBM cases involve EGFR alterations, yet their impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear. Previous studies suggest EGFR overexpression fosters an immunosuppressive TME dominated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), which inhibit immune cell infiltration and activity. This immune "cold" nature of GBM contributes to poor responses to treatments, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which has shown limited effectiveness compared to other malignancies. We hypothesized that EGFR alterations contribute to increased accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and reduced T cell density in the TME. Targeted EGFR ablation or inhibition using a small molecule inhibitor will reduce myeloid cell populations, promote T and B cell recruitment, and enhance T cell infiltration and activation. To investigate the impact of EGFR inhibition on the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME), we used the MADR-mEGFRvIII murine glioma model, which expresses murine EGFRvIII under a tetracycline-off promoter. The model was established via perinatal electroporation, incorporating PTEN and CDKN2A deletions, and mimics patient GBM. Tumors with active EGFRvIII were implanted intracranially, and samples were collected on days 4, 9, and 18 post-implantation for flow cytometry to profile immune cell composition. Mice with established tumors received treatment with doxycycline for genetic EGFR ablation or ERAS-801, a brain-penetrant small molecule EGFR inhibitor, and were compared to untreated control mice. Brain tissues were zinc-fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with H&E to confirm tumor presence. Adjacent sections underwent multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) to visualize and quantify immune cells. Quantitative analysis with HALO Image Analysis Software was used for immune cell densities and localization within the TME. Flow cytometric analysis of tumors, lymph nodes, and spleens collected at different time points showed a dominant infiltration of macrophages within the TME between Day 4 and Day 18 post-implantation. Early EGFR ablation/inhibition at Day 9 reduced TAMs, increased T and B cell infiltration, and improved survival by 50% compared to untreated controls. mIF of brain sections confirmed that MADR-mEGFRvIII tumor’s TME was dominated with myeloid cells, with limited T and B cell infiltration in Vehicle mice, aligning with findings in human GBM. mIF analysis showed reduced tumor cell proliferation and higher immune cell infiltration in the doxycycline and ERAS-801-treated groups compared to Vehicle mice. HALO image analysis confirmed enhanced spatial distribution and co-localization of lymphocytes, indicating improved immune cell activity in the TME following EGFR inhibition. The results demonstrate that EGFR ablation/inhibition reprograms the TME by reducing myeloid cell dominance and enhancing lymphocyte infiltration and activation. Future research will investigate combining EGFR-targeted therapy with ICB to further boost immune responses within the TME.

While CAR-T cells have shown promise in some patients, sustaining T-cell activity and overcoming the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME) remain significant hurdles. Here, we present an armoured CAR-T cell design to address these challenges and enhance persistence in GBM tumours. We developed a highly specific humanised single-domain antibody (VHH) targeting IL13Rα2 and included it alongside four additional modular elements in a single retroviral vector for CAR-T generation. Our results demonstrate that this single-cassette CAR-T cell design possesses high resilience against TGF-β-mediated immunosuppression, enhanced tumour-killing capacity through IL-12 secretion while maintaining a favourable safety profile, extended persistence in the host, and an additional layer of safety control through the incorporation of a suicide switch. Importantly, despite its complexity, the construct can still be manufactured efficiently. These advancements represent a significant step forward in addressing key challenges associated with CAR-T cell therapy in solid tumours.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background There is a need for noninvasive immunological biomarkers that can identify stable kidney allograft immune quiescence to inform individualized immunosuppression. Methods We conducted a cross‐sectional, pilot cohort study evaluating the relative abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to effector T‐cell (Teff) populations as a surrogate marker of long‐term graft tolerance. We obtained fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients, most with recent surveillance biopsies to identify the presence or absence of chronic inflammation. Tregs were sub‐phenotyped as naïve, memory, and activated Tregs (aTreg). Treg/Teff ratios were modeled for association with chronic inflammation and in the context of potential clinical features. Results Twenty‐seven patient samples were included on standard immunosuppression (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) with a mean age of 9.2 ± 5.0 years, at 30.2 ± 21.7 months posttransplant. The ratio of aTreg (FOXP3++CD45RA−) to Th17 cells (CD4+IL‐17+) was significantly greater in patients without inflammation than in patients with graft inflammation (p < 0.01). Similarly, there was a trend toward greater aTreg/CD4+ T cells and aTreg/CD8+ Teff in patients without inflammation (p = 0.05 and 0.09, respectively). There was no significant association for inflammation with naïve or memory Treg/Teff ratios. Multiple logistic regression with all three aTreg/Teff ratios modeled allograft inflammation with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–0.98). Conclusions The proportion of peripheral blood aTregs/Teff cells in this pilot cohort of stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients was associated with immune quiescence. These data support further investigation into aTreg/Teff monitoring to inform precision immunosuppressive treatment.">

 Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine how T cell engagers (TCEs) impact the localization and phenotype of key T-cell subsets in preclinical solid tumor models. Background: TCEs are a class of immunotherapy that have demonstrated substantial benefit to patients with hematologic cancers and have shown evidence of clinical activity in solid tumor malignancies. Mechanisms of response to TCEs, particularly in solid tumors, are not well understood. Identification of diagnostic strategies to stratify patients that are more likely to respond is expected to enhance the clinical benefit of TCEs. Friedrich et al. (Cancer Cell 2023) found that effector CD8 T cell subsets significantly expanded in TCE responsive but not refractory patients in multiple myeloma using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Furthermore, the increased abundance of exhausted T cells at baseline was associated with a worse prognosis. We hypothesize that analogous populations exist in preclinical solid tumor models, which have distinct localization and cellular interactions within the TCE treated tumor microenvironment. Methods: Either hCD3 transgenic C57BL/6J or wildtype FVB mice were implanted with either ID8-LyPD1 or Fo5-HER2 tumors. Mice were grouped at a tumor volume of ∼ 300mm^3 and treated with either 10mpk of LyPD1 TCE, 5mpk of HER2 TCE, or vehicle. scRNAseq data was produced at day 1 and 4 post-treatment according to the 10X gene expression kit protocol and was processed in R using Seurat. Flow cytometry data was generated using commercially available antibodies, acquired on a BD FACSymphony and analyzed using FlowJo. Xenium data was generated using a custom probe panel according to the 10X Xenium protocol and was processed in either Python or R using the Squidpy or Seurat packages. Results: In the ID8-LyPD1 TCE model, we identified proliferative effector (CD8.pe) and terminally differentiated (CD8.Tex) CD8 populations by scRNAseq. The abundance of CD8.pe increased 3-fold and CD8.Tex expanded 2-fold upon TCE treatment. We then validated the expansion of these CD8 subsets by flow cytometry. Notably, increases in the number of CD8.pe per gram of tumor significantly correlated with reductions in tumor volume. Due to the impact of TCE treatment on these CD8 subsets and the importance of CD8.pe in tumor outcomes, we profiled the localization and cellular interactions of CD8s in preclinical solid tumors. Cell-cell communication inference analysis suggested that CD8s were more frequently targets of cellular interactions in TCE treated tumors. Utilizing Xenium spatial transcriptomics we verified that CD8.pe and CD8.Tex were more abundant in TCE treated samples and that their interactions with other key cell subsets were enhanced by TCE treatment. Conclusions: In summary we found that key CD8 subsets were expanded by TCE treatment in preclinical solid tumor models, that the abundance of CD8.pe correlates with reduced tumor burden, and that TCE treatment promotes cellular interactions among CD8s and other key cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment.

In this issue of the JCI, McCarthy and colleagues used the SKG mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis to characterize the role of Sag activity in inflammatory arthritis by profiling arthritogenic naive CD4+ T cells. Within the diseased joints, they found a marked enrichment of T cell receptor–variable β (TCR-Vβ) subsets that were reactive to the endogenously encoded mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) Sag. Arthritis was improved using reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Moreover, depletion of MMTV Sag-activated TCR-Vβ subsets affected the ability of transferred activated CD4+ T cells to induce disease in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Further virological studies should determine whether endogenous or exogenous MMTV is necessary or sufficient to trigger inflammatory arthritis in the SKG model.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Due to their enhanced responsiveness and persistence, cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML)-natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as new immunotherapeutic tools against malignancies. However, their effects on tumor-cell spread and metastases in solid tumors remain poorly investigated. Moreover, a clear identification of the most effective CIML-NK subsets, especially in controlling cancer stem cells (CSC), is still lacking. Methods We performed combined phenotypical and functional analyses of CIML-NK cell subsets, either selected by flow-cytometry gating, or generated from sorted CD56bright/CD56dim NK cells. By co-culture experiments, we analyzed the effect of CIML-NK cells on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell spheroids, or patient-derived xenografts (PDX), assessing changes in their CSC content, tumorigenicity, and/or tumor disseminating capability in vivo. CIML-NK cells were also infused in PDX-bearing mice to validate their effect on the CSC dissemination from the PDX to the lungs. Finally, we generated and functionally analyzed CIML-NK cells from patients with stages I/III NSCLC (n=6). Results We show that CIML-NK cells exert antitumor activity mostly through their CD56bright cell subset, which greatly expands during CIML differentiation. Compared with NK cells conventionally activated with interleukin-2, CIML-NK cells express lower levels of check-point receptors, TIGIT and TIM3, and higher effector functions against NSCLC cells from PDX, and against in vitro-generated tumor spheroids. Remarkably, CIML-NK cells also significantly reduce the CSC-containing CD133+ cell subpopulation within spheroids and PDX, and limit tumor cell tumorigenicity and ability to disseminate CSCs from primary tumors to distant sites. Sorting experiments on CIML or tumor cell subsets reveal that CD56bright cells drive most of this anti-CSC activity, and suggest that such functional advantage could be related to increased expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 on CD56bright cells and CSCs, respectively. We also show that the tri-specific killer cell engager (TriKE) 1615133 significantly enhances CIML-NK cell activity against CSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that CIML-NK cells, capable of killing autologous tumor cells and responding to the 1615133 TriKE, could be induced from patients with NSCLC. Conclusions Our study discloses for the first time the therapeutic potential of CIML-NK cells in controlling CSCs and metastatic spread, highlighting the role of the CD56bright subset expansion and 1615133 TriKE for optimizing CIML-NK-based therapies against metastatic tumors.">

 Addressing the limited responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in human cancers remains a critical challenge. Efforts over the past two decades have primarily focused on enhancing CD8 T cell function and preventing their exhaustion. However, less attention has been given to understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which impedes CD8 T cell infiltration and fosters ICB resistance. The TME in ICB-resistant tumors is characterized by Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) cytokine signaling, leading to a fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) and the accumulation of immunosuppressive fibroblasts and myeloid cells. These features hinder CD8 T cell penetration, thereby promoting immune escape. The immune checkpoint molecule B7-H3, overexpressed in ICB-resistant cancers, has been linked to impaired CD8 T cell infiltration and poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms governing B7-H3 function remain poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between B7-H3 gene expression and ICB response using transcriptomic data from two randomized phase 3 trials (IMvigor010 and IMvigor210). Bulk RNAseq data, tissue staining, and spectral flow cytometry were used to characterize the TME composition of B7-H3 high and low tumors. Multi-omic profiling of tumor cell lines with manipulated B7-H3 expression was performed to identify downstream targets of B7-H3. Syngeneic mouse tumor models were used to assess the impact of B7-H3 on tumor growth and antitumor immunity. High B7-H3 expression was associated with shorter overall survival in both IMvigor010 (HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.33-0.70, p<0.0001) and IMvigor210 trials (HR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.51-0.92, p=0.01). In ICB-refractory cancers, B7-H3 expression correlated with high levels of fibroblasts, collagen deposits, and M2 macrophages. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a positive association between B7-H3 and TGF-β signaling. Genetic deletion of B7-H3 in tumor cells reduced the surface expression of MMP14, a metalloprotease that activates TGF-β. Pan-cancer analysis identified MMP14 as the gene most correlated with B7-H3 (Pearson r=0.69, p<0.0001). TGF-β activation was reduced by 70% in B7-H3 knockout cells compared to wild-type. Loss of B7-H3 led to MMP14 accumulation in lysosomes, resulting in its degradation. We generated a B7-H3 inhibitor, 5D10, which promotes MMP14 degradation and inhibits TGF-β activation. In humanized B7-H3 mouse models, 5D10 significantly reduced TGF-β activation, enhancing CD8 T cell infiltration and impairing tumor growth. Our research identifies B7-H3 as a driver of immune exclusion and ICB resistance. We describe a novel, receptor-independent mechanism where B7-H3 promotes TGF-β activation via stabilization of MMP14. Targeting B7-H3 represents a strategy to modulate the TME, transforming immune-excluded tumors into immune-inflamed states that may respond better to ICB.

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Chromium, a common environmental and occupational sensitizer, frequently induces allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). This study investigates the role of CD4+ (T helper), CD8+ (T cytotoxic), regulatory (Tregs: CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+), and gamma delta (Tγδ) T cells in chromium tolerance versus hypersensitivity. Methods: Six chromium-allergic patients and six healthy controls were recruited, confirmed via patch testing. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured, with chromium exposure and proliferation assays conducted. Specific T cell subtypes were isolated and analyzed for chromium-specific proliferative responses, cytokine production, and metabolic activity. Results: Chromium-allergic individuals exhibited broad proliferation across PBMC and T cell subsets, contrasting with restricted responses in controls. Treg cells in healthy subjects effectively suppressed T cell proliferation in response to chromium, while allergic individuals showed unmodulated T cell activity, indicative of impaired regulatory function. Cytokine analysis revealed elevated IL-2 and TNF-α but absent IL-10 in allergic patients. Metabolic assessments showed higher glycolytic activity in Tregs of healthy controls, suggesting enhanced regulatory potential. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of balanced effector and regulatory T cell interactions for chromium tolerance. Dysregulated Treg and Tγδ cell functions in allergic individuals may contribute to hypersensitivity, with implications for targeted therapeutic strategies to restore immune balance and reduce allergic responses in chromium-sensitive patients.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, a subset of T cells identified by the surface glycoprotein CD8, particularly those expressing the co-stimulatory molecule CD226, play a crucial role in the immune response to malignancies. However, their role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an immunosuppressive disease, has not yet been explored. We studied 64 CLL patients and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed the proportion of CD226-expressing cells among different CD8+ T cell subsets (including naïve, central memory, effector memory, and effectors) in CLL patients, stratified by Rai stage and immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgHV) mutation status. Additionally, we compared the effector functions of CD8+CD226+ cells and their CD226- counterparts. We also quantified cytokine and chemokine levels in the plasma of CLL and HCs. Furthermore, we reanalyzed the publicly available bulk RNA-seq on CD226+ and CD226-CD8+ T cells. Finally, we evaluated the impact of elevated cytokines/chemokines on CD226 expression. Our results showed that CD226-expressing cells were significantly decreased within the effector memory and effector CD8+ T cell subsets in CLL patients with advanced Rai stages and unmutated IgHV, a marker of poor prognosis. These cells displayed robust effector functions, including cytokine production, cytolytic activity, degranulation, proliferation, and migration capacity. In contrast, CD8+CD226- T cells displayed an exhausted phenotype with reduced Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β) were inversely correlated with the frequency of CD8+CD226+ T cells and may contribute to the downregulation of CD226, possibly leading to T cell dysfunction in CLL. Our findings highlight the critical role of CD8+CD226+RUNX2hi T cells in CLL and suggest that their reduction is associated with disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. This study also underscores the potential of targeting IL-6 and MIP-1β to preserve polyfunctional CD8+CD226+ T cells as a promising immunotherapy strategy.">

CD14+CD16+ monocytes exhibit diverse functions and contribute to neuroinflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-NCI). Analysis of human CD14+CD16+ monocytes matured in vitro by single-cell RNA sequencing identified a heterogenous population of nine clusters. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in each cluster identified increased migratory and inflammatory pathways for a group of clusters, which we termed Group 1 monocytes. Group 1 monocytes, distinguished by increased ALCAM, CD52, CD63, and SDC2, exhibited gene expression signatures implicated in CNS inflammatory diseases, produced higher levels of CXCL12, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, and ROS, and preferentially transmigrated across a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model. Thus, Group 1 cells within the CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset are likely to be major contributors to neuroinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. Patients who have ovarian tumors infiltrated with high frequencies of T cells are associated with a greater survival probability. However, therapies to revitalize tumor-associated T cells, such as PD-L1/PD-1 or CTLA4 blockade, are ineffective for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that for ovarian cancer, Toll-Like Receptor 5 (TLR5) signaling, for which the only known ligand is bacterial flagellin, governed failure of PD-L1 and CTLA4 blockade. Mechanistically, chronic TLR5 signaling on CD11c+ cells in vivo and in vitro impaired the differentiation of functional IL-12-producing XCR1+CD103+ conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), biasing CD11c+ precursor cells toward myeloid subsets expressing high levels of PD-L1. This culminated in impaired activation of CD8+ T cells, reducing CD8+ T-cell function and ability to persist within the ovarian tumor microenvironment. Expansion of cDC1s in situ using FLT3L in combination with PD-L1 blockade achieved significant survival benefit in TLR5 knockout mice bearing ovarian tumors, whereas no benefit was observed in the presence of TLR5 signaling. Thus, we have identified a host-intrinsic mechanism leading to the failure of PD-L1 blockade for ovarian cancer, demonstrating that chronic TLR5 signaling on CD11c+ cells is a barrier limiting the efficacy of checkpoint therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to the malignant progression of tumors by exerting immunosuppressive effects. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) have been widely demonstrated in various types of solid tumors. LPS can promote the malignant progression of tumors, which mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, a type of MDSC‐like tumor cells (MLTCs) is found in tumor tissues induced by low‐dose and long‐term LPS stimulation. MLTCs can simultaneously express tumor cell and MDSCs markers. Similar to MDSCs, MLTCs can produce arginine, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species and inhibit the activity of NK and T cells to promote the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. MLTCs can also promote tumor cell proliferation and vasculogenic mimicry formation. CRISPR‐Cas9 activity screening studies identified RNA‐binding Fox‐1 homolog 3 (Rbfox3) as a critical protein for MLTCs formation after LPS treatment. Rbfox3 can transcriptionally regulate the expression of Ass1 in the form of phase‐separated particles. Crocin can inhibit the generation of MLTCs by disrupting phase‐separated particles of Rbfox3 and enhance the anti‐tumor effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by dysregulated humoral immunity, leading to the generation of autoreactive B cells that can differentiate both within and outside of lymph node (LN) follicles.Here, we employed spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging to investigate the follicular immune landscaping and the in situ transcriptomic profile in LNs from SLE individuals.Our spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed robust type I IFN and plasma cell signatures in SLE compared to reactive, control follicles. Cell deconvolution revealed that follicular T cell subsets are mainly affected by the type I IFN fingerprint of SLE follicles. Dysregulation of TFH differentiation was documented by i) the significant reduction of Bcl6hi TFH cells, ii) the reduced cell density of potential IL-4 producing TFH cell subsets associated with the impaired transcriptomic signature of follicular IL-4 signaling and iii) the loss of their correlation with GC-B cells. This profile was accompanied by a marked reduction of Bcl6hi B cells and an enrichment of extrafollicular CD19hiCD11chiTbethi, age-associated B cells (ABCs), known for their autoreactive potential. The increased prevalence of follicular IL-21hi cells further reveals a hyperactive microenvironment in SLE compared to control.Taken together, our findings highlight the altered immunological landscape of SLE follicles, likely fueled by potent inflammatory signals such as sustained type I IFN and/or IL-21 signaling. Our work provides novel insights into the spatial molecular and cellular signatures of SLE follicular B and TFH cell dynamics, and points to druggable targets to restore immune tolerance and enhance vaccine responses in SLE patients.">

However, the immune microenvironment in cervical cancer remains poorly described. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) were recently described as markers for better immunotherapy response and overall better prognosis in cancer patients. We evaluated the cervical tumor immune microenvironment, specifically focusing on TLS, using combined high-throughput phenotyping, soluble factor concentration dosage in the TME and spatial interaction analyses. We found that TLS presence was associated with a more inflammatory soluble microenvironment, with the presence of B cells as well as more activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, this myeloid cell activation was associated with expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1 and CD40, and proximity of activated conventional type 2 DCs (DC2) to CD8+ T cells, indicating better immune interactions and tumor control. Finally, we associated TLS presence, greater B cell density, and activated DC density with improved progression-free survival, substantiating TLS presence as a potential prognostic marker. Our results provide evidence that TLS presence denotes cell activation and immunotherapy target expression.">

        <tr id="Relevance. Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies worldwide, with high mortality primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and the lack of effective early screening. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in cancer progression, immune evasion, and resistance to therapy. Immune cells, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, along with immune checkpoint proteins like PD-L1, significantly influence tumor behavior and therapeutic response. Understanding their roles in ovarian cancer may provide insights into novel immunotherapeutic strategies. Materials and methods of study. A total of 135 ovarian cancer patients from the Republican Specialized Scientific and Practical Medical Center of Oncology and Radiology, Samarkand Branch, were included in this study. Tumor samples were obtained through biopsy or surgical resection, and immune profiling was performed using multiplex immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The expression levels of CD4+, CD8+, and PD-L1 were quantified, and their spatial distribution within the TME was analyzed. Correlations between immune profiles and clinical outcomes, including survival rates and response to immunotherapy, were assessed. Research results. CD4+ T helper cells exhibited functional diversity, with Th1 cells promoting anti-tumor immunity, whereas Th2 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) contributed to immune suppression in advanced tumors. High CD8+ T-cell infiltration correlated with improved survival; however, elevated PD-L1 expression was associated with T-cell exhaustion (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3) and immune evasion. Increased PD-L1 levels were linked to poor prognosis, reinforcing its role as a key immune checkpoint regulator. Conclusion. This study highlights the prognostic significance of CD4+, CD8+, and PD-L1 expression in ovarian cancer. Immune profiling may aid in personalized treatment strategies, optimizing immunotherapy efficacy. Future research should focus on integrating multi-omics approaches to enhance patient stratification and improve therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immunologically inert or cold tumors pose a substantial challenge to the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The use of oncolytic viruses (OVs) to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in tumor cells is a well-established strategy for initiating the cancer immunity cycle (CIC). This process promotes the trafficking and infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumors, thereby eliciting a tumor-specific immune response. Despite the potential of OVs for handling cold tumors, clinical outcomes have fallen short of expectations. To better understand the obstacles faced by oncolytic virus immunotherapy (OVI), we would like to revisit the OV issue. Growing evidence indicates that limited intratumoral penetration and inadequate intratumoral distribution of OVs are critical factors contributing to the suboptimal response to OVI. Aberrant expressions of matrix proteins by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) alter the mechanical properties of the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM). This results in increased ECM desmoplasia and elevated intratumoral interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), creating physical barriers that impede the penetration and dissemination of OVs within tumors. This review explores the latest advancements in strategies designed to improve the intratumoral penetration of OVs to facilitate the penetration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) into cold tumors. Additionally, we investigated current clinical trials and challenges associated with translating these strategies into clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The immune suppression mechanisms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unknown, but preclinical studies have implicated macrophage-mediated immune tolerance. Hence, pathways that regulate macrophage phenotype are of strategic interest, with reprogramming strategies focusing on inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-gamma (PI3Kγ) due to restricted immune cell expression. Inhibition of PI3Kγ alone is ineffective in PDAC, despite increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells.


OBJECTIVE
We hypothesised that the immune stimulatory effects of radiation, and its ability to boost tumour antigen availability could synergise with PI3Kγ inhibition to augment antitumour immunity.


DESIGN
We used orthoptic and genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer (LSL-KrasG12D/+;Trp53R172H/+;Pdx1-Cre). Stereotactic radiotherapy was delivered using contrast CT imaging, and PI3Kγ inhibitors by oral administration. Changes in the tumour microenvironment were quantified by flow cytometry, multiplex immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing. Tumour-educated macrophages were used to investigate efferocytosis, antigen presentation and CD8+ T cell activation. Single-cell RNA sequencing data and fresh tumour samples with autologous macrophages to validate our findings.


RESULTS
Tumour-associated macrophages that employ efferocytosis to eradicate apoptotic cells can be redirected to present tumour antigens, stimulate CD8+ T cell responses and increase local tumour control. Specifically, we demonstrate how PI3Kγ signalling restricts inflammatory macrophages and that inhibition supports MERTK-dependent efferocytosis. We further find that the combination of PI3Kγ inhibition with targeted radiotherapy stimulates inflammatory macrophages to invoke a pathogen-induced like efferocytosis that switches from immune tolerant to antigen presenting.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data supports a new immunotherapeutic approach and a translational rationale to improve survival in PDAC.">

B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is a heterogenous group of aggressive and indolent malignancies with significant therapeutic challenges due to high relapse rates and limited options for relapsed/refractory disease. BsAbs function by simultaneously binding to CD3 on endogenous T-cells and a tumor-associated antigen, creating an immunologic synapse which results in the death of the target cell. The widespread T-cell activation that occurs with BsAb administration can result in cytokine release syndrome and neurological adverse events. Mosunetuzumab, epcoritamab, and glofitamab are CD20-targeting BsAbs that have demonstrated promising single-agent activity in both indolent and aggressive B-NHL. BsAbs are now being evaluated in combination with other anti-lymphoma agents and in earlier lines of treatment, and the results of ongoing clinical trials involving these agents have the potential to reshape the treatment landscape for B-NHL. In this review, we describe the structural features, clinical data, and toxicity profile associated with the BsAbs currently used to treat B-NHL and then discuss ongoing studies and future directions for this exciting new class of therapeutic agents.">

 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) harness the power of the immune system to fight against systemic cancers. Despite being one of the most promising current therapeutic strategies, response rates remain heterogeneous. Immunologically cold tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are among those that do not respond well to checkpoint inhibition. Ferroptosis-related therapies are emerging as a new class of therapeutics for chemo-resistant and metastatic cancers, as they exploit the antioxidant dependence of cancer cells, circumventing most resistance mechanisms. However, the relationship between ferroptosis and the tumor microenvironment (TME) is not well characterized. Here, we leverage ferroptosis-inducing therapies as an adjuvant for immunotherapy and monitor the myeloid dynamics in response with immuno-Positron Emission Tomography (immuno-PET). Methods: A myeloid-heavy TNBC model was used to study myeloid dynamics in response to ferroptosis therapy. The immunogenicity of ferroptotic cancer cells was investigated through in vitro quantification of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The impact of ferroptosis therapies on macrophages was also evaluated. Furthermore, the synergy of ferroptosis-inducing therapy (using IKE) and ICB (with aPD-1) was assessed in vivo, and immune infiltration changes were quantified via flow cytometry and tissue staining. To facilitate this investigation, a pan-myeloid radioimmunoconjugate, 89Zr-DFO-CD11b, was developed as an immunoPET agent to quantitatively monitor spatiotemporal dynamics of tumor myeloid cells during ferroptosis-based therapy. Results: TNBC cells undergoing ferroptosis exhibit an immunogenic phenotype, characterized by increased DAMP production, which can contribute to TME reprogramming. Macrophages exposed to cells undergoing ferroptosis were polarized to an anti-tumor phenotype, exhibited increased tumor spheroid infiltration, and increased phagocytosis signaling. In vivo combination of IKE with aPD-1 suppressed tumor growth. The combination therapy increased tumor infiltration of lymphocyte populations, particularly CD8+ T cells, as well as anti-tumor macrophages, into the tumor core. After confirming 89Zr-DFO-CD11b showed high radiochemical conversion, stability in serum, and specific binding to myeloid cells both in vitro and in vivo, 89Zr-DFO-CD11b was injected IV into tumor-bearing mice receiving therapy. Tumor uptake was significantly less in the combination therapy group, with a distinct pocket of myeloid cells in the center of treated tumors, compared to control tumors with myeloid cells around the tumor periphery. Conclusions: This study underscores the potential of ferroptosis as an adjuvant to immunotherapy, with spatiotemporal immune cell dynamics highlighted by 89Zr-DFO-CD11b myeloid imaging. Future studies will multiplex PET imaging with T cell and ferroptosis markers to further elucidate TME dynamics.

Cirrhosis, an advanced stage of liver diseases, induces Cirrhosis-Associated Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CAIDS) characterized by both innate and adaptive immune dysfunction. Inflammation triggered by factors such as alcohol, viruses, toxins, and cholesterol induce metabolic reprogramming of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Our study specifically sought to investigate the compromised adaptive immune response in cirrhosis by focusing on assessing T-cell exhaustion and activation markers on helper and cytotoxic T cells.


METHOD
A prospective observational study involving 19 liver cirrhosis patients and 36 healthy controls was conducted. Hepatic decompensation degree was assessed using various parameters including serum bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. T cell activation (CD38, CD44, CD69, HLADR), and exhaustion markers (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3) were assessed on helper and cytotoxic T cells by flow cytometry.


RESULT
Cirrhosis patients showed reduced T cells with no alteration in CD4:CD8 T cell ratio. Among activation markers, HLADR showed increased expression on CD8+ T cells (P=0.031). Regarding exhaustion markers LAG-3 and TIM-3 exhibited increased expression in cirrhotic patients compared to controls in both CD4 and CD8 T cells (P=0.004, P=0.016, P=0.001, P=0.004, respectively). Neither cirrhotic nor healthy controls showed CTLA expression. PD-1 did not differ significantly between the two groups. Co-expression of PD-1/TIM-3 on CD8+ T cells was notably higher in cirrhotic patients (P<0.002).


CONCLUSION
The observation of impaired adaptive immunity with notable T cell exhaustion and activation in cirrhosis underscores the potential relevance of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Understanding both local and systemic immunity is essential to optimizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the dynamic alterations in systemic immunity during tumor development are yet to be clearly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized connection that bridges the interaction between the spleen and tumor through erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), which suppress tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. We performed the single-cell RNA-seq and RNA-seq to demonstrate the presence of EPCs and identify the characteristic and an immunomodulatory role of EPCs during tumor progression. These tumor-hijacked EPCs proliferate in situ in spleens and impaired systemic and local antitumor response through the interaction between tumor and spleen. Specifically, the splenic CD45- EPCs secreted heparin-binding growth factor to regulate PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression of splenic CD45+ EPCs. Educated CD45+ EPCs from the spleen then migrated to the tumors via the CCL5/CCR5 axis, thereby weakening local antitumor immunity. Consequently, targeting EPCs not only revitalized antitumor immunity but also improved the anti-PD-L1 effect by promoting intratumoral T cell infiltration. Importantly, CD45+ EPCs are associated with immunosuppression and reduced survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal the role of EPCs in orchestrating the interaction between the spleen and tumor, which could have significant implications for the development of more effective cancer immunotherapy.">

Tumor-associated macrophages are particularly influential in the regulation of immunosuppressive cytokines, thereby supporting tumor metastasis. The upregulation of Th2 cytokines in cancer cells is recognized for its involvement in suppressing anticancer immunity. However, the association between these cytokines and tumor-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) remains poorly understood. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the connection between tumor-promoting macrophages and melanoma-derived EVs. The analysis from altered cytokine profile data showed that melanoma-derived EVs upregulate Th2 cytokine expression in naïve macrophages, thereby contributing to the promotion of tumor-supporting functions. Notably, many of these cytokines were also found to be upregulated in metastatic melanoma patients (n = 30) compared to healthy controls (n = 33). Overall, our findings suggest a strong connection between melanoma secretory EVs and the induction of tumor-associated macrophages that facilitates the development of an immunosuppressive TME, supporting melanoma metastasis through regulation at both local and systemic levels.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is associated with dysregulated/chronic inflammation. The immune system has multiple roles including beneficial effects such as clearing alpha synuclein aggregates. However, peripheral immune cells entering the brain may also contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. To identify which cells might have a negative impact and could be potential therapeutic targets, we compared immune signatures of patients and healthy controls.


METHODS
Multicolor flow cytometry was used to determine the frequencies of major immune cell subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PD patients and controls. Because of the major impact of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on the distribution of immune cell subsets, particularly cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T-cells, all participants were tested for CMV seropositivity.


RESULTS
Although the cohort of 35 PD patients exhibited the well-established T-cell differentiation signature driven by CMV infection, there were no differences in the frequencies of differentiated or pro-inflammatory T-cells, B-cells or natural killer cells (NK-cells) attributable to the disease. However, percentages of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were higher in PD patients than controls. Moreover, percentages of CD14+CD16+ (intermediate) monocytes expressing the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) correlated with disease severity assessed by the Movement Disorder Society's revised version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) score and disease duration.


CONCLUSIONS
A comprehensive evaluation of the major subsets of circulating immune cells in PD patients revealed differences in myeloid cells between PD and healthy controls and some correlation of monocyte abundance with disease severity.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare haematological cancer with poor 5-years overall survival (OS) and high relapse rate. Leukemic cells are sensitive to Natural Killer (NK) cell mediated killing. However, NK cells are highly impaired in AML, which promote AML immune escape from NK cell immune surveillance. We made the first report of CD56neg CD16+ NK cells expansion in AML. This unconventional subset has been reported to expand in some chronic viral infections. Although it is unclear whether CD56neg NK cells expansion mechanism is common across diseases, it seems more relevant than ever to further investigate this subset, representing a potential therapeutic target. Methods We used PBMCs from AML patients and HV to perform mass cytometry, spectral flow cytometry, bulk RNA-seq and in vitro assays in order to better characterize CD56neg CD16+ NK cells that expand in AML. Results We confirmed that CD56neg CD16+ NK cells represent a unique NK cell subset coexpressing Eomes and T-bet. CD56neg CD16+ NK cells could recover CD56 expression in vitro where they displayed unaltered NK cell functions. We previously demonstrated that CD56neg CD16+ NK cells expansion at diagnosis was associated with adverse clinical outcome in AML. Here, we validated our findings in a validation cohort of N=38 AML patients. AML patients with CD56neg CD16+ NK cells expansion at diagnosis had decreased overall survival (HR[CI95]=5.5[1.2-24.5], p=0.0251) and relapse-free survival (HR[CI95]=13.1[1.9-87.5], p=0.0079) compared to AML patients without expansion after 36 months follow-up. RNA-seq unveiled that CD56neg CD16+ NK cells were mature circulating NK cells with functional capacities. Upon expansion, CD56neg CD16+ NK cells from AML patients showed altered proteomic phenotype, with increased frequency of terminally mature CD56neg CD16+ NK cells expressing TIGIT along with decreased frequency of Siglec-7+ CD56neg CD16+ NK cells. Discussion Taken together, our results suggest that we could harness CD56neg CD16+ NK cells cytotoxic potential in vitro to restore NK cell anti-tumor response in AML patients with CD56neg CD16+ NK cells expansion and improve patients’ prognosis. To conclude, CD56neg CD16+ NK cells represent a relevant target for future NK-cell-based immunotherapies in AML.">

        <tr id="Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus associated with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), a hematological malignancy, and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM), a progressive neurological disorder. HTLV-1 predominantly infects CD4+ T cells in vivo. The T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex on CD4+ helper T cells plays a pivotal role in immune responses by recognizing antigens and facilitating coordination with other immune cells. Dysfunction of the TCR/CD3 complex may impair immune function. Although CD3 downregulation has been identified as a characteristic of ATL cells, it remains uncertain whether a similar downregulation occurs in HTLV-1-infected cells from HAM patients. We hypothesized that HTLV-1 infection leads to TCR and CD3 downregulation, contributing to immune dysfunction in HAM patients. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed TCR/CD3 expression, TCR signaling, and immune responses in HTLV-1-infected cells from HAM patients. Intracellular HTLV-1 Tax detection revealed that HTLV-1 preferentially targets CD4+ over CD8+ T cells. CD3 and TCR expression levels were significantly lower in CD4+ T cells from HAM patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, HTLV-1-infected cells exhibited markedly reduced CD3 and TCR expression compared to uninfected cells. Impairments in TCR signaling, assessed through Lck and ZAP70 phosphorylation upon CD3 stimulation, were observed in CD4+ T cells from HAM patients compared to those from healthy controls. Notably, this reduction in TCR signaling was more pronounced in HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells than in uninfected CD4+ T cells in HAM patients. Additionally, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD4+ T cells detected by an addition of CMV antigens demonstrated reduced interferon-γ production in HTLV-1-infected cells compared to their uninfected counterparts. These findings suggest that TCR/CD3 downregulation and impaired TCR signaling contribute to immune dysfunction in HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. As CD4+ T cells play a central role in immune responses, this mechanism may partially explain the cellular immune dysfunction to other pathogens observed in HAM patients.">

 A fundamental dichotomy in lymphocytes separates adaptive T and B lymphocytes, with clonally expressed antigen receptors, from innate lymphocytes, which carry out more rapid responses. Some T cell populations, however, are intermediates between these 2 poles, with the capacity to respond rapidly through T cell receptor activation or by cytokine stimulation. Here, using publicly available datasets, we constructed linear mixed models that not only define a gradient of innate gene expression in common for mouse innate-like T cells, but also are applicable to other mouse T lymphoid populations. A similar gradient could be identified for chromatin landscape based on ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) data. The gradient included increased transcripts related to many traits of innate immune responses, with increased scores related to evidence for antigen experience. While including genes typical for T helper 1 (Th1) responses, the innateness gene program could be separated from Th1, Th2, and Th17 responses. Lymphocyte populations with higher innateness scores correlated with lower calcium-dependent T cell receptor–mediated cell activation, with some downstream signaling proteins dependent on calcium or affecting metabolism prephosphorylation. Therefore, as a group, different mouse innate-like T cell populations had related gene expression programs and activation pathways that are different from naive CD4 and CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="CCR2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, is widely expressed on monocytes, macrophages, activated T cells, and other cell types, and plays a critical role in coordinating the immune response to various infections. Here we demonstrate that CCR2 expression is significantly elevated during Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) respiratory infection, and its absence leads to exacerbated susceptibility, as evidenced by significant weight loss, higher bacterial loads, severe lung pathology, and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (il-1β, tnfα, and il-6). The absence of ccr2 impairs both myeloid cell infiltration and T cell responses, which are crucial for effective immune defense. Specifically, ccr2 deficiency disrupts the differentiation and response of Th1 cells, which are the primary effector lineage responsible for clearing chlamydia through secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). As a result, there is a significant decrease in CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells in the lung and spleen, accompanied by reduced levels of IFN-γ protein and mRNA, as well as downregulated mRNA expression of Th1-promoting cytokines (il-12p35, il-12p40) and transcription factors (stat4, T-bet), which play crucial roles in Th1 differentiation. Moreover, ccr2 deficiency greatly diminishes STAT1 phosphorylation, a key regulator of IFN-γ secretion by Th1 cells. Meanwhile, we also observed a significant reduction in IFN-γ secretion by CD8+ T cells following ccr2 deficiency. Conversely, ccr2-/- mice exhibit an exaggerated Th2-type immune response, with elevated levels of Th2-promoting cytokines (IL-4), transcription factors (STAT6 and gata3), and il-5, which together lead to more severe lung tissue damage and increased susceptibility to infection. Furthermore, these mice show higher levels of IL-17 along with an enhanced Th17-type immune response, characterized by increased Th17-promoting cytokines TGFB, transcription factors stat3 and RORγt, and il-21, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that drives neutrophil infiltration to exacerbate lung inflammation. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CCR2, a chemokine receptor, in orchestrating the immune response to Chlamydia infection by facilitating Th1 cells differentiation while restraining Th2-type and Th17-type immune responses, thereby alleviating pulmonary inflammation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Many patients now survive their initial critical events but subsequently develop chronic critical illness (CCI). CCI is characterized by prolonged hospital stays, poor outcomes, and significant long-term mortality. The incidence of chronic critical illness (CCI) is estimated to be 34.4 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence varies significantly with age, peaking at 82.1 cases per 100,000 in individuals aged 75–79. The one-year mortality rate among CCI patients approaches 50%. A subset of these patients enters a state of persistent inflammation, immune suppression, and ongoing catabolism, a condition termed persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS) in 2012. In recent years, some progress has been made in treating PICS. For instance, recent advancements such as the persistent expansion of MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) and the mechanisms underlying intestinal barrier dysfunction have provided new directions for therapeutic strategies, as discussed below. Persistent inflammation, a key feature of PICS, has received comparatively little research attention. In this review, we examine the potential pathophysiological changes and molecular mechanisms underlying persistent inflammation and its role in PICS. We also discuss current therapies about inflammation and offer recommendations for managing patients with PICS.">

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with TRM features are associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, the cellular interactions that program TRM differentiation and function are not well understood. Using murine genetic models and targeted spatial transcriptomics, we found that the CD8+ T cell-derived chemokine XCL1 is critical for TRM formation and conventional DC1 (cDC1) supported the positioning of intestinal CD8+ T cells during acute viral infection. In tumors, enforced Xcl1 expression by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells promoted intratumoral cDC1 accumulation and T cell persistence, leading to improved overall survival. Notably, analysis of human TIL and TRM revealed conserved expression of XCL1 and XCL2. Thus, we have shown that the XCL1-XCR1 axis plays a non-cell autonomous role in guiding intestinal CD8+ TRM spatial differentiation and tumor control.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoints are critical regulators of T-cell exhaustion, impairing their ability to eliminate antigens present during chronic viral infections. Current immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in the clinic aim to reinvigorate exhausted T cells; yet, most patients fail to respond or develop resistance to these therapies, underscoring the need to better understand these immunosuppressive pathways. PSGL-1 (Selplg), a recently discovered immune checkpoint, negatively regulates T-cell function. We investigated the cell-intrinsic effects of PSGL-1, PD-1, and combined deletion on CD8+ T cells during chronic viral infection. We found that combined PSGL-1 and PD-1 (Selplg-/-Pdcd1-/-) deficiency in CD8+ T cells increased their frequencies and numbers throughout chronic infection compared to the wild type. This phenotype was primarily driven by PD-1 deficiency. Furthermore, while PD-1 deletion increased virus-specific T-cell frequencies, it was detrimental to their function. Conversely, PSGL-1 deletion improved T-cell function but resulted in lower frequencies and numbers. The primary mechanism behind these differences in cell maintenance was driven by proliferation rather than survival. Combined PSGL-1 and PD-1 deletion resulted in defective T-cell differentiation, driving cells from a progenitor self-renewal state to a more terminal dysfunctional state. These findings suggest that PD-1 and PSGL-1 have distinct, yet complementary, roles in regulating T-cell exhaustion and differentiation during chronic viral infection. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the individual and combined roles of PSGL-1 and PD-1 in CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. It underscores the potential of targeting these checkpoints in a more dynamic and sequential manner to optimize virus-specific T-cell responses, offering critical perspectives for improving therapeutic strategies aimed at reinvigorating exhausted CD8+ T cells.IMPORTANCEOur findings provide a comprehensive analysis of how the dual deletion of PD-1 and PSGL-1 impacts the response and function of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, revealing novel insights into their roles in chronic infection. Notably, our findings show that while PD-1 deletion enhances T-cell frequencies, it paradoxically reduces T-cell functionality. Conversely, PSGL-1 deletion improves T-cell function but reduces their survival. Whereas the combined deletion of PSGL-1 and PD-1 in CD8+ T cells improved their survival but decreased their function and progenitor-exhausted phenotypes during infection. We believe our study advances the understanding of immune checkpoint regulation in chronic infections and has significant implications for developing more effective immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies.">

 Cancer therapy has been rapidly transformed by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1. However, many patients fail to respond, particularly those with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), suggesting the existence of additional immune checkpoints that act through orthogonal mechanisms. To overcome therapeutic resistance, identifying and targeting new types of checkpoints, such as glycan-binding immune checkpoints, may offer a promising strategy to reprogram the TME by suppressing tumor-promoting factors. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptors, especially the inhibitory members constitutively expressed on myeloid cells, play an immunosuppressive role in innate immunity. Here, we identify Siglec-7 and -9 immunosuppressors as novel glyco-immune checkpoints that inhibit T cell function and anti-tumor immunity. We discovered that T cells in the TME acquire these Siglec checkpoints from myeloid cells via trogocytosis, impairing T cell activity by dephosphorylating T cell receptor (TCR)-related signaling pathways through engagement with tumor-associated sialoglycans. Using sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry, we developed a high-affinity ligand specific for Siglec-7 and -9, and converted it into a degrader for targeted lysosomal degradation of both Siglecs. This degrader efficiently reduced Siglec levels in T cells and myeloid cells, significantly restoring T cell function and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. The degrader, particularly when combined with anti-CTLA-4, reshaped the TME and generated durable T cell memory, resulting in excellent tumor control in multiple murine models. These findings underscore the significance of degrading exogenously acquired Siglec checkpoints on T cells as a novel strategy to overcome resistance to established checkpoint inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are one of the key immunosuppressive components in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and contribute to tumor development, progression, and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. Several reagents targeting TAMs have been tested in preclinical and clinical studies, but they have had limited success. Here, we show that a unique reagent, FF-10101, exhibited a sustained inhibitory effect against colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor by forming a covalent bond and reduced immunosuppressive TAMs in the TME, which led to strong antitumor immunity. In preclinical animal models, FF-10101 treatment significantly reduced immunosuppressive TAMs and increased antitumor TAMs in the TME. In addition, tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were increased; consequently, tumor growth was significantly inhibited. Moreover, combination treatment with an anti–programmed cell death 1 (anti–PD-1) antibody and FF-10101 exhibited a far stronger antitumor effect than either treatment alone. In human cancer specimens, FF-10101 treatment reduced programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on TAMs, as observed in animal models. Thus, FF-10101 acts as an immunomodulatory agent that can reduce immunosuppressive TAMs and augment tumor antigen-specific T cell responses, thereby generating an immunostimulatory TME. We propose that FF-10101 is a potential candidate for successful combination cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.">

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, delivering impressive results across various cancers. However, resistance is common, and only a limited number of patients experience lasting responses. This underscores the urgent need to understand resistance mechanisms and develop new strategies to enhance responsiveness. Here we focus on breast cancer, particularly ER+ breast cancer, which is generally poorly immunogenic and responds poorly to ICB. To address this, we analyzed the METABRIC cohort's immunogenic biomarkers and tumor mutational burden (TMB). We found that relapsed ER+ patients treated with endocrine therapy exhibit activated immune pathways. However, high TMB correlates with lower overall survival (OS), suggesting an active but clinically ineffective immune response. To explore the immune-resistant mechanisms, we developed chronically tamoxifen-treated T47D and MCF7 cells (cTMX-T47D and cTMX-MCF7) by exposing them to the drug for over six months. RNA sequencing data revealed increased type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and innate immunity in these cells, confirmed in vivo in T47D xenografts. Tracing tamoxifen’s effects, we found that IFN-I signaling and ISG induction depend on the cGAS/STING pathway. Short-term tamoxifen exposure induced only modest ISG expression, indicating additional prerequisites during long-term treatment. We identified that the RACK7/KDM5C H3K4 demethylase complex is crucial for tamoxifen-induced ISG upregulation, with both proteins decreasing over time. Knocking down RACK7 intensified tamoxifen's activation of the cGAS/STING signaling and ISG expression. Combined tamoxifen treatment and RACK7 knockdown significantly enhanced these innate immunity effects compared to either treatment alone. Furthermore, tamoxifen’s DNA-damaging ability modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, particularly through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-induced STING upregulation. We discovered key tamoxifen-mediated mechanisms for cGAS/STING-IFN-I pathway activation via STING upregulation, involving the tamoxifen–mtDNA–STING and tamoxifen–RACK7/KDM5C–STING axes. While IFN-I signaling can promote anti-tumor immunity, our tumor/T-cell co-culture experiments revealed that tamoxifen inactivates T-cells through tumor-intrinsic mechanisms, likely involving T-cell exhaustion pathways. We investigated tamoxifen’s effects on immune checkpoint molecules, finding that CEACAM1, the primary ligand for TIM3, was upregulated in cTMX-T47D and cTMX-MCF7 cells. Further analysis of tamoxifen-treated T47D xenografts revealed elevated CEACAM1 levels, suggesting an immunosuppressive mechanism via the CEACAM1-TIM3 pathway. To investigate this axis in vivo, we used syngeneic tumor mouse models with TS/A (ER+) cells in BALB/c mice. Tamoxifen induced CEACAM1, increased CD45+ immune cell infiltration, and caused TIM3+ CD8 T-cell exhaustion, contributing to tumor progression. Blocking the CEACAM1-TIM3 interaction with an anti-TIM3 antibody significantly inhibited tumor growth, highlighting its role in tamoxifen resistance.

        <tr id="Allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) for patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can result in cure in some patients. Analogous to chemotherapy and targeted therapy, we hypothesized that allogeneic cellular immunotherapies, including alloSCT and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), would impact malignant evolution through the application of selective immunologic pressure with reciprocal changes in the T cell compartment. We tested a cohort of 24 patients treated with HLA-matched alloSCT +/− DLI, two mediators of the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. Comparison of pre-alloSCT samples revealed that a key difference between responders (n=13) and non-responders (n=11) is the cellularity of leukemic cells. We further mapped mutational trajectories of tumor cells by whole exome sequencing (WES) of sort-purified CLL in 11 post-transplant relapsed patients and found evidence of subclonal leukemic evolution in 8/11 patients after nonmyeloablative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched alloSCT. Different patterns of CLL evolution were observed, and these changes included putative CLL drivers in every case. To investigate the presence of immune-related variants in patients, we collected 19 T cell co-culture CRISPR datasets and identified the top positive and negative regulators of cancer cell’s response to T-cell-dependent killing. We found that most mutations linked to T-cell killing emerged after allo-SCT treatment, suggesting that selective pressures from the GVL effect may drive the evolution of these mutations. Together, these data identify cellular homogeneity as a key biomarker for susceptibility to GVL-driven immunity in CLL and illustrate how the leukemic cells further evolve to evade immunosurveillance. SIGNIFICANCE The impact of allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) on subclonal leukemia evolution remains poorly understood. By performing whole exome sequencing (WES) on pre- and post-alloSCT patient samples, we reveal different patterns of CLL evolution and potential immune-related driver genes influencing CLL relapse and refractory disease post-alloSCT.">

 Prevention of metastases is critical for the future of breast cancer research, as metastatic cancer is extremely difficult to manage and treat. Solid tumors often contain patches of hypoxic regions that yield aggressive, pro-metastatic phenotypes. Recent work in our lab has shown that long-term hypoxia suppresses type I interferon (IFN) signaling in breast cancer cells, and this suppression of IFN signaling is maintained even after reoxygenation, indicative of “hypoxic memory.” Breast cancer cells and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that have exited hypoxia but maintain such hypoxic memory showed enhanced metastatic potential. In addition to tumor intrinsic effects, IFN suppression can dampen surrounding immune cell populations within the tumor microenvironment, primarily through interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) which carry out immune functions through activation of various immune cell populations. More research is needed to understand how ISGs are downregulated in hypoxia and how those changes in gene expression contribute to immunosuppressive ability of hypoxic and post-hypoxic cells. Interferon-inducible 44-like (IFI44L) is an ISG that has been associated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and enhanced metastasis in other cancers, but its role in breast cancer has not been studied. We found that IFI44L is significantly suppressed in breast cancer cells in hypoxia and maintained after reoxygenation as hypoxic memory. Overexpressing interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are positive regulators of the type I IFN pathway, did not rescue hypoxic suppression and memory of IFI44L, suggesting IRFs are not the sole regulator of IFN and ISG expression in hypoxia. Current experiments in the lab are ongoing to address the mechanisms responsible for hypoxic memory of IFI44L suppression. Additionally, co-culture studies of IFI44L knockdown and overexpression breast cancer cell lines with different immune populations will shed light on the role of hypoxic suppression of IFI44L in immune evasion. To better understand implications of maintained IFI44L suppression, we will also examine immune cell activity and metastatic potential using in vivo mouse studies. We expect to see less immune cell effect and enhanced metastasis with IFI44L knockdown and reversed phenotypes with overexpression of IFI44L. Understanding mechanisms of immune suppression and evasion mediated via IFI44L can lead to strategies for targeting hypoxia-mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis.

This study examined the effects of pooling donor-derived macrophages on their phenotype and function, focusing on murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs). Murine BMDMs were generated using L929-conditioned media and compared across single and pooled donors (two-to-five mice). Similarly, hMDMs cultured with M-CSF from individual donors were compared to pooled cultures. Pooling macrophages did not alter core phenotypic markers (CD11b, F4/80, CD64) or functional outputs such as cytokine secretion and nitric oxide production. In hMDMs, pooling reduced variability and led to slightly elevated or more-uniform marker expression. These findings demonstrate that pooling macrophages minimizes inter-individual variability without compromising cellular stability or function, enhancing reproducibility in immunological research while maintaining the option of single-donor studies for personalized analyses.">

As tissue-resident secretory immune cells, MCs rapidly detect the presence of bacteria and parasites because they harbor many surface receptors, which enable their activation via a multitude of stimuli. MC activation has been traditionally linked to IgE-mediated allergic reactions, but MCs play a pivotal role in different physiological and pathological processes. In gut, MCs are essential for the maintenance of gastrointestinal (GI) barrier function, and their interactions with neurons, immune cells, and epithelial cells have been related to various GI disorders. This review recapitulates intestinal MC roles in diseases with a main focus on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

        <tr id="Epstein-Barr virus-induced 3 (EBI3) functions as a component of the heterodimer cytokine IL-27, which regulates innate and acquired immune responses. The expression of EBI3 gene is induced by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Repeated treatment with imiquimod (IMQ), a TLR7 agonist, induces splenomegaly and cytopaenia due to increased splenic function. Although immune cell activation is speculated to play a role in chronic infection-mediated splenomegaly, the detailed mechanisms remain unknown. This study shows that IMQ treatment induces marked splenomegaly and severe bicytopaenia (anaemia and thrombocytopaenia) in wild-type mice. In IMQ-treated mice, myeloid cell populations in the spleen increased, and extramedullary haematopoiesis was observed. RNA-seq analysis revealed the upregulation of type I interferon (IFN)-related genes in the spleens of IMQ-treated mice. IMQ-induced pathological changes were partially mitigated by EBI3 deficiency. To investigate the mechanism of the improved phenotypes in the Ebi3 KO mice, we examined the involvement of IL-27, a heterodimer of EBI3 and IL-27p28. The expression of Il27a, which encodes IL-27p28, was increased in the spleen and peripheral blood by IMQ treatment. Furthermore, IL-27 stimulation upregulated type I IFN-related genes in bone marrow-derived macrophage cultures without type I IFN. These findings suggest that EBI3 deficiency mitigated IMQ-mediated pathological changes, presumably via a lack of IL-27 formation. Our study thus provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic infection-mediated splenomegaly.">

        <tr id="The role of natural killer (NK) cells, which mediate innate immunity, in the immune reconstitution of people living with HIV (PLWH) remains unclear. Our previous research indicated that early activation of CD56dimCD16dim/- NK cells plays an important role in the recovery of CD4+ T cells in immunological non-responders (INRs) after ART. This study mainly focuses on the profiles of cell receptors and their relative ligands for NK cells and CD4+ T cells exhibited on INRs and immunological responders (IRs) in order to analyze the impact of differential immune status on immune reconstitution in PLWH receiving ART.This study included 66 PLWH who had been on ART for 4 years, comprising 32 INRs and 34 IRs. Using flow cytometry, we examined the expression of cell receptors and ligands for NK cells and CD4+ T cells in PBMCs, as well as the differentiation of CD4+ T cells.The expression of NKG2D ligands, including MICA/B and ULBP2-5, on CD4+ T cells in INRs is elevated prior to ART. Further research found that the expression of CD95 on MICA/B+CD4+ T cells and ULBP2-5+CD4+ T cells was higher in INRs before ART compared to IRs. Simultaneously, the percentages of death receptor CD95 expression on MICA/B+CD4+ T cells and on ULBP2-5+CD4+ T cells before ART were negatively correlated with CD4+ T-cell counts and ΔCD4. Among the CD4+ T-cell subsets, an imbalance persists in the CD4+ Tcm and CD4+ Temra subsets in both INRs and IRs, before or after ART. CD4+ T cells exhibit elevated levels of activation, proliferation, exhaustion, and apoptosis prior to ART initiation. However, CD4+ T-cell activation and proliferation normalize post-ART, while apoptosis and exhaustion levels remain significantly elevated. Regardless of ART, the anti-apoptotic capacity of CD4+ T cells in INRs is still lower than that of IRs and healthy controls (HCs). Before ART, the frequency of CD31 expression on naive CD4+ T cells in INRs is lower than that in IRs and HCs. Following ART, the amounts of CD31+ Tn from CD4+ T cells remain impaired in both INRs and IRs compared to HCs.The upregulation of related ligands for the NKG2D receptor on CD4+ T cells in INRs is associated with increased susceptibility of CD4+ T cells to NK cell-mediated killing. CD95 may plays an important role in poor recovery of CD4+ T cells co-expressing NKG2D-related ligands. The imbalance in CD4+ Tcm and CD4+ Temra subset homeostasis and impaired CD31 expression on naive CD4+ T cells in INRs are associated with poor immune reconstitution outcomes.">

 B cells are emerging as key players in anti-tumor immunity. Their ability to produce antibodies against tumor-associated antigens makes them potent agents in cancer immunotherapy. However, B cell-based therapies remain underutilized compared with T cell-focused approaches. Tumor-infiltrating B cells can form tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) that resemble lymphoid follicles of inflamed lymph nodes. Significant evidence indicates that TLS are associated with enhanced anti-tumor immunity, and the presence of TLS correlates with improved prognosis and better therapeutic responses across various cancers. However, the development of B cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity might be generated mainly in the tumor-draining lymph nodes, and TLS formation may be a bystander effect of the strong local immune responses. Thus, direct evidence for TLS-B cells contributing to anti-tumor immunity is lacking. Recently, our laboratory discovered that simultaneous activation of innate immune effectors, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR), by their agonists induces mature TLS with germinal center B cell responses in various mouse tumor models. In the current study, we investigated the role of TLS using CD79a knockout mice, which cannot develop TLS due to B cell deficiency. We also leveraged hybridoma technology to generate monoclonal antibodies from TLS-B cells for potential tumor targeting. We show that, in wild type mice, the STING activation improved the fitness of LTβR-induced TLS with B cell maturation to IgG+ long-lived plasma cells and memory cells. This treatment reduced the tumor size and heightened the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition, leading to complete cure. When used as neoadjuvant therapy, it prevented tumor recurrence and metastasis with 100% survival post-tumor rechallenge, indicating the effective immunization against tumors. Functional TLS formed in different tumor types and anatomical sites using this approach. Hybridoma clones developed from TLS-B cells of these tumors generated monoclonal IgG antibodies targeting mouse pancreatic cancer cells, which effectively induced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In contrast, B cell-deficient CD79a KO mice failed to develop TLS while still being capable of developing high endothelial venules in primary tumors. T cell infiltration did not appear to be reduced by the B cell deficiency. However, these mice showed significantly reduced survival (40%) after tumor rechallenge, underscoring the importance of TLS-B cells for coordinated anti-tumor immune responses. These findings underscore the critical role of B cells in the development of functional TLS and strong anti-tumor immunity. The STING and LTβR agonist combination therapeutically induces TLS to produce tumor-specific high-affinity antibodies with significant tumor-killing potential. This approach highlights a promising strategy for targeting immune-cold tumors that are refractory to standard immunotherapies, paving the way for innovative immunotherapies that harness the power of B cells.

 Immunotherapies are a transformative force in clinical oncology, delivering prolonged disease-free survival in refractory cancers. However, in the setting of breast malignancies, clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are both low and ephemeral, particularly in the hormone receptor-positive (HR+) subtype. Effective responses are predicated on abundant neoantigens, the activity of immune effector cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the establishment of immunological memory. These prerequisites pose a significant efficacy barrier as BC patients carry low mutational burdens (neoantigens), and T-cells are profoundly hindered by the presence of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Radiotherapy (RT) holds a significant untapped potential to overcome the lack of neoantigens by triggering immunogenic cell death and recruiting adaptive immunity. However, the unavoidable tissue damage and clearance of dead cells by adjacent macrophages further enhance their wound-healing (immunosuppressive) phenotype, dampening the immunogenic potential of RT. Macrophages regulate immune responses through remarkably plastic activation states, including immune-stimulatory (M1) and immune-suppressive (M2). In breast tumors, macrophages undergo a well-documented but poorly understood “M2-education” process that facilitates immune evasion, utilizing a myriad of immune modulators (hormones, cytokines, and enzymes). Collectively, these dependencies highlight a tremendous therapeutic potential for combining RT with strategies that recover the M1 phenotype of TAMs, creating immune-supportive TME. Despite the potential, modulating TAM activities has proven exceptionally challenging, primarily due to the pleiotropic nature of their suppressive functions and the lack of scalable TME models to enable high-throughput target discovery. To overcome these limitations, we developed a scalable platform that recreates the breast TME at scale and phenotypic fidelity. This model contains the major BC constituents, including macrophages, tumor cells, and their supporting stroma, while preserving the functions, transcriptional programs, cell-cell interactions, and typical spatial organization. To identify reprogramming targets in TAMs, we performed a CRISPR screen utilizing Arg1 (a hallmark M2 marker) as a surrogate marker. Our screen exposed targets that convert immunosuppressive (M2) TAMs into immunostimulatory (M1) macrophages in established tumors. In vivo data show that TAM reprogramming is remarkably effective, promoting tumor regression and abscopal effect in HR+ and ovarian cancers. Reprogrammed TAMs enhanced responses to ICI and radiotherapy, a path we plan to optimize for future clinical development as “first-in-human” trials. Interventions that re-potentiate innate and adaptive immunities can benefit cancer patients, particularly those with limited therapeutic options. Our findings pioneer an actionable roadmap to unlock the full therapeutic potential of RT and immunotherapies in refractory human cancers.

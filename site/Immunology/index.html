        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by immune dysregulation, including alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations and aberrant cytokine signaling. Methotrexate (MTX) is the preferred first-line treatment for RA, yet its precise mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. This study employed a multi-omics strategy—combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunophenotyping—to identify key effector peripheral immune cells and their cellular responses in RA patients over 12 weeks of MTX treatment. In our study, MTX was associated with significant immune modulation, including the restoration of naïve T and B cells and reductions in T cell memory subsets with these effects detectable as early as three weeks post-treatment. Plasmablast levels also emerged as a potential biomarker for early therapeutic response, reflecting MTX’s impact on immune homeostasis. Transcriptional analysis revealed modulation of key pathways, including TNF-α signaling, B cell receptor signaling, and T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis. Network analysis identified critical regulatory hubs, such as EGR1, JAK2, and SOCS1, in monocytes and CD4 memory T cells, highlighting these cell types as key mediators of MTX’s effects. In conclusion, these findings advance our understanding of MTX’s effects on immune cell dynamics at different stages of treatment, showing for the first time the early cellular changes leading to immune modulation in RA. Altogether, our results provide the foundation for further mechanistic investigations into MTX.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) signaling blockade by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) effectively restores immune surveillance to treat melanoma. However, chronic interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-induced immune homeostatic responses in melanoma cells contribute to immune evasion and acquired resistance to ICI. Poly ADP ribosyl polymerase 14 (PARP14), an IFNγ-responsive gene product, partially mediates IFNγ-driven resistance. PARP14 inhibition prolongs PD-1 blockade responses in preclinical models, but fails to achieve full tumor clearance, suggesting the involvement of additional resistance mechanisms. Methods We identified a robust PARP14 catalytic inhibitor gene signature and evaluated its association with patient survival. Using preclinical models and single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated immune and tumor cell adaptations to PARP14 inhibition combined with PD-1 blockade. Results Combining PARP14 inhibition and PD-1 blockade suppressed tumor-associated macrophages while increasing proinflammatory memory macrophages. Moreover, this combination mitigated the terminal exhaustion of cytotoxic T cells by inducing a quiescent state, thereby preserving functionality. Despite the enhanced immune responses, tumor cells developed adaptive resistance by engaging alternative immune evasion pathways. Conclusions Although adaptive resistance mechanisms re-emerge, PARP14 inhibition combined with PD-1 blockade offers a promising strategy to enhance treatment outcomes and overcome ICI resistance in melanoma, as immune cells are primed for further therapeutic interventions that leverage the quiescent state.">

        <tr id="Self-antigens that are obscure to immune cells under homeostasis, are exposed following tissue damage and can trigger autoimmunity. Our previous work showed that conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) mediate immunoregulation after traumatic skeletal muscle injury. Here, we found that, immune responses to injury in cDC1-depleted mice (Batf3-/-) mirror those of autoimmune mice (Aire-/-). Mechanistically, we determined that cDC1s prime killer regulatory T cells (CD8+/-Ly49+Tregs) which express Ly49 inhibitory receptors and HELIOS. These killer-like Tregs are clonally diverse and carry T cell receptors associated with self-reactivity and response to hydrophobicity. cDC1 or CD8 deletion promoted CD62L+CCR7+ naïve T cell retention and B cell recruitment to injured muscle. These naïve T cells, which are implicated in autoimmunity, strongly correlate with B cell abundance in the muscle and are selectively pruned by CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs. Furthermore, clinically used materials that promote wound healing enrich CD8+/-Ly49+ Treg function whereas those that are associated with pathology promote naïve T cell and B cell accumulation. We hypothesize that CD8+/-Ly49+ Tregs maintain self-tolerance after tissue damage and avert autoimmunity by eliminating naive T cells and preventing pathogenic B cell activation.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. HPV-negative HNSCC, which arises in the upper airway mucosa, is particularly aggressive, with nearly half of patients succumbing to the disease within five years and limited response to immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to other cancers. There is a need to further explore the complex immune landscape in HPV-negative HNSCC to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here, we integrated two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from 29 samples and nearly 300,000 immune cells to investigate immune cell dynamics across tumor progression and lymph node metastasis. Notable shifts toward adaptative immune cell populations were observed in the 14 distinct HNSCC-associated peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) and 21 tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) considering disease stages. All PBMCs and TICs revealed unique molecular signatures correlating with lymph node involvement; however, broadly, TICs increased ligand expression among effector cytokines, growth factors, and interferon-related genes. Pathway analysis comparing PBMCs and TICs further confirmed active cell signaling among Monocyte-Macrophage, Dendritic cell, Natural Killer (NK), and T cell populations. Receptor-ligand analysis revealed significant communication patterns shifts among TICs, between CD8+ T cells and NK cells, showing heightened immunosuppressive signaling that correlated with disease progression. In locally invasive HPV-negative HNSCC samples, highly multiplexed immunofluorescence assays highlighted peri-tumoral clustering of exhausted CD8+ T and NK cells, alongside their exclusion from intra-tumoral niches. These findings emphasize cytotoxic immune cells as valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets, shedding light on the mechanisms by which the HNSCC sustainably evades immune responses.">

        <tr id="The functional plasticity of tumor-infiltrating B (TIL-B) cells spans from anti-tumor responses to non-canonical immune suppression. Yet, how tumor microenvironment (TME) influences TIL-B development is still underappreciated. Our current study integrated single cell transcriptomics and BCR (B cell receptor) sequencing to profile TIL-B phenotypes and clonalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using trajectory and gene regulatory network analysis, we were able to characterize plasma cells, memory and naïve B cells within the HCC TME and further revealed a downregulation of BCR-signaling genes in plasma cells and a subset of inflammatory TNF+ memory B cells. Within the TME, non-switch memory B cell subset acquires an age-associated B cell phenotype (TBET+, CD11c+) and expressed higher levels of PD-L1, CD25 and granzyme B. We further demonstrated that the presence of HCC tumor cells could confer suppressive functions on peripheral blood B cells which in turn, dampen T cell co-stimulation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent novel mechanisms of non-canonical immune suppression in HCC. While previous studies identified atypical memory B cells in chronic hepatitis and across several solid cancer types, we further highlighted their potential role as regulatory B cells (Bregs) within both the TME and peripheral blood of HCC patients.">

        <tr id="Steroid-resistant acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGVHD) is the leading life-threatening complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Novel therapeutics development is impeded by scares knowledge on biological pathways leading to steroid resistance at time of aGVHD diagnosis. To gain insight into our understanding on circulating immune cell subsets and functions at time of aGVHD, a single cell deep phenotyping and transcriptome analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with aGVHD before steroid treatment or without aGVHD. We aimed at identifying biological patterns associated with steroid resistance at early onset of aGVHD. First, circulating immune cell subsets were associated with increased incidence of aGVHD, but not with steroid sensitivity. Then, pathway analysis and inferred ligand/receptor interactions revealed major functional divergences between steroid-sensitive (SS-) and SR-aGVHD, including enrichment of TNFα activation in SR-GVHD, as well as TNF/TNFR, CCL3, CCL4 and IL18 signaling, and decreased interferon α and γ signaling pathways, suggesting that steroid resistance in an intrinsic property of immune cells before any treatment. To go deeper into the understanding of mechanisms at play during SR-aGVHD, we modeled immune trajectories within CD8+ T cells and evidenced specific direct transition, from an early naive state to a highly activated one. By contrast, SS-aGVHD involved specific gene signatures across multiple intermediate differentiation stages during cell-to-cell transitions. These findings provide evidence that steroid resistance is driven by intrinsic mechanisms already present at the onset of alloimmune response, that may serve as potential new therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Arming T cells with a synthetically orthogonal IL-9 receptor (o9R) permits facile engraftment and potent anti-tumor functions. We considered whether the paucity of natural IL-9R expression could be exploited for T cell immunotherapy given that, in mice, high doses of IL-9 were well-tolerated without discernible immune modulation. Compared to o9R, T cells engineered with IL-9R exhibit superior tissue infiltration, stemness, and anti-tumor activity. These qualities are consistent with a stronger JAK/STAT signal, which in addition to STAT1/3/5, unexpectedly includes STAT4 (canonically associated with IL-12 but not common γ-chain cytokines). IL-9R T cells are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations of proximal signaling, including structure-guided attenuation, amplification, and rebalancing of JAK/STAT signals. Biased IL-9R mutants uncover STAT1 as a rheostat between proliferative stem-like and terminally differentiated effector states. In summary, we identify native IL-9/IL-9R as a natural cytokine-receptor pair with near-orthogonal qualities and an optimal JAK/STAT signaling profile for engineered T cell therapy.">

Metabolic and immunologic dysfunction are archetypal findings in critically ill patients with sepsis, but whether these factors are mechanistically linked remains incompletely defined. We characterized functional metabolic properties of human CD4 T cells from critically ill patients with and without sepsis and healthy adults. CD4 T cells in critical illness showed increased subset-specific metabolic plasticity, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) acquiring glycolytic capacity that stabilized suppressive markers FOXP3 and TIGIT and correlated with clinical illness severity. Single-cell transcriptomics identified differential kynurenine metabolism in Tregs, which was validated ex vivo as a mechanism of Treg glycolytic adaptation and suppressive rewiring. These findings underscore immunometabolic dysfunction as a driver of CD4 T cell remodeling in sepsis and suggest therapeutic avenues to restore an effective immune response.">

        <tr id="Cells of the myeloid lineage, particularly monocytes and macrophages, play a key role in HIV infection by contributing to viral replication, immune response, and maintaining immune balance during suppressive therapy. We hypothesized that metabolic reprogramming and altered chemokine signaling in people living with HIV (PWH) on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) affect monocyte transport and polarization due to ongoing inflammation. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the mechanism of impaired monocyte/macrophage function in PWH on well-treated ART that can lead to clinical intervention strategies to improve health. Single-cell RNA sequencing, immune-phenotyping, and metabolic modeling identified altered expression of chemokine and metabolite receptors and altered metabolic flux in PWH monocytes that decreased monocyte migration. The plasma secretome revealed a nonclassical inflammatory microenvironment in PWH. Integrative multi-omics and single-cell proteomics of differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) detected metabolic reprogramming orchestrated by α-ketoglutarate (AKG) that affected macrophage function and HIV infection. Increased levels of AKG in plasma were shown to occur in PWH under ART. Therefore, when differentiating MDM with serum from PWH or AKG, macrophage function was found polarized towards an M2-like state. AKG alone was shown to increase CCR5 levels and increase HIV-1 infection in MDM. Here, we utilize systems biology-driven identification and ex vivo assays to show impaired macrophage polarization, due to metabolic training, can leads to a low-grade nonclassical inflammatory environment in well-treated PWH.">

Analysis of spontaneous SLE-prone mice deficient in IRF7 uncovered the IRF7 role in regulating autoimmune germinal center (GC), plasma cell (PC) and autoantibody responses and disease. IRF7, however, was dispensable for foreign antigen driven GC, PC and antibody responses. Competitive bone marrow (BM) chimeras highlighted the importance of IRF7 in hematopoietic cells in spontaneous GC and PC differentiation. Single-cell-RNAseq of SLE-prone B cells indicated IRF7 mediated B cell differentiation through GC and PC fates. Mechanistic studies revealed that IRF7 promoted B cell differentiation through GC and PC fates by regulating the transcriptome, translation, and metabolism of SLE-prone B cells. Mixed BM chimeras demonstrated a requirement for B cell-intrinsic IRF7 in IgG autoantibody production but not sufficient for promoting spontaneous GC and PC responses.

        <tr id="Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), either due to inherited or somatic mutation, is prevalent in colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers. While anti-PD-1 therapy is utilized in both local and advanced disease, up to 50% of MMRd CRC fail to respond. Using animal and human models of MMRd, we determined that interactions between MHC+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and TCF+ BHLHE40+ PRF1+ T cell subsets are associated with control of MMRd tumor growth, during anti-PD-1 treatment. In contrast, resistance is associated with upregulation of TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, and PD-1 expression on T cells, and infiltration of the tumor with immunosuppressive TREM2+ macrophages and monocytes. By combining anti-PD-1 with anti-LAG3/CTLA4/TREM2, up to 100% tumor eradication was achieved in MMRd CRC and remarkably, in >70% in MMRp CRC. This study identifies key T cell and macrophage subsets mediating the efficacy of immunotherapy in overcoming immune escape in both MMRd and MMRp CRC settings. Highlights Anti-PD-1 therapy leads to the accumulation and colocalization of MHCI/II+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and DCs with TCF+ CCL5+ T cells that have high TCR diversity. Resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy involves multiple T cell checkpoints, TREM2+ macrophages, IL1B+ TREM1+ monocytes and neutrophils, and IFITM+ tumor cells. Simultaneous blockade of PD-1, LAG3, CTLA-4 and TREM2 dramatically prevents progression of both MMRd and MMRp tumors. Combination therapy completely eliminates tumors by leveraging MHC+ macrophage, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell interactions, facilitating durable anti-tumor effects.">

        <tr id="Although IgA+ long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) generated following mucosal viral infection provide durable protection against reinfection, little is known about their generation. Here, we show that oral RV infection induces gut-resident LLPCs that produce highly mutated protective IgA. Unlike RV-specific IgG+ LLPCs, IgA+ LLPCs were generated independently of MHCII expression by dendritic cells – rather MHCII expression by B cells was both necessary and sufficient. B cell MHCII was also sufficient to induce a unique population of T-bet+ follicular helper T (TFH1) cells which were crucial for RV-specific IgA+ LLPC accumulation in the gut via IFNγ- and CXCR3-dependent mechanisms. Similar to RV infection, TFH1 cells were required for influenza-specific IgA response. However, unlike RV infection, B cell MHCII was not sufficient to induce influenza-specific IgA+ LLPCs, suggesting the operation of mucosal site-specific priming mechanisms.

        <tr id="Introduction Bryostatin-1, a potent agonist of the protein kinase C, has been studied for HIV and cancer therapies. In HIV research, it has shown anti-HIV effects during acute infection and reactivation of latent HIV in chronic infection. As effective CD8+ T cell responses are essential for eliminating reactivated virus and achieving a cure, it is important to investigate how bryostatin-1 affects HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. HIV-specific CD8+ T cells often become exhausted, showing reduced proliferative potential and impaired cytokine production, a dysfunction also observed in cancer. Therefore, we further investigated how bryostatin-1 directly impacts exhausted CD8+ T cells. Methods PBMCs from people with HIV (PWH) were treated with bryostatin-1 and tracked with proliferation dye for cell expansion. One day 6, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were detected by tetramers staining and examined by flow cytometry. By utilizing an established in vitro murine T cell exhaustion system, changes in inhibitory receptors, transcription factors, cytokine production and killing capacity of bryostatin-1 treated exhausted CD8+ T cells were determined by flow cytometry. RNA-seq analysis was performed to study transcriptional changes in these cells. Results We found that bryostatin-1 improved the expansion and decreased PD-1 expression of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Bryostatin-1 enhanced the functionality and proliferation while decreasing inhibitory receptor expression of in vitro generated exhausted CD8+ T cells. Bryostatin-1 upregulated TCF-1 and decreased TOX expression. These changes were confirmed through RNA-seq analysis. RNA-seq revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) 11 was significantly downregulated in exhausted CD8+ T cells, however, it greatly upregulated after bryostatin-1 treatment. Inhibition of MAPK11 in bryostatin-1-treated cells blocked the increased proliferation and IFN-γ production induced by bryostatin-1, but did not affect other bryostatin-1 induced effects, such as the reduction of inhibitory receptors. Discussion Our data demonstrate that bryostatin-1 induces a MAPK 11-dependent improvement in the proliferative and functional capacity of exhausted T cells. This study provides a rationale for bryostatin-1's potential to help eradicate the HIV reservoir during treatment, and it may also contribute to cancer immunotherapy by functionally improving exhausted CD8+ T cells.">

        <tr id="Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is characterized by immune dysregulation that facilitates chronic infection. Objective: To investigate the role of T cells in the immunopathology of CL by characterizing the immune landscape of skin lesions using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods: We performed scRNA-seq to profile T cells from PBMC and skin lesions of CL patients. Results: We analyzed the transcriptional profile of distinct populations of CD4+ and CD8+ migratory T cells in CL lesions. CD8+ resident T cells displayed expression of exhaustion markers and were categorized into progenitor, transitional, and terminal stages, with HAVCR2 (TIM-3) identified as a potential driver of dysfunction. Compared to psoriasis and healthy skin, CL lesions showed a reduced frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), potentially linked to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased apoptosis. We also detected double-negative (DN) gd T cells, suggesting their potential role in antigen presentation via MHC class II through TGF-b signaling. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into immune evasion mechanisms in CL, identifying TIM-3, Treg modulation, and the functional role of DN gd T cells as distinct potential targets for future immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Bacteria of the genus Shigella replicate in intestinal epithelial cells and cause shigellosis, a severe diarrheal disease that resolves spontaneously in most healthy individuals. During shigellosis, neutrophils are abundantly recruited to the gut, and have long been thought to be central to Shigella control and pathogenesis. However, how shigellosis resolves remains poorly understood due to the longstanding lack of a tractable and physiological animal model. Here, using our newly developed Nlrc4−/−Casp11−/− mouse model of shigellosis, we unexpectedly find no major role for neutrophils in limiting Shigella or in disease pathogenesis. Instead, we uncover an essential role for macrophages in the host control of Shigella. Macrophages respond to Shigella via TLRs to produce IL-12, which then induces IFN-γ, a cytokine that is essential to control Shigella replication in intestinal epithelial cells. Collectively, our findings reshape our understanding of the innate immune response to Shigella.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8 T cells typically exhibit improved effector functions compared to their naive counterparts. However, under certain activation conditions, such as chronic viral infections or cancer, these cells may develop functional defects. In this study, we compared the functional quality of memory CD8 T cells generated following tumor rejection with those arising from an acute viral infection. We found that tumor-induced (Tum-CD8) memory cells exhibited a distinct phenotype and transcriptomic profile compared with viral-induced (Vir-CD8) memory cells. These memory cells are characterized by the expression of inhibitory receptors and displayed altered functions including reduced IFNγ and TNFα production as well as changes in integrin expression. Additionally, the protective capacity of Tum-CD8 memory cells was flawed relative to that of Vir-CD8 memory cells. Importantly, the functional defects of Tum-CD8 persisted upon viral recall. Together, these findings indicate that transient tumoral stimulation can imprint a stable partial exhaustion-like program on memory CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major global cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for over a million deaths annually. Despite this burden, natural immunity prevents disease in more than 90% of exposed individuals. Previous studies have identified interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as a key regulator of innate immune defense against MTB. Here, we investigate the impact of IFN-γ timing on macrophage-mediated control of MTB infection. We demonstrate that IFN-γ exposure before infection enhances macrophage antibacterial activity, whereas post-infection exposure does not. Further investigation into this phenotype revealed a strong association between c-Myc signaling and macrophage function in MTB control, as identified using unbiased in vitro systems approaches. Given the challenge of perturbing c-Myc in primary cells, we developed a lentiviral system for c-Myc inhibition and overexpression. Using a tetracycline-inducible Omomyc system - a small peptide inhibitor of c-Myc - we show that c-Myc inhibition promotes a pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype with enhanced anti-mycobacterial activity. Mechanistically, c-Myc inhibition induces metabolic reprogramming via increased mTORC1 activity, leading to upregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase and improved bacterial clearance. In vivo analyses, including murine models and human clinical histopathology, reveal a strong correlation between c-Myc expression and MTB persistence, as well as active tuberculosis (TB), suggesting a role for c-Myc in immune evasion. These findings reveal c-Myc as a potential mediator of immune privilege in MTB infection and highlight its role as a promising target for novel TB therapies aimed at enhancing macrophage function. Author Summary Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), remains a major global health threat. While most people exposed to MTB successfully fight off the infection, some individuals develop active disease. Understanding how the bacteria evade immune defenses is key to developing better treatments. In this study, we identify a new role for c-Myc, a protein well-known in cancer research, in suppressing the ability of immune cells called macrophages to fight MTB. Macrophages are responsible for engulfing and killing bacteria, but we found that c-Myc interferes with this process, allowing MTB to survive. Using a small peptide inhibitor called Omomyc, we were able to block c-Myc activity, which restored macrophages’ ability to kill MTB. This effect is linked to changes in cellular metabolism, leading to the increased production of molecules essential for bacterial destruction. We also discovered that high c-Myc levels are associated with persistent MTB infection in both mouse models and human tissues. This suggests that c-Myc helps the bacteria evade immune attack, contributing to long-term infection. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism exploited by MTB to survive in the body and suggest that targeting c-Myc could be a promising approach to enhancing immune defenses against TB. By bridging insights from cancer biology and infectious disease research, our work provides a new perspective on tackling TB and highlights c-Myc as a potential therapeutic target for boosting immunity against this deadly infection.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are critical regulators of HIV immunity, but the mechanisms behind their expansion and value as a therapeutic target remain unclear. We investigated MDSC function in HIV using a humanized mouse model. Acute HIV-1 infection triggered the systemic expansion of polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), with their frequency correlating positively with plasma viral load. Notably, PMN-MDSC expansion increased further when natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were depleted, suggesting these immune cells restrain MDSC proliferation. We identified Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis as a regulatory mechanism, as MDSCs expressed high levels of TRAIL receptor 2 (R2), while NK cells and CTLs upregulated TRAIL expression during HIV infection. Treating HIV-1-infected mice with a TRAIL-R2 agonist significantly reduced MDSC levels to those of uninfected mice and significantly improved NK cell and CTL immune function. Crucially, in viremic humanized mice, the treatment prevented CD4+ T cell loss, a hallmark of HIV-1 pathogenesis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting MDSC apoptosis to mitigate CD4+ T cell depletion and enhance HIV-specific immunity, offering a new clinical target to prevent AIDS and insights into MDSC– NK/CTL cross-regulation during HIV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Natural resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in some people with HIV (PWH) is unexplained. We performed single cell RNA-sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells, unstimulated or ex vivo stimulated with Mtb, for 7 PWH who were TST & IGRA positive (called LTBI) and 6 who were persistently TST & IGRA negative (called resisters). Alveolar macrophages (AM) from resisters displayed a baseline M1 macrophage phenotype while AM from LTBI did not. Resisters displayed alveolar lymphocytosis, with enrichment of all T cell subpopulations including IFNG-expressing cells. In both groups, mycobactericidal granulysin was expressed almost exclusively by a T cell subtype that co-expressed granzyme B, perforin and NK cell receptors. These poly-cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) over-expressed activating NK cell receptors and were increased in resister BAL. Following challenge with Mtb, only Intraepithelial Lymphocytes-like cells from LTBI participants responded with increased transcription of IFNG. AM from resisters responded with a stronger TNF signature at 6h post-infection while at 24h post-infection AM from LTBI displayed a stronger IFN-γ signature. Conversely, at 24h post-infection only AM from resisters displayed a significant upregulation of MICA transcripts which encode an activating ligand for poly-CTL. These results suggest that poly-CTL and AM mediate the resister phenotype in PWH.">

        <tr id="Biological sex differences in morbidity upon influenza A virus (IAV) infection are linked to stronger IFN-centered immune responses in females, yet the regulatory role of sex hormone receptors in immune cell subsets is incompletely understood. Lung-resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) express notably high levels of androgen receptors (AR). In IAV infection, ILC2s produce type 2 cytokines and facilitate tissue repair, but they also may be functionally suppressed by type 1 cytokines. Here we report sex differences in the magnitude of lung ILC2 functional suppression at the peak of sublethal IAV infection. Relative to males, ILC2s in females show attenuated proliferation, decreased propensity for IL-5 and amphiregulin production and reduced expression of GATA3 and IL-33R, features supported by divergent transcriptomes. Equivalent inflammatory cytokine levels and viral load suggested sex differences in ILC2-intrinsic factors. Indeed, naïve female ILC2s showed elevated IFNGR expression and higher phospho-STAT1 levels following IFNγ stimulation, and lymphocyte-restricted STAT1 deficiency reversed IAV-induced suppression of female ILC2s. Lymphocyte-restricted AR deficiency or loss of androgens via orchiectomy led to increased IFNGR expression and suppression of male ILC2s. These data support the hypothesis that intrinsic AR activity regulates IFNGR-STAT1 signaling pathways to preserve canonical ILC2 function in males during IAV infection.">

        <tr id="Background Targeting glutamine metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer therapy. However, several barriers, such as in vivo anti-tumor efficacy, drug toxicity, and safety, remain to be overcome to achieve clinical utility. Prior preclinical in vivo studies had generated encouraging data showing promises of cancer metabolism targeting drugs, although most were performed on immune-deficient murine models. It is being recognized that aside from tumor cells, normal cells such as immune cells in the tumor microenvironment may also utilize glutamine for maintaining physiological functions. To provide an in-depth view of glutamine antagonist (GLNi) treatment on the tumor immune microenvironment, the current study made several unique approaches. Method First, to evaluate GLNi treatment modality that potentially involves immune cells, the study was performed on immunocompetent murine models of gynecological cancers. Second, to enhance safety and reduce potential off-target effects, we developed a GLNi prodrug, JHU083, which is bio-activated restrictively in cancer tissues. Third, to unbiasedly decode the response of single cells in the tumor microenvironment to GLNi treatment, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on cells prepared from tumors of the JHU083 or vehicle control-treated mice. Results In both immunocompetent murine tumor models, we observed a significant anti-tumor efficacy, resulting in reduced tumor burden and impeded tumor progression. Similarly, in both tumor models, scRNA-seq revealed significantly impeded immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages by JHU083, while the treatment spared pro-inflammatory M1-like tumor macrophages. In many tumor microenvironment (TME) cells, JHU083 downregulated genes regulated by Myc and hypoxia. M2 macrophages’ greater sensitivity to glutamine antagonism when compared to M1 macrophages or monocytes was further validated on ex vivo cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages. Conclusion Our findings support a converged mechanism of glutamine metabolism antagonists. JHU083 exerted its anti-tumor efficacy through not only direct targeting of glutamine-addicted cancer cells but also by suppressing glutamine-dependent M2 macrophages, leading to a shift in the M1/M2 macrophage landscape in favor of an immune-stimulatory microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells contribute to solid organ cancer progression, except in colorectal cancer (CRC) despite being abundantly present. Here, we demonstrate that two distinct tumoral IL-10⁺ and IL-10⁻ Treg cell subsets exert opposing functions by counteracting and promoting CRC tumor growth, respectively. The tumor restraining activity of IL-10⁺ Treg cells was mediated by their suppression of effector CD4 T cell production of IL-17, which directly stimulates CRC tumor cell proliferation. Consistently, IL-10⁻ Treg cells were more abundant in both mouse and human CRC tumors than in tumor-adjacent normal tissues, whereas IL-10+ Treg cells exhibited the opposite distribution. Furthermore, relative abundance of IL-10⁺ and IL-10⁻ Treg cells correlated with better and worse disease prognoses in human CRC, respectively. This functional dichotomy between Treg cell subsets provides a rationale for therapeutic strategies to selectively target pro-tumoral Treg cells while preserving their anti-tumoral counterparts across barrier tissue cancers that harbor both subsets.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia remains a major contributor to clinical complications in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, including organ injury, morbidity and mortality. Given their critical role in antiviral defense, CD8+ T cells are essential for protective immunity against CMV. Methods Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated the transcriptional signatures and developmental lineages of CD8+ T cells in eight immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who received organs from CMV-seropositive donors. Results were validated in a cohort of 62 KTRs using immunophenotyping. Results Our data revealed a significant influence of CMV serostatus on transcriptional variance of CD8+ memory T cells, associating with the first principal component from a global analysis of CD8+ T cells (p =0.0406), forming a continuum with five principal differentiation trajectories driven by CMV primary infection or reactivation. Following CMV primary infection, CD8+ T cells were hallmarked by restrained effector-memory differentiation. CD8+ T cells during CMV reactivation diverged non-linearly into senescent-like cells with signatures of arrested cell cycle, diminished translational activity and downregulated ZNF683 and longitudinally expanding effector cells with robust cytotoxic potential and upregulated ZNF683, acting as a reservoir for long-lived effector cells supporting long-term protection. Notably, CD28lo KLRG1hi IL-7R (CD127)lo HLA-DRhi CD8+ T cells present prior to the detection of viremia in CMV-seropositive patients emerged as a key feature distinguishing patients who did or did not undergo CMV reactivation after prophylaxis discontinuation (p =0.0163). Frequencies of these cells were also positively correlated with CMV-stimulated secretion of IFN-γ (p =0.0494), TNF-α (p =0.0358), MIP-1α (p =0.0262), MIP-1β (p =0.0043). Discussion These results provide insights into the transcriptional regulation that influences the generation of CD8+ T cell immunity to CMV and may inform strategics for monitoring host immune response to CMV to better identify and introduce therapeutic intervention to patients at risk of developing clinically significant CMV viremia.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors can elicit deep and durable immune responses although most cancer patients fail to experience long-term remission. There is consensus that tumor hypoxia coordinates a multitude of underlying resistance mechanisms that contribute to treatment failure. Here we show that the clinical-stage hypoxia-activated prodrug tarloxotinib lowers tumor hypoxia 8-fold in the EGFR-dependent MB49 syngeneic tumor model, attracting a effector CD8+ T cell infiltrate into an oxygen enriched tumor microenvironment, leading to potentiation of checkpoint inhibitor activity. Various methodologies, including CD8+ T cell depletion and exogenous T cell priming confirmed that tarloxotinib has a positive impact on the function of activated CD8+ T cells. Whilst anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 treatments all benefited from the remodeled tumor microenvironment, anti-PD-L1 was most responsive to tarloxotinib coadministration, providing a 100% complete response rate and >360% improvement in tumor growth delay (day 19; p<0.0001). This robust interaction was associated with MB49 tumor enrichment of CD8+ T cell infiltrate from 8% to 43% of the total CD45+ population. To further understand these promising observations, comparative RNA transcript analysis of 770 cancer/immune related genes in naïve and tarloxotinib treated tumors highlighted the strong induction of gene clusters related to co-stimulatory signaling, cytokine/chemokine signaling, interferon signaling, immune cell adhesion/migration, antigen presentation and the lymphoid/myeloid compartments. Serum protein analysis confirmed upregulation of a mixture of cytokines/chemokines, including IL-6, IL-12p40, IFNγ, G-CSF and MIP-1β, amongst others. The source of this broad immunogenic response was identified as toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) dependent, with the positive interaction between anti-PD-L1 and tarloxotinib blocked in MyD88 or TLR9 knockout mice. Further, the observed therapeutic interaction was still evident in MC38 and EG7.OVA syngeneic tumor models, both refractory to tarloxotinib by virtue of EGFR-signal independence. Consistent with the clinical experience of minimal systemic toxicities related to EGFR inhibition (e.g. diarrhea), mouse body weight loss was minimal across all in vivo studies and histopathology screening for evidence of lung fibrosis proved negative. Tarloxotinib therefore represents a systemically administered small molecule with an established clinical safety profile that is capable of activating TLR9 signaling within tumors whilst remodeling the microenvironment to facilitate efficacy of checkpoint blockade. What is already known on this topic Solid tumor resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is orchestrated through a diverse collection of hypoxia-driven mechanisms. In preclinical models modifying the tumor microenvironment (TME) to lessen hypoxia typically improves responses to ICI. What this study adds Tarloxotinib is a hypoxia-activated prodrug (HAP) of an irreversible EGFR/HER2 TKI that profoundly remodels the TME, both eliminating tumor hypoxia and elevating cytokine/chemokine production via a TLR9 dependent effect. Together, this results in a marked tumor influx of activated CD8+ T cells (and other TILs), that results in major improvements in the efficacy of ICIs, particularly anti-PD-L1. How this study might affect research, practice or policy Tarloxotinib is the first example of a tumor-targeted small molecule TLR9 stimulant that restores ICI sensitivity in a range of syngeneic tumor models. Phase I/II data has demonstrated that tarloxotinib is well tolerated, with few EGFR-dependent (on-target) side-effects, reflecting minimization of normal tissue exposure with the tumor-targeted HAP approach. Importantly, it also optimizes tumor selective exposure, offering a compelling clinical rationale for evaluation of this combination in cancer patients experiencing ICI relapse or resistance.">

        <tr id="Durable T cell immunity against cancer depends on the continual replenishment of effector CD8+ T cells. Thymic output has been correlated with favorable prognosis in cancer patients across a range of ages, suggesting that the thymus is an important source for replenishing T cells capable of controlling cancer progression. However, the effector potential of thymic mature CD8+ T cells and their regulation have not been clearly defined. In this study, we identified the ability of thymic single positive CD8+ T cells to gain effector potential after thymic selection, but they are subject to the regulation of PD-1. We found a previously undisclosed role of PD-1 in limiting both the cytotoxic and exhaustion potential of thymic and peripheral CD8+ T cells. Our results show that although PD-1 inhibition facilitates the expansion of effector CD8+ T cells, effector CD8+ cells gradually lose their antitumor activity within tumor tissues due to advanced exhaustion in the absence of PD-1. Thus, although the preset effector potential in thymic mature CD8+ T cells allows them to rapidly respond to malignant cells in the periphery, PD-1, as a checkpoint, is embedded in the thymic mature CD8+ T cells after positive selection to balance their effector function from exaggeration and exhaustion. Therefore, we propose that a strategy capable of upholding the cytotoxic capacity and avoiding exhaustion of CD8+ T cells during the early stages of PD-1 inhibition therapy is needed to achieve durable antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Radiation is used to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in the locally-advanced setting. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), in particular, has shown improved outcomes against conventional RT in a number of clinical trials. One key cell type involved in the response to RT are neutrophils. These innate immune cells are the first responders to tissue damage and infiltrate irradiated tumors in high numbers to rectify injury. Neutrophils typically possess an immunosuppressive, wound healing phenotype in this scenario, which allows the tumor to recover and actively suppress immunological efforts to eradicate the disease. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of neutrophils in a murine model of PDAC treated with SBRT. Mice harboring PDAC tumors were treated with targeted SBRT and neutrophils were determined to be significantly increased in the tissue when compared to unirradiated controls. Additionally, phenotypic analysis determined that these cells were largely immunosuppressive and depletion studies confirmed they played a key role in acquired radioresistance in our model. In order to establish whether these infiltrating cells could be re-wired to contribute to anti-tumor immunity, we utilized a novel combination therapy consisting of SBRT and microspheres containing recombinant IL-12 to attempt to repolarize these cells. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed intratumoral neutrophils underwent considerable changes indicative of an immunostimulatory, anti-tumor phenotype following treatment. Moreover, depleting these cells resulted in a loss of treatment efficacy, suggesting that neutrophil re-wiring was vital for the therapeutic outcome. This study highlights neutrophils as key players in SBRT and IL-12 treatment and confirms they can act as a double-edged sword depending on the treatment employed.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8 T cells play a vital role in providing lasting immune protection, yet their origins remain incompletely understood. Contrary to classical models, emerging evidence suggests that heterogeneity within the naïve T cell pool may influence fate decisions prior to antigen encounter. However, the markers of naïve T cell heterogeneity have not yet been clearly defined. Here, we describe intraclonal heterogeneity within the naïve T cell population marked by the protein Dapl1. Using novel monoclonal antibodies and a reporter-knockout mouse model, we found that Dapl1-positive naïve CD8 T cells exhibit distinct phenotypes compared to their Dapl1-negative counterparts. Furthermore, this population includes a subset of pre-programmed precursors biased toward memory lineage fate. The differentiation of these precursors is independent of Dapl1 but relies on the transcription factor Bcl11b, resulting in the generation of Dapl1-positive central memory-like CD8 T cells in response to infection, and stem-like memory cells in response to cancer. Notably, naïve Dapl1-positive T cells originate among mature thymocytes and gradually appear in the periphery within several days after birth. Our findings suggest that committed memory precursors in the Dapl1-positive population may represent an alternative pathway for memory CD8 T cell generation, offering new avenues for therapeutic application.

        <tr id="Access to the brain for treating neurological sequalae requires a craniotomy, which can be complicated by infection. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1-/- mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1-/- animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng-/- mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1-/- animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="During tumorigenesis, the extracellular matrix (ECM), which constitutes the structural scaffold of tissues, is profoundly remodeled. While the impact of such remodeling on tumor growth and invasion has been extensively investigated, much less is known on the consequences of ECM remodeling on tumor infiltration by immune cells. By combining tissue imaging and machine-learning, we here show that the localization of T lymphocytes and neutrophils, which orchestrate antitumor immune responses, can be predicted by defined topographical features of fibrillar collagen networks. We further show that these collagen topographies result from the activation of a fibrotic pathway controlled by the transcription factor Tcf4 upon depletion of tumor-associated macrophages at late tumor stages. This pathway promotes the deposition of collagen 3 by both tumor and stromal cells, resulting in intermingled collagen networks that favor intra-tumoral T cell and neutrophil localization. Importantly, analysis of human colorectal cancer public bulk RNAseq databases showed a strong correlation between Tcf4 and collagen 3, as well as between the expression of these genes and tumor infiltration by T lymphocytes and neutrophils, attesting the clinical relevance of our findings. This study highlights the key structural role of macrophages on the tumor extracellular matrix and identifies collagen network topographies as a major regulator of tumor infiltration by immune cells.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal 5-year survival rate of only 10% in the United States. While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown efficacy in many solid tumors, PDAC remains largely unresponsive. Agonistic CD40 antibodies can activate PDAC-associated myeloid cells, enhancing innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity. However, clinical trials with agonistic CD40 antibodies have demonstrated only modest efficacy and significant hepatotoxicity. We previously reported that IL-1 pathway blockade enhances CD40 agonist efficacy against melanoma by depleting polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs; CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G+). Since PMN-MDSCs also cause liver toxicity. This study investigates the impact of IL-1R1 blockade on the efficacy and toxicity of CD40 agonist therapy in PDAC. We found that treatment with an agonistic CD40 antibody induced immune activation and significantly prolonged survival in orthotopic PDAC-bearing mice. The transcriptomic profile revealed that IL-1R1 blockade as monotherapy downregulated innate and adaptive immune response and exacerbated tumor growth. However, the combination therapy of agonistic CD40 antibody and IL-1R1 blockade upregulated several immune-related pathways (GO enrichment analysis), including JAK-STAT signaling, antigen processing, and presentation, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, boosted innate and adaptive immune responses, compared to CD40 agonist treatment alone. Paradoxically, despite these immunostimulatory effects, IL-1R1 blockade failed to improve the overall anti-tumor efficacy of CD40 agonist therapy and exacerbated liver toxicity. Liver toxicity was assessed by serum ALT and AST levels, and transcriptomic profiling of the liver revealed several pathways related to immune infiltration, liver metabolism, viral carcinogenesis and alcoholic liver disease were associated with hepatotoxicity. To further investigate the role of PMN-MDSCs in PDAC and understand the failure of anti-IL-1R1 therapy, we depleted these cells using an anti-Ly6G antibody in mice treated with an agonistic CD40 antibody. Unexpectedly, Ly6G depletion reduced the efficacy of CD40 agonist therapy, suggesting that, contrary to expectations, Ly6G+ immune cells (PMN-MDSCs or neutrophils) exhibit an anti-tumor rather than an immunosuppressive role in PDAC. Our findings underscore the complex role of IL-1 signaling in modulating immune responses in PDAC and caution against pursuing IL-1R1 blockade, either as a monotherapy or in combination with CD40 agonist antibodies, in future clinical trials for PDAC.">

        <tr id="Suppressive myeloid cells play a central role in cancer escape from anti-tumor immunity. Beyond their immunosuppressive function, these cells are capable of exerting multiple other pro-tumoral activities, including the promotion of cancer cell survival, invasion and metastasis. The ability of some myeloid subsets to induce cancer stemness has recently emerged. Here we demonstrated that human immunosuppressive myeloid cells, generated in vitro or isolated from breast cancer patients, promoted the acquisition of mesenchymal-like breast cancer stemness properties. This cancer-stemness-inducing function was restricted to a myeloid subset expressing the glycoprotein CD52. Single cell transcriptomic- and surface proteome-based interactome analysis pointed towards membrane-bound TGF-β1 as a potential factor involved in cancer stemness induction. Functional inhibition of the TGF-β1 pathway blocked the emergence of cancer stem cells induced by suppressive myeloid cells. These results therefore identified the underlying mechanisms of a new tumor-promoting function of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, which may potentially be targeted.

Why immunity fails after initially controlling infection is unknown. C57BL/6 mice control Mycobacterium tuberculosis for up to a year but ultimately succumb to disease. We hypothesize that the development of CD4 T cell dysfunction permits bacterial recrudescence. We developed a reductionist model to assess antigen-specific T cells during chronic infection and found evidence of CD4 T cell senescence and exhaustion. In C57BL/6 mice, CD4 T cells upregulate coinhibitory receptors and lose effector cytokine production. Single cell RNAseq shows that only a small number of CD4 T cells in the lungs of chronically infected mice are polyfunctional. While the origin and causal relationship between T- cell dysfunction and recrudescence remains uncertain, we propose T cell dysfunction leads to a feed-forward loop that causes increased bacillary numbers, greater T cell dysfunction, and progressive disease.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by recurrent inflammatory relapses and neurodegeneration. Myeloid cells play a critical role in shaping the inflammatory environment and influencing disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that activation of the Wnt signaling pathway reprograms myeloid cells into an immunoregulatory phenotype, leading to reduced neuroinflammation and disease severity. Using both experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and human-derived myeloid cells, we show that Wnt agonist treatment promotes the expression of inhibitory molecules such as PD-L1 and PD-L2, suppressing pro-inflammatory responses. In the chronic and relapsing-remitting EAE models, Wnt activation significantly reduced disease severity, immune cell infiltration into the CNS, and pathogenic T cell responses. Notably, in relapsing-remitting EAE, Wnt treatment prevented new relapses in a PD-L1–dependent manner, highlighting the crucial role of myeloid cell–mediated immune regulation. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for Wnt signaling in myeloid cell immunoregulation and suggest that targeting this pathway could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for MS and other autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is a debilitating pulmonary disorder that occurs due to persistent exposure to beryllium (Be) particles in the workplace. Be-exposure causes activation of the innate immune system, resulting in the secretion of interleukins and chemokines that drive the accumulation of B and T cells in the lungs. However, the mechanisms by which innate molecules influence the recruitment of B cells and B cell-mediated protection in CBD are poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiple approaches to examine the role of innate immune signaling and CD4+ T cells in B cell recruitment and function in the lungs. We show that the absence or blocking of IL-1R1 signaling prevents the recruitment of B cells to the lungs of BeO-exposed mice. Additionally, we show that B cell recruitment to the lungs depends on the chemokine receptor, CXCR5, and CD4+ T cells. In BeO-exposed mice, lung B cells down-regulate IgM but showed an increased IgD and CD44 surface expression. Further, RNA sequencing of pulmonary tissue-specific B cells in CBD revealed distinct gene signatures compared to splenic B cells, with increased expression of pathways involved in antigen presentation, tight junction interactions, and interferon signaling. Overall, our study shows that B cell recruitment and aggregate formation during CBD depend on sequential activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.">

        <tr id="A key mechanism of immune escape from CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor control occurs via downregulation of NLRC5, the IFNγ-induced transcriptional activator of MHC class-I. As NLRC5 deficiency does not abrogate CD8+ T cell development, we investigated whether NLRC5-dependent antitumor immune mechanisms are required for immune surveillance. Development of 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced endogenous fibrosarcoma was studied in Nlrc5-/- mice with Nlrc5+/+ and Rag1-/- mice serving as controls. Nlrc5-/- and Rag1-/- mice showed increased propensity to develop MCA-induced tumors with elevated growth rate compared to Nlrc5+/+ mice, and displayed significantly reduced survival. Tumors from Nlrc5+/+ and Nlrc5-/-mice, but not from Rag1-/- mice, contained necrotic areas and displayed T cell infiltration. Tumor cell lines established from MCA- induced tumors were evaluated for their sensitivity to immune-mediated growth control following implantation into immunocompetent C57BL/6 and immunodeficient Rag1-/- hosts. Tumors formed by Nlrc5+/+ tumor cell lines progressed unhindered in C57BL/6 hosts that reflected their immunoedited status, whereas cell lines from Nlrc5-/- and Rag1-/-tumors were efficiently controlled, indicating their non-immunoedited status. Proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry followed by pathway analysis revealed enrichment of granzyme-mediated cytolytic pathway in Nlrc5+/+ tumors that were absent in Nlrc5-/- tumors, which showed enrichment of humoral and innate immune pathways. Overall, our findings show that NLRC5 is required for robust tumor immune surveillance and tumor immunoediting and that compensatory humoral and innate immune mechanisms activated by the loss of NLRC5 are insufficient for cancer immune surveillance and cancer immunoediting.">

        <tr id="Antitumor immune surveillance is the key feature of tumour progression and response to treatment in various malignancies, such as lymphomas. Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are bone marrow (BM)-derived cells with potent suppressive properties, implicated in T cell inhibition and tumour dissemination. In Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), circulating MDSCs constitute the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, while the contribution of BM MDSCs in disease pathogenesis remains elusive. In the present study we aimed to evaluate both the frequencies as well as the molecular signatures of MDSCs in blood and BM from newly diagnosed DLBCL patients prior to treatment initiation and from age matched healthy donors. Circulating levels of total, monocytic (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSCs were found increased in DLBCL compared to healthy control, while in DLBCL patients the BM MDSCs were significantly increased compared to blood. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significantly different molecular fingerprints to characterize circulating and BM M-MDSCs, implying that MDSCs exhibit their function with distinct mechanisms depending on the anatomical compartment. Despite that MDSC frequencies did not demonstrate any significant correlation with disease characteristics and outcome, our findings propose that gene expression profiling should be evaluated for their potential prognostic impact. Overall, the findings presented here, provide new insights in the immunosuppressive networks that operate in DLBCL and importantly propose new molecular mechanisms expressed by BM MDSCs which may be explored therapeutically.">

        <tr id="Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are capable of mounting an adequate antimicrobial inflammatory response to pathogens while tolerating commensals. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of immune sensitivity remain incompletely understood, particularly in the context of human IECs. To enhance our understanding of the immune response of IECs to bacterial epithelial barrier breach, we investigated whether epithelial responsiveness is contingent on cell identity and cell polarization. We exposed human intestinal organoids to bacterial antigens to study their immune responses. Notable discrepancies were observed in the specific reactions exhibited by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enterocytes. It was determined that basolateral exposure of IECs to bacterial antigens resulted in a robust response, whereas apical exposure elicited a significantly more modest response. We identified ISCs as the responders, while the reaction of enterocytes was found to be attenuated. The regulation of bacterial responsiveness in enterocytes occurs at multiple levels, including the modulation of NFκB activation and post-transcriptional control of mRNA stability. Our findings demonstrate that differentiated non-responsive enterocytes can be sensitized to bacterial antigens through the activation of the WNT pathway. These findings extend the crucial role of WNT signaling for intestinal epithelial homeostasis and regulation of stem cell maintenance, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue architecture in the gut. Additionally, they reveal a new function of WNT signaling in regulating microbial responses within the intestinal environment.">

The immense potential MSC-EVs hold as tumour-targeted therapeutics warrants an understanding of potential adverse events to support clinical translation. This study aimed to determine whether MSC-EVs would elicit an immune response following administration in tumour-bearing immunocompetent animals. Secreted EVs were isolated from both human and murine bone marrow derived MSCs and characterized. hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs were administered intravenously into 4T1 breast tumour-bearing Balb/c mice or healthy controls. Tumour tissue, draining lymph nodes and spleens were harvested, dissociated into a single cell suspension and flow cytometry performed targeting T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The 4T1 model immune profile was first determined by comparing the spleen of tumour-bearing animals to healthy controls. T cells were increased in tumour-bearing animals (CD4+/CD25+ p=0.041; CD8+/CD25+ p=0.02). A significant elevation of GR-1+ MDSCs (p=0.002), CD11b+ macrophages (p=0.023) and CD11c+ dendritic cells (p=0.001) was also observed. In contrast, CD27+ NK cells were significantly decreased compared to the spleen of healthy animals (p=0.006). Collectively this data validated the immune profile and supported the determination of any changes in response to hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs administration. No significant activation of CD4+ (p=0.20) or CD8+ (p=0.57) T cells were seen in tumour tissue in both groups. The percentage of GR-1+ MDSCs (28% vs 27%, p=0.92), CD11b+, CD11c+ and CD27+ cells were similar regardless of EV origin. No significant changes in T cells, MDSCs, macrophages, dendritic or NK cells were observed in the lymph node or spleen of animals that received hMSC-EV versus mMSC-EVs. In conclusion, human MSC-EVs elicited no discernible immune response in mice, supporting the hypothesis that MSC-EVs retain the immune privilege of the secretory cell. This reinforces the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs.">

        <tr id="Pharmacologic activation of the innate immune response is being actively being pursued for numerous clinical purposes including enhancement of vaccine potency and potentiation of anti-cancer immunotherapy. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) represent especially useful targets for these efforts as their engagement by agonists can trigger signaling pathways that associate with phenotypes desirable for specific immune outcomes. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an ER-resident PRR reactive to cyclic dinucleotides such as those synthesized endogenously in response to cytosolic dsDNA. STING activation leads to transient generation of type I interferon (IFN-I) and proinflammatory responses that augment immunologically relevant effects including antiviral responses, antigen presentation, immune cell trafficking, and immunogenic cell death. In recent years engineered cyclic dinucleotides and small molecules have been discovered that induce STING and safely confer clinically useful outcomes in animal models such as adjuvanticity of anti-microbial vaccines and tumor clearance. Unfortunately, clinical trials examining the efficacy of STING agonists have thus far failed to satisfactorily recapitulate these positive outcomes and this has prevented their translational advancement. A likely relevant yet perplexingly under investigated aspect of pharmacologic STING activation is the diversity of molecular and immune responses that associate with chemical properties of the agonist. Based on this, a comparative survey of these was undertaken using unrelated STING-activating molecules to characterize the molecular, innate, cellular, and immune outcomes they elicit. This was done to inform and direct future studies aimed at designing and selecting agonists appropriate for desired clinical goals. This revealed demonstrable differences between the agonists in potency, transcriptomes, cytokine secretion profiles, immune cell trafficking, and antigen-directed humoral and cell mediated immune responses. As such, this work illustrates that phenotypes deriving from activation of a protein target can be linked to chemical properties of the engaging agonist and thus heightened scrutiny is necessary when selecting molecules to generate specific in vivo effects.">

To evaluate the response of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to IFN-γ, we established small intestinal organoids (enteroids) derived from non-IBD controls and CD patients. IFN-γ stimulated programmed cell death (PCD) of IECs in both control and CD enteroids in a dose-dependent manner. Pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis were activated in enteroids, suggesting that PANoptosis was the main process of IFN-γ-induced PCD in IECs. The response to IFN-γ depends on the cell type of the IECs. IFN-γ induced depletion of enterocytes with upregulation of PANoptosis-associated genes, while leading to expansion of goblet cells without significant change in PANoptosis-associated gene expression. Individual PCD inhibitors were insufficient to block IFN-γ-induced cytotoxicity, whereas the selective JAK1 inhibitor (upadacitinib) effectively blocked IFN-γ-induced cytotoxicity and PANoptosis. Furthermore, PANoptosis was significantly activated in surgically resected tissues and in publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of intestinal tissues from patients with CD. In conclusion, IFN-γ induces PANoptosis in enterocytes, which can be treated with a selective JAK1 inhibitor in patients with CD.">

As compared to polyclonally-activated CD4+ T cells, S. aureus-specific Tcon were enriched for the expression of the Th17-type cytokine genes IL17A, IL22 and IL26, while higher percentages of S. aureus-specific Treg expressed the T Cell Immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), a pleiotropic immune checkpoint. Notably, the antagonistic anti-TIGIT mAb Tiragolumab increased IL-1β production in response to S. aureus in vitro. Therefore, these results uncover the presence of S. aureus-specific TIGIT+ Treg in the blood of healthy subjects that could blunt responses to vaccination and indicate TIGIT as a potential targetable biomarker to overcome pre-exposure-induced immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="The current approach to minimize transplant-associated complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) includes long-term pharmacological immune suppression frequently accompanied by unwanted side effects. Advances in targeted immunotherapies regulating alloantigen responses in the recipient continue to reduce the need for pan-immunosuppression. Here, in vivo targeting of the TNF superfamily receptor 25 (TNFRSF25) and the high affinity IL-2 receptor with a TL1A-Ig fusion protein and low dose IL-2, respectively, was used to pretreat recipient mice prior to allogeneic-HSCT (aHSCT). Pretreatment induced Treg expansion persisting early post-aHSCT leading to diminished GVHD and improved transplant outcomes. Expansion was accompanied by an increase in frequency of stable and functionally active Tregs as evidenced by in vitro assays using cells from major GVHD target tissues including colon, liver, and eye. Importantly, pretreatment supported epithelial cell function/integrity, a diverse microbiome including reduction of pathologic bacteria overgrowth and promotion of butyrate producing bacteria, while maintaining physiologic levels of obligate/facultative anaerobes. Notably, using a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor agonist to sequester T cells in lymphoid tissues, we found that the increased tissue Treg frequency included resident CD69+CD103+FoxP3+ hepatic Tregs. In contrast to infusion of donor Treg cells, the strategy developed here resulted in the presence of immunosuppressive target tissue environments in the recipient prior to the receipt of donor allo-reactive T cells and successful perseveration of GVL responses. We posit strategies that circumvent the need of producing large numbers of ex-vivo manipulated Tregs, may be accomplished through in vivo recipient Treg expansion, providing translational approaches to improve aHSCT outcomes.

        <tr id="Background Glioblastoma, associated with poor prognosis and impaired immune function, shows potential interactions between newly identified disulfidptosis mechanisms and T cell exhaustion, yet these remain understudied. Methods Key genes were identified using Lasso regression, followed by multivariate analysis to develop a prognostic model. Single-cell pseudotemporal analysis explored disulfidptosis T-cell exhaustion (Tex) signaling in cell differentiation. Immune infiltration was assessed via ssGSEA, while transwell assays and immunofluorescence examined the effects of disulfidptosis-Tex genes on glioma cell behavior and immune response. Results Eleven disulfidptosis-Tex genes were found critical for glioblastoma survival outcomes. This gene set underpinned a model predicting patient prognosis. Single-cell analysis showed high disulfidptosis-Tex activity in endothelial cells. Memory T cell populations were linked to these genes. SMC4 inhibition reduced LN299 cell migration and increased chemotherapy sensitivity, decreasing CD4 and CD8 T cell activation. Conclusions Disulfidptosis-Tex genes are pivotal in glioblastoma progression and immune interactions, offering new avenues for improving anti-glioblastoma therapies through modulation of T cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="The discovery of immune checkpoints and the rapid growth of immuno-oncology (IO) have sparked tremendous efforts to utilize the immune system to treat a wide range of cancer types/subtypes. While the major focus of IO over the past decades has been to manipulate the adaptive immune system, recent attention has been given to manipulating the innate immune system to treat cancer and/or to enhance adaptive responses. In this work we detail the intracellular protein, Dual Specificity Phosphatase 11 (DUSP11), as an innate immune checkpoint (iIC) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Expression of this atypical phosphatase is correlated with patient survival for multiple cancer types, and we show here that its activity is important for the viability of lung cancer cells in vitro. Specifically, we demonstrate that DUSP11 knockdown in LUAD cells induces apoptosis and an innate immune response capable of activating other cells in vitro, and we provide evidence that these phenotypes are primarily mediated by the pattern recognition receptor, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I). Finally, we show that expression of DUSP11 is important for tumor engraftment and growth of human LUAD in mice. Overall, these data are the first to establish DUSP11 as an immunosuppressive, pro-neoplastic, and potentially targetable protein in LUAD. In addition, our data suggests that the anti-cancer mechanisms induced by diminishing the activity of DUSP11 are likely to be generalizable to other cancer types such as breast cancer, warranting future investigation and therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

        <tr id="HIV persists in diverse tissues, with distinct cellular reservoirs presenting a major barrier to a cure and requiring targeted therapeutic strategies to address this heterogeneity. Here, we developed tissue models of HIV latency using human tonsillar, intestinal and cervicovaginal tissues. These models revealed differential HIV infection across CD4+ T cell subpopulations, with ART partially restoring CD4+ T cells and reducing intact HIV DNA. T follicular helper cells (TFH CD69+ CCR7-) were the primary inducible reservoir in tonsils, while tissue-resident memory cells (TRM CD69+ CD49a+) dominated in the intestine. Identification of markers for inducible reservoirs revealed that CD69, CD45RO, and PD-1 were shared across tissues, while CXCR5 in the tonsils and CD49a in the intestine served as tissue-specific markers. Furthermore, using different latency reversal agents (LRAs) we found that Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDACis) failed to induce HIV in any tissue, the SMAC mimetic AZD5582 was effective only in a resident-memory CD4+ T cell subpopulation in the intestine, and IL15 exhibited the broadest reactivation potential across tissues and CD4+ T subsets. These models recapitulate key aspects of HIV infection providing insights into the inducible reservoir’s composition in different tissues and informing strategies for its elimination.">

        <tr id="Antibody production is central to protection against new pathogens and cancers, as well as to certain forms of autoimmunity. Antibodies often originate in the lymph node (LN), specifically at the extrafollicular border of B cell follicles, where T and B lymphocytes physically interact to drive B cell maturation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts. In vitro models of this process are sorely needed to predict aspects of the human immune response. Microphysiological systems (MPSs) offer the opportunity to approximate the lymphoid environment, but so far have focused primarily on memory recall responses to antigens previously encountered by donor cells. To date, no 3D culture system has replicated the engagement between T cells and B cells (T—B interaction) that leads to antibody production when starting with naïve cells. Here, we developed a LN-MPS to model early T—B interactions at the extrafollicular border built from primary, naïve human lymphocytes encapsulated within a collagen-based 3D matrix. Within the MPS, naïve T cells exhibited CCL21-dependent chemotaxis and chemokinesis as predicted. Naïve T and B cells were successfully skewed on chip to an early T follicular helper (pre-Tfh) and activated state, respectively, and co-culture of the latter cells led to CD38+ plasmablast cells and T cell dependent production of IgM. These responses required differentiation of the T cells into pre-Tfhs, physical cell-cell contact, and were sensitive to the ratio at which pre-Tfh and activated B cells were seeded on-chip. Dependence on T cell engagement was greatest at a 1:5 T:B ratio, while cell proliferation and CD38+ signal was greatest at a 1:1 T:B ratio. Furthermore, plasmablast formation was established starting from naïve T and B cells on-chip. We envision that this MPS model of primary lymphocyte physiology will enable new mechanistic analyses of human humoral immunity in vitro.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant neoplasm globally, with an increased death rate despite recent advancements in research and therapeutic options. Different molecular subtypes of GC have distinct interactions with the immune system, impacting the tumor microenvironment (TME), prognosis, and reaction to immunotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the TME are crucial for preventing tumor growth and metastasis, as evidenced by research showing that patients with GC who have a significant density of TILs have better survival rates. But cancer cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, both sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) playing a pivotal role in the development of an immunosuppressive TME. They prevent T cell activation and proliferation resulting in a decrease in the immune system’s capacity to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. These immune checkpoint molecules function via different but complementary mechanisms, the expression of Siglec-15 being mutually exclusive with PD-L1 and, therefore, providing a different therapeutic approach. The review explores how TILs affect tumor growth and patient outcomes in GC, with particular emphasis on their interactions within the TME and potential targeting of the PD-L1 and Siglec-15 pathways for immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="While the majority of ovarian cancer (OC) patients respond to front-line carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy and surgical debulking, nearly all patients will develop platinum-resistance and recur. Our study investigates how tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) affect chemotherapy outcomes using OC patient-derived organoids and humanized patient-derived xenografts (huPDX). In vitro macrophage migration assays demonstrate the selective recruitment of M2 polarized macrophages to OC organoids. M2 macrophages, but not M1 macrophages, increase OC organoid viability and reduce their sensitivity to paclitaxel in co-culture assays. Furthermore, we identified BMS777607, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that is capable of repolarizing M2 macrophages in vitro and reduces organoid viability by a macrophage-dependent mechanism. In a platinum-sensitive humanized patient-derived xenograft (huPDX) model, the presence of human immune cells increased between-mouse variability in response to paclitaxel with two of four mice demonstrating tumor regrowth after two weeks of treatment. A TAM-targeted CSF-1R inhibitor, BLZ945 significantly reduced the total number of human immune cells within the ascites fluid of huPDX3 mice, but did not reduce tumor burden. However BLZ945 in combination with paclitaxel reduced tumor burden with no sign of regrowth. Our study demonstrates that patient-derived OC organoids and huPDX, are useful for evaluating the immunomodulatory effects of therapies and the influence of TAMs on response. huPDX models could serve as a robust platform for preclinical testing of novel anti-cancer treatments, providing insights into the complex interplay between immune cells and cancer therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a serious threat to global health, with rising incidence and mortality rates. Therapeutic options for advanced HCC are quite limited, and the overall prognosis remains poor. Recent advancements in immunotherapy, particularly immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting anti-PD1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4, have facilitated a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, demonstrating substantial survival benefits across various cancer types, including HCC. However, only a subset of HCC patients exhibit a favorable response to ICB therapy, and its efficacy is often hindered by the development of resistance. There are many studies to explore the underlying mechanisms of ICB response. In this review, we compiled the latest progression in immunotherapies for HCC and systematically summarized the sophisticated mechanisms by which components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) regulate resistance to ICB therapy. Additionally, we also outlined some scientific rationale strategies to boost antitumor immunity and enhance the efficacy of ICB in HCC. These insights may serve as a roadmap for future research and help improve outcomes for HCC patients.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (AHST) can cure patients with many diseases, but harmful acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) remains a challenge. Many immune cells are implicated in the pathogenesis and control of alloreactive T-cell responses causing aGvHD, but the functionally dominant cells at different times remain unknown. Using mass cytometry to simultaneously assess alloreactive and immunoregulatory cell populations after AHST, we identified a robust early immune signature predictive of aGvHD rich in CD4 effector memory T-cells and deficient in functionally allosuppressive NK cells. Additionally, network analysis identified a heterogeneous immunoregulatory cell group (IRCG) that more accurately predicted aGVHD than any individual cell populations or established serum biomarkers. Immune signatures preceding aGvHD evolved over time, with qualitative and quantitative changes in both the alloreactive T-cell compartment and the constituent components of the IRCG. In mapping how alloreactive and immunoregulatory cell populations evolve temporally, we provide mechanistic insight into dynamic control of alloreactivity supporting development of time-sensitive targeted strategies to reduce aGvHD.

CD14+CD16+ monocytes exhibit diverse functions and contribute to neuroinflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-NCI). Analysis of human CD14+CD16+ monocytes matured in vitro by single-cell RNA sequencing identified a heterogenous population of nine clusters. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in each cluster identified increased migratory and inflammatory pathways for a group of clusters, which we termed Group 1 monocytes. Group 1 monocytes, distinguished by increased ALCAM, CD52, CD63, and SDC2, exhibited gene expression signatures implicated in CNS inflammatory diseases, produced higher levels of CXCL12, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, and ROS, and preferentially transmigrated across a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model. Thus, Group 1 cells within the CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset are likely to be major contributors to neuroinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Mucosal-associated invariant T cells are highly conserved innate-like T cells in mammals recognized for their high baseline frequency in human blood and cytotoxic effector functions during infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer. While the majority of these cells express a conserved CD8αβ+ TRAV1-2 T cell receptor recognizing microbially-derived Vitamin B2 intermediates presented by the evolutionarily conserved major histocompatibility complex I-related molecule, MR1, there is an emerging appreciation for diverse subsets that may be selected for in humans with distinct functions, including subpopulations that co-express CD4. Prior work has not examined T cell receptor (TCR) heterogeneity in CD4+ MAIT cells, largely due to bias of identifying human MAIT cells as CD8+ TRAV1-2+ cells. In this study, we adopted an unbiased single-cell TCR-sequencing approach of total MR1-5-OP-RU-tetramer-reactive T cells and discovered that CD4+ MAIT cells express highly diverse TRAV1-2 negative TCRs. To specifically characterize this TCR repertoire, we analyzed VDJ sequences of single MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer+ MAIT cells across two datasets and identified distinct TCR usage among CD4+ MAIT cells including TRAV21, TRAV8 (TRAV8-1, TRAV8-2, TRAV8-3), and TRAV12 families (TRAV12-2, TRAV12-3), as well as more variable J chain and CDR3 sequences. Non-TRAV1-2 MAIT cell TCRs were also enriched after in vitro expansion, including with Mycobacterial tuberculosis. These results indicate that mature human CD4+ MAIT cells adopt distinct TCR usage from the canonical TRAV1-2+ CD8+ subset and suggest that alternative MR1 ligands in addition to riboflavin intermediates may select them.">

        <tr id="Many inflammatory stimuli can induce progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells as part of the process of emergency myelopoiesis. These events are associated with innate training and can have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27 deficient mice are pre-disposed towards the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.">

        <tr id="Eosinophils exert antimicrobial, cytotoxic and immunoregulatory effects, but their function in cutaneous tissue still remains poorly understood. Here, we used a mouse model of chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania (L.) mexicana to investigate the function and transcriptomic signature of eosinophils in the skin. In C57BL/6 wild-type mice, L. mexicana infection induced local and systemic eosinophilia that was dependent on type 2 innate lymphoid cells and interleukin-5. Genetic and pharmacological depletion of eosinophils led to complete clinical resolution of disease, which was accompanied by a more pronounced Th1 and M1-like macrophage response. Bioinformatic analyses revealed a novel inflammatory and tissue-specific transcriptional trajectory in skin-infiltrating eosinophils. Skin-imprinted eosinophils strongly expressed the high-affinity glucose transporter 3 (Slc2a3), deprived the environment of glucose and directly impeded the function of Th1 cells. Together, our results demonstrate that disease progression and chronicity of L. mexicana infection is caused by inflammatory eosinophils and linked to their metabolic program. Short Summary The authors describe that depletion of eosinophils prevents chronic cutaneous disease caused by Leishmania mexicana. They identify a novel, tissue-specific transcriptomic profile of inflammatory skin eosinophils and demonstrate that skin-imprinted eosinophils show strong glucose uptake and directly repress Th1 responses.

        <tr id="Background: Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate among all cancers, for which immunotherapy can frequently lead to drug resistance. To understand the molecular mechanisms behind immune escape in patients with lung cancer and develop predictive and therapeutic targets, we carried out analytical experiments using single-cell sequencing. Methods: We collected eight tumor tissue samples from eight patients with lung adenocarcinoma and categorized them based on the positive reactions for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels. Single-cell sequencing analysis was employed to create a comprehensive cellular landscape. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection was used to show the proportion of immune and endothelial cells, along with a map depicting the distribution of different cell types. Cells were subdivided according to molecular markers; the subpopulations were grouped based on PD-L1 levels and tumor marker-positive reactions. The correlation between the occurrence of the PD-L1 reaction and the response time of immune cells was explored; differential gene expression between the groups was elucidated. Finally, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to examine the relationship between key differentially expressed genes and PD-L1 immune escape checkpoint response. Results: A total of 58,810 single cells were analyzed, identifying seven distinct cell types. In the PD-L1-positive sample group, B cells, astrocytes, endothelial cells, outer skin cells, and tissue stem cells were present in higher proportions, whereas T and dendritic cells were the main cells in the PD-L1-negative sample group. According to the molecular markers, the seven cell types were divided into 17 cell clusters, with one cluster classified as tumor cells, showing PD-L1 positivity. Eleven molecular markers with different expression levels were simultaneously screened (NAPSA, MUC1, WFDC2, MYO6, LYZ, IGHG4, IGLL5, IGHM, IGKC, AQP3, and IGFBP7), and their association with the PD-L1/PD-1 immune escape axis response was confirmed by qPCR. Conclusion: Our study suggests that PD-L1-mediated immune escape may occur at a later stage of tumor progression, involving both PD-L1-positive and negative immune cells. Additionally, we identified 11 differentially expressed genes that could provide insights into the potential mechanisms of immune escape in patients with lung cancer. These findings offer promising molecular targets for the detection and treatment of immune escape in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi infections range from asymptomatic (AS) to severe visceral leishmaniasis (VL). One of the manifestations is an atypical non-ulcerated cutaneous leishmaniasis (NUCL), which occurs in some locations of Central America with few cases of VL. We conducted a transcriptomic analysis of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) on blood samples from NUCL, AS, VL patients from Amapala, Honduras, and healthy controls. RNA-seq revealed a similar perturbation of gene expression in NUCL and AS. Eight gene signatures of CMI were found in NUCL involved in CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration, reactive oxygen species generation, PD-1 receptor ligand, inflammasome assembly, chemotaxis, complement receptor and suppressor immune cell infiltration. NUCL was distinguished from VL by its up-regulation of differently expressed genes (DEGs) related to T lymphocyte exhaustion, adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes, and down-regulation of oxidative stress genes. In contrast, VL exhibited up-regulated DEGs involved in antigen cross-presentation, and similar to VL from Brazil, down-regulated DEGs involved in innate immunity. Corroborating the transcriptome findings, both the Leishmanin skin test, and the immunopathology of NUCL skin lesion defined NUCL as a proinflammatory condition, intermediate between the AS and VL clinical outcomes. That condition may be the underlying element for the benign nature of the NUCL.">

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint blockade is a standard-of-care treatment for mRCC patients, but the immune mechanisms driving clinical benefit remain underexplored. In the I-RENE trial (NCT04891055), we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) and lymphoid dynamics and their impact on the efficacy of nivolumab.
 Methods:
 The I-RENE study is a prospective, translational, real-world multicenter trial involving mRCC patients treated with nivolumab after failure of previous VEGFR-targeted therapies. Sixty patients were enrolled between December 2018 and August 2022. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected at baseline and at 2, 4, and 12 weeks, as well as at disease progression. PBMCs were analyzed by high-resolution flow cytometry (profiling 144 lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets), and plasma was assessed using multiplex analysis (69 soluble factors). CD14+ monocytes from PB and tumor tissue were subjected to RNA sequencing.
 Results:
 Significant immune modulations in PB were detectable as early as 2 weeks into treatment across all patients, regardless of clinical response, and persisted throughout the 3-month observation period. These changes included substantial alterations in the profiles of immune cells and plasma soluble factors. Responders to nivolumab exhibited a marked reduction in monocyte subsets associated with immune suppression, such as CD14+HLA-DR- cells, CD14+PD-L1+ cells, and intermediate monocytes. In contrast, non-responders showed a progressive increase in suppressive monocytes and a concomitant decrease in CD14+ cells involved in anti-tumor immunity, including non-classical monocytes and CD14+ cells expressing HLA-DR and CX3CR1. Lymphoid compartment analysis revealed that responders experienced an increase in CD8+ T cells and CD4+ effector memory T cells, along with a reduction in CD38+ T cells. Conversely, non-responders showed significant upregulation of senescent CD8+ T cells (KLRG1+CD28-CD57+) and CD38+ T cells. All progressing patients showed a notable resurgence of suppressive myeloid cells (HLA-DR-, PD-L1+), confirmed by an enriched MDSC gene signature, as well as an increase in PB CD38+ and senescent T cells. Notably, the detrimental role of myeloid-driven immune suppression in non-responders was further confirmed by an enriched MDSC gene signature in matched tumor samples.
 Conclusions:
 The pervasive and detrimental impact of myeloid cells committed to immune suppression is evident even before radiological progression in mRCC patients and persists despite immunotherapy. These findings highlight the need for early identification of immune-suppressive infiltrates and the development of strategies to overcome or reprogram these cells, both at the systemic and tumor level, following diagnosis.

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in linking innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition to presenting antigens to T cells, DCs must also provide co-stimulatory signals along with cytokines for T cells to induce an appropriate cellular immune response. Tolerance is also established and maintained by DCs under homeostatic circumstances. There is remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity in DCs, each with different functional flexibility and specific expression of various markers. The three primary categories of DCs comprise conventional DCs (cDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). Langerhans cells (LCs) are another type of DCs, which are found in the skin's epidermal layer. DCs may be positioned or triggered inappropriately as a result of dysregulation of DC. This phenomenon can cause an imbalance in immune responses and even immune-related pathological disorders, i.e., autoimmune diseases and malignancies. Herein, by reviewing the ontogeny, biology, characteristics, and function of DCs subsets in immune system, we discuss the contribution of these cells in the mentioned immune-related disorders.">

        <tr id="While durable antibody responses from long-lived plasma cell (LLPC) populations are important for protection against pathogens, LLPC may be harmful if they produce antibodies against self-proteins or self-nuclear antigens as occurs in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Thus, the elimination of autoreactive LLPC may improve the treatment of antibody-driven autoimmune diseases. However, LLPC remain a challenging therapeutic target. Here, we compare the matched bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PBL) plasma cell (PC) compartments of SLE and healthy donors (HD). We show a similar distribution of CD138- and CD138+ PC, including putative LLPC (CD19- CD138+ CD38+), between SLE and HD BM. For both SLE and HD, CD138+ PC are at a higher frequency in BM than PBL. Expression of Ki-67 associates with the PBL compartment where it is found on all PC subsets regardless of CD19 or CD138 expression. Transcriptomic analysis identifies an interferon (IFN) gene signature in transitional B cells in the SLE BM, but surprisingly also in the BM PC derived from SLE. BM PC and B cells phosphorylate STAT1 in response to type I IFN stimulation in vitro, but with decreased fold change compared to those from the PBL. While BM PC bind type I IFN receptor-blocking antibody anifrolumab, it is to a lesser degree than circulating B cells. Anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA) are found in the BM supernatant and PBL serum of SLE patients. Both SLE and HD BM-derived PC have increased survival compared to their PBL counterparts when treated with verdinexor. In summary, these findings show evidence of IFN activation in BM PC from SLE.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Adaptive immune resistance in cancer describes the various mechanisms by which tumors adapt to evade anti-tumor immune responses. IFN-γ induction of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was the first defined and validated adaptive immune resistance mechanism. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is central to adaptive immune resistance as immune modulatory secreted and integral membrane proteins are dependent on ER. Sigma1 is a unique ligand-regulated integral membrane scaffolding protein enriched in the ER of cancer cells. PD-L1 is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is translated into the ER and processed through the cellular secretory pathway. At the cell surface, PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint molecule that binds PD-1 on activated T-cells and blocks anti-tumor immunity. PD-L1 can also be incorporated into cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), and EV-associated PD-L1 can inactivate T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that a selective small molecule inhibitor of Sigma1 can block IFN-γ mediated adaptive immune resistance in part by altering the incorporation of PD-L1 into cancer cell-derived EVs. Sigma1 inhibition blocked post-translational maturation of PD-L1 downstream of IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling. Subsequently, EVs released in response to IFN-γ stimulation were significantly less potent suppressors of T-cell activation. These results suggest that by reducing tumor derived immune suppressive EVs, Sigma1 inhibition may promote antitumor immunity. Sigma1 modulation presents a novel approach to regulating the tumor immune microenvironment by altering the content and production of EVs. Altogether, these data support the notion that Sigma1 may play a role in adaptive immune resistance in the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="The hallmark of HIV-1 infection is the progressive development of multicellular and systemic immune dysfunction, culminating in AIDS. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a pivotal role in HIV dissemination to CD4+ T cells, which are subsequently depleted by the virus leading to HIV disease progression. Type I interferons (IFNs) are critical for host defense during acute infection but contribute to chronic immune activation during the later stages of HIV disease. This persistent activation leads to immune cell exhaustion. HIV-1 can activate type I IFN responses via several pathways, including the STING pathway, which is activated by e.g., virus-derived oligonucleotides. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms creating HIV-1-mediated immune dysfunction and role of type I IFNs using a DC and T cell co-culture model. HIV-1 exposure in the DC-T cell co-culture promoted the expansion of suppressive T cells with diminished proliferation and effector functions. The impairment required type I IFNs and subsequent IFN-α/β receptor signaling, initiated by HIV-derived ssDNA activation of IFI16/cGAS followed by STING signaling in the DCs. Targeting IFNAR1 with Anifrolumab restored the immune functions of both DCs and T cells, as well as T cell proliferation and T cell effector functions, including their secretion of IL-2, IFN-γ, and granzyme B. Our findings support that the immune impairments existing in untreated or antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated HIV-infected individuals are mediated, if not fully in part by type I IFN’s negative effect on DC and T cells. Therapeutics targeting IFN-α/β receptors, such as Anifrolumab, hold potential as combination treatment alongside ART, to achieve a more complete immune restoration and contribute to improved quality of life among people living with HIV.">

        <tr id="T cell exhaustion is important to protect the host from immunopathology during chronic viral infection, but it also impairs T cell anti-tumor immunity1–5. A fundamental unresolved question is whether and how T cell exhaustion is determined at the onset of TCR signaling6–8. Here we report an unexpected role of Themis, a TCR-proximal signaling molecule9, in T cell exhaustion. Chronic viral infection in mice usually leads to T cell exhaustion and survival of the host. Surprisingly, Themis T-cell conditional knockout mice died from severe CD8+-dependent lung immunopathology in chronic viral infection, showing Themis’ importance in establishing T cell exhaustion. We found that Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells were hyperactivated at the single-cell level - producing more TNF and IFNγ compared to wild-type counterparts - but defective in population-level expansion. Moreover, TCF-1 and TOX expression were inhibited in Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells, thereby impairing differentiation of exhausted T cell precursors (T-pex) and maintenance of terminally exhausted T cells (T-ex), respectively. Mechanistically, Themis initially promotes TCR signaling to induce PD-1 expression and subsequently mediates PD-1 signaling. In the latter, Themis binds to PD-1 and promotes PD-1 phosphorylation and its recruitment of SHP2, thereby acting as a negative regulator to inhibit T cell effector functions. Without Themis, the orderly regulation of TCR and PD-1 signaling, and therefore exhaustion, is disrupted. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that Themis-mediated early TCR signaling plays a decisive role in T cell exhaustion and provide a novel mechanism of PD-1 signaling through Themis.">

        <tr id="Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is known as an inflammasome-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in T-cell-driven autoimmune diseases. In mice, T-cells were reported to instruct myeloid cells to produce IL-1β via an inflammasome-independent mechanism, that engages TNFR and Fas-caspase-8-dependent signalling pathways. In this study, we explored T-cell-driven myeloid IL-1β production in humans. Co-culturing of autologous primary T-cells (memory CD4+ and CD8+) with myeloid cells (monocyte, macrophage and dendritic cells) revealed that both memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induce IL-1β secretion. Also, caspase-1 rather than caspase-8 cleaves pro-IL-1β in human myeloid cells. This process depends on TNF-α, CD40L and IFN-γ together rather than TNF-α alone, leading to upregulated pro-IL-1β expression in human myeloid cells. We additionally show that TNF-α, CD40L and IFN-γ independently enhance IL-1β secretion. Together, our study highlights that, despite the shared biology in T-cell-instructed IL-1β production between humans and mice, different underlying molecular pathways are implicated. Summary Like murine cells, human T-cells stimulate IL-1β secretion from myeloid cells. However, the underlying mechanisms differ, with IL-1β production in humans being driven by TNF-α, CD40L, IFN-γ, and Caspase-1, whereas in mice, it is primarily regulated by TNF-α and Caspase-8.">

Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocytes in human, and heterogeneous neutrophils have been increasingly recognized as important players in tumor progression. They play double “edge-sward” by either supporting or suppressing the tumor growth, including driving angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling to promote tumor growth, participating in antitumor adaptive immunity, or killing tumor cells directly to inhibit the tumor growth. The complex role of neutrophils in various tumors depends on the tumor microenvironment (TME) they are located, and emerging evidence has suggested that neutrophils may determine the success of tumor immunotherapy in the context of the immune checkpoint blockade, innate immune training, or drug-loaded extracellular microvesicles therapy, which makes them become an exciting target for tumor immunotherapy, but still with challenges. Here, we summarize the latest insights on how to activate neutrophils in antitumor immunity and discuss the advances of neutrophil-targeted immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are characterized by impaired immune response that fails to eliminate HBV. Immune checkpoint molecules (ICMs) control the amplitude of the activation and function of immune cells, which makes them the key regulators of immune response. Methods We performed a multiparametric flow cytometry analysis of ICMs and determined their expression on intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets in untreated and treated patients with HBV in comparison with non-pathological liver tissue. Results The liver of untreated HBV patients exhibited a high accumulation of PD-1+CD8+ T cells, while the frequencies of 4-1BB+ T cells, 4-1BB+ natural killer (NK) cells, and TIM-3+CD8+ T cells were the highest in the chronic hepatitis phase. Our findings showed that the HBeAg status is linked to a distinct immune phenotype of intrahepatic CD8+ T cells and NK cells characterized by high expression of ICMs, particularly 4-1BB. Importantly, antiviral treatment partially restored the normal expression of ICMs. Finally, we described important differences in ICM expression between intrahepatic and circulating NK cells in HBV patients. Conclusions Our study shows clear differences in the intrahepatic expression of ICMs on NK cells and T cells in chronic HBV patients depending on their clinical stage.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of adaptive immunity, guiding T helper (Th) cell differentiation through antigen presentation, co-stimulation, and cytokine production. However, in steady-state conditions, certain DC subsets, such as Langerhans cells (LCs), induce T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and B cell responses without inflammatory stimuli. Using multiple mouse models and in vitro systems, we investigated the mechanisms underlying steady-state LC-induced adaptive immune responses. We found that LCs drive germinal center Tfh and B cell differentiation and antibody production independently of interleukin-6 (IL-6), type-I interferons, and ICOS ligand (ICOS-L) signaling, which are critical in inflammatory settings. Instead, these responses relied on CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation. Our findings challenge the conventional three-signal paradigm by demonstrating that cytokine signaling is dispensable for LC-mediated Tfh and B cell responses in steady-state. These insights provide a framework for understanding homeostatic immunity and the immune system’s role in maintaining tolerance or developing autoimmunity under non-inflammatory conditions.

        <tr id="Avian γδ T lymphocytes are highly abundant in the intestinal mucosa and play a critical role in immune defense against infectious diseases in chickens. However, their specific contributions to infection control remain poorly understood. To investigate the role of γδ T cells and their possible compensation, we studied wild-type and γδ T cell knockout chickens following infection with Salmonella Enteritidis. Bacterial loads in the liver, cecal content, and cecal wall were quantified. Immune cell populations in blood, spleen, and cecum were analyzed using flow cytometry. Immune gene transcription in sorted T cell subsets and cecal tissue was measured by RT-qPCR. Strikingly, chickens lacking γδ T cells had significantly higher bacterial loads in the liver and more extensive Salmonella invasion in the cecal wall during the early stages of infection compared to wild-type birds. In the blood, infected γδ T cell knockout chickens displayed a significantly increased percentage of CD25+ NK-like cells. In both blood and tissue, infected wild-type chickens demonstrated an increased absolute number of CD8αα++ γδ T cells. Conversely, γδ T cell knockout chickens exhibited an augmented cell count of a CD8αα++CD4- non-γδ T cell population after infection, which might include αβ T cells. At 7 days post infection (dpi), gene expression analysis revealed elevated transcription of the activation marker IL-2Rα and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IFN-γ) in CD8αα++CD4- non-γδ T cells from γδ T cell knockout chickens compared to CD8αα++ γδ T cells from wild-type birds. By 12 dpi, these differences diminished as transcription levels increased in γδ T cells of wild-type animals. Our findings demonstrate that γδ T cells play a role in early immune protection against Salmonella Enteritidis infection in chickens. In later stages of the infection, the γδ T cells and their functions appear to be replaced by other cells.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents significant clinical challenges due to its limited treatment options and aggressive behavior, often associated with poor prognosis. This study focuses on Kindlin-2, an adaptor protein, and its role in TNBC progression, particularly in hematopoiesis-mediated immune evasion. TNBC tumors expressing high levels of Kindlin-2 induce a notable reshaping of hematopoiesis, promoting expansion of myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM) and spleen. This shift correlated with increased levels of neutrophils and monocytes in tumor-bearing mice over time. Conversely, genetic knockout of Kindlin-2 mitigated this myeloid bias and fostered T cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, indicating Kindlin-2's pivotal role in immune modulation. Further investigations revealed that Kindlin-2 deficiency led to reduced expression of PD-L1, a critical immune checkpoint inhibitor, in TNBC tumors. This molecular change sensitized Kindlin-2-deficient tumors to host anti-tumor immune responses, resulting in enhanced tumor suppression in immune-competent mouse models. Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA-seq, and immunohistochemistry data supported these findings by highlighting enriched immune-related pathways and increased infiltration of immune cells in Kindlin-2-deficient tumors. Therapeutically, targeting PD-L1 in Kindlin-2-expressing TNBC tumors effectively inhibited tumor growth, akin to the effects observed with genetic Kindlin-2 knockout or PD-L1-KO. Our data underscore Kindlin-2 as a promising therapeutic target in combination with immune checkpoint blockade to bolster anti-tumor immunity and counteract resistance mechanisms typical of TNBC and other immune evasive solid tumors. Implications: Kindlin-2 regulates tumor immune evasion through the systemic modulation of hematopoiesis and PD-L1 expression, which warrants therapeutic targeting of Kindlin-2 in TNBC patients.">

 Three novel therapies have shown promise in managing moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC): fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, and targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Individually, these treatment approaches face issues with either safety concerns or limited efficacy due to disease relapses. Yet, the development of better strategies is hampered by limited knowledge about the cellular mechanisms driving chronic inflammation and disease relapse in UC. In UC, the number of aberrantly differentiated tissue resident MSCs in the colonic mucosa is increased. The mechanisms behind this abnormal MSC differentiation and how they affect MSC therapy in UC remain unclear. JAK2 signaling is involved in the differentiation of bone marrow derived (BM)-MSCs and previously we observed that stimulation of BM-MSCs with UC relevant microbial ligand LPS upregulated JAK2. We hypothesized that dysbiotic microbial ligands in UC promote aberrant MSC differentiation through JAK2 activation, reducing the efficacy of MSC therapy.



 Mesenchymal progenitor cells were isolated from human UC tissue. Wild-type and MyD88 mesenchymal lineage conditional knockout mice (Grem1CreMyD88KO) were used in two models of experimental colitis (TNBS-induced and oxazolone-induced colitis). Murine FMT and syngeneic MSC transplant were also used in these studies.



 Analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA seq data showed increased numbers of mesenchymal cells co-expressing stem cell (POU5F1) and progenitor markers (Grem1), along with JAK2, in inflamed colon tissue from UC patients. Bulk RNA seq analysis of healthy colonic mesenchymal cells from normal tissue stimulated with the Gram-negative bacteria-derived TLR4 ligand, LPS, revealed upregulation of inflammatory genes IL-6, IL-33, PD-L1, and JAK2 signaling. Deletion of MyD88 in MSCs during the acute phase of TNBS-induced colitis improved symptoms and decreased UC-relevant inflammation concomitantly with downregulation of JAK2. In the oxazolone-induced model of colitis, depletion of dysbiotic microbiota with antibiotics and subsequent FMT resulted in reduced JAK2 expression in the colonic mucosa, and when combined with MSC therapy shown superior efficacy in improvement of clinical sign of colitis, improvement of colonic tissue architecture and reduction of UC-relevant inflammatory responses when compared to FMT or MSCs therapy alone.



 Dysbiotic microbial ligands in UC contribute to the generation of abnormally differentiated MSCs with active JAK2 signaling and downstream molecules supporting inflammation in UC and this process involves MSC intrinsic MyD88 signaling. Further, our data suggests depletion of the dysbiotic microbiota in combination of FMT/MSCs therapy could counteract this effect and may offer a more effective approach to treating UC.

 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become a successful mainstay of therapy for cancer; however, the use of ICIs is limited by their unique inflammatory toxicities including ICI-colitis, which involves the infiltration of both CD8 and CD4 T cells. The precise immune pathogenesis of ICI-colitis remains incompletely understood. Pathogenesis of other immune-mediated colitis including acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), Crohn’s disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) also involves T-cell-mediated immune response against intestinal tissues. We hypothesized that T cell subtypes and the immune milieu surrounding damaged colonic epithelium in ICI-colitis are distinct from other types of immune-mediated colitis. We aimed to compare transcriptomic landscape of immune microenvironment in ICI-colitis with other immune-mediated colitis using transcriptomic and spatial profiling. We retrospectively identified formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded distal colonic biopsies demonstrating histopathologic features of ICI-colitis (n=3), aGVHD (n=3), CD (n=3), and UC (n=3) and normal distal colon (n=2) from age- and gender-matched patients. Transcriptomic analysis was first performed using bulk RNA-seq. Differentially expressed genes were further analyzed by CompBio, a novel knowledge engine to define molecular pathways. Spatial transcriptomic analysis was performed using the 10x Genomics Xenium platform with a pre-designed human colon panel (322 genes) on all biopsies. Data were analyzed in R by Seurat. Dimensionality reduction was done using UMAP. The Louvain algorithm was used for clustering. Analysis was further subdivided into microdomains of colonic surface and crypt bases. Bulk RNA-seq and pathway analysis revealed upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine production in all colitis types when they were compared to normal colon. Transcriptomic alterations in ICI-colitis compared with all other colitis included pathways upregulated in T-cell chemotaxis, particularly CCL5, and downregulated in IL4/IL13 mediated Th2 activation. Louvain clustering of the spatial transcriptomic data showed an increase in DUOX2 expressing inflamed enterocytes across all colitis types compared with normal colon and a similar overall abundance of inflammatory cells across sample types(Figure 1). Spatial microdomain analysis showed higher numbers of activated CD8+ T cells neighboring enterocytes and goblet cells in ICI-colitis relative to other types of colitis (Figure 2). The increase in neighboring activated CD8+ T cells was present in both the crypt base and surface epithelium and was accompanied with increased neighboring CCL5+ cells in both microdomains in ICI-colitis. Our results show that an increase in activated T cells and CCL5 expression in the immune microenvironment of damaged colonic epithelium differentiates ICI-colitis from other types of immune-mediated colitis.

        <tr id="The combination of chemotherapeutic agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, its success is often limited by insufficient immune priming in certain tumors, including pediatric malignancies. In this report, we explore clinical trials currently investigating the use of immunogenic cell death (ICD)-inducing chemotherapies in combination with ICIs for both adult and pediatric cancers. Given the limited clinical data available for pediatric tumors, we focused on recent preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy of these combinations in neuroblastoma (NB). Finally, to address this gap, we propose an innovative strategy to assess the impact of ICD-inducing chemotherapies on antitumor immune responses in NB. Using tumor spheroids derived from a transgenic NB mouse model, we validated our previous in vivo findings concerning how anthracyclines, specifically mitoxantrone and doxorubicin, significantly enhance MHC class I surface expression, stimulate IFNγ and granzyme B production by CD8+ T cells and NK cells, and promote immune cell recruitment. Importantly, these anthracyclines also upregulated PD-L1 expression on NB spheroids. This screening platform yielded results similar to in vivo findings, demonstrating that mitoxantrone and doxorubicin are the most potent immunomodulatory agents for NB. These data suggest that the creation of libraries of ICD inducers to be tested on tumor spheroids could reduce the number of combinations to be tested in vivo, in line with the principles of the 3Rs. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of chemo-immunotherapy regimens to counteract the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in NB, paving the way for improved therapeutic strategies in pediatric cancers. They provide compelling evidence to support further clinical investigations of these combinations to enhance outcomes for children with malignancies.">

        <tr id="The type-I interferon family is well known for its critical role in innate immunity. It comprises several members, among which IFN-α2 and IFN-β are the most extensively studied, with important antiviral and immune-modulatory functions. Recent findings linking autoantibodies against type-I interferons to severe COVID-19 suggest a potential role for IFN-ω in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, little is known about human IFN-ω, as most research on this interferon has been conducted in feline models. Here, we demonstrate that human IFN-ω is secreted at levels comparable to those of IFN-α2 or IFN-β upon stimulation with inflammatory agonists and triggers a robust antiviral response, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Moreover, IFN-ω enhances the effector functions of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells primed de novo from healthy donor cells, highlighting its capacity to promote strong cellular immunity. Our results position IFN-ω as a key member of the type-I interferon family, with promising potential for therapeutic and vaccine applications. Author Summary Type-I interferons are pleiotropic cytokines, including IFN-α and IFN-β, which are well known for their antiviral activities. Here, we report on the functional characteristics of human IFN-ω, a neglected member of the type-I IFN family, which has primarily been studied in feline models. We show here that human IFN-ω induces intense downstream signaling in cells resulting in the upregulation of antiviral genes, and efficient restriction of SARS-CoV-2 replication. IFN-ω also promotes the acquisition of strong cytolytic functions by antigen primed CD8+ T cells. Overall, our findings portray human IFN-ω as a major antiviral molecule, similar to the well-studied and highly effective IFN-α2. The secretion of IFN-ω upon infection is likely to be crucial for effective control of multiple viruses, advocating for its use in therapeutic approaches in humans.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Non‐lymphoid tissue Tregs (NLT‐Tregs) are critical for tissue homeostasis, inflammation control, and induction of tissue repair. Recent single‐cell RNA sequencing data identified the expression of CD83 as part of an NLT‐Treg signature, which is an essential molecule for the stability and differentiation of lymphoid Tregs. However, the biological significance of CD83 expression for NLT Tregs has not yet been elucidated. The present study explores for the first time the role of CD83 expression by lung‐resident Tregs in the steady state and during asthma to understand its importance in barrier tissues. We evaluated the effect of Treg‐specific CD83 deletion (CD83cKO) on the lung‐resident T‐cell compartment and cytokine profile. CD83‐deficient lung Tregs are less differentiated but more activated, resulting in unrestrained T‐cell activation. Further, CD83cKO mice were challenged in an asthma model and showed an accelerated disease progression, driven by Th2‐biased T‐cell responses. CD83cKO Tregs exhibited enhanced responsiveness to IL‐4, leading to insufficient control of Th2‐differentiation from naïve T cells. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CD83 in the NLT‐Treg‐mediated modulation of Th2 responses. Overall, our results highlight CD83 as a key player in tissue homeostasis and inflammatory responses, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for inflammatory disorders such as asthma.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have revolutionized cancer research by offering three-dimensional models that retain the genetic and architectural features of primary tumors. The integration of invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells into PDO platforms presents an innovative approach for studying immune–tumor dynamics and advancing cancer immunotherapy. iNKT cells, known for their ability to modulate immune responses and target tumors, face challenges in suppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs), which limit their therapeutic potential. PDOs provide a physiologically relevant platform to explore strategies to counteract TME-induced immunosuppression, such as modulating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), or tumor metabolism. Additionally, PDOs enable the testing of combination therapies, including iNKT cell-based treatments and immune checkpoint inhibitors, to amplify anti-tumor efficacy. While the integration of iNKT cells with PDOs remains underexplored, ongoing advancements in multi-omics, imaging, and automation technologies promise to enhance this approach, paving the way for personalized cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="In the realm of oncology, the tumor microenvironment (TME)—comprising extracellular matrix components, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells—plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, progression, and response to therapeutic interventions. Initially, the TME exhibits tumor-suppressive properties that can inhibit malignant transformation. However, as the tumor progresses, various factors induce immune tolerance, resulting in TME behaving in a state that promotes tumor growth and metastasis in later stages. This state of immunosuppression is crucial as it enables TME to change from a role of killing tumor cells to a role of promoting tumor progression. Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract with an alarmingly high mortality rate. While chemotherapy has historically been the cornerstone of treatment, its efficacy in prolonging survival remains limited. The emergence of immunotherapy has opened new therapeutic pathways, yet the challenge of immune tolerance driven by the gastric cancer microenvironment complicates these efforts. This review aims to elucidate the intricate role of the TME in mediating immune tolerance in gastric cancer and to spotlight innovative strategies and clinical trials designed to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches. By providing a comprehensive theoretical framework, this review seeks to advance the understanding and application of immunotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with increased rates of severe disease, hospitalization, and death in elderly individuals. Clearance of RSV is frequently delayed within this demographic, contributing to the more severe disease course. Geriatric cotton rats mimic this prolonged clearance kinetic and serve as a useful animal model for studying age-associated immunological deficits during RSV infection. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen restores RSV clearance, indicating that inflammation contributes to impaired clearance in geriatric cotton rats. Here, we further characterize a compromised immune response in geriatric cotton rats and identify an inflammatory pathway that contributes to this deficiency. Dendritic cell (DC) activation and migration to mediastinal lymph nodes are decreased during early infection in geriatric cotton rats, resulting in delayed generation of cytotoxic T cells and virus clearance. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which reduces DC migration through the elevation of D-type prostanoid 1 receptor (DP1 receptor), is elevated in the airways of infected geriatric cotton rats. Reducing PGD2 production by inhibiting COX-2 or PGD2 synthase improves RSV clearance kinetics through DC activation and RSV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in geriatric cotton rats, whereas activation of DP1 receptor through an agonist resulted in delayed viral clearance in adult cotton rats. These results indicate that PGD2 contributes to delayed antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell responses to RSV in geriatric cotton rats. Inhibiting PGD2 generation or signaling may be a useful mechanism of therapeutic intervention in elderly individuals. IMPORTANCE Elderly adults are at increased risk of severe disease resulting from infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), characterized in part by delayed clearance (removal of the virus from airways). Understanding the immunological factors that lead to this delayed clearance may allow for the development of therapies to improve disease outcomes in elderly individuals infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Here, we describe an inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats, the preferred small animal laboratory model for RSV, that impairs the generation of an effective immune response. We show that inhibiting this inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats improves immune parameters and speeds clearance of RSV. These results contribute to our understanding of delayed RSV clearance in elderly individuals with possible applications for improving immune responses to RSV in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Some patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) despite programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. To address the mechanism of ICI resistance in PD-L1-positive NSCLC, we investigated the role of tumor-cell-intrinsic function of PD-L1 in interleukin (IL)-6-mediated immunosuppression.


METHODS
Cohorts of NSCLC patients treated with ICI and public datasets were analyzed. PD-L1-overexpressing and PD-L1-knockdown NSCLC cells were submitted to RNA-seq, in vitro analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR, CUT&Tag, and biochemical assays. Human myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were co-cultured with NSCLC cells and then assessed for their immunosuppressive activity on T-cells. Mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells with PD-L1 overexpression or knockdown were subcutaneously injected into wild-type or PD-1-knockout C57BL/6 mice in the presence of IL-6 and/or PD-1 blockade.


RESULTS
In the ICI cohort with RNA-seq data, the IL-6/Jak/Stat3 pathway was enriched, and IL-6 expression was higher in patients with PD-L1-high NSCLCs who did not respond to ICIs. In another cohort, a higher baseline serum IL-6 level was associated with poor clinical outcomes after ICI therapy. IL-6 expression and the IL-6/Jak/Stat3 pathway were enhanced in PD-L1-high NSCLCs in the ICI cohorts and The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis. IL-6 expression correlated positively with tumor-infiltrating MDSCs in NSCLCs. In NSCLC cells, PD-L1 activated Jak2/Stat3 signaling by binding to and inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B. PD-L1 also bound to p-Stat3 in the nucleus, thus promoting the activity of p-Stat3 in the transcription of several cytokines (IL-6, TGF-β, TNF-α, IL-1β) and chemokines. PD-L1-overexpressing NSCLC cells enhanced the migration and immunosuppressive activity of human MDSCs in vitro, mediated by IL-6 and CXCL1. In both wild-type and PD-1-knockout mice, PD-L1-overexpressing LLC tumors were infiltrated by increased MDSCs with high immunosuppressive function, increased Tregs, and decreased granzyme B+ or IFNγ+ CD8 T-cells. These responses were mediated by IL-6 secreted from PD-L1-overexpressing tumor cells. Combined blockade of PD-1 and IL-6 was effective in tumor control and decreased MDSCs while increasing granzyme B+ or IFNγ+ CD8 T-cells.


CONCLUSIONS
The tumor-cell-intrinsic function of PD-L1 drives immunosuppression and tumor progression through the PD-L1/Jak/Stat3/IL-6/MDSC axis. This pathway represents a potential therapeutic target to improve ICI efficacy in PD-L1-high NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer is considered immunologically "cold", with low mutational burden, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and PD-L1 levels, culminating in poor response to immune checkpoint therapies. Bispecific CD3 redirection antibodies can elicit T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and hold promise for immune cell recruitment into prostate tumors. CD3 redirection antibodies in solid tumors are still in early phases of clinical development, and it is not yet understood whether these potential therapies will achieve the high response rates observed in hematological malignancies or result in durable T cell responses. Here we demonstrated that treatment with a PSMA targeted CD3 redirector resulted in efficacy against LnCaP.AR human prostate xenografts in CD34+ cord blood humanized mice. Efficacy correlated with T cell infiltration into tumors with an activated phenotype, but also increased PD-L1 expression. Engineered overexpression of PD-L1 in LNCaP.AR tumors resulted in resistance to PSMAxCD3 bispecific antibody treatment, whereas sensitivity was restored in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. PSMAxCD3 and anti-PD-1 combination treatment resulted in complete tumor responses in approximately 20% of mice, and elicited immune responses that delayed growth of rechallenged tumors. In a second prostate model, patient derived LuCaP 86.2 xenografts, PSMAxCD3 monotherapy treatment resulted in complete responses in 25% of mice. When PSMAxCD3-treated responder mice were rechallenged with LuCaP 86.2 tumors, partial control of tumor regrowth was associated with expansion of effector memory T cells. These studies show that PSMAxCD3 treatment elicits antitumor memory T cell responses, and that combination with PD-1 blockade can enhance these effects in tumors with immune suppressive tumor microenvironments.">

        <tr id="CAR T cells therapies have demonstrated success in treating hematologic malignancies, but have proven less effective in eradicating solid tumors. While suppressive immune cells may contribute to reduced CAR T cell efficacies in malignant masses, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are also believed to facilitate tumor survival by secreting growth factors, immunosuppressive cytokines, and extracellular matrix components that inhibit drug and immune cell filtration and facilitate metastasis. In an effort to eliminate both CAFs and cancer cells simultaneously, we have employed a universal CAR T cell that can attack both cell types when supplemented with appropriate bispecific adapters. We show here that tumor regression is indeed enhanced when CAR T cells are directed to concurrently kill both cancer cells and CAFs. We further demonstrate that simultaneous targeting of both cell types enhances CAR T cell proliferation, activation, tumor infiltration, and tumor distribution relative to targeting only a single cell type. Because all of these benefits are achieved in both cold and hot tumors without significant toxicity, we conclude that use of a universal CAR T cell in combination with multiple bispecific adapters can provide a safe, potent, cost-effective, and scalable alternative to the treatment of solid tumors with conventional CAR T cells.">

        <tr id="PD-1 pathway inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy. However, most patients do not durably benefit, highlighting the need for biomarkers to stratify patients as responders or non-responders. While CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been associated with immune checkpoint therapy response, there is not a consensus on which CD8+ TIL subpopulations have the most prognostic value. Preclinical studies have focused on progenitor-like exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX), since TPEX proliferate more in response to PD-1 inhibitors than other exhausted T cell (TEX) subpopulations. However, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment drives TPEX differentiation into other TEX populations that can mediate anti-tumor immunity. These data complicate the ability to identify prognostically important T cell populations in patients that predict ICI treatment response. In this study, we found that advanced melanoma patients with ≥20% of CD8+ TILs co-expressing PD-1 and CTLA-4 (termed CPHi TILs) had better objective response rates and survival following PD-1 monotherapy than those below this threshold. Characterization of the CPHi TIL subset using bulk and single cell RNA sequencing showed that while TPEX-like cells were present within the CPHi subset, they were in the minority of these cells. Rather, the CPHi population was numerically dominated by other subsets, including cycling, terminally exhausted, cytotoxic-like, and/or resident memory-like TEX populations, and a subset enriched for glycolytic genes. Collectively, these data show that CPHi TILs correlate with response in melanoma, but this TIL subset is a heterogenous mix of different subpopulations that may differentially contribute to anti-tumor immunity following checkpoint blockade.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy is one of the most promising approaches for cancer management, as it utilizes the intrinsic immune response to target cancer cells. Normally, the human body uses its immune system as a defense mechanism to detect and eliminate foreign objects, including cancer cells. However, cancers develop a ‘switch off’ mechanism, known as immune checkpoint proteins, to evade immune surveillance and suppress immune activation. Therefore, significant efforts have been made to develop the strategies for stimulating immune responses against cancers. Among these, the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) to enhance the anti-tumor immune response has emerged as a particularly promising approach in cancer management. EVs possess several unique properties that elevate the potency in modulating immune responses. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in this field, focusing on the strategic usage of EVs to overcome tumor-induced immune tolerance. We discuss the biogenesis and characteristics of EVs, as well as their potential applications in medical contexts. The immune mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment and the strategies employed by cancers to evade immune detection are explored. The roles of EVs in regulating the tumor microenvironment and enhancing immune responses for immunotherapy are also highlighted. Additionally, this article addresses the challenges and future directions for the development of EV-based nanomedicine approaches, aiming to improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes with greater precision and efficacy while minimizing off-target effects.">

 In the past decade, T-cell based immunotherapies have grown to become some of the most promising treatments for cancer. Following the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors, other T-cell based therapies emerged including CAR-T cells and bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs). BiTEs have the unique ability to crosslink T cells and tumor cells independently of MHC restriction. They do not rely on TCR specificity or the CD4+/CD8+ costimulatory molecules, overcoming tumor MHC downregulation and low-affinity TCR binding. However, like many other immunotherapies, BiTEs have shown limited success beyond the treatment of hematological malignancies. BiTEs for the treatment of solid tumors still face challenges. Studies in gastrointestinal tumors have revealed Fc toxicity, short half-lives, and immunotoxicity, leading to Fc-silenced half-life extended BiTEs with humanized single-chain variable fragments. Studies in prostate tumors, lung tumors, and malignant gliomas have identified promising targets in PSMA, DLL3, and EGFRvIII, respectively, but also highlighted the problems of on-target off-tumor and BiTE-specific toxicities and inaccessible and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. Ongoing research to overcome these limitations remains an interesting field to follow, as BiTEs have the potential to be a powerful tool, especially when used in combination with other immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that poses a severe threat to human health. A variety of highly immunogenic tuberculosis proteins have been used as targets in vaccine development to mitigate the spread of TB. Although Th1-type immunity has long been considered a crucial part of resistance to Mtb, γδ T cells, the predominant source of IL-17, are not negligible in controlling the early stages of TB infection. In addition to classical phosphoantigens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat-resistant antigens (HAg), a complex containing 564 proteins obtained from live tuberculosis bacteria after heat treatment at 121 °C for 20 min, have been confirmed to be highly effective γδ T cell stimulators as well. Several studies have demonstrated that HAg-activated γδ T cells can participate in TB immunity by secreting multiple cytokines against Mtb or by interacting with other innate immune cells. In this review, we present a possible mechanism of HAg stimulation of γδ T cells and the role of HAg-activated γδ T cells in anti-TB immunity. We also highlight the limitations of studies on HAg activation of γδ T cells and suggest further research directions on the relationship between HAg and γδ T cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The occurrence of inflammation subsequent to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with an elevated risk of transplant‐related mortality (TRM). However, the duration of inflammation and the potential efficacy of anti‐inflammatory agents in reducing TRM remain uncertain. We performed a comprehensive investigation to examine the post‐transplantation alterations of inflammatory mediators and to ascertain the correlation between inflammation level and TRM through the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, ELISAs and cytometric bead array. The findings revealed that the 30‐day interval following transplantation is characterised by the most pronounced inflammatory response in both human and murine subjects, thereby elevating the risk of TRM. The inflammation is primarily caused by myeloid bias during haematopoietic reconstitution, which is a commonly overlooked aspect in clinical transplantation, additionally, a lesser extent of irradiation‐induced injury. The administration of the anti‐inflammatory agent resveratrol has the potential to reduce systemic inflammation and TRM by suppressing the NOD‐like receptor signalling pathway and slowing down granulocyte implantation in HSCT mice. This approach did not impair the differentiation potential of haematopoietic stem cells. These findings demonstrate that the 30‐day post‐transplant period represents an opportunity to facilitate HSCT colonisation, mitigate transplant‐related adverse effects, and potentially reap the benefits of anti‐inflammatory treatments.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells are pivotal in maintaining self-tolerance and controlling immune responses. In this study, we investigated potential Treg cell epitopes in human α-tubulin that were selected in silico for their promiscuous binding to class II human leukocyte antigens and full identity with antigens from enteric nematodes present in excretory-secretory products. We identified five Treg cell epitopes in α-tubulin that were capable of stimulating and expanding IL-10 and TGF-β-producing Foxp3+ Treg cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We also proved that a peptide pool containing the identified Treg cell epitopes (αTBL pool) suppressed the T cell responses elicited by different stimuli, including LPS, and class I and class II restricted T cell epitopes, as determined by intracellular cytokine staining assays. Similarly, this same peptide pool was able to suppress T cell responses in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Finally, we found that stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells with autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells in the presence of the αTBL pool promoted the differentiation of functional CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ T cells capable of suppressing the proliferation of CD3/CD28-activated T cells. α-tubulin Treg cell epitopes could be useful for treating autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases by inducing Treg cells and, given the ubiquitous and copious expression of α-tubulin, enable a general mechanism of immune homeostasis.">

Systemic administration of allogenic EVs derived from epithelial and mesenchymal cells has been shown to be safe, despite carrying an array of functional molecules, including thousands of proteins. To address whether epithelial cell-derived EVs can be modified to acquire the capacity to induce an immune response, we engineered 293T EVs to harbor the immunomodulatory molecules CD80, OX40L, and PD-L1. We demonstrated abundant levels of these proteins in the engineered cells and EVs. Functionally, the engineered EVs efficiently elicited positive and negative costimulation of human and murine T cells. In the setting of cancer and autoimmune hepatitis, the engineered EVs modulated T cell functions and altered disease progression. OX40L EVs also provided enhanced antitumor activity in combination with anti-CTLA-4 in melanoma-bearing mice. In addition, we added multiple immunomodulatory proteins in EVs (EVmIM), attempting to elicit an immune response in both lymphoid and myeloid compartments. The EVmIM containing CD80, 4-1BBL, CD40L, CD2, and CD32 engaged both T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) in melanoma tumors, demonstrating the capacity for EVmIM to elicit antitumor activity. Our work provides evidence that EVs can be engineered to induce specific immune responses with translational potential to modulate immune cell functions in pathological settings.">

        <tr id="The lung is continuously exposed to pathogens and other noxious environmental stimuli, rendering it vulnerable to damage, dysfunction, and the development of disease. Studies utilizing mouse models of respiratory infection, allergy, fibrosis, and cancer have been critical to reveal mechanisms of disease progression and identify therapeutic targets. However, most studies focused on the mouse lung prioritize the isolation of either immune cells or epithelial cells, rather than both populations concurrently. Here, we describe a method for preparing a comprehensive single-cell suspension of both immune and non-immune populations suitable for flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These populations include epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and a variety of myeloid cell subsets. This protocol entails bronchoalveolar lavage and subsequent inflation of the lungs with dispase. Lungs are then digested in a liberase mixture. This method of processing liberates a variety of diverse cell types and results in a single-cell suspension that does not require manual dissociation against a filter, promoting cell survival and yielding high numbers of live cells for downstream analyses. In this protocol, we also define gating schemes for epithelial and myeloid cell subsets in both naïve and influenza-infected lungs. Simultaneous isolation of live immune and non-immune cells is key for interrogating intercellular crosstalk and gaining a deeper understanding of lung biology in health and disease.">

        <tr id="As the prospect of engineering primary B‐cells for cellular therapies in cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases grows, there is an increasing demand for robust in vitro culture systems that effectively activate human B‐cells isolated from peripheral blood for consistent and efficient expansion and differentiation into various effector phenotypes. Feeder cell‐based systems have shown promise in providing long‐term signaling for expanding B‐cells in vitro. However, these co‐culture systems necessitate more rigorous downstream processing to prevent various feeder cell‐related contaminations in the final product, which limits their clinical potential. In this study, we introduce a microbead‐based CD40L‐presentation platform for stable and consistent activation of human naïve B‐cells. By employing a completely synthetic in vitro culture approach integrating B‐cell receptor, CD21 co‐receptor, toll‐like receptor (TLR‐9), and cytokine signals, we demonstrate that naïve B‐cells can differentiate into memory B‐cells (IgD‐CD38‐/lo + CD27+) and antibody‐secreting cells (IgD‐CD38++CD27+). During this process, B‐cells underwent up to a 50‐fold expansion, accompanied by isotype class switching and low levels of somatic hypermutation, mimicking physiological events within the germinal center. The reproducible generation of highly expanded and differentiated effector B‐cells from naïve B‐cells of multiple donors positions this feeder‐free in vitro synthetic niche as a promising platform for large‐scale production of effector B‐cell therapeutics.">

        <tr id="During tumor immunosurveillance, leukocytes play a crucial role in the cellular defense system, working collaboratively with other immune components to recognize and eliminate aberrant cells. Integral to this process is the integrin Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen 1 (LFA-1). LFA-1 facilitates adhesion during leukocyte migration and helps establish stable cell-to-cell contacts between leukocytes and their targets. Additionally, as a receptor, LFA-1 signaling activates leukocytes, promoting their differentiation and effector functions against cancer. However, tumors can develop mechanisms to evade immune clearance by disrupting LFA-1 functions or hijacking its pathways. In this review, we first detail how leukocytes utilize LFA-1 during immunosurveillance and then explore how tumors counteract this process in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by either altering LFA-1 functions or exploiting it to drive tumorigenesis. Moreover, we discuss therapeutic strategies targeting LFA-1, including inhibitors tested in laboratory studies and animal models, highlighting their potential as anticancer interventions and the need for further research to evaluate their clinical utility.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT MAIT cells are one of the largest unconventional T cell populations and, recruited to the site of infection, play both protective and pathogenic roles during pulmonary viral infections. MAIT cell activation patterns change significantly during COVID‐19, with a notable decrease in their frequency in peripheral blood of severe cases. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiles of various immune checkpoint pathways on MAIT, MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells in moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients undergoing cytokine storm. Despite numerous studies comparing MAIT cell characteristics based on COVID‐19 disease severity, none have delved into the critical differences in MAIT cell immune checkpoint profiles between moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients, all experiencing a cytokine storm. Flow cytometry was used to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 35 patients, comprising 18 moderate and 17 severe cases, alongside 14 healthy controls. Our investigation specifically focuses on severe COVID‐19 presentations, revealing a marked deletion of MAIT cells. Further exploration into the regulatory dynamics of MAIT cell functionality reveals shifts in the expression profiles of critical immune checkpoint receptors, notably PD‐1 and CD226. In severe COVID‐19 patients, MAIT cells showed a significant decrease in the expression of CD226, whereas MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of PD‐1 compared to healthy individuals. The expression of the TIGIT receptor remained unaltered across all investigated groups. Our findings contribute to the existing knowledge by elucidating the changes in MAIT cell subpopulations and their potential role in COVID‐19 disease severity.">

        <tr id="Memory T cells are critical for secondary immunity against pathogens, yet their persistence in the absence of antigen remains unclear. While memory CD8+ T cells are known to persist independently of their cognate antigen, the durability of memory CD4+ T cells in the absence of antigen remains controversial. Recovery from cutaneous leishmaniasis confers lifelong immunity, largely mediated by CD4+ T cells, but the necessity of persistent parasites for sustaining this immunity has not been empirically confirmed. We investigated immunity in mice infected with a dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts)-deficient Leishmania major, which cannot persist due to their thymidine salvage deficiency. These mice lost protection against wild-type challenge, correlating with a decline in Leishmania (PEPCK)-specific CD4+ T cells. To further dissect this relationship, we generated PEPCK-specific CD4+ TCR transgenic (PEG) mice, enabling precise tracking of Leishmania-specific memory CD4+ T cells. Both in vitro and in vivo-generated memory PEG cells gradually disappeared over time in the absence of antigen, irrespective of the host’s MHC II status, and this loss paralleled the erosion of infection-induced immunity. PEG and endogenous PEPCK-specific memory cells were not maintained in mice infected with dhfr-ts- or PEPCK-deficient L. major, resulting in loss of recall responses and secondary immunity. These findings demonstrate that continuous antigen presence is crucial for maintaining Leishmania-specific memory CD4+ T cells and highlight the role of persistent antigen in sustaining long-term immunity against chronic infections.">

HLA-edited PCOs (ePCOs) displayed the same phenotypical and functional characteristics as parental un-edited PCOs. Despite minimal off-target edits, single-molecule DNA-sequencing demonstrated that ePCOs and PCOs acquire substantial mutations in culture at similar rates but without evident selection for cancer-driver mutations. ePCOs induced reduced T cell-mediated immunity and a donor-dependent NK cell cytotoxicity in vitro and evaded cytotoxic responses with increased graft survival in humanized mice in vivo.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has brought hope for patients with cancer and showed promising results and a high cure rate in various types of hematological malignancies. However, cellular therapy can lead to profound immunodeficiency of the innate and adaptive immune systems, whether at the systemic or at the local cellular immune response, which is a major predisposing risk factor for invasive opportunistic infection, including fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogens. The role of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and their antigen specificity in humans remains largely unknown, but Tregs have been implicated in a wide range of modulating viral and fungal infections. Though there have been many advancements regarding the use of CAR T-cells in treating hematological malignancies, the intricate and homeostatic role of Tregs in influencing therapeutic outcomes and infection risk remains underexplored. Most published literature on this topic focuses on the role of Treg in the immunosuppression necessary for successful CAR T-cell therapy rather than the dual function of Treg in immunosuppression and immune recovery. We intend to bridge this gap with a specific focus on the contribution of Tregs in the modulation of CAR T-cell efficacy and their role in opportunistic infections after therapy. In this review, we described the potential role and dynamics of Tregs following CAR T-cell therapy, offering an expanded understanding of their impact on patient outcomes and highlighting areas for future research.">

 Background:
 Recent studies indicate that the efficacy of chemotherapy is significantly influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment. Peritoneal cavity contains many immune cells, however, the relationship between immune response within the peritoneal cavity and tumor response remains poorly understood.
 Methods:
 Single cell suspensions were obtained from ascites or peritoneal lavages from 41 patients with PM from GC. In 28 patients, cells were collected both before and after 1-3 courses of IP chemotherapy. These samples were immunestained with mAbs targeting to specific lymphoid or myeloid subsets, and their proportions in CD45(+) leukocytes were analyzed using flowcytometry. Eosinophils were purified by magnetic cell sorting for subsequent RNA-Seq analysis.
 Results:
 Among 41 patients with PM, tumor leukocyte ratio (TLR) calculated as CD326(+) tumor cells divided by CD45(+) leukocytes varied from 0.002% to 58.1%. TLR was not correlated with any ratios of immune cells, however, the ratios of CD8(+) T cells, NK cells and CD16(-) CD193(+) eosinophils tended to decrease with the increase in TLR. Conversely, the ratios of CD19(+) B cell, CD14(+) macrophages and CD16(+) neutrophils increased with elevated TLR. Mean survival time of these patients was 17.7 months. None of the leukocyte subsets showed significant association with patient outcome. In 28 patients, the ratios of lymphocytes mostly decreased with significant difference in CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells after IP treatment. In contrast, the ratio of CD11b(+) myeloid cells increased in peritoneal cavity after IP treatment. Among the myeloid cells, the ratio of CD16(-) CD193(+) eosinophils significantly increased. The change was particularly prominent in in post-treatment negative peritoneal lavage cytology (CY0) patients (M=0.47% vs M=10.0%, p<0.0001), while the difference was not significant in post-treatment positive peritoneal lavage cytology (CY1) patients (M=0.93% vs M=0.97%, p=0.84). Patients with eosinophil ratio of ≥2% after IP chemotherapy in peritoneal cavity had significantly longer overall survival compared to those with lower eosinophil ratios (17.3 mo vs 26.7 mo, p=0.034; HR =0.23[0.06-0.89]). The peritoneal eosinophils after IP treatment exhibited elevated levels of CD11b and CD63 expression compared to circulating eosinophils (p<0.01), while SSC-A levels tended to be lower. Gene ontology pathways revealed enrichment of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, extracellular matrix organization and response to interferon-gamma in peritoneal eosinophils (p<0.0001).
 Conclusions:
 IP-PTX induces eosinophil activation and recruitment in the peritoneal cavity, while also affecting other types of immune cells. These effects may potentially contribute to the anti-tumor response against peritoneal metastases.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Statins, a class of HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors, exhibit prophylactic benefits against immune rejection induced by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo‐HSCT). Despite the protective function is confirmed, the precise mechanism to induce immune tolerance of statin in the initial stages of transplantation remains incompletely understood. Given that Treg cells play a critical role in preventing graft versus host response and Foxp3 as a transcription factor of Treg can be induced by statins, we hypothesize that the immunosuppressive effects of statins are partially mediated through regulation of Treg cells expansion. Methods T cells were stimulated in vitro under anti‐CD3/anti‐CD28/IL‐2/TGF‐β condition or allo‐reactive system with or without the addition of statins. The induction of Tregs were detected using flow cytometry. Allo‐HSCT models were established by transferring donor cells alone or combined with recipient treated by fluvastatin. The proportions of Treg and phenotypes of effector T cells were identified. Cytokine secretion and antigen‐presenting cell (APC) function were tested in irradiated mice. Results Statins induced higher Treg production in classical and allogeneic cell co‐culture conditions in vitro. In the early stage of models treated with fluvastatin only in donors or combined treatment of donors and recipients, a similar phenomenon was observed with elevated levels of Foxp3+ Treg along with increased expression of CCR7, CD62L, and S1P1 on allo‐reactive T cells. Fluvastatin treatment suppressed the secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines IFN‐γ and TNF‐α by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in irradiated mice. Furthermore, fluvastatin also contributed to restraining the numbers and activation of APCs, including dentritic cells (DCs) and macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Our finding demonstrated that statin exposure modulates immune responses during the initial phase of allo‐HSCT by promoting Treg expansion and suppressing inflammatory reactions, which supply a promising strategy for aGVHD prevention.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Although repeated exposure to HIV‐1 can result in infection, some individuals remain seronegative without clinical or serologic evidence of infection; these individuals are known as HIV‐1‐exposed seronegative individuals. This population has been extensively studied to understand the mechanisms associated with natural resistance to HIV infection. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain this resistance: some researchers associated resistance with a low activation phenotype characterized by a decrease in the activation and proliferation of immune system cells linked with infection control and decreased production of cytokines and pro‐inflammatory molecules, whereas others suggest that resistance is related to immune system activation and the expression of high levels of chemokines, pro‐inflammatory cytokines and antiviral molecules. Aims Our study aims to review and analyze the most relevant evidence supporting the role of the activation level of the immune system during natural resistance to HIV‐1 infection. Methods A search was conducted via the PubMed, SciELO and ScienceDirect databases. The literature search was performed in a nonsystematic manner. Articles published in the last five decades addressing immune activation mechanisms in natural resistance to HIV were reviewed. Results A low‐activation phenotype, characterized by a high frequency of Treg cells; reduced expression of CD25, CD38, and HLA‐DR; and lower production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in peripheral and mucosal tissues, plays a key role in reducing the number of activated cells susceptible to infection, but it minimizes chronic inflammation, facilitating viral entry and spread. In contrast, the activation phenotype is associated with high expression of markers such as CD25, CD38, and HLA‐DR, along with elevated high levels of interferon‐stimulated genes and pro‐inflammatory cytokines. This profile could promote infection control while increasing the number of virus‐susceptible cells. Conclusion The complexity of the immune response during HIV exposure, reflected in the conflicting evidence concerning whether low or high immune activation offers protection against infection, suggests that there may be multiple pathways to HIV‐1 resistance, influenced by factors such as the type of viral exposure, the immune environment, and individual genetics. Further research is needed to determine which immune states are protective and how these responses can be modulated to prevent infection.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The asymptomatic progression of early-stage HCC often results in diagnosis at advanced stages, significantly limiting therapeutic options and worsening prognosis. Immunotherapy, with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) at the forefront, has revolutionized HCC treatment. Nevertheless, tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and the presence of immunosuppressive components within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) continue to compromise its efficacy. Furthermore, resistance or non-responsiveness to ICIs in some patients underscores the urgent need to unravel the complexities of the TIME and to design innovative strategies that enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes. Emerging evidence has revealed the pivotal role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a prominent RNA methylation modification, in shaping the TIME in HCC. By regulating RNA stability and translation, m6A influences immune-related factors, including cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules. This modification governs PD-L1 expression, facilitating immune escape and contributing to resistance against ICIs. Advances in this field have also identified m6A-related regulators as promising biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy response and as potential therapeutic targets for optimizing treatment efficacy. This review examines the regulatory mechanisms of m6A modification within the TIME of HCC, with a focus on its impact on immune cells and cytokine dynamics. It also explores the therapeutic potential of targeting m6A pathways to improve immunotherapy efficacy and outlines emerging directions for future research. These insights aim to provide a foundation for developing novel strategies to overcome immune resistance and advance HCC treatment.">

        <tr id="Purpose Conjunctival-resident γδT cells, the predominant ocular source of interleukin-17A (IL-17A), play crucial roles in dry eye disease (DED) pathogenesis. The upstream regulators of these cells are unknown. This study evaluated the role of conjunctival IL-23 expression in mediating γδT cell generation and elucidated its contribution to dry eye inflammatory responses. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to identify and quantify conjunctival mRNA molecules in γδT cells in mice. The IL-23 level increased in wild-type (WT) and decreased in γδT-deficient (TCRδ–/–) mice after dry eye was induced via an intelligently controlled environmental system (ICES). Flow cytometry and transcriptome sequencing were used to investigate the impact of the changes in IL-23 expression on human γδT cells. Results The expression of the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) was greater in γδT cells than in other conjunctival cell types, such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and epithelial cells. An increase in IL-23 led to an increase in γδT cell density, which was proportional to dry eye severity. However, in the TCRδ–/– mice, the upregulation of IL-23 failed to increase the expression level of IL-17A and the severity of dry eye. Furthermore, increases in the expression of IL-23 and the number of γδT cells were evident in the ocular surface cells of patients who developed visual display terminal syndrome. Conclusions An increase in conjunctival IL-23 expression contributes to the induction of the DED inflammatory response through interactions with its cognate receptor on γδT cells and the promotion of their proliferation. The findings of this study suggest that the suppression of IL-17A through the blockade of IL-23R activation may be a viable target for improving the management of inflammation in DED patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The first evidence that Orthopoxvirus induced the expansion in vivo and the recall of effector innate Vδ2 T-cells was described in a macaque model. Although, an engagement of αβ T-cells specific response in patients infected with human monkeypox (Mpox) was demonstrated, little is known about the role of γδ T-cells during Mpox infection. IFN-γ-producing γδ T-cells in the resistance to poxviruses may a key role in inducing a protective type 1 memory immunity. We analyzed the kinetics of Vδ2 T-cell response from the acute phase up to three months after Mpox infection. Fourteen MSM subjects (5 PWH, 35.7%) were enrolled in a longitudinal study from May to July 2022. Blood samples were collected in the early phase of infection (T1, T2) and at 3 months (T3M) post-symptom onset. Vδ2 T-cell profiles (CD45RA/CCR7), activation/exhaustion markers (CD38/HLA-DR/CD57/PD-1/TIM-3), cytokine production (IFN-γ/TNF-α) and CD107a expression were assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry. Ten healthy donors (HD) were used as a control group. At T1, Vδ2 T-cell frequency of patients decreased, and effector memory Vδ2 T-cells increased with respect to HD. Activation/exhaustion markers were higher than HD. Vδ2 functionality decreased at T1 related to HD, and it was associated with CD38 and HLA-DR higher expression as well as TIM-3. Vδ2 T-cells restored their profile at T3M. The presence of effector/activated Vδ2 T-cells in the early stages of Mpox infection and their capability to activate quickly, producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, may be useful to enhance the early adaptive response to human Mpox, maintaining a protective memory/effector T-cell response.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Lung cancer is among the most common and deadliest malignant tumors worldwide. It is often detected at late stages, resulting in unfavorable outcomes, with tumor cell heterogeneity and medication resistance. Tumor‐associated macrophages are among the key cells contributing to cancer progression. They are categorized into two primary phenotypes: Proinflammatory (M1) and anti‐inflammatory (M2) which are involved in the onset and progression of NSCLC. The role of common cytokines secreted by macrophages in the progression of lung cancer are described, and the effects of various substances such as RNA or protein on the differentiation and polarization of two phenotypes of macrophages are highlighted to characterize the impact of the immune state of tumors on therapeutic effect of treatments and patient prognosis. Researchers have primarily aimed to investigate innovative carriers and strategies based on macrophages to modify the tumor microenvironment. Objectives These approaches are often integrated with other treatments, particularly immunotherapy, to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Methods A comprehensive review was carried out by systematically synthesizing existing literature on PubMed, using the combination of the keywords “TAMs”, “NSCLC”, “Drug resistance”, and “therapy”. The available studies were screened for selection based on quality and relevance. Conclusions TAMs promote tumor invasion, growth, and metastasis by promoting angiogenesis and EMT. In addition, they contribute to the development of drug resistance and the immunosuppressive microenvironment establishment. The immunosuppressive factors secreted by TAM can weaken the activity of immune cells, inhibit their killing effect on tumors, leading to immune suppression and hindering the effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, TAM is a key target for the development of cancer immunotherapy. Various strategies are being explored, including reducing the recruitment of TAMs and influencing their polarization to treat NSCLC. In addition, TAMs based treatment systems can achieve precise delivery of drugs or gene interfering molecules without causing side effects.">

        <tr id="
 A major hurdle in treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is a lack of response (primary resistance) and relapse after an initial response (acquired resistance). Recent studies reveal that responses to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade are associated with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, and high baseline PD-L1 expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME), while impaired tumor antigen presentation and the immunosuppressive TME have been associated with ICB resistance. Numerous studies have established that the generation of an anti-tumor immune response driven by CD8+ T cells requires type I conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) mediated cross presentation of tumor associated antigens, which can license CD8+ T cells to initiate an anti-tumor immune response. In addition, previous publications have shown that systemic administration of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) cytokine can expand endogenous cDC1s in the TME and augment anti-tumor immune responses to ICB therapy. Considering these data, we hypothesize that a viable approach to overcome NSCLC anti-PD-1 resistance is to intratumorally vaccinate tumors with Flt3l-gene modified cDC1s. Using lenti-viral transduction, we engineered murine CD103+ cDC1s to constitutively secrete FLT3L (FLT3L_cDC1) and performed in situ vaccination studies on murine models of NSCLC with Lkb1-deficiency and elevated TMB that better represents human disease. In situ vaccination with FLT3L_cDC1 promotes anti-tumor immune responses in NSCLC tumors that are non-responders to unmodified cDC1 vaccination and synergizes with anti-PD-1 ICB to significantly inhibit tumor growth. FLT3L_cDC1 therapy induces significant activation and expansion T cells within the TME at both an early and late timepoint post vaccination. Furthermore, FLT3L_cDC1 + anti-PD-1 combination therapy significantly increases DC progenitor numbers within the tumor draining lymph node, including DC progenitors that are committed to the cDC1 lineage. NSCLC tumor bearing mice cured following FLT3L_cDC1 + anti-PD-1 therapy independently reject rechallenge with the same NSCLC tumor model, suggesting that combination therapy promotes tumor-specific immune memory responses. Our data suggests in situ vaccination with FLT3L_cDC1 represents a promising strategy to potentiate the efficacy of ICB and can improve outcomes for patients with primary resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy.

        <tr id="Cancer remains a major challenge to global public health, with rising incidence and high mortality rates. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex system of immune cells, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix (ECM), and blood vessels that form a space conducive to cancer cell proliferation. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are abundant in tumors, and they drive immunosuppression through metabolic reprogramming in the TME. This review describes how metabolic pathways such as glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and adenosine metabolism have a significant impact on the function of MDSCs by regulating their immunosuppressive activity and promoting their survival and expansion in tumors. The review also explores key metabolic targets in MDSCs and strategies to modulate MDSC metabolism to improve the tumor immune microenvironment and enhance anti-tumor immune responses. Understanding these pathways can provide insight into potential therapeutic targets for modulating MDSC activity and improving outcomes of cancer immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Brain metastasis (BM) is a poor prognostic factor in cancer patients. Despite showing efficacy in many extracranial tumors, immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or anti-CTLA-4 mAb appears to be less effective against intracranial tumors. Promisingly, recent clinical studies have reported that combination therapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs has a potent antitumor effect on BM, highlighting the need to elucidate the detailed mechanisms controlling the intracranial tumor microenvironment (TME) to develop effective immunotherapeutic strategies. Here, we analyzed the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in murine models of BM that responded to anti-CTLA-4 mAb to anti-PD-1 mAb. Activated CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells with high CTLA-4 expression characteristically infiltrated the intracranial TME, which were activated by the combination anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 treatment. Loss of TFH cells suppressed the additive effect of CTLA-4 blockade on anti-PD-1 mAb. B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) produced by abundant myeloid cells, particularly CD80hiCD206lo pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages, in the intracranial TME, induced B cell and TFH cell infiltration and activation. Furthermore, the intracranial TME of patients with non-small cell lung cancer featured TFH and B cell infiltration as tertiary lymphoid structures. Together, these findings provide insights into the immune cell crosstalk in the intracranial TME that facilitates an additive anti-tumor effect of CTLA-4 blockade with anti-PD-1 treatment, supporting the potential of a combination immunotherapeutic strategy for BM.">

        <tr id="In the initial phase of infections, prior to the development of the follicular antibody response, an extrafollicular B cell response develops in lymphoid organs, with activation of cells displaying B cell receptors with low affinity to the different epitopes of the invading pathogen. To evaluate if this response allows early protection in the murine host, we investigated its role during infection with Sylvio X10/4 (a low virulence Trypanosoma cruzi parasite) of CD28KO mice, a mouse strain that does not develop a follicular antibody response, in parallel with infected C57BL/6 mice (used as control). We observed that T. cruzi infection allowed CD28KO mice to survive for a long period of time, ranging from a few weeks to almost a year. However, the CD28KO mice showed higher levels of subpatent parasitemia than C57BL/6 mice, as well as more intense and long-lasting inflammatory infiltrates in the heart. Following the CD28KO mice throughout the infection, we found a significant reduction in the number of CD8+ T cells in the spleen, but not CD4+ T cells, as well as a strong fluctuation in the number of B cells. Meanwhile, although the production of IFN-γ in the spleen was not affected by CD28 deficiency, a reduction in IL-2 production was observed in anti-CD3 stimulated CD4+ T cells from infected CD28KO mice. Regarding the humoral response, after confirming that the T follicular helper (TFH) cells and germinal center B cells (GC-B) were absent in the infected CD28KO mice, we demonstrated that the extrafollicular antibodies, present in CD28KO infected mice, allowed an early protection in the murine host, since the transfer of serum from chronic CD28KO mice to naïve CD28KO mice, which were infected with T. cruzi 24 hours later, promoted a significant reduction in parasitemia. These results demonstrate that low-affinity anti-T cruzi extrafollicular antibodies contribute to the control of circulating parasites, allowing Sylvio X10/4-infected CD28KO mice to survive for a long time.

        <tr id="Tumors often arise in chronically inflamed, and thus immunologically highly active niches. While immune cells are able to recognize and remove transformed cells, tumors eventually escape the control of the immune system by shaping their immediate microenvironment. In this context, macrophages are of major importance, as they initially exert anti-tumor functions before they adopt a tumor-associated phenotype that instead inhibits anti-tumor immune responses and even allows for sustaining a smoldering inflammatory, growth promoting tumor microenvironment (TME). Type I interferons (IFNs) are well established modulators of inflammatory reactions. While they have been shown to directly inhibit tumor growth, there is accumulating evidence that they also play an important role in altering immune cell functions within the TME. In the present review, we focus on the impact of type I IFNs on anti-tumor responses, driven by monocytes and macrophages. Specifically, we will provide an overview of tumor-intrinsic factors, which impinge on IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, like the presence of nucleic acids, metabolites, or hypoxia. We will further summarize the current understanding of the consequences of altered IFN responses on macrophage phenotypes, i.e., differentiation, polarization, and functions. For the latter, we will focus on macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing and phagocytosis, as well as on how macrophages affect their environment by secreting cytokines and directly interacting with immune cells. Finally, we will discuss how type I IFN responses in macrophages might affect and should be considered for current and future tumor therapies.">

        <tr id="Although significant progress has been made in cancer immunotherapy in recent years, its overall efficacy remains limited in a large number of patients. The interaction between the tumor microenvironment (TME) and CD8+ T cells is one of the core topics in cancer immunotherapy research. CD8+ T cells can play an anti-tumor role by recognizing and killing virus-infected or mutated cells. However, in the TME, as the tumor compresses immune cells, the function of them is impaired, and studies have found that relying on PD-1 alone is not enough to resist tumor cells. Therefore, by blocking the PD-1 and Tim-3 pathways to interfere with CD8+ T cell exhaustion (TEX), the performance of CD8+ T cells can be maximized, their survival period extended, and the efficacy of positive cancer immunotherapy improved. For patients with cancer who have failed to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy, multi-targeted combination therapy may achieve better results.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cells crucial for fighting infections, exhibit both tumor-promoting and tumor-inhibiting roles in cancer. This dual behavior depends on the environment around the tumor and includes remodeling the extracellular matrix, fostering angiogenesis, inducing cancer cell death, and enhancing immune responses. A notable yet underexplored phenomenon is the engulfment of neutrophils by cancer cells, potentially mediated by LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). This process raises critical questions about its role in either aiding immune evasion or triggering cancer cell death through mechanisms such as ferroptosis. This review delves into neutrophil biology, their complex roles in cancer, the impact of LAP on neutrophil engulfment, and the therapeutic implications of modulating this pathway. Additionally, it highlights the potential of neutrophils as delivery systems for cancer therapies, underscoring the need to unravel tumor-associated neutrophil functions and LAP mechanisms to inform novel and effective cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Trafficking of immune cells to the central nervous system is hypothesized to facilitate HIV entry and immune-induced neuronal injury and is mediated by surface proteins such as chemokine receptors and α4 integrin. We longitudinally assessed immune cell activation and surface marker expression in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood and their relationship with CSF HIV RNA beginning during primary HIV infection (PHI) before and after antiretroviral therapy (ART).Longitudinal paired blood and CSF were obtained in ART-naïve PHI (<12 month since infection) participants; some independently initiated ART during follow up. Multiparameter flow cytometry of fresh samples determined activation (% CD38+HLADR+) and chemokine receptor expression (% CCR5+ and CXCR3+) on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and subtype and α4 integrin expression (% and mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) of CD49d+) on monocytes. HIV RNA was quantified by PCR. Analyses employed Spearman correlation, within-subject correlation, and linear mixed models.51 participants enrolled at a median 3.2 months post HIV transmission with 168 total visits (113 pre-ART, 55 post-ART) and a median of 6.5 months of longitudinal follow up (range 0-40). In pre-ART PHI, frequencies of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were much higher in CSF than in blood, with levels similar to ART-naïve people with chronic HIV infection. Both CSF CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation increased longitudinally prior to initiation of ART. In multivariate analysis, CSF CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell activation independently predicted CSF HIV RNA. Neither CSF monocyte subtypes or α4 expression correlated with CSF HIV RNA. Blood monocyte α4 MFI correlated with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation (p<0.05). Following ART initiation, blood but not CSF T cell activation declined with days on treatment (slope=-0.06, p=0.001). During ART, blood and CSF monocyte α4 MFI correlated with T cell activation (p<0.05).In untreated early infection after PHI, immune activation increases over time, and CSF CD4+ T cell activation but not monocyte activation correlates with CSF HIV RNA. Intrathecal T cell activation does not decline during early follow up on ART. Immunomodulating therapies may be needed to prevent neuronal injury and HIV neuroinvasion during early HIV.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors contains myeloid cells that modulate local immune activity. STING signaling activation in these myeloid cells enhances local type I interferon (IFN) production, inducing an innate immune response that mobilizes adaptive immunity and reprograms immunosuppressive myeloid populations to drive antitumor immunity. Here, we generated TAK-500, an immune cell directed antibody drug conjugate (iADC), to deliver a STING agonist to CCR2+ human cells and drive enhanced antitumor activity relative to non-targeted STING agonists. Preclinically, TAK-500 triggered dose-dependent innate immune activation in vitro. In addition, a murine TAK-500 iADC surrogate enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses both in vitro and in murine tumor models. Spatially resolved analysis of CCR2 and immune cell markers in the TME of >1,000 primary human tumors showed the CCR2 protein was predominantly expressed in intratumoral myeloid cells. Collectively, these data highlight the clinical potential of delivering a STING agonist to CCR2+ cells.">

        <tr id="Introduction. Immune memory is a tool of the adaptive immune system that allows it responding quickly and effectively to repeated contact with an antigen. The role of memory cell populations in the recurrence and progression of immune-dependent diseases is shown. 
Aim. To determine the trend in memory T-cell populations depending on the effectiveness of biological therapy (BT) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis (PS). 
Materials and methods. Four hundred fifty children with immunosuppressive diseases (ISD) were examined during different periods of administration of biological drugs: IBD — 162 children (infliximab /adalimumab), MS — 116 children (interferon β1α — IFNβ1α), PS — 172 children (adalimumab). The effectiveness of BT was assessed using clinical activity indices and functional methods. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry to determine populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell: central (TCM), effector (TEM), and terminally differentiated (TEMRA). Statistical data processing was carried out in the Statistica 16.0 program, using the Mann–Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation analysis (p < 0.05). In the SPSS version 25 software, ROC analysis was performed in the efficiency–inefficiency separation model. 
Results. In all forms of pathology, changes in the content of memory T-cells have been established depending on the activity of inflammation. In IBD and PS patients, with an increase in the indices of disease activity, a decrease in the levels of CD4+ naive T-cells (TNAIVE) and an increase of TCM were detected. In MS patients with active foci, an MRI scan showed a decrease in the percentage of naive CD8+ T-cells (TcytNAIVE) and an increase in the population of CD8+ TEM. The content of TNAIVE populations decreased with age, and memory T-cells increased in patients with all the studied forms of pathology. In patients with BT efficacy, a high content of TNAIVE populations and a low content of TCM were found compared with the levels in patients with insufficient BT efficacy. Thresholds have been determined for IBD, MS, and PS patients, which make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT. An increase in the levels of TNAIVE and TcytNAIVE makes it possible to predict the presence of a BT effect, an increase in the levels of TCM, CD4+ TEM, and CD8+ ТEMRA make it possible to predict the absence or insufficient effect of BT. 
Conclusion. The activity of the inflammatory process is reflected in the differentiation of populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells. With the effectiveness of BT, the number of TNAIVE increases with a decrease in the number of TCM and TEM in patients with immune-dependent diseases, regardless of the form of pathology and the drug used. Threshold values for memory T-cells populations make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the most challenging and lethal brain cancers, with limited treatment options. While CAR-T cells have shown promise in some patients, sustaining T-cell activity and overcoming the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME) remain significant hurdles. Here, we present an armoured CAR-T cell design to address these challenges and enhance persistence in GBM tumours. We developed a highly specific humanised single-domain antibody (VHH) targeting IL13Rα2 and included it alongside four additional modular elements in a single retroviral vector for CAR-T generation. Our results demonstrate that this single-cassette CAR-T cell design possesses high resilience against TGF-β-mediated immunosuppression, enhanced tumour-killing capacity through IL-12 secretion while maintaining a favourable safety profile, extended persistence in the host, and an additional layer of safety control through the incorporation of a suicide switch. Importantly, despite its complexity, the construct can still be manufactured efficiently. These advancements represent a significant step forward in addressing key challenges associated with CAR-T cell therapy in solid tumours.">

 Regulatory CD8 T cells (CD8 Treg) are responsible for the selective killing of self-reactive and pathogenic T cells to maintain peripheral immune tolerance. In autoimmune disease, CD8 Treg fail to control the expansion of pathogenic T cells that subsequently cause tissue destruction. This CD8 Treg dysfunction is due in part to the expression of inhibitory KIR receptors (KIR2DL1/2/3), which serve as autoimmune checkpoints, and insufficient ICOS (inducible T cell co-stimulator) signaling, which is a primary costimulatory receptor for CD8 Treg. We have demonstrated that in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the expression of inhibitory KIR and ICOS on CD8 Treg is increased relative to that in healthy controls, with downstream dysfunctions of their cytolytic capacity and signaling pathways that promote CD8 T cell longevity and memory. Here we present pre-clinical characterization of the CD8 Treg modulator MTX-201, a bispecific antibody that binds to inhibitory KIR and ICOS that are co-expressed by CD8 Treg. MTX-201 binding antagonizes inhibitory KIR signaling and promotes ICOS co-stimulation, resulting in restored CD8 Treg activation and memory, cytolytic capacity, and functions in highly inflamed tissues, including improved metabolic flexibility and deferred exhaustion.



 Using in vitro testing of Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis (UC) patient derived PBMC, ex vivo tissue organoids, and in vivo testing in a highly inflammatory humanized acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) mouse model, we assessed the binding, specificity, and mechanisms of action of MTX-201. MTX-201 bound to CD8 Treg in mixed PBMC at low nanomolar concentrations, and select single target expressing immune cells, such as activated CD4 T cells. However, MTX-201 increased ICOS downstream effects in inhibitory KIR-expressing CD8 Treg without activating immune cells expressing only ICOS or KIR. In the GVHD model, MTX-201 extended survival and reduced disease score, marked by an increase in CD8 Treg and a reduction of activated CD4 T cells. In antigen stimulated PBMC from patients with either UC or Crohn’s disease, MTX-201 also reduced pathogenic T cell responses without evidence of broad immunosuppression, and reduced antigen induced epithelial cell death in colonic tissue derived organoids containing either tissue resident or engrafted IBD patient-derived T cells. MTX-201 had antibody-like pharmacokinetic parameters with good tolerability, no toxicity, or induction of proinflammatory serum cytokines in repeat dose studies at doses up to 50 mg/kg in CD34+NSG-Tg(Hu-IL15) mice harboring stable engraftments of human lymphocytes, including CD8 Treg cells.



 Collectively, our data support the development of MTX-201 as a therapeutic to restore CD8 Treg functions in patients for the treatment of IBD.

        <tr id="Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, but can also spread via sexual contact and from mother to fetus. While often asymptomatic, ZIKV can lead to severe neurological conditions, including microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain–Barré Syndrome in adults. ZIKV can infect placental macrophages and fetal microglia in vivo as well as human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro. Here, we observed that both human monocytes, and MDM particularly, supported ZIKV replication without evident cytopathicity, with virions accumulating in cytoplasmic vacuoles. We also investigated whether the cytokine-induced polarization of MDMs into M1 or M2 cells affected ZIKV replication. The stimulation of MDMs with pro-inflammatory cytokines (interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α) polarized MDMs into M1 cells, significantly reducing ZIKV replication, akin to previous observations with a human immunodeficiency virus type-1 infection. In contrast, M2 polarization, induced by interleukin-4, did not affect ZIKV replication in MDMs. M1 polarization selectively reduced the expression of MERTK, a TAM family putative entry receptor, and increased the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) previously associated with the containment of ZIKV infection; of interest, ZIKV infection transiently boosted the expression of some ISGs in M1-MDMs. These findings suggest a dual mechanism of ZIKV restriction in M1-MDMs and highlight potential antiviral strategies targeting innate immune responses.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background There is a need for noninvasive immunological biomarkers that can identify stable kidney allograft immune quiescence to inform individualized immunosuppression. Methods We conducted a cross‐sectional, pilot cohort study evaluating the relative abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to effector T‐cell (Teff) populations as a surrogate marker of long‐term graft tolerance. We obtained fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients, most with recent surveillance biopsies to identify the presence or absence of chronic inflammation. Tregs were sub‐phenotyped as naïve, memory, and activated Tregs (aTreg). Treg/Teff ratios were modeled for association with chronic inflammation and in the context of potential clinical features. Results Twenty‐seven patient samples were included on standard immunosuppression (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) with a mean age of 9.2 ± 5.0 years, at 30.2 ± 21.7 months posttransplant. The ratio of aTreg (FOXP3++CD45RA−) to Th17 cells (CD4+IL‐17+) was significantly greater in patients without inflammation than in patients with graft inflammation (p < 0.01). Similarly, there was a trend toward greater aTreg/CD4+ T cells and aTreg/CD8+ Teff in patients without inflammation (p = 0.05 and 0.09, respectively). There was no significant association for inflammation with naïve or memory Treg/Teff ratios. Multiple logistic regression with all three aTreg/Teff ratios modeled allograft inflammation with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–0.98). Conclusions The proportion of peripheral blood aTregs/Teff cells in this pilot cohort of stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients was associated with immune quiescence. These data support further investigation into aTreg/Teff monitoring to inform precision immunosuppressive treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract To investigate the potential mechanisms underlying neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) confer ferroptosis resistance and CD8(+) T cell inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). By the intravenous injection of LLC cells into the tail vein, a LUAD mouse model was created. Phorbol‐12‐myristate‐13‐acetate (PMA) stimulated neutrophils to facilitate NETs formation and combined with NETs inhibitor DNase I to explore NETs mechanism on LLC cell proliferation, migration, ferroptosis resistance, and CD8(+) T cell activity. CitH3, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cell‐free DNA, and MPO‐DNA levels in LUAD were increased, indicating an increase in NETs formation in LUAD. PMA promoted NETs formation in tumours of mice, increased the number of CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells, decreased perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B, IFNγ, and TNF‐α levels, and promoted LUAD growth and the number of lung tumour nodules, indicating that PMA promoted NETs formation, reduced the activity of CD8(+)T cells, and promoted LUAD growth. DNase I partially reversed the effects of PMA. NETs promoted LLC cell proliferation and migration, while DNase I reversed NETs effects. Erastin inhibited LLC cell proliferation and migration and promoted ferroptosis. NETs partially reversed Erastin effects. Further results showed that NETs promoted LLC cell proliferation and migration and inhibited ferroptosis by promoting YTHDF2‐mediated SLC2A3 mRNA degradation. Sh‐YTHDF2 partially reversed the effect of NETs on LLC cells, whereas si‐SLC2A3 partially reversed sh‐YTHDF2 effects on LLC cells. In addition, NETs inhibited LLC cell ferroptosis by inhibiting CD8(+) T cell activity. Sh‐YTHDF2 and DNase I inhibited NETs formation in tumours, increased the activity of CD8(+) T cells and inhibited LUAD growth. Our results suggested that NETs promoted the growth of LUAD through inhibiting ferroptosis and CD8(+) T cell activity by promoting YTHDF2‐mediated SLC2A3 mRNA degradation.">

While it is plausible that HIV-induced immunosuppression could result in a more severe progression, the exact mechanisms remain undetermined. To better understand the immunopathology of MPXV in patients with and without HIV infection, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from six patients hospitalized for MPXV, three of whom had HIV infection (HIV antibody positive and HIV RNA level below the detection limit), and three patients only infected with MPXV (HIV-). We map the peripheral immune response in both the acute phase and the recovery period, showing the reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotypes in acute stage compared with recovery stage, characterized by disturbed cell subsets and intense cell interactions mediated by monocytes and neutrophils. Importantly, we also found obviously dysregulated gene expression and cell subsets in HIV+ patients proposing mechanism underlying their serious condition. Our findings provide a comprehensive cell atlas of MPXV patients, shed light on the mechanisms underlying the severe disease progression and longer recovery time in HIV+ individuals.">

 Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine how T cell engagers (TCEs) impact the localization and phenotype of key T-cell subsets in preclinical solid tumor models. Background: TCEs are a class of immunotherapy that have demonstrated substantial benefit to patients with hematologic cancers and have shown evidence of clinical activity in solid tumor malignancies. Mechanisms of response to TCEs, particularly in solid tumors, are not well understood. Identification of diagnostic strategies to stratify patients that are more likely to respond is expected to enhance the clinical benefit of TCEs. Friedrich et al. (Cancer Cell 2023) found that effector CD8 T cell subsets significantly expanded in TCE responsive but not refractory patients in multiple myeloma using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Furthermore, the increased abundance of exhausted T cells at baseline was associated with a worse prognosis. We hypothesize that analogous populations exist in preclinical solid tumor models, which have distinct localization and cellular interactions within the TCE treated tumor microenvironment. Methods: Either hCD3 transgenic C57BL/6J or wildtype FVB mice were implanted with either ID8-LyPD1 or Fo5-HER2 tumors. Mice were grouped at a tumor volume of ∼ 300mm^3 and treated with either 10mpk of LyPD1 TCE, 5mpk of HER2 TCE, or vehicle. scRNAseq data was produced at day 1 and 4 post-treatment according to the 10X gene expression kit protocol and was processed in R using Seurat. Flow cytometry data was generated using commercially available antibodies, acquired on a BD FACSymphony and analyzed using FlowJo. Xenium data was generated using a custom probe panel according to the 10X Xenium protocol and was processed in either Python or R using the Squidpy or Seurat packages. Results: In the ID8-LyPD1 TCE model, we identified proliferative effector (CD8.pe) and terminally differentiated (CD8.Tex) CD8 populations by scRNAseq. The abundance of CD8.pe increased 3-fold and CD8.Tex expanded 2-fold upon TCE treatment. We then validated the expansion of these CD8 subsets by flow cytometry. Notably, increases in the number of CD8.pe per gram of tumor significantly correlated with reductions in tumor volume. Due to the impact of TCE treatment on these CD8 subsets and the importance of CD8.pe in tumor outcomes, we profiled the localization and cellular interactions of CD8s in preclinical solid tumors. Cell-cell communication inference analysis suggested that CD8s were more frequently targets of cellular interactions in TCE treated tumors. Utilizing Xenium spatial transcriptomics we verified that CD8.pe and CD8.Tex were more abundant in TCE treated samples and that their interactions with other key cell subsets were enhanced by TCE treatment. Conclusions: In summary we found that key CD8 subsets were expanded by TCE treatment in preclinical solid tumor models, that the abundance of CD8.pe correlates with reduced tumor burden, and that TCE treatment promotes cellular interactions among CD8s and other key cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment.

In this issue of the JCI, McCarthy and colleagues used the SKG mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis to characterize the role of Sag activity in inflammatory arthritis by profiling arthritogenic naive CD4+ T cells. Within the diseased joints, they found a marked enrichment of T cell receptor–variable β (TCR-Vβ) subsets that were reactive to the endogenously encoded mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) Sag. Arthritis was improved using reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Moreover, depletion of MMTV Sag-activated TCR-Vβ subsets affected the ability of transferred activated CD4+ T cells to induce disease in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).

        <tr id="Abstract Background Due to their enhanced responsiveness and persistence, cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML)-natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as new immunotherapeutic tools against malignancies. However, their effects on tumor-cell spread and metastases in solid tumors remain poorly investigated. Moreover, a clear identification of the most effective CIML-NK subsets, especially in controlling cancer stem cells (CSC), is still lacking. Methods We performed combined phenotypical and functional analyses of CIML-NK cell subsets, either selected by flow-cytometry gating, or generated from sorted CD56bright/CD56dim NK cells. By co-culture experiments, we analyzed the effect of CIML-NK cells on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell spheroids, or patient-derived xenografts (PDX), assessing changes in their CSC content, tumorigenicity, and/or tumor disseminating capability in vivo. CIML-NK cells were also infused in PDX-bearing mice to validate their effect on the CSC dissemination from the PDX to the lungs. Finally, we generated and functionally analyzed CIML-NK cells from patients with stages I/III NSCLC (n=6). Results We show that CIML-NK cells exert antitumor activity mostly through their CD56bright cell subset, which greatly expands during CIML differentiation. Compared with NK cells conventionally activated with interleukin-2, CIML-NK cells express lower levels of check-point receptors, TIGIT and TIM3, and higher effector functions against NSCLC cells from PDX, and against in vitro-generated tumor spheroids. Remarkably, CIML-NK cells also significantly reduce the CSC-containing CD133+ cell subpopulation within spheroids and PDX, and limit tumor cell tumorigenicity and ability to disseminate CSCs from primary tumors to distant sites. Sorting experiments on CIML or tumor cell subsets reveal that CD56bright cells drive most of this anti-CSC activity, and suggest that such functional advantage could be related to increased expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 on CD56bright cells and CSCs, respectively. We also show that the tri-specific killer cell engager (TriKE) 1615133 significantly enhances CIML-NK cell activity against CSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that CIML-NK cells, capable of killing autologous tumor cells and responding to the 1615133 TriKE, could be induced from patients with NSCLC. Conclusions Our study discloses for the first time the therapeutic potential of CIML-NK cells in controlling CSCs and metastatic spread, highlighting the role of the CD56bright subset expansion and 1615133 TriKE for optimizing CIML-NK-based therapies against metastatic tumors.">

        <tr id="Advanced metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with deficient DNA mismatch repair (MMR-d), or immune-hot CRCs, show significantly improved clinical outcomes compared to MMR-proficient (MMR-p), or immune-cold CRCs. While the prior represents about 5% of all CRCs, the latter represent 95% and are characterized by low immunogenicity. This study investigates bis-diethyldithiocarbamate (CuET), a novel anticancer compound, and its impact on the colorectal cancer tumor microenvironment (TME). CuET is shown to convert immunologically inactive tumors into hotbeds of antitumor immune responses, marked by increased lymphocyte infiltration, heightened cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) and T cells, and enhanced non-self recognition by lymphocytes. The potent anticancer cytotoxicity and in vivo safety and efficacy of CuET are established. In summary, CuET transforms the colorectal cancer TME, bolstering NK and T cell cytotoxicity and refining tumor cell recognition through non-classical activation via the NKG2D/NKG2DL axis. This study unveils a novel mechanism of action for CuET: a potent immunomodulator capable of turning cold tumors hot.">

        <tr id="Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is broadly produced by various cell types, particularly immune cells, and functions as a key modulator of innate and adaptive immunity. Increasing evidence has linked MIF to the pathogenesis of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We previously showed that the global deletion of Mif in the TCL1 transgenic mouse model for CLL significantly delayed disease development leading to longer overall survival of the knockout mice. In this study, we demonstrated that adaptive transfer of murine CLL cells failed to establish disease in Mif-deficient recipients due to impaired homing of leukemic cells into the spleens, indicating that host-derived Mif is essential for leukemic infiltration and expansion. To identify the most relevant source of Mif in CLL, we generated two CLL mouse strains with B-lymphoid- or myeloid-lineage-specific Mif deletion. In contrast to the global Mif knockout, neither conditional Mif knockout significantly altered CLL progression, illustrating that the cellular source of Mif is less critical than its systemic presence in the tissue environment. Taken together, these in vivo findings indicate that MIF plays a relevant role in CLL pathogenesis, acting independently of its specific cellular origin.

Although PMCs are known to exert multiple immune functions, their role in pleurisy remains unclear. Methods Pleurisy model was induced by intrapleural injection of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) into wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. The pleural cavity was washed with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to get the immune cells. Flow cytometry was performed to identify the characteristics of the target cells. Results We found that IFN-γ prompts PMCs to act a summon role for the recruitment of inflammatory cells in pleurisy model. Our data showed that CD4+ T cells were the main producer of IFN-γ in the pleurisy model, and IFN-γ stimulated PMCs to recruit immune cells into the pleural cavity through the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis. In addition, IFN-γ can reshape PMCs to display macrophage-like polarization. These results revealed some new immune roles of PMCs in pleurisy. Conclusion In a mouse model of pleurisy, IFN-γ, which is mainly derived from CD4+ T cells, promoted PMCs to recruit of immune cells into the pleural cavity and exhibited macrophage-like polarization.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Chromium, a common environmental and occupational sensitizer, frequently induces allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). This study investigates the role of CD4+ (T helper), CD8+ (T cytotoxic), regulatory (Tregs: CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+), and gamma delta (Tγδ) T cells in chromium tolerance versus hypersensitivity. Methods: Six chromium-allergic patients and six healthy controls were recruited, confirmed via patch testing. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured, with chromium exposure and proliferation assays conducted. Specific T cell subtypes were isolated and analyzed for chromium-specific proliferative responses, cytokine production, and metabolic activity. Results: Chromium-allergic individuals exhibited broad proliferation across PBMC and T cell subsets, contrasting with restricted responses in controls. Treg cells in healthy subjects effectively suppressed T cell proliferation in response to chromium, while allergic individuals showed unmodulated T cell activity, indicative of impaired regulatory function. Cytokine analysis revealed elevated IL-2 and TNF-α but absent IL-10 in allergic patients. Metabolic assessments showed higher glycolytic activity in Tregs of healthy controls, suggesting enhanced regulatory potential. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of balanced effector and regulatory T cell interactions for chromium tolerance. Dysregulated Treg and Tγδ cell functions in allergic individuals may contribute to hypersensitivity, with implications for targeted therapeutic strategies to restore immune balance and reduce allergic responses in chromium-sensitive patients.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. Patients who have ovarian tumors infiltrated with high frequencies of T cells are associated with a greater survival probability. However, therapies to revitalize tumor-associated T cells, such as PD-L1/PD-1 or CTLA4 blockade, are ineffective for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that for ovarian cancer, Toll-Like Receptor 5 (TLR5) signaling, for which the only known ligand is bacterial flagellin, governed failure of PD-L1 and CTLA4 blockade. Mechanistically, chronic TLR5 signaling on CD11c+ cells in vivo and in vitro impaired the differentiation of functional IL-12-producing XCR1+CD103+ conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), biasing CD11c+ precursor cells toward myeloid subsets expressing high levels of PD-L1. This culminated in impaired activation of CD8+ T cells, reducing CD8+ T-cell function and ability to persist within the ovarian tumor microenvironment. Expansion of cDC1s in situ using FLT3L in combination with PD-L1 blockade achieved significant survival benefit in TLR5 knockout mice bearing ovarian tumors, whereas no benefit was observed in the presence of TLR5 signaling. Thus, we have identified a host-intrinsic mechanism leading to the failure of PD-L1 blockade for ovarian cancer, demonstrating that chronic TLR5 signaling on CD11c+ cells is a barrier limiting the efficacy of checkpoint therapy.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by dysregulated humoral immunity, leading to the generation of autoreactive B cells that can differentiate both within and outside of lymph node (LN) follicles.Here, we employed spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging to investigate the follicular immune landscaping and the in situ transcriptomic profile in LNs from SLE individuals.Our spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed robust type I IFN and plasma cell signatures in SLE compared to reactive, control follicles. Cell deconvolution revealed that follicular T cell subsets are mainly affected by the type I IFN fingerprint of SLE follicles. Dysregulation of TFH differentiation was documented by i) the significant reduction of Bcl6hi TFH cells, ii) the reduced cell density of potential IL-4 producing TFH cell subsets associated with the impaired transcriptomic signature of follicular IL-4 signaling and iii) the loss of their correlation with GC-B cells. This profile was accompanied by a marked reduction of Bcl6hi B cells and an enrichment of extrafollicular CD19hiCD11chiTbethi, age-associated B cells (ABCs), known for their autoreactive potential. The increased prevalence of follicular IL-21hi cells further reveals a hyperactive microenvironment in SLE compared to control.Taken together, our findings highlight the altered immunological landscape of SLE follicles, likely fueled by potent inflammatory signals such as sustained type I IFN and/or IL-21 signaling. Our work provides novel insights into the spatial molecular and cellular signatures of SLE follicular B and TFH cell dynamics, and points to druggable targets to restore immune tolerance and enhance vaccine responses in SLE patients.">

However, the immune microenvironment in cervical cancer remains poorly described. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) were recently described as markers for better immunotherapy response and overall better prognosis in cancer patients. We evaluated the cervical tumor immune microenvironment, specifically focusing on TLS, using combined high-throughput phenotyping, soluble factor concentration dosage in the TME and spatial interaction analyses. We found that TLS presence was associated with a more inflammatory soluble microenvironment, with the presence of B cells as well as more activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, this myeloid cell activation was associated with expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1 and CD40, and proximity of activated conventional type 2 DCs (DC2) to CD8+ T cells, indicating better immune interactions and tumor control. Finally, we associated TLS presence, greater B cell density, and activated DC density with improved progression-free survival, substantiating TLS presence as a potential prognostic marker. Our results provide evidence that TLS presence denotes cell activation and immunotherapy target expression.">

        <tr id="Adaptive resistance to immunotherapy remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment. The reshaping of the tumor immune microenvironment in response to therapeutic pressures is a crucial factor contributing to this resistance. Here, by comprehensive metabolic profiling of tumor tissues, we identified elevated itaconate in response to anti-PD-1 therapy as an adaptive resistance mechanism that promoted immune escape and tumor progression. CD8+ T-cell-derived interferon (IFN)-γ induced a significant upregulation of cis-aconitate decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1) in macrophages via the JAK-STAT1 pathway, thereby rewiring the Krebs cycle toward itaconate production. In murine models, macrophage-specific deletion of Acod1 increased the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy and improved survival. Additionally, itaconate and its derivative, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), suppressed the tumor antigen presentation and cross-priming ability of dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in the impairment of antigen-specific T-cell anti-tumor responses. In summary, these findings identify an IFN-γ-dependent immunometabolic mechanism of anti-PD-1 resistance, providing a promising strategy for combination therapy.">

        <tr id="Relevance. Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies worldwide, with high mortality primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and the lack of effective early screening. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in cancer progression, immune evasion, and resistance to therapy. Immune cells, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, along with immune checkpoint proteins like PD-L1, significantly influence tumor behavior and therapeutic response. Understanding their roles in ovarian cancer may provide insights into novel immunotherapeutic strategies. Materials and methods of study. A total of 135 ovarian cancer patients from the Republican Specialized Scientific and Practical Medical Center of Oncology and Radiology, Samarkand Branch, were included in this study. Tumor samples were obtained through biopsy or surgical resection, and immune profiling was performed using multiplex immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The expression levels of CD4+, CD8+, and PD-L1 were quantified, and their spatial distribution within the TME was analyzed. Correlations between immune profiles and clinical outcomes, including survival rates and response to immunotherapy, were assessed. Research results. CD4+ T helper cells exhibited functional diversity, with Th1 cells promoting anti-tumor immunity, whereas Th2 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) contributed to immune suppression in advanced tumors. High CD8+ T-cell infiltration correlated with improved survival; however, elevated PD-L1 expression was associated with T-cell exhaustion (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3) and immune evasion. Increased PD-L1 levels were linked to poor prognosis, reinforcing its role as a key immune checkpoint regulator. Conclusion. This study highlights the prognostic significance of CD4+, CD8+, and PD-L1 expression in ovarian cancer. Immune profiling may aid in personalized treatment strategies, optimizing immunotherapy efficacy. Future research should focus on integrating multi-omics approaches to enhance patient stratification and improve therapeutic outcomes.">

 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) harness the power of the immune system to fight against systemic cancers. Despite being one of the most promising current therapeutic strategies, response rates remain heterogeneous. Immunologically cold tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are among those that do not respond well to checkpoint inhibition. Ferroptosis-related therapies are emerging as a new class of therapeutics for chemo-resistant and metastatic cancers, as they exploit the antioxidant dependence of cancer cells, circumventing most resistance mechanisms. However, the relationship between ferroptosis and the tumor microenvironment (TME) is not well characterized. Here, we leverage ferroptosis-inducing therapies as an adjuvant for immunotherapy and monitor the myeloid dynamics in response with immuno-Positron Emission Tomography (immuno-PET). Methods: A myeloid-heavy TNBC model was used to study myeloid dynamics in response to ferroptosis therapy. The immunogenicity of ferroptotic cancer cells was investigated through in vitro quantification of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The impact of ferroptosis therapies on macrophages was also evaluated. Furthermore, the synergy of ferroptosis-inducing therapy (using IKE) and ICB (with aPD-1) was assessed in vivo, and immune infiltration changes were quantified via flow cytometry and tissue staining. To facilitate this investigation, a pan-myeloid radioimmunoconjugate, 89Zr-DFO-CD11b, was developed as an immunoPET agent to quantitatively monitor spatiotemporal dynamics of tumor myeloid cells during ferroptosis-based therapy. Results: TNBC cells undergoing ferroptosis exhibit an immunogenic phenotype, characterized by increased DAMP production, which can contribute to TME reprogramming. Macrophages exposed to cells undergoing ferroptosis were polarized to an anti-tumor phenotype, exhibited increased tumor spheroid infiltration, and increased phagocytosis signaling. In vivo combination of IKE with aPD-1 suppressed tumor growth. The combination therapy increased tumor infiltration of lymphocyte populations, particularly CD8+ T cells, as well as anti-tumor macrophages, into the tumor core. After confirming 89Zr-DFO-CD11b showed high radiochemical conversion, stability in serum, and specific binding to myeloid cells both in vitro and in vivo, 89Zr-DFO-CD11b was injected IV into tumor-bearing mice receiving therapy. Tumor uptake was significantly less in the combination therapy group, with a distinct pocket of myeloid cells in the center of treated tumors, compared to control tumors with myeloid cells around the tumor periphery. Conclusions: This study underscores the potential of ferroptosis as an adjuvant to immunotherapy, with spatiotemporal immune cell dynamics highlighted by 89Zr-DFO-CD11b myeloid imaging. Future studies will multiplex PET imaging with T cell and ferroptosis markers to further elucidate TME dynamics.

Cirrhosis, an advanced stage of liver diseases, induces Cirrhosis-Associated Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CAIDS) characterized by both innate and adaptive immune dysfunction. Inflammation triggered by factors such as alcohol, viruses, toxins, and cholesterol induce metabolic reprogramming of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Our study specifically sought to investigate the compromised adaptive immune response in cirrhosis by focusing on assessing T-cell exhaustion and activation markers on helper and cytotoxic T cells.


METHOD
A prospective observational study involving 19 liver cirrhosis patients and 36 healthy controls was conducted. Hepatic decompensation degree was assessed using various parameters including serum bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. T cell activation (CD38, CD44, CD69, HLADR), and exhaustion markers (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3) were assessed on helper and cytotoxic T cells by flow cytometry.


RESULT
Cirrhosis patients showed reduced T cells with no alteration in CD4:CD8 T cell ratio. Among activation markers, HLADR showed increased expression on CD8+ T cells (P=0.031). Regarding exhaustion markers LAG-3 and TIM-3 exhibited increased expression in cirrhotic patients compared to controls in both CD4 and CD8 T cells (P=0.004, P=0.016, P=0.001, P=0.004, respectively). Neither cirrhotic nor healthy controls showed CTLA expression. PD-1 did not differ significantly between the two groups. Co-expression of PD-1/TIM-3 on CD8+ T cells was notably higher in cirrhotic patients (P<0.002).


CONCLUSION
The observation of impaired adaptive immunity with notable T cell exhaustion and activation in cirrhosis underscores the potential relevance of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Understanding both local and systemic immunity is essential to optimizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the dynamic alterations in systemic immunity during tumor development are yet to be clearly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized connection that bridges the interaction between the spleen and tumor through erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), which suppress tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. We performed the single-cell RNA-seq and RNA-seq to demonstrate the presence of EPCs and identify the characteristic and an immunomodulatory role of EPCs during tumor progression. These tumor-hijacked EPCs proliferate in situ in spleens and impaired systemic and local antitumor response through the interaction between tumor and spleen. Specifically, the splenic CD45- EPCs secreted heparin-binding growth factor to regulate PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression of splenic CD45+ EPCs. Educated CD45+ EPCs from the spleen then migrated to the tumors via the CCL5/CCR5 axis, thereby weakening local antitumor immunity. Consequently, targeting EPCs not only revitalized antitumor immunity but also improved the anti-PD-L1 effect by promoting intratumoral T cell infiltration. Importantly, CD45+ EPCs are associated with immunosuppression and reduced survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal the role of EPCs in orchestrating the interaction between the spleen and tumor, which could have significant implications for the development of more effective cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cytokines play a crucial role in mediating cell communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages are particularly influential in the regulation of immunosuppressive cytokines, thereby supporting tumor metastasis. The upregulation of Th2 cytokines in cancer cells is recognized for its involvement in suppressing anticancer immunity. However, the association between these cytokines and tumor-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) remains poorly understood. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the connection between tumor-promoting macrophages and melanoma-derived EVs. The analysis from altered cytokine profile data showed that melanoma-derived EVs upregulate Th2 cytokine expression in naïve macrophages, thereby contributing to the promotion of tumor-supporting functions. Notably, many of these cytokines were also found to be upregulated in metastatic melanoma patients (n = 30) compared to healthy controls (n = 33). Overall, our findings suggest a strong connection between melanoma secretory EVs and the induction of tumor-associated macrophages that facilitates the development of an immunosuppressive TME, supporting melanoma metastasis through regulation at both local and systemic levels.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is associated with dysregulated/chronic inflammation. The immune system has multiple roles including beneficial effects such as clearing alpha synuclein aggregates. However, peripheral immune cells entering the brain may also contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. To identify which cells might have a negative impact and could be potential therapeutic targets, we compared immune signatures of patients and healthy controls.


METHODS
Multicolor flow cytometry was used to determine the frequencies of major immune cell subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PD patients and controls. Because of the major impact of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on the distribution of immune cell subsets, particularly cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T-cells, all participants were tested for CMV seropositivity.


RESULTS
Although the cohort of 35 PD patients exhibited the well-established T-cell differentiation signature driven by CMV infection, there were no differences in the frequencies of differentiated or pro-inflammatory T-cells, B-cells or natural killer cells (NK-cells) attributable to the disease. However, percentages of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were higher in PD patients than controls. Moreover, percentages of CD14+CD16+ (intermediate) monocytes expressing the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) correlated with disease severity assessed by the Movement Disorder Society's revised version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) score and disease duration.


CONCLUSIONS
A comprehensive evaluation of the major subsets of circulating immune cells in PD patients revealed differences in myeloid cells between PD and healthy controls and some correlation of monocyte abundance with disease severity.">

 Melanoma is the 8th most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, predominantly driven by exposure to UV radiation leading to an abundant oncogenic mutational burden. However, very few models incorporate these mechanisms in their representation of the disease significantly influencing treatment responses. To address this, our lab uses the Yale University Melanoma Model (YUMM) irradiated cell line that contains clinically represented mutations that are imperative to melanoma development. As a result, these cells are sensitive to combination immune checkpoint inhibition making them a superior system to study the immune response in melanoma over less representative lines such as B16. These cells are injected into a syngeneic in vivo murine system C57/Bl6 INK-ATTAC mice with a senescent cell depletion cassette exclusively expressed in the host stroma, incorporating cellular senescence as a key contributor to the host response to cancer. This dual system allows for the exploration of the immune response that patients experience after receiving ICI treatment in concert with senescent stromal cell burden in the tumor microenvironment (TME). INK-ATTAC mice bearing single cell clone YUMM tumors are treated with a combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (aPD-1+aCTLA-4) to generate both responder and non-responder phenotypes. Upon clearance of senescent cells from the TME via injection of AP20187, the proportions of these response phenotypes shift in both pro- and anti-tumor directions. Immunohistochemical analyses show a significant negative correlation of immune infiltration with tumor size, where T cells show a 2-fold increase as tumor size is reduced as a result of ICI and AP+ICI treatment. More in-depth analysis of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and myeloid cells through Cytometry Time of Flight (CyTOF) of a specific single cell clone reveal that the proportions of immunosuppressive myeloid cells to cytotoxic T cells are key drivers of response phenotypes in AP+ICI treated tumors. Our findings suggest that stromal cellular senescence potentially have pro- and anti-tumor effects, thus influencing both treatment efficacy and resistance mechanisms that prevent response to immune checkpoint inhibition.

        <tr id="The innate immune system acts as the body’s frontline defense, detecting and responding to pathogenic threats with remarkable precision. Central to this defense are inflammatory markers, including cytokines, chemokines, acute-phase proteins, and cellular mediators. These markers not only recognize infections and cellular damage but also orchestrate immune cell recruitment and signal the activation of adaptive immunity. Key cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 play dual roles in promoting inflammation and restoring homeostasis. Similarly, chemokines like CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL2 (MCP-1) guide immune cells to infection sites. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like and NOD-like receptors, are vital for detecting pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns, triggering signaling cascades that amplify the inflammatory response. Clinically, these markers are invaluable for diagnosing infections, monitoring inflammatory diseases, and predicting treatment outcomes. Furthermore, their dysregulation is implicated in chronic inflammatory conditions, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases like sepsis and COVID-19. Emerging therapies targeting cytokine signaling pathways and PRRs hold promise for mitigating excessive inflammation while preserving host defense. This review highlights the pivotal roles of inflammatory markers in innate immunity, focusing on their detection mechanisms, activation pathways, and therapeutic potential. Advancing our understanding of these markers will enable precise modulation of immune responses, offering innovative solutions to manage inflammatory and infectious diseases.

        <tr id="Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus associated with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), a hematological malignancy, and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM), a progressive neurological disorder. HTLV-1 predominantly infects CD4+ T cells in vivo. The T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex on CD4+ helper T cells plays a pivotal role in immune responses by recognizing antigens and facilitating coordination with other immune cells. Dysfunction of the TCR/CD3 complex may impair immune function. Although CD3 downregulation has been identified as a characteristic of ATL cells, it remains uncertain whether a similar downregulation occurs in HTLV-1-infected cells from HAM patients. We hypothesized that HTLV-1 infection leads to TCR and CD3 downregulation, contributing to immune dysfunction in HAM patients. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed TCR/CD3 expression, TCR signaling, and immune responses in HTLV-1-infected cells from HAM patients. Intracellular HTLV-1 Tax detection revealed that HTLV-1 preferentially targets CD4+ over CD8+ T cells. CD3 and TCR expression levels were significantly lower in CD4+ T cells from HAM patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, HTLV-1-infected cells exhibited markedly reduced CD3 and TCR expression compared to uninfected cells. Impairments in TCR signaling, assessed through Lck and ZAP70 phosphorylation upon CD3 stimulation, were observed in CD4+ T cells from HAM patients compared to those from healthy controls. Notably, this reduction in TCR signaling was more pronounced in HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells than in uninfected CD4+ T cells in HAM patients. Additionally, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD4+ T cells detected by an addition of CMV antigens demonstrated reduced interferon-γ production in HTLV-1-infected cells compared to their uninfected counterparts. These findings suggest that TCR/CD3 downregulation and impaired TCR signaling contribute to immune dysfunction in HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. As CD4+ T cells play a central role in immune responses, this mechanism may partially explain the cellular immune dysfunction to other pathogens observed in HAM patients.">

 A fundamental dichotomy in lymphocytes separates adaptive T and B lymphocytes, with clonally expressed antigen receptors, from innate lymphocytes, which carry out more rapid responses. Some T cell populations, however, are intermediates between these 2 poles, with the capacity to respond rapidly through T cell receptor activation or by cytokine stimulation. Here, using publicly available datasets, we constructed linear mixed models that not only define a gradient of innate gene expression in common for mouse innate-like T cells, but also are applicable to other mouse T lymphoid populations. A similar gradient could be identified for chromatin landscape based on ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) data. The gradient included increased transcripts related to many traits of innate immune responses, with increased scores related to evidence for antigen experience. While including genes typical for T helper 1 (Th1) responses, the innateness gene program could be separated from Th1, Th2, and Th17 responses. Lymphocyte populations with higher innateness scores correlated with lower calcium-dependent T cell receptor–mediated cell activation, with some downstream signaling proteins dependent on calcium or affecting metabolism prephosphorylation. Therefore, as a group, different mouse innate-like T cell populations had related gene expression programs and activation pathways that are different from naive CD4 and CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="CCR2, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, is widely expressed on monocytes, macrophages, activated T cells, and other cell types, and plays a critical role in coordinating the immune response to various infections. Here we demonstrate that CCR2 expression is significantly elevated during Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) respiratory infection, and its absence leads to exacerbated susceptibility, as evidenced by significant weight loss, higher bacterial loads, severe lung pathology, and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (il-1β, tnfα, and il-6). The absence of ccr2 impairs both myeloid cell infiltration and T cell responses, which are crucial for effective immune defense. Specifically, ccr2 deficiency disrupts the differentiation and response of Th1 cells, which are the primary effector lineage responsible for clearing chlamydia through secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). As a result, there is a significant decrease in CD3+CD4+IFN-γ+ T cells in the lung and spleen, accompanied by reduced levels of IFN-γ protein and mRNA, as well as downregulated mRNA expression of Th1-promoting cytokines (il-12p35, il-12p40) and transcription factors (stat4, T-bet), which play crucial roles in Th1 differentiation. Moreover, ccr2 deficiency greatly diminishes STAT1 phosphorylation, a key regulator of IFN-γ secretion by Th1 cells. Meanwhile, we also observed a significant reduction in IFN-γ secretion by CD8+ T cells following ccr2 deficiency. Conversely, ccr2-/- mice exhibit an exaggerated Th2-type immune response, with elevated levels of Th2-promoting cytokines (IL-4), transcription factors (STAT6 and gata3), and il-5, which together lead to more severe lung tissue damage and increased susceptibility to infection. Furthermore, these mice show higher levels of IL-17 along with an enhanced Th17-type immune response, characterized by increased Th17-promoting cytokines TGFB, transcription factors stat3 and RORγt, and il-21, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that drives neutrophil infiltration to exacerbate lung inflammation. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CCR2, a chemokine receptor, in orchestrating the immune response to Chlamydia infection by facilitating Th1 cells differentiation while restraining Th2-type and Th17-type immune responses, thereby alleviating pulmonary inflammation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Many patients now survive their initial critical events but subsequently develop chronic critical illness (CCI). CCI is characterized by prolonged hospital stays, poor outcomes, and significant long-term mortality. The incidence of chronic critical illness (CCI) is estimated to be 34.4 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence varies significantly with age, peaking at 82.1 cases per 100,000 in individuals aged 75–79. The one-year mortality rate among CCI patients approaches 50%. A subset of these patients enters a state of persistent inflammation, immune suppression, and ongoing catabolism, a condition termed persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS) in 2012. In recent years, some progress has been made in treating PICS. For instance, recent advancements such as the persistent expansion of MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) and the mechanisms underlying intestinal barrier dysfunction have provided new directions for therapeutic strategies, as discussed below. Persistent inflammation, a key feature of PICS, has received comparatively little research attention. In this review, we examine the potential pathophysiological changes and molecular mechanisms underlying persistent inflammation and its role in PICS. We also discuss current therapies about inflammation and offer recommendations for managing patients with PICS.">

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with TRM features are associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, the cellular interactions that program TRM differentiation and function are not well understood. Using murine genetic models and targeted spatial transcriptomics, we found that the CD8+ T cell-derived chemokine XCL1 is critical for TRM formation and conventional DC1 (cDC1) supported the positioning of intestinal CD8+ T cells during acute viral infection. In tumors, enforced Xcl1 expression by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells promoted intratumoral cDC1 accumulation and T cell persistence, leading to improved overall survival. Notably, analysis of human TIL and TRM revealed conserved expression of XCL1 and XCL2. Thus, we have shown that the XCL1-XCR1 axis plays a non-cell autonomous role in guiding intestinal CD8+ TRM spatial differentiation and tumor control.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoints are critical regulators of T-cell exhaustion, impairing their ability to eliminate antigens present during chronic viral infections. Current immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in the clinic aim to reinvigorate exhausted T cells; yet, most patients fail to respond or develop resistance to these therapies, underscoring the need to better understand these immunosuppressive pathways. PSGL-1 (Selplg), a recently discovered immune checkpoint, negatively regulates T-cell function. We investigated the cell-intrinsic effects of PSGL-1, PD-1, and combined deletion on CD8+ T cells during chronic viral infection. We found that combined PSGL-1 and PD-1 (Selplg-/-Pdcd1-/-) deficiency in CD8+ T cells increased their frequencies and numbers throughout chronic infection compared to the wild type. This phenotype was primarily driven by PD-1 deficiency. Furthermore, while PD-1 deletion increased virus-specific T-cell frequencies, it was detrimental to their function. Conversely, PSGL-1 deletion improved T-cell function but resulted in lower frequencies and numbers. The primary mechanism behind these differences in cell maintenance was driven by proliferation rather than survival. Combined PSGL-1 and PD-1 deletion resulted in defective T-cell differentiation, driving cells from a progenitor self-renewal state to a more terminal dysfunctional state. These findings suggest that PD-1 and PSGL-1 have distinct, yet complementary, roles in regulating T-cell exhaustion and differentiation during chronic viral infection. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the individual and combined roles of PSGL-1 and PD-1 in CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. It underscores the potential of targeting these checkpoints in a more dynamic and sequential manner to optimize virus-specific T-cell responses, offering critical perspectives for improving therapeutic strategies aimed at reinvigorating exhausted CD8+ T cells.IMPORTANCEOur findings provide a comprehensive analysis of how the dual deletion of PD-1 and PSGL-1 impacts the response and function of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, revealing novel insights into their roles in chronic infection. Notably, our findings show that while PD-1 deletion enhances T-cell frequencies, it paradoxically reduces T-cell functionality. Conversely, PSGL-1 deletion improves T-cell function but reduces their survival. Whereas the combined deletion of PSGL-1 and PD-1 in CD8+ T cells improved their survival but decreased their function and progenitor-exhausted phenotypes during infection. We believe our study advances the understanding of immune checkpoint regulation in chronic infections and has significant implications for developing more effective immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies.">

 Cancer therapy has been rapidly transformed by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1. However, many patients fail to respond, particularly those with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), suggesting the existence of additional immune checkpoints that act through orthogonal mechanisms. To overcome therapeutic resistance, identifying and targeting new types of checkpoints, such as glycan-binding immune checkpoints, may offer a promising strategy to reprogram the TME by suppressing tumor-promoting factors. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptors, especially the inhibitory members constitutively expressed on myeloid cells, play an immunosuppressive role in innate immunity. Here, we identify Siglec-7 and -9 immunosuppressors as novel glyco-immune checkpoints that inhibit T cell function and anti-tumor immunity. We discovered that T cells in the TME acquire these Siglec checkpoints from myeloid cells via trogocytosis, impairing T cell activity by dephosphorylating T cell receptor (TCR)-related signaling pathways through engagement with tumor-associated sialoglycans. Using sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry, we developed a high-affinity ligand specific for Siglec-7 and -9, and converted it into a degrader for targeted lysosomal degradation of both Siglecs. This degrader efficiently reduced Siglec levels in T cells and myeloid cells, significantly restoring T cell function and enhancing anti-tumor immunity. The degrader, particularly when combined with anti-CTLA-4, reshaped the TME and generated durable T cell memory, resulting in excellent tumor control in multiple murine models. These findings underscore the significance of degrading exogenously acquired Siglec checkpoints on T cells as a novel strategy to overcome resistance to established checkpoint inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy.

 Introduction: Radiation therapy (RT) induces adenosine signaling by releasing ATP in the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting immune suppression and tumor progression. This study investigates how RT impacts adenosine signaling and immune cell infiltration in a preclinical model of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using immunophenotyping of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in LLC1 murine model, we aim to explore the potential of targeting the adenosine pathway in combination with RT to enhance antitumor immunity and clinical outcomes. Methods: LLC1 tumor cells (5 x 105) were implanted subcutaneously in the flanks of C57BL/6 mice. After 12 days, mice received RT (4 Gy x 3 or 8 Gy x 3). Tumor volumes were measured thrice a week and harvested 5- and 10-days post-RT. We performed immunophenotyping of tumor tissue to assess changes in immune (CD45+) and CD45- compartments. The expression of adenosine signaling pathway members was quantified in distinct immune cell populations. Results: RT caused significant inhibition in tumor growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. 5-days post-RT, CD73 (P< 0.01) and CD39 expressions (P< 0.01) were significantly upregulated in the immune compartment, while A2BR (P< 0.01) and A2AR (P< 0.05) were decreased in the non-immune compartment. RT decreased T cell populations, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Further, CD4+ T cells downregulate adenosine signaling markers, particularly CD73 (P< 0.05) and ENPP1 (P< 0.05), while CD8+ T cells decreased in CD73 expression (P< 0.01). Myeloid subtype abundance was unchanged, but A2AR, A2BR, CD39, and CD73 expressions increased in the M2-like macrophage compartment (F4-80+MHCII-). 10 days post-RT, all adenosine signaling pathway markers significantly increased in the immune compartment and significantly decreased in the non-immune compartment. T cells (TCRb+) and macrophages (F4-80+) increased in abundance, including immuno-suppressive Arg+ macrophages (P< 0.05). Macrophage population that expressed the adenosine signaling markers increased by 10-15% (P< 0.05). While the proportion of CD4+ T cells and Tregs (CD4+FoxP3+) that expressed CD39 and CD73 also increased (P< 0.05). Conclusions: Our study revealed that RT promotes an immunosuppressive TME, in part through adenosine signaling. 5 days post-RT, we observed lymphocyte depletion and upregulation of the adenosine signaling pathway in M2-like macrophages. 10 days post-RT, adenosine signaling significantly increased across the immune compartment and decreased in the non-immune compartment, suggesting that the increase in adenosine signaling post-RT is immunologically mediated and largely driven by the myeloid compartment. These data lead to the hypothesis that inhibition of the adenosine signaling pathway may partially mitigate RT-induced immune suppression and improve RT efficacy. Ongoing work includes quantification of adenosine by LC-MS, extension to a preclinical SCC model of NSCLC, and evaluating adenosine pathway inhibition in combination with RT as a therapeutic strategy to improve antitumor immune responses.

        <tr id="Cancer participates in the immune response by releasing several factors, such as cytokines and chemokines, which can alter the ability of the immune system to identify and eradicate cancer. Notably, the role of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in breast cancer (BC) is currently controversial and unclear. The present study characterized the role of TSLP in BC and its interaction with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, focusing on the CD14+CD16+ monocyte population via the secretome released by BC cells. The UALCAN and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis tools were employed to define TSLP expression in BC, and its levels in different BC subtype cell lines were validated using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and ELISA. In addition, TIMER 2.0 was used to determine the abundance of immune cell infiltration in BC. Subsequently, the effects of BC conditioned medium (CM) and TSLP were investigated on CD14+CD16+ monocytes via flow cytometry. A Cellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Assay Kit, Fluo-4 AM assay and ATPlite assay were used to explore the effects of TSLP on monocyte cellular metabolism. The results showed that a reduction in TSLP expression was associated with an unfavorable prognosis in BC. Furthermore, a higher expression of TSLP in CM from a non-tumoral cell line increased the percentage of CD14+CD16+ monocytes. Finally, it was revealed that TSLP decreased intracellular ATP levels, while increasing intracellular calcium levels and producing ROS in THP-1 cells. Therefore, TSLP may be considered a novel biomarker in the BC microenvironment, where it could regulate cellular metabolism through the expansion of CD14+CD16+ monocytes.">

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, delivering impressive results across various cancers. However, resistance is common, and only a limited number of patients experience lasting responses. This underscores the urgent need to understand resistance mechanisms and develop new strategies to enhance responsiveness. Here we focus on breast cancer, particularly ER+ breast cancer, which is generally poorly immunogenic and responds poorly to ICB. To address this, we analyzed the METABRIC cohort's immunogenic biomarkers and tumor mutational burden (TMB). We found that relapsed ER+ patients treated with endocrine therapy exhibit activated immune pathways. However, high TMB correlates with lower overall survival (OS), suggesting an active but clinically ineffective immune response. To explore the immune-resistant mechanisms, we developed chronically tamoxifen-treated T47D and MCF7 cells (cTMX-T47D and cTMX-MCF7) by exposing them to the drug for over six months. RNA sequencing data revealed increased type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and innate immunity in these cells, confirmed in vivo in T47D xenografts. Tracing tamoxifen’s effects, we found that IFN-I signaling and ISG induction depend on the cGAS/STING pathway. Short-term tamoxifen exposure induced only modest ISG expression, indicating additional prerequisites during long-term treatment. We identified that the RACK7/KDM5C H3K4 demethylase complex is crucial for tamoxifen-induced ISG upregulation, with both proteins decreasing over time. Knocking down RACK7 intensified tamoxifen's activation of the cGAS/STING signaling and ISG expression. Combined tamoxifen treatment and RACK7 knockdown significantly enhanced these innate immunity effects compared to either treatment alone. Furthermore, tamoxifen’s DNA-damaging ability modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, particularly through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-induced STING upregulation. We discovered key tamoxifen-mediated mechanisms for cGAS/STING-IFN-I pathway activation via STING upregulation, involving the tamoxifen–mtDNA–STING and tamoxifen–RACK7/KDM5C–STING axes. While IFN-I signaling can promote anti-tumor immunity, our tumor/T-cell co-culture experiments revealed that tamoxifen inactivates T-cells through tumor-intrinsic mechanisms, likely involving T-cell exhaustion pathways. We investigated tamoxifen’s effects on immune checkpoint molecules, finding that CEACAM1, the primary ligand for TIM3, was upregulated in cTMX-T47D and cTMX-MCF7 cells. Further analysis of tamoxifen-treated T47D xenografts revealed elevated CEACAM1 levels, suggesting an immunosuppressive mechanism via the CEACAM1-TIM3 pathway. To investigate this axis in vivo, we used syngeneic tumor mouse models with TS/A (ER+) cells in BALB/c mice. Tamoxifen induced CEACAM1, increased CD45+ immune cell infiltration, and caused TIM3+ CD8 T-cell exhaustion, contributing to tumor progression. Blocking the CEACAM1-TIM3 interaction with an anti-TIM3 antibody significantly inhibited tumor growth, highlighting its role in tamoxifen resistance.

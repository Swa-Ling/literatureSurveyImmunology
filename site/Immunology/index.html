        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is defined by granulomas— immune aggregates that either contain or support bacterial replication. Macrophages, fundamental components of these lesions, are crucial to TB pathogenesis, yet their phenotypic and functional diversity is incompletely understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence to profile macrophages in lung tissue and granulomas from a nonhuman primate model of early TB. We identified distinct subsets, including embryonic-origin tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived alveolar and interstitial macrophages, with distinct spatial localization in granulomas. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and a subset undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition accounted for the highest frequency of Mtb-infected cells. Infected cells exhibited differential expression of immune- and migration-associated genes compared to uninfected counterparts, suggesting Mtb either induces or exploits these pathways as a survival strategy. These findings highlight macrophage heterogeneity as a major driver of differential susceptibility to Mtb and provide insights relevant to future immunomodulatory strategies.">

        <tr id="Sensitization of the immune-suppressed tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer by histone deacetylase inhibition shows promise, but the mechanisms of sensitization are unknown. We investigated the TME of breast-to-lung metastases by combining experimental and clinical data with theory. Knowledge-guided subclustering of single-cell RNA-sequencing data and cell circuits analysis identified 39 cell states and salient interactions, of which myeloid, T cell and B cell subpopulations were most affected by treatment. Using functional immunologic assays, we verified that inhibition of the ICAM pathway partially recapitulated treatment effects. Mathematical modeling of tumor-immune dynamics confirmed that tumor reduction required simultaneous modulation of multiple TME interactions. We found evidence that treatment affected anti-tumor antibody production. Analysis of patient biopsies via spatial proteomics corroborated preclinical findings: in responders we observed increased B cell activation, mature tertiary lymphoid structures, and increased CD8+ T cell—macrophage distances with treatment. Overall, this study provides a framework for the discovery of cell-cell interactions that govern responses in complex TMEs. Statement of significance This study provides a framework for the discovery of cell-cell interactions that control responses in complex TMEs. We not only identify impactful tumor immunologic interactions that facilitate sensitization of the metastatic TME but also demonstrate how interdisciplinary data integration fuels cancer systems immunology to accelerate discovery of mechanisms of successful immunotherapeutic response in breast cancers and other previously unresponsive solid tumor types.">

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Although effective for immunologically hot tumors, immune checkpoint inhibitors minimally affect tumors that are not T cell inflamed, including breast cancer. An alternate strategy to combat immune cold breast tumors may be to reeducate innate immunity. This study identifies strategies to skew neutrophils to acquire tumoricidal properties. Systemic Toll-like receptor (TLR)–induced inflammation, concomitant with mitochondrial complex I inhibition in breast tumors, increases neutrophil cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells and independently of CD8+ T cell immunity. These therapy-entrained neutrophils enhance secretory granule production, increasing expression of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase machinery and inducing a respiratory burst. Moreover, systemic administration of TLR agonists elevates nuclear factor κB signaling in neutrophils to increase production of secretory granule and NADPH oxidase machinery components, whereas complex I inhibitors are required to potentiate oxidative damage. In summary, we describe a class of neutrophils, educated by the combined action of inflammatory mediators and metabolic inhibitors, having tumoricidal functions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, are marked by systemic inflammation, T-cell exhaustion, lymphopenia, and chronic immune dysfunction, with limited therapeutic options for recovery. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a naturally occurring feline coronavirus infection, mirrors these immune pathologies, providing a valuable translational model. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapy combined with antiviral treatment in cats with effusive FIP. Hematologic, virologic, and immunologic analyses were conducted over 12 weeks. Antiviral therapy reduced cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion by downregulating inhibitory receptors PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3. MSC-treated cats demonstrated enhanced immune recovery, evidenced by reduced expression of exhaustion-related transcription factors (IKZF2, ZEB2, PRDM1) and increased regulatory T-cell populations, promoting immune homeostasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of mesenteric lymph nodes revealed transcriptomic shifts indicative of immune rejuvenation, including elevated memory T-cell markers (IKZF1, GZMK, IL7R) and reduced hyperproliferative lymphocyte subsets. Serum cytokine analysis revealed 3 distinct inflammatory mediator patterns using principal component analysis. Both treatment groups showed transitions toward cytokine profiles resembling those of healthy controls. Notably, residual cytokine elevations persisted at the study’s end, mirroring features of chronic immune dysregulation. PDGF-bb, a marker of tissue repair, was uniquely associated with higher lymphocyte counts, suggesting its role in lymphoid recovery. This study highlights the potential of MSC therapy to modulate immune dysfunction and support durable immune recovery. The findings underscore its translational relevance for addressing severe viral diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, advancing both veterinary and human medicine.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and associated receptors remains poorly characterized. We applied a single-cell multi-omics approach (CITE-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy donors, before and after in vitro TNF stimulation. Using integrated analysis of surface protein expression and transcriptomic data, we focused on phenotypic and transcriptional changes in dendritic cell populations. DCs from RA patients exhibited elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, indicative of an inflammatory phenotype, and showed marked responsiveness to TNF. Upon stimulation, RA-derived DCs upregulated genes involved in antigen presentation (CD83, LAMP3), lymph node migration (CCR7, ADAM19), and inflammation (TRAF1, IL24) whereas such activation was absent in healthy controls. Our data reveal a TNF-responsive, pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in dendritic cells from RA patients and underscore the relevance of the TNF receptor profile in shaping DC function. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of RA and identify dendritic cells as potential targets for personalized immunomodulatory therapy.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (TINs) are highly heterogeneous and mostly immunosuppressive in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Current biomarkers of TINs and treatment strategies targeting TINs have not yielded optimal responses in patients across cancer types. Here, we separated human and mouse neutrophils into three developmental stages, including promyelocyte (PM), myelocyte & metamyelocyte (MC & MM), and banded & segmented (BD & SC) neutrophils. Based on this separation, we observed the predominance of human but not mouse MC & MM-stage neutrophils in bone marrow (BM), which exhibit potent immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting properties. MCs & MMs also occupy the majority of TINs among patients with 17 cancer types. Moreover, through the creation of a NCG-Gfi1-/- human immune system (HIS) mouse model, which supports efficient reconstitution of human TIN, we found a significant increase of BM MCs & MMs in tumor-bearing mice. By comparing the scRNA-seq analysis results of human neutrophils from both BM and tumors, we found CD63 and Galectin-3 distinguish MC & MM from neutrophil populations in cancer patients. Furthermore, we proposed a strategy with Flt3L to specifically induce the trans-differentiation of MCs & MMs into monocytic cells, and trigger tumor control in NCG-Gfi1-/- HIS mice. Thus, our findings establish an essential role of human MC & MM-stage neutrophils in promoting cancer progression, and suggest their potential as targets for developing potential biomarkers and immunotherapies for cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a critical therapeutic strategy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, relapse remains a major challenge, with limited effective options for managing post-transplant recurrence. Tumor cells escape immune surveillance by establishing a complex, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a central role in immune evasion and disease relapse. Understanding the TME’s impact on immune cells and their functional alterations is therefore of significant clinical importance. Methods Utilizing a non-irradiated AML mouse model and bioinformatic analysis, we systematically analyzed T-cell dynamics during AML progression and identified abnormal metabolic activation in CD8+ T cells at early disease stages, which correlated with leukemia cell immune evasion. Result We found that when major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on AML cells were haplomatched with immune cells, CD8+ T cells exhibited robust cytokine and cytotoxic activation, retaining immune profiles similar to those of normal T cells. However, under the same tumor burden, T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, showed dramatic metabolic gene activation in MHC-matched leukemic mice. This metabolic activation led to rapid exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, accelerating leukemia progression. Based on these activated metabolic genes, we established a metabolism-associated genes (MAGs) scoring system. Validation using public datasets revealed that a high MAG score is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Conclusions Our findings provide molecular evidence supporting the stronger graft-versus-leukemia effects observed in HLA haploidentical HSCT. Moreover, they highlight that abnormal metabolic activation in CD8+ T cells during early AML progression contributes to rapid disease advancement and poor prognosis.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) occurs as the third most common cancer with high mortality across the world. Understanding the intratumoral immune cell heterogeneity and their responses to various therapies is crucial for enhancing patient outcomes. This study aimed to characterise and evaluate the immune microenvironment landscapes of CRC shaped by different therapies including CD73 inhibitor, PD‐1 blockade and photothermal therapy (PTT). Our investigation revealed that three therapies could commonly modulate the down‐regulation of Treg, M2 macrophage and Ptprj+ G4 granulocyte, up‐regulation of effector/memory T cell, M1 macorphage and Hilpda+ G1 granulocyte. Moreover, we identified the uniquely dis‐regulated cell types and pathway activities response to each therapy, such as CD73 inhibitor enriched more Cd8+ memory and central memory (CM) cell, PD‐1 blockade with more Cd8+ CTL and Cxcl3+ G2 granulocyte, and PTT with more Cd8+ effector memory and Rethlg+ G3 granulocyte cell. These responses disordered the glycolysis, angiogenesis, phagocytosis functions and cellular communication to reshape the CRC tumour immune microenvironment. We provide the detail insights into the intratumoral immunomodulation preferences of CRC mice treated with CD73 inhibitor, PD‐1 blockade and PTT therapies, which might contribute to the ongoing development of more effective anticancer strategies.">

We identify a subset of EGR1+ CD14+ monocytes in patients with scleroderma renal crisis (SRC). This subset activates NF-kB signaling and differentiates into tissue-damaging macrophages, which accumulate at sites of tissue injury. Furthermore, we identify a CD8+ T cell subset with type II interferon signature in the peripheral blood and the lung tissue of patients with progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD), suggesting that chemokine-driven migration of these cells contributes to ILD progression. Thus, our single-cell analysis reveals distinct immune cell abnormalities associated with clinical organ manifestations, providing insights into tailored treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is characterized by high incidence and recurrence rates, presenting as an immune ‘cold’ tumor that exhibits a poor response to immunotherapy. The mechanisms underlying immune suppression and evasion within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of PCa remain inadequately understood. Methods A comprehensive analysis of the immune environment in PCa was conducted using combined single-cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches, encompassing samples from healthy tissue, adjacent normal tissue, and localized tumors. Cell abundance and polarization state analyses were performed to identify pivotal cellular populations. Spatial deconvolution techniques were employed to elucidate cell composition within its spatial context. Additionally, cell niche and spatial colocalization analyses were conducted to evaluate potential cellular interactions. Immune response enrichment analysis was utilized to assess cellular response states. In vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to validate hypotheses. Results Data indicated a prevalent immunosuppressive state among CD8 T cells, accompanied by variations in cell abundance. Macrophages emerged as key regulators in recruiting CD8+ effector T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) into the TME, mediated by the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. A spatial proximity relationship was established between CD8+ effector T cells and Tregs, suggesting Tregs directly influence CD8+ T cell function. Immune cell state analysis revealed interleukin-2 (IL-2) as a critical cytokine in reshaping the immune microenvironment, with Tregs competitively depleting IL-2 and mediating IL-2/STAT5 signaling to induce CD8+ effector T cell exhaustion. Treatment with CXCR4 inhibitor and IL-2 demonstrated significant antitumor effects and reversed immune dysfunction in both in vivo and in vitro experiments, with combined treatment exhibiting superior efficacy. Conclusion These findings elucidate the role of macrophages in mediating the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis to aggregate CD8+ effector T cells and Tregs, thereby influencing the TME. Furthermore, Tregs competitively deplete IL-2 and mediate IL-2/STAT5 signaling, leading to CD8+ effector T cells exhaustion and the establishment of an immunosuppressive microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside in the lower airways and play a crucial role in lung health and response to sterile inflammation and infections. AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-Glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of central trained immunity by reprogramming haematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan in mice induces peripheral trained immunity by reprogramming AMs in the lungs, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (lipopolysaccharide) or viral (polyI:C) challenges via a neutrophil/IFN-γ-dependent manner. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.">

        <tr id="Patients with lymphoma are at increased risk of severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, due to immune suppression. Using multidimensional spectral flow cytometry and serology, we characterized in-depth immune responses in 50 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated lymphoma patients across12 lymphoma subtypes, treated with anti-CD20 antibody (aCD20) ± chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. Compared to healthy control, aCD20±CT-treated patients exhibited distinct immune alterations, including elevated late-stage effector memory (EM3) CD4+, and terminally differentiated (EMRA) CD8+ T cells, reduced circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, and increased dysfunctional DN3 B cells. While B cell depletion was expected with aCD20 therapy, our data reveals broader immune dysregulation beyond B cell loss. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, aCD20±CT treated patients showed impaired vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses. In contrast, CT-only Hodgkin lymphoma patients maintained antibody responses comparable to healthy controls. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in aCD20±CT treated patients displayed fewer regulatory T cells, increased Th1 population, and more EMRA CD8+ T cells, suggesting a compensatory T-cell mediated immunity. Antibody response correlated positively with naïve T cell frequencies and transitional, classical memory, and DN2 B cell subsets. These findings inform the tailored development of vaccine strategies for immunocompromised patients to enhance protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral pathogens.">

How MCPyV spatially modulates immune responses within the tumor microenvironment and how such are linked to patient outcomes remains unknown. We interrogated the cellular and transcriptional landscapes of 60 MCC-patients using a combination of multiplex proteomics, in-situ RNA-hybridization, and spatially oriented transcriptomics. We identified a spatial co-enrichment of activated CD8+ T-cells and CXCL9+PD-L1+ macrophages at the invasive front of virus-positive MCC. This spatial immune response pattern was conserved in another virus-positive tumor, HPV+ head-and-neck cancer. Importantly, we show that virus-negativity correlated with high risk of metastasis through low CD8+ T-cell infiltration and the enrichment of cancer-associated-fibroblasts at the tumor boundary. By contrast, responses to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) were independent of viral-status but correlated with the presence of a B-cell-enriched spatial contexts. Our work is the first to reveal distinct immune-response patterns between virus-positive and virus-negative MCC and their impact on metastasis and ICB-response.">

        <tr id="Age-related thymic involution leads to diminished output of naïve T-cells. While this process is suggested to increase the risk of disease severity in the elderly following infection, direct evidence is lacking. We developed two mouse models that allow us to experimentally prevent or reverse thymic involution. Constitutive Myc expression in thymic epithelial cells (TEC) of middle-aged mice enhanced thymic function, and increased numbers of peripheral naïve CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Inducible Myc expression reversed age-related thymic involution and partially recovered peripheral naïve T-cell numbers. Importantly, improving thymic function in these settings preserved T-cell-dependent antibody responses and significantly reduced T-cell-associated mortality after infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Improved thymic function also rebalanced age-associated alterations in the Treg pool, and mitigated loss of the transcriptional Th1 signature in aged conventional T-cells. Our findings support the value of TEC-focused thymic regeneration strategies for enhancement of T-cell-mediated immunity in the elderly.">

        <tr id="Introduction End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing worldwide, and although kidney transplantation improves survival, long-term graft loss–driven mainly by immune-mediated rejection–remains common. We aimed to delineate immune mechanisms that distinguish recipients with stable versus impaired graft function. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from kidney-transplant recipients with normal (n = 10) or impaired (n = 10) renal function were profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing. Fourteen immune populations were identified; CD4+ T-cell “stemness” was quantified using mRNAsi and EREG_mRNAsi indices, lineage trajectories were reconstructed with Monocle, and ligand–receptor communication was inferred with iTalk. Findings were validated in an independent bulk RNA-seq cohort (n = 192) using differential expression and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Results Recipients with graft dysfunction exhibited (i) expansion of Th17 cells and contraction of Treg cells, (ii) significant loss of CD4+ T-cell stem-like features (lower mRNAsi/EREG_mRNAsi, p < 0.001), and (iii) pseudotime trajectories skewed toward Th17 differentiation. iTalk revealed enhanced S100A8/A9-TLR4 signalling from myeloid cells to neutrophils, consistent with reduced circulating neutrophils and presumptive intragraft accumulation. Bulk validation confirmed the stemness deficit and identified eight hub genes (API5, CAPRIN1, CCT2, DLG1, NMD3, RDX, SENP7, S100A4) that correlated with both low stemness and poor clinical outcome. Pathway enrichment implicated cell-morphogenesis, tight-junction, and metabolic-homeostasis pathways in graft injury. Discussion Integrative single-cell and bulk analyses link diminished CD4+ T-cell stemness, Th17-dominant polarization, and S100A4-mediated neutrophil recruitment to graft dysfunction. These signatures nominate stemness indices, Th17/Treg balance, and the S100-TLR4 axis as candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets to preserve allograft integrity and prolong transplant survival.">

Advances in high-parameter immunophenotyping, single-cell multiomics profiling, and spatial multiomics have redefined SLE pathogenesis, revealing stage-specific immune network perturbations. These discoveries have propelled mechanism-driven therapeutic strategies, including CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy for B cell depletion, disruption of T–B cell synaptic signaling (CD40L inhibitors), and restoration of pDC tolerance (anti-BDCA2 antibodies). While patient heterogeneity poses challenges for universal therapeutic efficacy, emerging strategies integrating molecular endotyping and cellular biomarkers hold promise for overcoming these limitations. By aligning targeted therapies with the immunophenotypic signatures of individual patients, precision medicine approaches are expected to optimize treatment efficacy, minimize off-target effects, and ultimately enhance long-term clinical outcomes in SLE.

This review dissects the developmental pathways and functional specializations of diverse DC subsets—including cDC1, cDC2, pDCs, DC3s, tDCs, moDCs, and emerging RORγt+ antigen‐presenting cells (APCs)—and explores how the tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamically reprograms these cells. Immunosuppressive cytokines, metabolic stress, hypoxia, and altered lipid metabolism can induce tolerogenic phenotypes such as mregDCs and ISG+ DCs, dampening antigen presentation and T‐cell activation. We detail how specific DC subsets interact with the TME—either reinforcing immune evasion or promoting antitumor immunity—depending on their transcriptional states and spatial organization. Emphasis is placed on recent findings from spatial transcriptomics and single‐cell studies that reveal key DC–T cell niches critical for immune control. Furthermore, we evaluate current and emerging therapeutic strategies that aim to restore DC functionality or exploit their antigen‐presenting capabilities, including mRNA vaccines, receptor‐targeted delivery, CD40 agonists, and in situ cellular reprogramming. By integrating mechanistic insights with clinical advances, this review underscores the potential of context‐aware, subset‐specific DC interventions to overcome immune suppression and enhance cancer immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play dual roles in cancer, either promoting or suppressing tumor progression, complicating therapeutic approaches. TAMs include recruited macrophages (recMacs), derived from circulating monocytes, and tissue-resident interstitial macrophages (IMs). We recently identified a heterogeneous population of chemokine-expressing IMs, including subsets that support tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation during lung inflammation. Here, we show that IMs can be either pro- or anti-tumorigenic, depending on the subset. Using Pf4 Cx3cr1 mice to deplete CD206hi IMs expressing Cxcl13, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10, we demonstrate their essential role in TLS formation, lymphocyte recruitment, and tumor suppression in melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma. In contrast, Ccl2-expressing IMs promote tumor growth by recruiting pro-tumorigenic recMacs. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the distinct localization and chemokine profiles of these subsets. Finally, CCR5 blockade with the FDA-approved inhibitor Maraviroc during neoantigen vaccination improved tumor control by preventing the migration of immunosuppressive, antigen-presenting recMacs (moDCs). These findings support the development of macrophage-targeted therapies by identifying pro-tumorigenic subsets and recMac trafficking as actionable targets, while preserving macrophage populations that sustain anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Background This study aims to explore the common mechanisms between aging and the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods A total of 87 patients with AS and matched controls were analyzed via multidimensional flow cytometry to examine the peripheral blood immune signature. Single-cell RNA sequencing was employed to characterize T-cell subsets. The infiltration of Ly49h + cells (the murine homolog of NKG2C) was observed in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model, and functional experiments were conducted to validate the cytotoxicity of NKG2C + CD8 + T cells. The mechanisms were further confirmed via the use of HLA-B27 transgenic mice and RNA-sequencing. Results The peripheral blood immune signature of AS patients exhibited dysregulation similar to that observed during aging. NKG2C + CD8 + T cells activated the PI3K‒Akt signaling pathway and increased phagocytosis in AS patients. HLA-B27 stimulation significantly increased the cytotoxicity of this subset, an effect that could be reversed by NKG2C blockade. In HLA-B27 transgenic mice, Ly49h + T cells exhibited significantly enhanced degranulation ability. RNA sequencing validated the activation of the PI3K‒Akt pathway in NKG2C + CD8 + T cells by HLA-B27. Conclusions HLA-B27 drives the cytotoxicity of aging-related NKG2C + CD8 + T cells via activation of the PI3K‒Akt signaling pathway. Targeting NKG2C inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for AS. This study elucidates the association between immune aging and the pathogenesis of AS, providing theoretical evidence for clinical intervention.

Using single-cell technology, we analyzed infected pig spleens and found macrophages—a type of immune cell—to be the virus’s primary target. Infection depletes disease-fighting cells while favoring virus-supportive conditions. We identified four macrophage subtypes, including one highly susceptible to infection and another with antiviral properties that is rapidly destroyed. The viral E165R gene was essential for ASFV replication while disrupting host defense signals. By tracking cellular changes, we revealed how macrophages drive ASFV progression. Our findings offer insights for future therapies against this global threat.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a debilitating neglected tropical disease characterized by lesions that can range from self-healing to permanent disfigurations. A predominant Th1 response, which stimulates IFN-γ production, is crucial for parasite control during self-healing CL. While IFN-γ primarily activates macrophages to produce nitric oxide via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) leading to parasite control, IFN-γ also activates other downstream pathways involved in cell autonomous immunity. One such pathway is the activation of guanylate binding proteins (GBPs), a class of interferon inducible GTPases. However, the role of GBPs during CL has been minimally explored. Utilizing RNA-Seq we found that Leishmania major infection leads to the upregulation of several GBPs in C57Bl/6 mice. In vitro studies using GBPChr3 knockout (KO), and C57Bl/6 control mice reveal that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from KO mice exhibit higher parasite burdens following IFN-γ treatment, independent of GBP localization to the parasite. Single-cell RNA-Seq identifies macrophages as the primary expressers of GBPs during L. major infection in vivo. In vivo, GBPChr3 KO mice display increased disease severity and parasite load. GBPChr3 KO macrophages and monocytes show elevated ARG-1 and reduced iNOS expression, indicating a shift toward a parasite-permissive environment that supports parasite growth. These findings highlight a critical role for GBPs in immune-mediated control of CL.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neonates have increased vulnerability to life-threatening infections due to the distinct immune landscape. Interleukin (IL)-27 is a key component of this immune profile that we have previously shown to be elevated in both newborn humans and mice. IL-27 continues to increase in the serum and tissues consistent with poor outcomes during gram-negative neonatal bacterial sepsis. Presently, we dissected the IL-27 producer profile at a single-cell level using IL-27p28eGFP reporter mice in our previously established model of neonatal sepsis with luciferase-expressing K1-encapsulated Escherichia coli. Whole animal imaging regionally highlighted the spleen, liver, and lungs as key infection sites by bacterial luminescence. Flow cytometry showed that IL-27 producers increased significantly in the liver with infection and were predominantly F4/80+ and CD11b+ with subpopulations that emerged expressing additional markers. This information paired with single-cell RNA sequencing further identified the most robust populations as monocytes, monocyte-derived cells, and Kupffer cells followed by smaller populations of dendritic cells and neutrophils. The transcriptome demonstrated a diverse range of functionality amongst populations that included differential expression of genes implicated in bactericidal, metabolic, and inflammatory changes. Collectively, the transcriptome of IL-27 producers from the livers of infected animals suggests an uncoordinated mix of inflammatory and suppressive activity that may contribute to immune dysregulation characteristic of sepsis. Together, this work provides previously undescribed insight into the details of IL-27 producers during early-life infection. This further provides essential information needed to support IL-27 as a therapeutic target for neonatal bacterial sepsis.">

        <tr id="Despite the success of chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy in hematological malignancies, durable remissions remain low. Here, we report CART senescence as a potential resistance mechanism in 41BB-costimulated CART cell therapy. To mimic cancer relapse, we utilized an in vitro model with repeated CART cell activation cycles followed by rest periods. Using CD19-targeted CART cells with costimulation via 4-1BB-CD3ζ (BBζ) or CD28-CD3ζ (28ζ), we showed that CART cells undergo functional, phenotypical, and transcriptomic changes of senescence, which is more prominent in BBζ. We then utilized two additional independent strategies to induce senescence through MYC activation and irradiation. Induction of senescence impaired BBζ activity but improved 28ζ activity in preclinical studies. These findings were supported by analyses of independent patient data sets; senescence signatures in CART cell products were associated with non-response to BBζ but with improved clinical outcomes in 28ζ treatment. In summary, our study identifies senescence as a potential mechanism of failure predominantly in 41BB-costimulated CART cells.

        <tr id="Introduction Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is an effective treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, yet the mechanisms underlying immune reset and sustained remission remain incompletely understood. This study provides a longitudinal immune profiling of patients undergoing AHSCT, with a specific focus on immune reconstitution at two years post-AHSCT. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 22 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients at baseline and multiple time points post-AHSCT. Immune reconstitution was characterized using high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry to assess phenotypic changes in B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells. Results AHSCT led to profound alterations in immune cell populations. B-cell recovery was marked by a rapid expansion of naïve B cells, while memory B cells and plasmablasts remained depleted. Notably, patients with evidence of inflammatory disease activity (EIDA) post-AHSCT exhibited higher pre-transplant frequencies of non-switched IgD+IgM+ memory B cells, raising the possibility of a potential biomarker for treatment response. Myeloid-cell reconstitution showed a decline in classical monocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, potentially shifting the immune balance toward a more tolerogenic state. CD4 T-cell reconstitution demonstrated a shift from central memory (Tcm) to effector memory (Tem) phenotypes, with a selective depletion of polyfunctional Th1/Th17cells lacking PD-1 expression. Clusters enriched for PD-1+ Tem CD4 T cells appeared to differ between patients with and without EIDA. Furthermore, an increase in atypical naïve CCR7⁻CD62L⁻ CD4 T cells was observed in EIDA patients, raising questions about their role in the pathophysiology of MS. CD8 T-cell reconstitution followed a similar pattern, with a shift from a naïve/Tcm-dominant to a Tem-skewed population, albeit with substantial interpatient variability. Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells showed a sustained decrease, possibly reflecting microbiota alterations post-transplant. Conclusions Taken together, these findings provide an exploratory characterization of immune reconstitution following AHSCT, highlighting candidate biomarkers and mechanisms that warrant validation in larger cohorts to guide patient stratification and monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.">

        <tr id="Background Bladder cancer (BLCA) remains heavily dependent on bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy due to the profound heterogeneity of its tumor microenvironment (TME) and deregulated metabolic landscapes. Taurine metabolism (TM) is a pivotal axis in BLCA, exhibiting dual roles in tumor progression and immune evasion. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms by which TM reprogramming fosters immunosuppression is imperative for advancing BLCA immunotherapy. Methods This study employed an integrative approach combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics (ST), and bulk transcriptome analyses to unravel taurine metabolic dysregulation in the BLCA TME. Computational frameworks such as Seurat and Monocle 3 were used to characterize cellular subpopulations, reconstruct differentiation trajectories, and model intercellular signaling networks. A taurine metabolic dysregulation index (TMs) was developed using TCGA cohorts, with survival modeling and machine learning methodologies deployed to assess its prognostic utility. Immuno-infiltration patterns and immunotherapeutic responsiveness were quantified via algorithms including ESTIMATE and TIDE. Mechanistic validation was achieved through co-culture systems. Results ScRNA-seq profiling revealed significant perturbations in TM scores across epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages within the BLCA TME. High TMs clusters were enriched for Notch signaling and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance pathways. Spatial transcriptomics analyses highlighted spatiotemporal heterogeneity in taurine metabolic gene expression. The TMs index emerged as an independent prognostic biomarker, with high TMs patients demonstrating significantly shorter overall survival and synergistic prognostic deterioration in the context of high tumor mutational burden (TMB). High TMs tumors exhibited enrichment of immunosuppressive cell compartments and elevated immune checkpoint molecule expression. Mechanistically, FAAH knockdown in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) attenuated co-cultured BLCA cell viability, potentially mediated by CCL15 secretion. Conclusion This study establishes that taurine metabolic dysregulation reconfigures intercellular signaling within the BLCA TME, driving immunosuppression and tumor progression. The TMs framework enables robust patient stratification and provides a mechanistic rationale for therapeutic strategies targeting TM in conjunction with immune checkpoint inhibitors, thus paving the way for advanced precision medicine approaches in BLCA.">

        <tr id="Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly prevalent and deadly disease that is largely refractory to immunotherapy. The only CRC subset that responds to these therapies is characterized by prevalent microsatellite instability (MSI), extensive  CD8+ T cell infiltration and high expression of innate immune signaling pathways. Endogenous activation of the cGAS/STING pathway is essential for this CD8+ T cell antitumor response in MSI CRCs, suggesting that activating it in other CRCs could boost immunotherapy response rates. In contrast, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is typically associated with tumor-promoting inflammation although this has primarily been studied in immune cells. Methods We used a mixture of flow cytometry, activation assays, in vivo orthotopic models and patient-derived organoids to investigate the effect of NLRP3 activation in CRC cells on cGAS/STING-mediated antitumor immunity. Results Our results show that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome specifically in CRC cells boosts cGAS/STING signaling in both MSI and non-MSI CRCs and that dual stimulation increases CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. The ability of NLRP3 to enhance cGAS/STING signaling was specific and did not occur with activation of other innate immune pathways such as AIM2 or TLRs. Enhancement of cGAS/STING signaling by NLRP3 proceeded via a positive feedback loop that was inflammasome-independent and required early crosstalk between the signaling mediators and regulation of their gene expression. Conclusions Activation of NLRP3 specifically in CRC cells could be a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity in otherwise immunotherapy resistant CRCs.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT NK cells are critical for immunosurveillance, yet become dysfunctional when chronically stimulated by virally infected or cancerous cells. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less characterized, limiting therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, with remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3‐expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating, and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="By balancing immunity and tolerance, dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of immune responses. Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of these cells in connective tissue diseases. Conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) exhibit distinct contributions to disease progression. In systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, pDCs primarily drive pathogenesis via excessive type I interferon production, whereas in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cDCs play a major role in promoting autoreactive T cell activation. Emerging DC subsets, such as inflammatory DC3s and LAMP3+ DCs, have been implicated in RA synovitis. In vasculitis, tissue-resident vascular DCs appear to regulate localized inflammation. Despite advances in single-cell analysis, the functional roles of specific DC subsets remain underexplored in several autoimmune conditions. Understanding DC heterogeneity and function in disease-specific contexts may lead to novel therapeutic strategies targeting DC-mediated immune dysregulation.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms by which Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) infection leads to acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a severe neurological condition characterized by sudden muscle weakness and paralysis, remain poorly understood. To investigate the cellular tropism and infection dynamics of EV-D68, we profiled naive and EV-D68-infected human spinal cord organoids (hSCOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Examining the cellular composition of healthy hSCOs, we found that hSCOs comprise diverse cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and multipotent glial progenitor cells (mGPCs). Upon infection with two EV-D68 strains, US/IL/14-18952 (a B2 strain) and US/MA/18-23089 (a B3 strain), we observed distinct viral tropism and host transcriptional responses. Notably, US/IL/14-18952 showed a significant preference for neurons, while US/MA/18-23089 exhibited higher rates of infection in cycling astrocytes and OPCs. These findings provide novel insights into the host cell tropism of EV-D68 in the spinal cord, offering insight into the potential mechanisms underlying AFM pathogenesis. Understanding the dynamics of infection at single-cell resolution will inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the neurological impact of enteroviral infections.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) significantly contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and targeted inhibition of MDSCs is a potential therapeutic strategy against cancer. Here, we identify macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as a critical regulator of MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression in breast cancer. The present study demonstrates that MARCO is expressed on MDSCs, and breast tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) enriched with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promote MDSC differentiation and amplify immunosuppressive activity by up-regulating MARCO. Genetic ablation of MARCO in a murine breast cancer model attenuated tumor growth, accompanied by reduced monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) and total tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), along with enhanced infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Furthermore, we developed a specific MARCO down-regulation-promoting monoclonal antibody that impeded TDE-induced MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression. In vivo, MARCO down-regulating antibody suppressed tumor growth and reprogrammed the TME by diminishing immunosuppressive MDSCs and TAMs and revitalizing CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Strikingly, combining the MARCO down-regulating antibody with PD-1 blockade synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. This work establishes MARCO as a key regulator of MDSC-mediated immunosuppression and presents a compelling case for the inclusion of MARCO as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Both intrinsic and microenvironmental factors contribute to the genesis and progression of leukemia. Dendritic cells (DCs) are important members of the immunomicroenvironment. The immature DCs (imDCs) and regulatory DCs (DCregs) participate in the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that play adverse role in tumor progression. However, the characteristics of DCs in leukemia microenvironment have not been well established. Here, we identified a novel CD11c+MHCIIlo DC population (T-DC) accumulated in the mouse splenic T-ALL microenvironment. T-DCs exhibited an immature phenotype as they were characterized by low expression of MHCII molecules and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD86, CD83 and CD40. Database analysis revealed that low level expression of DC maturation-associated genes correlated with poor prognosis in leukemia patients. Furthermore, T-DCs promoted T-ALL progression contributed by their attenuated phagocytosis and CD4+ T cell activation potential. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that T-DCs expressed low level of genes related to maturation and antigen processing. T-DCs showed similar expression pattern with DCregs and expressed high levels of immunosuppressive genes. In addition, single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated the heterogeneity of T-DCs, showing that they are mainly compose of cDC1s, cDC2s and macrophage-like DCs. Therefore, our findings uncover the critical role of a novel imDC subset in promoting leukemia progression through the suppression of T-cell immunity. These results may have significant implications for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies aiming at reversing immune evasion in leukemia and improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by pancytopenia and decreased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow, it can be either congenital or acquired, predominantly affecting adolescents and the elderly, with higher incidence in Asia compared to Europe and America. Current treatment options include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or immunosuppressive agents, yet proximately a third of patients fail to reach long-term survival. AA is primarily driven by immune-mediated destruction of HSPCs, initiated by self-activated T cells. Early stages feature a Th1 response, which later shifts to Th17 and effector memory CD8+ T cells. Key cytokines including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) play crucial roles in this immune dysregulation, influencing HSPCs and contributing to bone marrow failure. Furthermore, bone marrow macrophages (MΦ), particularly M1 subtype, are implicated in AA via the TNF-α/TNF-α receptor pathway, leading to T cell activating and subsequent HSPC damage. Interestingly, MΦ with high expression of IL-27Ra have been demonstrated to contribute to HSPC destruction in AA murine models. Beyond their role in thrombosis, platelets also participate in immune regulation. Some studies suggest that platelet may modulate T cell responses through mechanisms such as Akt-PGC1α-TFAM pathway or PF4-mediated activity, which could play a role in AA. However, direct evidence connecting platelet regulation to T cell-mediated HSPC damage is limited, and current research has largely focuses on CD8+ T cells. Moving forward, it is essential to investigate the interactions between platelets, CD4+ T cells, and mitochondrial energy metabolism. In this review, we propose that platelet-derived factors such as PF4 and TGFβ may activate mitochondrial pathways, influencing T cell activation and leading to HSPC destruction in AA. This hypothesis could provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AA and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies (Highlight).">

        <tr id="Background Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) triggers a dynamic immune response involving macrophages, However, the functional heterogeneity of these cells and the mechanisms through which they promote repair remain unclear. Although the neuropeptide CGRP has been shown to modulate macrophage phenotypes in other pathological contexts, its role in ICH recovery and white matter repair remains unexplored. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45 + cells from ICH mice (GSE167593 and GSE230414 datasets) identified macrophage subsets. Flow cytometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), behavioral assays, and immunofluorescence validated macrophage dynamics and white matter (WM) integrity. Bone marrow and skull analyses traced macrophage origins. The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was tested via intraperitoneal administration in ICH mice, with outcomes assessed through transcriptomics, ultrastructural imaging, and functional recovery. Results scRNA-seq revealed sustained accumulation of THBS1 + macrophages post-ICH, correlating with WM repair and neurological recovery. These macrophages exhibited pro-repair and remyelination gene signatures (e.g., Arg1, Tgm2). Bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, particularly skull-resident populations, served as the primary source of THBS1 + macrophages. CGRP, elevated in meninges and bone marrow post-ICH, drove macrophage polarization toward THBS + phenotypes. CGRP administration expanded THBS1-positive macrophages in the bone marrow and brain, improving WM integrity (reduced radial diffusivity, higher fractional anisotropy) and sensorimotor function. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed enhanced myelin regeneration (lower g-ratio) in CGRP-treated mice. Conclusions This study identifies a neuroimmune axis wherein CGRP promotes bone marrow-derived THBS1 + macrophages to facilitate WM repair and functional recovery after ICH. Targeting CGRP-macrophage signaling offers a therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery in hemorrhagic brain injury.

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells are well recognized for their role in immune regulation; however, their role in tissue regeneration is not fully understood. This study demonstrates such a role of Tregs in a published preclinical murine model of spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis (PF) expressing a human PF related mutation in the Surfactant Protein-C (SP-C) gene (SFTPCI73T). Genetic crosses of SP-CI73T mice with Foxp3GFP and Foxp3DTR lines were utilized to study Treg behavior during PF development. We found that FoxP3+Tregs accumulate during the transition from inflammation to fibrogenesis, peaking at 21-28 days after mutant SftpcI73T induction localizing to both perivascular and distal fibrotic lung regions. Diphtheria toxin mediated ablation of Tregs at 17 days worsened fibrosis and increased levels of TGFβ and inflammatory cytokines. Tregs expressed Th2 markers (Gata3+) and elaborated factors including amphiregulin (Areg) and Osteopontin (Spp1). Reductionist experiments showed that lung Tregs enhanced organoid formation when co-cultured with alveolar epithelial cells and adventitial fibroblasts, an effect size mimicked using Areg and Spp1 in combination. Our findings demonstrate that immune-mesenchymal-epithelial signaling crosstalk is present in the distal lung wherein Tregs play a protective role by limiting fibrosis and promoting tissue repair, highlighting their broader function beyond immune modulation in lung injury. HIGHLIGHTS In a preclinical model of spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis, regulatory T cells (Tregs) were found to infiltrate the lung coincident with the resolution of early injury and transition to fibrogenesis. Depletion of Tregs at this transition worsened lung injury and enhanced fibrogenesis. Tregs recovered from the fibrotic lung are Type 2 skewed – GATA3+ and produce growth factors (e.g. Amphiregulin, Osteopontin) that promote lung tissue repair in ex vivo organoid models.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Growing evidence links immune dysfunction, notably impaired IFNγ production, to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), but understanding of the immune phenotype in CPA patients remains limited. Methods To investigate this, we recruited 25 CPA patients and 25 controls with bronchiectasis, isolating immune cells from peripheral blood for detailed flow cytometric phenotyping at resting state and after ex vivo stimulation with the TLR2/Dectin-1 agonist Zymosan. Results CPA patients exhibited pronounced neutrophilia and a reduced frequency of conventional dendritic cell (DC) subsets at baseline compared to bronchiectasis controls. Post-stimulation, DC and monocyte subsets in CPA patients showed significantly lower expression of activation markers. Notably, cDC1s displayed reduced IL-12p40, TNFα, and CD86 expression. CPA patients with a history of tuberculosis (TB) had significantly higher frequencies of activated cDC1s. Machine learning analysis validated these immunological parameters as predictive of CPA status. Conclusion Our findings suggest that immune dysfunction in CPA involves DC and monocyte impairments, potentially contributing to IFNγ deficiency through reduced IL-12 production and co-stimulatory capacity in cDC1s. These results also hint at the presence of innate immune memory in CPA patients with prior TB. Our study advances understanding of the immune dysfunction underlying CPA.">

        <tr id="Background Chemotherapy is an integral part of the clinical management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), however, development of chemoresistance occurs frequently. Tumor sensitivity to treatment is known to be strongly influenced by the immune microenvironment, signifying the predictive potential of immune alterations. How tumor cells that acquire resistance may subsequently modulate the immune microenvironment it is still not well described. Here, we investigated immunomodulation in the context of acquired chemoresistance in TNBC, focusing on the role of the secretome. Methods Bulk RNA sequencing and multiplex cytokine profiling were performed on paclitaxel-resistant and -sensitive isogenic variants of TNBC cells to reveal resistance-associated secretome alterations. The immunomodulatory influence of the tumor cell secretome was investigated by exploring its effect on monocytes, macrophages (MΦs) and T cells derived from healthy blood donors. The influence on the immune cell phenotype and activity was evaluated by measuring molecular markers and performing functional assays. To validate the clinical relevance, we utilized longitudinal -omics data from breast cancer patients refractory to standard chemotherapy in the NeoAva clinical trial. CIBERSORT was applied to transcriptomics data to infer MΦ and T cell abundance in individual tumors upon treatment. To evaluate their association with the secretome profiles, patient-matched serum cytokine data were used. Results The acquisition of chemoresistance was accompanied by enhanced secretion of cytokines. Subsequently, the resistant cell secretome affected the abundance, phenotype and activity of immune cells. Specifically, it potentiated the recruitment of monocytes, facilitated the polarization of MΦs towards the immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype, and attenuated the activation of CD8+ T cells. Data from the NeoAva clinical cohort validated the enrichment of M2 MΦs and/or the depletion of M1 MΦs after treatment in the majority of residual tumors. The MΦ-associated changes counteracted CD8+ T cell abundance and were partially associated with the cytokine-enriched secretome. Conclusion Development of chemoresistance in BC is associated with alterations in the tumor secretome, which impairs immune activation and facilitates immunosuppression. Knowledge on the immune microenvironment in residual tumors after standard chemotherapy could aid in selecting rational treatment options for this group of patients.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer therapy, but their use is limited by the development of autoimmunity in healthy tissues as a side effect of treatment. Such immune-related adverse events (IrAE) contribute to hospitalizations, cancer treatment interruption, and even premature death. ICI-induced autoimmune diabetes mellitus (ICI-T1DM) is a life-threatening IrAE that presents with rapid pancreatic β-islet cell destruction leading to hyperglycemia and life-long insulin dependence. While prior reports have focused on CD8+ T cells, the role for CD4+ T cells in ICI-T1DM is less understood. We identify expansion of CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells expressing IL-21 and IFN-γ as a hallmark of ICI-T1DM. Furthermore, we show that both IL-21 and IFN-γ are critical cytokines for autoimmune attack in ICI-T1DM. Because IL-21 and IFN-γ both signal through JAK/STAT pathways, we reasoned that JAK inhibitors (JAKi) may protect against ICI-T1DM. Indeed, JAKi provide robust in vivo protection against ICI-T1DM in a mouse model that is associated with decreased islet-infiltrating Tfh cells. Moreover, JAKi therapy impaired Tfh cell differentiation in patients with ICI-T1DM. These studies highlight CD4+ Tfh cells as underrecognized but critical mediators of ICI-T1DM that may be targeted with JAKi to prevent this grave IrAE.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet its clinical efficacy remains limited to a subset of patients with specific tumor types. The present review provides a comprehensive analysis of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity from both local and systemic perspectives, with particular emphasis on CD8+ T cells as primary effectors. The review discusses how the complex trafficking between the tumor microenvironment (TME), surrounding lymphoid tissues and peripheral circulation creates multiple opportunities for tumors to evade immune surveillance. Within the TME, T-cell exclusion mechanisms, antigen specificity and the spectrum of T-cell exhaustion states, from progenitor exhausted T cells to terminally exhausted T-cell phenotypes, are reviewed. Beyond the local TME, the crucial roles of tumor-draining lymph nodes and tertiary lymphoid structures in maintaining sustainable antitumor immunity, as well as the significance of circulating T cells as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, are analyzed. This systemic perspective provides insights into the dynamic nature of antitumor immunity and suggests potential strategies for next-generation immunotherapies, including combination approaches targeting multiple immune compartments to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Imbalances in the gut microbiome have been linked to increased intestinal permeability and disease flares in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our study revealed that patients with flares of lupus nephritis (LN) and intestinal expansions of the anaerobic commensal, Ruminococcus gnavus (RG), displayed whole blood transcriptome profiles indicative of platelet, neutrophil, and myeloid cell activation, a profile reminiscent of sepsis. Serum analysis confirmed elevated serum levels of Platelet Factor 4 and neutrophil extracellular traps, which significantly correlated with levels of IgG-antibody to a novel lipoglycan (LG) produced by pathogenic RG strains, which was also documented in an independent LN cohort. To test for causality, in vivo mouse models further demonstrated that gut colonization with LG-producing RG strains, as well as a single intraperitoneal challenge with an LG preparation, caused platelet activation and megakaryocytosis in bone marrow and spleen. Mice colonized with RG strains that produce LG developed cellular infiltration of the kidneys by neutrophils and monocytes. Hence, RG expansions during renal flares may identify a specific LN flare endotype driven by thromboinflammatory mechanisms. Antibodies that arise from immune exposure to the RG lipoglycan may serve as a surrogate biomarker, helping to elucidate the impact of the relationship between gut microbiota communities and clinical outcomes in patients afflicted by LN.

        <tr id="Trained immunity represents a recent concept that elucidates the long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells, enabling them to adapt and respond more effectively to subsequent encounters with diverse pathogens. Initially recognized through the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine, Candida albicans infection, and β-glucan administration, this phenomenon challenges the traditional view that immune memory is exclusive to the adaptive immune system. Trained immunity is characterized by epigenetic and metabolic modifications in innate immune cells that facilitate enhanced responses to infections through mechanisms like chromatin remodeling and altered gene expression. This review focuses on the implications of trained immunity within the lung environment, which is constantly exposed to a plethora of pathogens and environmental irritants. We discuss the roles of various immune cell types, including alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, in mediating trained immunity and how these adaptations may influence pulmonary insults and disease. Furthermore, we highlight the potential for leveraging trained immunity to enhance vaccine efficacy and develop novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related lung conditions. As research progresses, understanding trained immunity in the lung could pave the way for innovative interventions that improve lung health and resilience against infections.">

Two molecular subtypes were identified based on 182 CTLE-associated genes, with 238 differentially expressed genes between them. A prognostic model was developed, identifying BST2 and DIRAS3 as key risk factors, and validated in multiple cohorts. The subtypes had distinct immune profiles, with Cluster 2 showing higher immune infiltration but a poorer prognosis. The model had a good predictive performance. High-risk patients had upregulated BST2 and DIRAS3, linked to immunosuppression and shorter survival. Knockdown experiments confirmed their roles in GBM cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, they promote immune evasion. BST2 and DIRAS3 could be therapeutic targets for HGG immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Immunosenescence describes the gradual remodeling of immune responses, leading to disturbed immune homeostasis and increased susceptibility of older adults for infections, neoplasia and autoimmunity. Decline in cellular immunity is associated with intrinsic changes in the T cell compartment, but can be further pushed by age-related changes in cells regulating T cell immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent inhibitors of T cell activation and function, whose induction requires chronic inflammation. Since aging is associated with low grade inflammation (inflammaging) and increased myelopoiesis, age-induced changes in MDSC induction and function in relation to T cell immunity were analyzed. Results MDSC numbers and functions were compared between “healthy” young and old adults, who were negatively diagnosed for severe acute and chronic diseases known to induce MDSC accumulation. MDSCs were either isolated from peripheral blood or generated in vitro from blood-derived CD14 cells. Aging was associated with significantly increased MDSC numbers in the monocytic- (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSC subpopulations. MDSCs could be induced more efficiently from CD14 cells of old donors and these MDSCs inhibited CD3/28-induced T cell proliferation significantly better than MDSCs induced from young donors. Serum factors of old donors supported MDSC induction comparable to serum factors from young donors, but increased immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs was only achieved by serum from old donors. Elevated immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs from old donors was associated with major metabolic changes and increased intracellular levels of neutral and oxidized lipids known to promote immunosuppressive functions. Independent of age, MDSC-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation required direct MDSC– T cell contact. Besides their increased ability to inhibit activation-induced T cell proliferation, MDSCs from old donors strongly shift the immune response towards Th2 immunity and might thereby further contribute to impaired cell-mediated immunity during aging. Conclusions These results indicate that immunosenescence of innate immunity comprises accumulation and functional changes in the MDSC compartment, which directly impacts T cell functions and contribute to age-associated impaired T cell immunity. Targeting MDSCs during aging might help to maintain functional T cell responses and increase the chance of healthy aging.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite causative links to lymphoproliferative disorders, little is known about early events governing KSHV infection in B lymphocytes. IL‐6 signaling plays a critical role in KSHV‐mediated disease, with human IL‐6 (hIL6) levels correlating with viral load and disease progression. This dynamic is even more complex due to the coexistence of hIL6 and KSHV‐encoded viral IL‐6 (vIL6) in these diseases. We hypothesize that hIL6 and vIL6 play critical, separable and collective roles in the early stages of KSHV infection in B cells. In this study, we use our ex vivo model of KSHV infection in human tonsil lymphocytes to investigate the relative contributions of vIL6 and hIL6 to early infection events in human B cells. We demonstrate that vIL6 and hIL6 collectively suppress KSHV infection in B cells restricting the distribution of KSHV within B cell subsets. We show that vIL6 manipulates hIL6 expression in a subset‐specific manner, and that vIL6 and hIL6 differentially influence the differentiation of germinal center and plasmablasts. Taken together, these results suggest a novel paradigm in which KSHV uses vIL6 to abrogate the GC‐mediated maturation pathway for antibody secreting cells that is driven by hIL6 signaling.">

        <tr id="Thyroid cancer (THCA) is profoundly influenced by its immune microenvironment, with dendritic cells (DCs) serving as key mediators of tumor-immune interactions. This study leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing and transcriptome RNA sequencing to analyze DC populations in THCA tissues. The results revealed significant disparities in DC distribution and function, with formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) emerging as a crucial factor associated with patient prognosis. Meta-analysis further validated the differential expression of FPR1, reinforcing its significance in THCA progression. Investigations into the TME highlighted the relationship between FPR1 and DC maturation and activation, elucidating the mechanistic basis for immune regulation. Experimental validation confirmed that Annexin A1 (ANXA1) interacts with FPR1 in DCs, promoting tumor progression through immune modulation. These findings advance the understanding of THCA immune mechanisms and underscore the potential of targeting the ANXA1-FPR1 axis as a novel approach for immunotherapy in THCA.

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer globally and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, following lung cancer. Despite the immune system’s capacity for tumor surveillance and elimination, CRC tumors can evade immune responses through complex mechanisms, ultimately escaping immune detection. T and B lymphocytes play a critical role in adaptive immunity against tumors, with T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, driving tumor elimination. Additionally, B cells contribute by producing tumor-specific antibodies, including various immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses that participate in immune modulation. However, the effectiveness of adaptive immunity in CRC is often limited due to tumor-driven immunosuppression. This study investigates the expression of T and B cell activation genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from CRC patients. A panel of 84 genes involved in T and B cell activation was analyzed to assess changes in expression using RT2 QPCR arrays. Additionally, we measured serum levels of the four IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) in CRC patients to explore possible alterations in humoral immunity. Compared to healthy controls, 5 genes were found to be downregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCL3 (fold regulation − 6.36), IL6 (fold regulation − 12.46), CSF2 (fold regulation − 7.50), CXCR3 (fold regulation − 3.01), and TNFSF14 (fold regulation − 4.90). Moreover, 13 genes were upregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCR3 (fold regulation 59.21), CD2 (fold regulation 3.07), CD27 (fold regulation 6.39), CD3G (fold regulation 4.15), CD8B (fold regulation 3.25), FAS (fold regulation 3.94), IL10 (fold regulation 39), IL18R1 (fold regulation 82.39), IL5 (fold regulation 20.4), LAG3 (fold regulation 19.88), MAP3K7 (fold regulation 4.07), TLR1 (fold regulation 6.45), and TLR6 (fold regulation 18.87). The serum levels of the four IgG subclasses were however statistically insignificant in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. Our findings provide insights into the adaptive immune dysfunction in CRC, offering a detailed profile of gene expression changes associated with T and B cell activation and antibody production. Understanding these dysregulations may enhance the development of targeted immunotherapies, potentially improving outcomes for CRC patients through more personalized immunomodulatory approaches.

Here, we describe that TH17 cytokines strongly inhibit expression of critical chemokines in epithelial tissues, which leads to blocking infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells into the colon, rendering resistance to DSS-induced colitis and colon cancer. We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of TH17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. Overall, our findings have identified a previously unrecognized critical gap between TH17 cytokines, epithelial chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration through a C/EBPβ-mediated pathway.">

        <tr id="Many autoimmune diseases exhibit a female sex bias in prevalence and severity, yet the mechanisms for this remain unclear. 17β-estradiol, a steroid sex hormone with established immunomodulatory roles, signals through the nuclear receptors ERα and ERβ, which are expressed by CD4+ T cells. Expression of ERβ is reduced in CD4+ T cells isolated from autoimmune disease patients, suggesting that dysregulated E2 signaling contributes to inflammation. We previously identified a novel role for ERβ in promoting the TGFβ-dependent differentiation of Foxp3+ Tregs, supporting the idea that ERβ has anti-inflammatory functions. In this study, we investigated the functional role of ERβ in effector T cells, which drive pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. We found that CD4+ T cells isolated from mice globally deficient in ERβ exhibit enhanced proliferation and Th1 polarization ex vivo, together with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. We also found that transfer of ERβ-KO T cells to immunodeficient mice results in significantly worse inflammation in a murine model of colitis. Together, these findings suggest that T cell-specific ERβ functions as a brake on T cell-mediated inflammation, thereby helping to maintain immune homeostasis.

        <tr id="Introduction Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a recently characterized subset of lymphocytes with critical effector and regulatory functions. Based on distinct phenotypic markers and cytokine secretion profiles, ILCs are classified into three subtypes: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) is characterized by heightened cytokine levels and dysregulated inflammatory responses, potentially affecting immune cell composition. In this study, we aimed to assess the frequency and absolute number of ILCs in the BM and peripheral blood (PB) of healthy individuals (HI) and compare them to those in MDS-BM. Methods ILC subsets were identified and quantified using multiparameter flow cytometry and histological analysis of BM and PB samples. Results ILC1 populations were consistently detected in all PB and BM samples. In contrast, ILC2 and ILC3 subsets were present in both BM and PB of healthy individuals but were largely absent in MDS-BM samples. Additionally, our findings suggest the existence of a potential maturation trajectory for BM-resident ILCs. Discussion These data indicate a disruption in the ILC maturation continuum within the MDS-affected BM compared to healthy BM, potentially contributing to the immunopathogenesis of MDS.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that plays a critical role in disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, exhibit dual functions, either promoting or suppressing tumor growth depending on their phenotype and interactions within the TME. The presence of immune evasion mechanisms, such as the loss of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression, upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, and metabolic reprogramming (hypoxia-induced glycolysis and lactate accumulation), further contributes to immune suppression and poor treatment responses. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, response rates remain highly variable, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven patient selection and combinatorial therapeutic strategies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of immune cells in the TME of HNSCC, discusses the mechanisms underlying immune escape, and explores emerging immunotherapeutic and epigenetic-targeting approaches aimed at enhancing antitumor immune responses and improving clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="The detection of cytosolic viral nucleic acids via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) activates multiple signaling pathways, leading to the production of interferons (IFNs), which are essential for host survival during viral infection. Precise control of PRR gene expression is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. Here, we showed that Mediator complex subunit 23 (Med23) is required for the precise production of the innate immune receptor RIG-I in response to RNA virus infection. Med23 deficiency markedly enhances the production of IFN-I, proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both multiple cell lines (MEFs, RAW264.7 cells, and HeLa cells) and mouse primary macrophages (bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs] and peritoneal macrophages [PEMs]) infected with RNA virus VSV or stimulated with poly(I:C). Myeloid-specific Med23 knockout mice were generated to test the critical role of Med23 in host resistance to VSV infection in vivo. Mechanistically, Med23 interacts with the transcription factor forkhead box O3 (Foxo3) to negatively regulate RIG-I, thereby modulating IFN-I signaling. Collectively, these findings elucidate a previously unrecognized role of Med23 as a gatekeeper of the RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune response and suggest a potential target for controlling viral infection.">

These effects were observed following the treatment of splenic mononuclear cells with erythroblast-conditioned media received from both healthy mice and mice subjected to hematopoiesis-activating conditions (hypoxia, blood loss, and hemolytic anemia), suggesting a common mechanism of action. Using flow cytometry, we elucidated that erythroblast-derived soluble products modulate T cell differentiation by promoting Treg development and increasing PD-1 surface expression on B cells. The immunoregulatory potential of erythroblasts is subpopulation-dependent: CD45+ erythroblasts respond to hemolytic stress by upregulating the surface expression of immunosuppressive molecules PDL1 and Galectin-9, while CD45- erythroblasts primarily increase TGFb production.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing natural killer (NK) cells has demonstrated success against hematological malignancies. Efficacy against solid tumors has been limited by poor NK cell survival and function in the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To enhance efficacy against solid tumors, stimulatory cytokines have been incorporated into CAR-NK cell therapeutic approaches. However, current cytokine strategies have limitations, including systemic toxicities, exogenous dependencies, and unwanted TME bystander effects. Here, we aimed to overcome these limitations by modifying CAR-NK cells to express a constitutively active interleukin (IL)-7 receptor, termed C7R, capable of providing intrinsic CAR-NK cell activation that does not rely on or produce exogenous signals nor activate bystander cells. Methods We examined persistence, antitumor function, and transcriptional profiles of CAR-NK cells coexpressing C7R in a novel tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) co-culture system and against hematologic and solid tumor xenografts in vivo. Results Peripheral blood NK cells expressing a CAR directed against the solid tumor antigen GD2 and modified with C7R demonstrated enhanced tumor killing and persistence in vitro compared with CAR-NK cells without cytokine support and similar functions to CAR-NK cells supplemented with recombinant IL-15. C7R.CAR-NK cells exhibited enhanced survival and proliferation within neuroblastoma TiME xenografts in vivo but produced poor long-term tumor control compared with CAR-NK cells supplemented with IL-15. Similar results were seen using C7R-expressing CD19.CAR-NK cells against CD19+leukemia xenografts. Gene expression analysis revealed that chronic signaling via C7R induced a transcriptional signature consistent with intratumor stressed NK cells with blunted effector function. We identified gene candidates associated with chronic cytokine-stressed NK cells that could be targeted to reduce CAR-NK cell stress within the solid TME. Conclusion C7R promoted CAR-NK cell survival in hostile TMEs independent of exogenous signals but resulted in poor antitumor function in vivo. Our data reveals the detrimental role of continuous IL-7 signaling in CAR-NK cells and provides insights into proper application of cytokine signals when attempting to enhance CAR-NK cell antitumor activity.">

        <tr id="Macrophages, as key sentinel cells of the innate immune system, can retain memory of prior stimulus exposure. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) plays a central role in maintaining trained immunity in vivo and can induce potent memory in macrophages. Such memory is associated with the formation of de novo enhancers that alter gene expression responses to subsequent stimuli. However, how such enhancers are maintained after cytokine exposure remains unclear. We report that durable IFNγ-induced enhancers can last for days after cytokine washout, yet the underlying persistence mechanism is not cell-intrinsic. IFNγ-treated macrophages continue to exhibit JAK/STAT signaling days after cytokine removal. Blocking IFNγ signaling with a JAK inhibitor or anti-IFNγ neutralizing antibodies after cytokine removal is sufficient to reverse IFNγ-induced enhancers and erase the potentiated state of the treated macrophages. Our findings suggest that epigenetic changes in macrophages do not inherently encode innate immune memory or a “potentiated” macrophage state, but in fact are themselves dependent on ongoing cytokine signaling. These findings suggest new possibilities for pharmacologic interventions to reverse aberrantly trained immune states associated with pathology.">

        <tr id="Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) typically present with widespread metastasis, obscuring a temporal understanding of tumor-immune dynamics. To address this, we perform multi-site global proteomics alongside matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. We order the protein expression profiles using an unbiased pseudotime analysis, recapitulating clinical observations of metastatic progression, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlates with immune cell infiltration, the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to counterbalance γδ T cell abundance, and an increased abundance of exhausted CD8⁺ T cells. The accumulation of Tregs at metastatic sites correlates with SNX8 expression, a critical regulator of the STING pathway. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruit Tregs via MHC class II, fostering an inflammatory phenotype with limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Together, our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with both localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC.">

        <tr id="Prolonged or broad-spectrum antibiotic courses are associated with intestinal dysbiosis and cytopenias, and depletion of hematopoietic progenitor populations following antibiotics is associated with loss of peripheral immune cells, leading to increased susceptibility to systemic infections. We evaluated the bone marrow hematopoietic compartment in a murine model of antibiotic exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a substantial and previously unrecognized depletion of bone marrow B cells at all stages of development in antibiotic-treated mice, further confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. Depletion of the microbiota was associated with rapid changes in the peripheral B cell compartment, yet fecal microbiota transfer did not rescue both peripheral and bone marrow B cells to a greater degree than natural recovery from antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic-mediated loss of B cell progenitors was secondary to enhanced apoptosis and occurred independent of disrupted systemic type I and II interferon signaling, previously implicated in the maintenance of other hematopoietic compartments. Instead, the depletion of pro-survival MYC signaling was implicated in the depletion of circulating lymphocytes and bone marrow B cell progenitor populations during antibiotic treatment. Further, in vitro exposure of bone marrow cells to antibiotics demonstrated significantly decreased viability of B cells. We conclude that both microbiota depletion and cytotoxic effects of prolonged broad spectrum antibiotic treatment disrupt cytokine and cell survival signaling critical for B cell progenitor maintenance. These results contribute to our understanding of the compartment-specific mechanisms by which the microbiota maintains the hematopoietic system and suggest critical pathways for maintenance of bone marrow progenitors during prolonged antibiotic treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly the human papillomavirus negative (HPV−) subset, have a dismal prognosis. Furthermore, patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) have a genetic predisposition with a 500-fold to 700-fold higher incidence of HNSCC. Thus, novel and more efficacious therapies are needed. As current immunotherapies often fail due to suppressive elements in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we developed a trispecific killer engager (TriKE) to direct multiple signals to natural killer (NK) cells to overcome the hypoxic TME. This TriKE is comprised of a camelid nanobody that binds to CD16 on NK cells, an interleukin (IL)-15 moiety, and another novel camelid nanobody that binds to the B7-H3 antigen, which is highly and specifically expressed on the tumor cell surface. Methods The B7H3 TriKE was generated using a mammalian expression system. Its functionality was evaluated using flow cytometry-based NK cell degranulation, cytokine production, proliferation and live cell imaging cytotoxicity assays. Models of acute and prolonged hypoxia (1% oxygen) were carried out to assess tumor killing. Tumor progression, NK cell persistence, and survival differences between IL-15-treated and TriKE-treated mice were studied using NOD-scidIL2Rgnull (NSG) mice engrafted with human HNSCC. Results High B7-H3 expression was found in HPV− HNSCC cell lines, even when the FA gene was knocked out, and The Cancer Genome Atlas patient data showed that high B7-H3 expression predicted poor survival in patients with HPV− HNSCC. Similar to the NK cell activity seen with healthy donors, the B7H3 TriKE enhanced activation, expansion and cytotoxicity of NK cells from patients with HPV− HNSCC, a target population for this therapeutic. Additionally, the B7H3 TriKE improved NK cell cytotoxicity in a three-dimensional spheroid model of HNSCC. In both acute and prolonged hypoxia (1% oxygen), the B7H3 TriKE mediated enhanced tumor killing, mitigating impairment of NK cell cytotoxicity in hypoxia. In vivo, the B7H3 TriKE-treated mice demonstrated substantial antitumor activity and prolonged survival. Conclusions The B7H3 TriKE is a novel immunotherapeutic approach that can overcome hypoxic suppression of NK cells in the HNSCC TME. These highly translational studies present an innovative therapy for patients with HNSCC and will be developed further for clinical application.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous group of immune cells that play a central role in regulating host immune responses during fungal infections. Their recruitment is mediated by pathogen recognition receptors, particularly Dectin-1 and CARD9 signaling, which promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-1β. Once activated, MDSCs suppress T-cell and natural killer cell functions through immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β, as well as enzymes such as arginase-1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1). This review explores the role of MDSCs in fungal infections caused by Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Aspergillus spp., and Cryptococcus neoformans, emphasizing their impact on immune modulation and disease progression. The emerging evidence suggests that fungal bioactive compounds, such as polysaccharides, can influence MDSC activity and restore immune balance. Notably, therapies targeting MDSCs have demonstrated promise in both fungal infections. In particular, infections with P. brasiliensis and C. neoformans show improved T-cell responses following MDSC-targeted interventions. Additionally, polysaccharides from Grifola frondosa and exposure to Aspergillus sydowii affect MDSC behavior, supporting the potential of modulating these cells therapeutically. Together, these findings highlight the relevance of MDSCs in fungal pathogenesis and underscore their potential as targets for immunotherapeutic strategies in infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="The transmembrane protein Tim-3 has received significant attention in recent years as a possible immunotherapy target. This is due to its robust expression on dysfunctional, exhausted, T cells found in the settings of cancer and chronic infection and biochemical evidence suggesting an inhibitory function of Tim-3. However, numerous clinical trials of putative Tim-3 blocking antibodies have yielded modest benefits, at best, in clinical trials for various cancers. Thus, there is a need to more fully understand the function of Tim-3 in vivo. Here we have studied the function of Tim-3 early during a T cell response to LCMV Armstrong, which causes an acute viral infection in mice. We show that Tim-3 is rapidly expressed after infection and that the expression of Tim-3 is associated with acquisition of a type I effector phenotype, including expression of T-bet and downregulation of Tcf-1, by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition, we demonstrate that knockout or cytoplasmic truncation of Tim-3 attenuates the acquisition of the effector program by T cells after LCMV Armstrong infection. Together, these data help to clarify the role of Tim-3 during acute infection.">

        <tr id="Background Aging is linked to various dysfunctions of the immune system, including the decline of its primary developmental source: the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. This decline leads to chronic inflammation, increased vulnerability to infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and reduced vaccine efficacy. As individuals age, the HSC niche undergoes significant changes, including greater adipocyte accumulation and alterations in the molecular microenvironment, which may influence the development and function of immune cells. Among these cells, the impact of the aging HSC niche on dendritic cell (DC) function is less understood. Heterochronic autologous HSC transplantation is a promising intervention to prevent age-related disorders, contributing to the extension of healthspan and longevity, however, several murine experiments failed to produce the expected results, which led us to presume that the problem lies within the old HSC niche. Therefore, we created in vitro models of young and old HSC niches and examined how these microenvironments affect the differentiation and maturation and functionality of BM-derived DCs (BMDCs). Results An analysis of the conditioned media from young and aged HSC niches revealed that the environment of aged niches exhibited an increased presence of adiponectin. This media was subsequently utilized in BMDC differentiation and maturation protocols, with their effects closely monitored. Our results indicate that the old HSC niche microenvironment promotes premature BMDC activation, characterized by elevated MHC class II expression and enhanced allostimulatory capacity of BMDCs at their immature stage. Additionally, LPS stimulation of BMDCs, used to induce DC maturation, significantly increased CD86 expression on BMDCs from the aged niche. However, these cells did not show superior allostimulatory capacity compared to their counterparts from the young niche environment. By analyzing the BMDC cytokine profile, we observed that when cultured in aged niche-conditioned media, the BMDCs secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6, indicating a heightened proinflammatory activation state. Conclusions Collectively, our findings suggest that aging-related changes within the HSC niche can considerably alter DC functionality by disrupting their normal development from BM precursors. These results emphasize the significance of this phenomenon and its implications for immunosenescence.

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review examines how myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) might contribute to an age-related increase in cancer incidence, traditionally attributed to the accumulation of somatic DNA mutations in stem cells. We discuss the emerging and potentially complementary perspective of a progressive decline in immune system fitness with age, which reduces its ability to detect and eliminate neoplastic cells. In particular, the review discusses the evidence implicating MDSCs in the suppression of immune function and their contribution to immunosenescence. Although several aspects of MDSC activity still remain unclear and more in-depth investigation is needed, advancing this area of research may lead to novel strategies for improving cancer treatment outcomes in elderly patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Emerging clinical and mouse tumor data indicate that tumor cells induce immune suppression in an anatomical site-specific manner. In lung metastases, tumor cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) engages myeloid cell programmed cell death protein 1 to activate SHP2 to suppress type I interferon (IFN-I) expression to repress Cxcl9 expression to impair cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) tumor recruitment. Loss of IFN-I expression thus underlies tumor immune evasion in lung metastases niche. We aimed at testing the hypothesis that forcing tumor cells to express IFNα2 activates Cxcl9 expression to increase CTL tumor recruitment to suppress lung metastasis. Methods Codon usage-optimized IFNα2-encoding DNA was designed and cloned to plasmid. IFNα2-encoding messenger RNA (mRNA) was synthesized. The plasmid DNA and mRNA were encapsulated into DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate)-cholesterol to generate lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mouse IFNα2 (LNP-mIFNα2), human IFNα2 plasmid, and mouse IFNα2 mRNA (LNP-mIFNα2-mRNA). Mouse breast tumor spontaneous lung metastasis, mouse melanoma experimental lung metastasis, and human colon tumor experimental lung metastasis humanized mouse models were used to determine LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid and mRNA efficacy in IFNα2 expression and antitumor immunity, toxicity, and mechanism of action in vivo. Results LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid primarily accumulated in tumor-bearing lungs in mice. LNP-IFNα2 therapy produces mouse IFNα2 protein in mouse tumor-bearing mice and human IFNα2 protein in human tumor-bearing humanized mice to suppress lung metastasis, respectively. Similarly, LNP-mIFNα2-mRNA therapy produces mouse IFNα2 protein and suppressed lung metastasis in tumor-bearing mice. The increased IFNα2 protein activates Cxcl9 expression and increases T cell infiltration in lung metastases. LNP-IFNα2 therapy did not induce liver toxicity and inflammatory cytokines. In human patients with cancer, IFN-I pathway activation is correlated with CXCL9 expression and T cell expansion after PD-(L)1 immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Mechanistically, LNP-delivered IFNα2 suppresses tumor lung metastasis through upregulating Cxcl9 in tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions Our findings determine that LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid DNA and mRNA are effective agents in restoring IFNα2 expression to activate Cxcl9 expression to enhance T cell tumor recruitment to suppress tumor lung metastasis. LNP-IFNα2 is potentially a safe and yet effective third-generation IFNα2 agent for human cancer immunotherapy to treat patients with lung metastasis.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Patients with chronic blood cancers called myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) can benefit from a therapy based on interferon alpha, which helps the immune system fight disease. However, we still do not fully understand how this treatment works at the molecular level, or how to predict who will respond best. In this study, we analyzed blood samples from patients treated with interferon alpha to investigate changes in immune signals and gene activity over time. We found a progressive decrease in inflammation-related molecules and changes in genes involved in immune regulation, cell survival, and blood cell production. These results suggest that interferon gradually reshapes the immune system and may help control the disease by reducing inflammation and promoting cell death in abnormal blood cells. Our findings may help identify new biomarkers to personalize treatment and monitor its effectiveness in future patients.">

        <tr id="The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma limits the effectiveness of most immunotherapies. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling drives tumor progression and prevents effective T cell activity. Notably, both regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T cells within glioblastoma and other tumors express high levels of the immune checkpoint receptor, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR), which modulates T cell activation and function. Combining GITR agonism with TGF-β inhibition may therefore offer a compelling approach to restore anti-tumor immunity. We evaluated the combined effects of TGF-β inhibition and GITR modulation using two different GITR agonists in syngeneic mouse glioma models. GITR modulation enhanced T cell activation, as shown by increased cytokine secretion and effector T cell proliferation in vitro. Combining GITR modulation with TGF-β inhibition amplified these effects, resulting in significantly stronger immune cell-mediated tumor cell killing compared to single-agent treatments. Combination therapy improved survival of glioma-bearing mice, with a higher fraction of long-term survivors compared to monotherapy. Surviving mice resisted tumor re-challenge, indicating durable adaptive immunity. In summary, dual targeting of TGF-β and GITR pathways synergistically enhances anti-tumor immunity in glioblastoma. This novel combination strategy demonstrates clinical potential by addressing the limitations of existing immunotherapies and offering a promising approach for durable and effective glioblastoma treatment.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has generated promising outcomes in cancer treatment; however, therapeutic responses are hampered by immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This has resulted in increased study of key immune cells in the TME as therapeutic interventions. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a major component of infiltrating immune cells in the TME, display high plasticity, largely dependent on cues received from their surroundings. Although significant progress in metabolomics and single-cell omics has unraveled the metabolic and functional heterogeneity of TAMs across several types of cancer, the development of TAM-targeted therapy remains challenging. In the present review, the crosstalk between TAMs and other components in TME, such as tumor cells, immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and extracellular matrix is highlighted. Additionally, updated insights into the origin, heterogeneity, and metabolic reprogramming of TAMs are discussed, and relevant approaches of targeting TAMs in clinical investigations are summarized. The present review provides a deeper understanding of TAMs within the microenvironment network, aimed at identifying candidate targets to improve cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Standing as the most aggressive form of primary malignant tumor, Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors with marked heterogeneity represents one of the enormous challenges in glioma treatment. Myeloid cells, which includes neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, microglia, and macrophages, play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment of GBM. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), T cells and natural killer (NK) cells exert anti-tumor functions, whereas myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can promote tumor progression by suppressing these immune responses. Therefore, MDSCs play a critical role in shaping the effectiveness of immunotherapy. TME has constrained the ability of traditional GBM treatment approaches to significantly enhance prognostic outcomes for patients. This category encompasses conventional therapies like surgical resection and radiation therapy, along with cutting-edge methodologies such as immunotherapy. Through extensive investigations into the dynamic interactions between the GBM microenvironment and neoplastic cells, both targeted treatment strategies and innovative immunotherapeutic modalities have emerged, offering promising new directions for clinical intervention. This review focuses on the interactions between GBM and myeloid cells (MCs), providing novel insights into the oncogenesis and progression of GBM.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a high-mortality cancer due to its aggressive nature and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which enables evasion of immune surveillance. Despite chemotherapy and targeted therapies, 5-year survival is ~ 30%, necessitating novel immunotherapies. AML suppresses cytotoxic T/NK cells by co-opting regulatory pathways, creating an “immune paradox.” Emerging strategies aim to disrupt this evasion. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 nivolumab and anti-CD47 magrolimab, combined with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), enhance T-cell activity and phagocytosis, especially in TP53-mutated AML. Therapeutic vaccines targeting leukemia-associated antigens (e.g., WT1, PRAME) via dendritic cell fusion show early success in prolonging remission. Combinatorial approaches, like HMAs with STING agonists or dual checkpoint blockade, target multiple immunosuppressive pathways to overcome resistance. Challenges include TME heterogeneity, therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells, toxicities (e.g., anemia, cytokine release syndrome), relapse from clonal evolution, and a lack of predictive biomarkers. Autologous therapies face economic and logistical hurdles, driving demand for scalable solutions. Advances in single-cell genomics, AI, and synthetic biology are identifying novel targets (TIM-3, TIGIT, VISTA) and improving patient stratification. Integrating these innovations may transform AML into a chronic condition, bridging preclinical potential to clinical impact. In this review, we aim to evaluate mechanisms, challenges, and future directions of immunotherapies in AML with highlighting ICIs and vaccination to improve therapeutic outcomes.">

Inflammatory pathways such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) promote tumor progression and reduce radiosensitivity. RT activates pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulates immune checkpoints including programmed death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), which contribute to immune suppression and treatment failure. Dual targeting of inflammatory and immune checkpoint pathways has shown potential to reverse radio resistance and enhance therapeutic response. Inhibition of COX-2 can reduce inflammation and improve tumor control, while blockade of PD-1 can restore T cell function and promote antitumor immunity. Strategies that integrate anti-inflammatory components, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and RT guided by molecular profiling may improve treatment outcomes in ESCC.

TLS develops antitumor immune competence following dynamic reorganization of their cellular components and proportions, although the precise mechanistic underpinnings remain to be fully characterized. Numerous studies have demonstrated that TLS can modulate the immune status of CRC, potentially enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy.

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) pathogenesis involves immune dysregulation, genetic factors, and bile duct pathology; however, a comprehensive pathogenesis model and effective therapeutic strategies remain limited. Here, we develop a novel human liver multilineage organoid (Mulorg) model combined with Mdr2−/− mice to investigate the pro-fibrotic role of T helper 17 cells (Th17) and the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVMSC) for PSC, particularly periductal fibrosis. EVMSC alleviates interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-induced fibrotic Mulorgs (FibHOs) and mitigates periductal fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice by inhibiting Th17 differentiation, decreasing Th17 numbers, and lowering intrahepatic IL-17A levels. Functional assays, miRNA array, and CUT & Tag analyses reveal that EVs-derived hsa-miR-7977 targets NFKBIZ, repressing IκBζ translation to reduce IL-17A and its downstream targets involved in Th17 differentiation, IL-17 signaling, and bile secretion pathways. Moreover, miR-7977-enriched EVMSC efficiently reduces IL-17A+ cell percentages in fibrotic areas and improves periductal fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice. Co-culture of FibHOs with Th17 found miR-7977 inhibits Th17 migration to the periductal fibrosis area, with distinct morphological differences observed between patient- and healthy-derived FibHOs. These findings demonstrate that EV-derived miR-7977 mitigates the periductal fibrosis microenvironment by inhibiting Th17 differentiation and migration, the former by targeting NFKBIZ, regulating IL-17A and IκBζ-targeted gene expression. This study clarifies Th17’s role in the PSC fibrotic microenvironment, underscores the modeling contributions of Mulorgs, and highlights EV-derived miR-7977’s potential to ameliorate Th17-related periductal fibrosis, offering insights and novel therapeutic avenues for PSC.

        <tr id="TCR repertoires against tumors lack high-affinity TCRs and are further suppressed by Tregs. We hypothesized that Treg depletion enhances the antitumor efficacy of low-affinity T cells. Using the weak agonistic peptide A4Y derived from LCMV glycoprotein peptide p33 as a model antigen and VLPs as a vaccine platform, we tested this approach. In a separate low-affinity model, we targeted B16F10 melanoma with our multi-target vaccine. Results revealed limited in vivo lytic cross-reactivity between A4Y and p33 peptides, and the A4Y-vaccine alone failed to inhibit B16F10p33 tumor progression. However, combining A4Y-vaccine with Treg depletion triggered a robust immune response, characterized by increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, enhanced T cell functionality, and tumor-free survival. Infiltrating T cells also exhibited closer spatial proximity and heightened migration from blood vessels. Similarly, combining low-affinity vaccine with Treg depletion enhanced antitumor responses. These findings highlight the potential of Treg depletion to advance vaccination strategies targeting TAAs with low-affinity T cells.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute significantly to immunosuppression in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), leading to high aggressiveness and poor prognosis. However, the key molecules involved in shaping TAMs toward the pro-tumoral phenotype in CRLM remain unclear, limiting the development of macrophage-mediated immunotherapies for CRLM. Results In this study, we showed that DICER1 was highly expressed in TAMs and closely associated with M2 polarization in CRLM. Knockdown of Dicer, encoded by DICER1 in humans (or Dicer1 in mice), skewed macrophages toward an anti-tumoral M1 phenotype, with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and tumor cell phagocytosis, thereby suppressing tumor growth in mice. An M2 macrophage-targeting nanosystem was developed to deliver Dicer1 siRNA for selectively downregulating Dicer expression in M2 macrophages. In situ manipulation of TAMs with the nanoparticle exerted a significant anti-tumor effect with an improved immune microenvironment in a CRLM mouse model. Macrophage depletion experiments further suggested that this effect was largely dependent on the presence of TAMs. Mechanistically, Dicer inhibition reprogrammed M2-like macrophages through downregulation of miR-148a-3p and miR-1981-5p. Conclusion Our study uncovered the central role of Dicer in the M2 polarization of TAMs, in turn suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for CRLM.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Combining interleukin-2 (IL-2) agonism with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibition has shown synergistic potential in reinvigorating antitumor T cell responses. However, integrating these two mechanisms within a single molecule has been challenging due to competing requirements for PD-1 engagement and IL-2 receptor signaling. ANV600 is a novel bispecific antibody–cytokine fusion protein that targets a non-blocking epitope on PD-1, enabling cis-targeted IL-2Rβγ agonism while preserving combinability with therapeutic PD-1 inhibitors. This design allows for selective expansion of tumor antigen-specific T cells while avoiding the systemic toxicity and regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion associated with conventional IL-2 therapies. Methods The PD-1-targeting antibody used in ANV600 was generated by immunization of humanized mice and selected for its ability to bind PD-1 without blocking the binding epitope of PD-1 checkpoint blocking agents. ANV600 was evaluated in multiple syngeneic tumor models using human PD-1 transgenic mice. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were analyzed to assess the selectivity of ANV600 for PD-1+ T cell subsets. Combination studies with pembrolizumab and nivolumab were performed to assess synergy with checkpoint inhibitors. Results ANV600 significantly inhibited tumor growth as monotherapy across multiple models, including the immune checkpoint-resistant B16F10 melanoma. By targeting PD-1, ANV600 selectively expanded tumor antigen-specific CD8+T cells, particularly progenitor exhausted (Tpex) and cytotoxic exhausted (Tcex) subsets, while sparing Tregs and NK cells. Combination with pembrolizumab and nivolumab resulted in additive effects, consistent with the complementary roles of PD-1 blockade in expanding Tpex cells and IL-2Rβγ signaling in reprogramming Tcex cells. ANV600’s efficacy was dependent on CD8+T cells and primarily driven by tumor-resident T cells, as it remained effective despite blocked lymph node trafficking (FTY720) but was abrogated on CD8+ T cell depletion. Conclusions ANV600 represents a novel approach to delivering IL-2Rβγ agonism specifically to PD-1+ cells while preserving the binding site for PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. By targeting a non-blocking epitope on PD-1, ANV600 enables the selective expansion of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells while allowing independent and optimized dosing of both agents. This design ensures combinability with PD-1 inhibitors at clinically relevant doses, including in patients previously treated with checkpoint blockade. These findings support the clinical development of ANV600 as both a monotherapy and a combination therapy in cancer immunotherapy.">

This response is essential to limit virus replication and spread. However, an exacerbated response may cause severe immune-pathologies. Therefore, it is very important to better understand innate immune responses at the level of its molecular networks in the context of viral infections. Data We infected human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and human monocytic (THP-1) cells with H3N2 influenza virus A virus and performed transcriptome analysis using next generation RNA sequencing at various times post infection. We report raw sequence data and normalized log2 transformed gene expression values. This data will allow researchers in the field to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways between the two cell types and over times post infection. Furthermore, our data enables comparisons to molecular studies performed in humans and animal models in the context of respiratory viral infections.">

        <tr id="Myeloid cells, including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, are essential for establishing central tolerance in the thymus by promoting T cell clonal deletion and regulatory T cell (Treg) generation. Previous studies suggest that the thymic DC pool consists of plasmacytoid DC (pDC), XCR1+ DC1 and SIRPα+ DC2. Yet the precise origin, development, and homeostasis, particularly of DC2, remain unresolved. Using single-cell transcriptomics and lineage-defining mouse models we identify nine major populations of thymic myeloid cells and describe their lineage identities. What was previously considered to be “DC2” is actually composed of 4 distinct cell lineages. Amongst these are monocyte-derived DCs (moDC) and monocyte derived macrophages (moMac), which are dependent on thymic interferon to upregulate MHCII and CD11c. We further demonstrate that conventional DC2 undergo intrathymic maturation through CD40 signaling. Finally, amongst “DC2” we identify a novel thymic population of CX3CR1+ transitional DC (tDC), which represent transendothelial DCs positioned near thymic microvessels. Together, these finding reveal the thymus as a niche for diverse, developmentally distinct myeloid cells and elucidate their specific requirements for development and maturation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background As a malignancy of hematopoietic origin, the standard-of-care cytoreductive chemotherapy can not provide satisfactory treatment effect for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Immunotherapy has received increasing attention in leukemia treatment. However, the immunosuppressive microenvironment and low cancer immunogenicity of AML blasts create major obstacles to effectively inducing immune responses. Methods We developed an extracellular vesicle-based dual-delivery biosystem, which enhanced anti-AML immune responses by activating the immunogenicity of leukemia cells and relieving immunosuppression in AML allografted mice. Red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles (REVs) were selected as delivery carriers due to the excellent biocompatibility. REVs were ligated with leukemia-targeting peptide P9 and subsequently loaded with immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer (Doxorubicin, Dox) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 siRNA (siIDO1) to construct a chemoimmunological cascade biosystem (REVs-Dox/siIDO1-P9). Results The biosystem can specifically deliver the loaded Dox and siIDO1 into target leukemia cells and was validated capable of inducing efficient ICD. ICD-mediated release of damage-associated molecular patterns synergistically functions with siIDO1-mediated IDO1 silence to effectually recruit CD8+ T cells and enhance CD8+ T cell’s functions. In the AML mouse model, REVs-Dox/siIDO1-P9 can evoke a strong antileukemia response and prolong leukemia-bearing mice survival compared with REVs-Dox/siNC-P9 and REVs-siIDO1-P9. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the extracellular vesicle-based chemoimmunological cascade biosystem provides a novel strategy for AML treatment.">

        <tr id="Introduction The prognostic management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a challenge for clinicians. This study aims to construct a novel risk model for AML patient through comprehensive analysis of scRNA and bulk RNA data to optimize the precise treatment strategies for patients and improve prognosis. Methods and Results scRNA-seq classified cells into nine clusters, including Bcells, erythrocyte, granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), hematopoietic stem cell progenitors (HSC/Prog), monocyte/macrophagocyte (Mono/Macro), myelocyte, neutrophils, plasma, and T/NK cells. Functional analysis demonstrated the important role of inflammation immune response in the pathogenesis of AML, and the leukocyte transendothelial migration and adhesion in the process of inflammation should be noticed. ssGSEA method identified four core cells including GMP, HSC/Prog, Mono/Macro, and myelocyte for subsequent analysis, which contains 1,594 marker genes. Furthermore, we identified AML-associated genes (2,067genes) and DEGs (1,010genes) between AML patients and controls usingGSE114868dataset. After performing intersection, univariate Cox, and LASSO analysis, we obtained a prognostic model based on the expression levels of five signature genes, namely, CALR, KDM1A, SUCNR1, TMEM220, and ADM. The prognostic model was then validated by two external datasets. Patients with high-risk scores are predisposed to experience poor overall survival. Further GSEA analysis of risk-model-related genes revealed the significant differences in inflammatory response between high-and low-risk groups. Conclusion In conclusion, we constructed an inflammation related risk model using internal scRNA data and external bulk RNA data, which can accurately distinguish survival outcomes in AML patients.">

        <tr id="The severity of certain viral infectious diseases varies across the age; we hypothesize that these variations could be related to the variation of immune responses to viral immune complexes (ICs) among the age. This study aimed to investigate monocyte activation in response to ICs in children, adults, and elderly individuals. An experimental in vitro model was established using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. Monocyte activation markers (CD169, CD38, HLA-DR), the negative co-stimulatory molecule (PD-L1), and cytokine production were measured under basal conditions and upon stimulation with human adenovirus 5-IgG immune complex (Ad5-ICs), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes from children and adults displayed similar activation profiles in response to ICs and IFN-α stimulation, characterized by increased expression of CD169 and PD-L1. In contrast, monocytes from elderly individuals exhibited weak or no overexpression of CD169 and PD-L1 coupled with a diminished PBMC cytokine response. Notably, cells from elderly participants produced high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the absence of stimulation. Multiple comparisons confirmed reduced monocyte activation and PBMC cytokine responses in the elderly compared to adults and children. Although children exhibited a significant response to ICs, their secretion of IFN-α, IP-10, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-2 was lower than that observed in adults. Our findings suggest that elderly individuals have poor and dysregulated responses to ICs, likely due to immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. Adults exhibit a robust and balanced response to ICs, while children display a moderate response, possibly influenced by ‘trained immunity’ resulting from frequent early-life exposures to pathogens. These insights highlight the importance of further research to develop age-specific therapeutic strategies to modulate immune function during viral IC exposure.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a significant barrier to the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), contributing to long-term morbidity and non-relapse mortality in both pediatric and adult populations. Central to GVHD pathophysiology is the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, where JAK2 mediates key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF. These cytokines promote donor T cell activation, effector differentiation, and target organ damage. The introduction of ruxolitinib, a selective JAK1/2 inhibitor, has transformed the treatment landscape for steroid-refractory acute and chronic GVHD, leading to improved response rates and durable symptom control. However, its limitations—such as cytopenias, infectious complications, and incomplete responses—have catalyzed the development of next-generation agents. In 2024, the FDA approved axatilimab, a CSF-1R inhibitor that targets monocyte-derived macrophages in fibrotic chronic GVHD, and remestemcel-L, an allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cell therapy, for pediatric steroid-refractory acute GVHD. Both agents offer mechanistically distinct and clinically meaningful additions to the therapeutic armamentarium. In parallel, emerging combination strategies involving JAK2 inhibitors and novel biologics show promise in enhancing immune tolerance while preserving graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects. Recent advances in biomarker development, such as the MAGIC Algorithm Probability (MAP), are enabling early risk stratification and response prediction. The integration of these tools with organ-specific and personalized approaches marks a shift toward more precise, durable, and tolerable GVHD therapy. This review highlights the current state and future direction of JAK2 inhibition and complementary therapies in the evolving GVHD treatment paradigm.">

        <tr id="Myeloid leukemia (ML) is a clonal malignant disease with abnormal hematopoietic stem cells. With the emergence of novel immunotherapies, such as CAR-T, therapeutic outcomes in ML patients have improved, while significant challenges persist, including severe adverse events and disease recurrence. Natural killer cells (NK cells) are “natural killers” of the immune system that do not require antigen presentation and responsible for recognizing and destroying tumor cells. Some NK cells-based clinical experiments have been carried out and achieved remarkable results with lower side effects in ML. Crucially, within the ML microenvironment, NK cells frequently exhibit more severe functional exhaustion compared with T cells, characterized by impaired cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and proliferative capacity which limits anti-ML efficacy of NK cells. However, clinical studies utilizing NK cell-based therapies (e.g., adoptive transfer, CAR-NK cells) have demonstrated promising results with favorable safety profiles, underscoring their therapeutic potential. Therefore, developing more strategies based on NK cell is of great clinical significance for the treatment of ML. In this review, we systematically analysed the relationship between ML and NK cells, aiming to propose more novel protocols for NK cell expansion and persistence enhancement, establish evidence-based guidelines for next-generation NK cell-based immunotherapies in ML treatment.">

        <tr id="Although the current paradigm posits that autoreactive T and B cells both contribute to inflammatory arthritis (IA), the existence of antibody-independent arthritis remains contentious. The immunological nature of IA immune related adverse events (irAE) following anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mediated immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed the peripheral immunological phenotypes of a large cohort of IA irAE patients in comparison to serologically matched rheumatoid arthritis (RA) controls, ICI controls (patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 without developing irAE) and healthy controls, Our data revealed that IA irAE CD4+ T cells are distinguished by reduced CXCR3 and CCR6 expression, and irAE CD8+ T cells are distinguished by increased cytotoxic molecule expression, while both exhibit increased metabolic activity. We did not observe any significant alterations in humoral immunity in IA irAE patients compared to control groups. In contrast, seronegative RA controls exhibited significantly increased CD11c+ CD21- atypical B cell frequency and autoantibody levels. Furthermore, IA irAE patients are characterized by highly elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We identified IL-6, IL-12 and IFN as potential soluble factors contributing to some of the IA irAE immunological alterations. Altogether, our results suggest that IA irAE is an immunologically distinct disease entity with a potential segregation of T and B cell immunity, indicating that autoantibodies may not be necessary to break systemic immune tolerance in humans.

        <tr id="TNFα-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2) reportedly plays a significant role in the initiation and progression of malignancy. However, its function in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) is largely unknown and urgently needs to be explored. Analysis of a publicly available database revealed that TNFAIP2 was significantly downregulated in SKCM tissues vs. normal controls (P < 0.001) and that its expression was a significant indicator for SKCM diagnosis (AUC = 0.742). Patients with low TNFAIP2 expression tended to have tumors in advanced clinical stages with a poor prognosis (P < 0.01), which was validated in our cohort. Subsequent enrichment analysis revealed that genes differentially expressed between SKCM tissues with high and low TNFAIP2 expression were highly enriched in with multiple tumor immune signatures, especially immune checkpoint signalling. Immune infiltration estimation indicated that TNFAIP2 upregulation predicated increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells, and M1 macrophages and predicted a favourable response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment in SKCM. In the SKCM mouse model, TNFAIP2 overexpression suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis, and this effect was even more pronounced in immunocompetent mice; notably, these mice presented increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages into the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, TNFAIP2 overexpression clearly increased the sensitivity of SKCM to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The above results indicate the tumor-suppressive role of TNFAIP2, which may be a promising target for improving the efficacy of ICB treatment in SKCM.

        <tr id="Amino acids play critical roles in the activation and function of lymphocytes. Here we show that the non-essential amino acid, asparagine, is essential for optimal activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells. We demonstrate that asparagine depletion at different time points after CD4+ T cell activation reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and function. Furthermore, asparagine depletion at specific time points during CD4+ T cell differentiation reduces cytokine production in multiple CD4+ T cell subsets. In an adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), myelin oligodendrocyte-specific pathogenic T helper 17 cells differentiated under Asn-deficient conditions exhibited reduced encephalitogenic potential and attenuated EAE severity. In a model of EAE induced by active immunization, therapeutic depletion of extracellular Asn significantly reduced disease severity. These results identify asparagine as a key metabolic regulator of the pathogenicity of autoreactive CD4+ T cells and suggest that targeting asparagine metabolism may be a novel therapeutic strategy for autoimmunity.">

Pediatric B cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a hematopoietic malignancy. T cell exhaustion has an important impact on the prognosis of leukemia. The interaction between tumor cells and T cells can influence the degree of T cell exhaustion. However, the effects of B-ALL cells on exhausted T cell subpopulations and how the interaction influences the prognosis of B-ALL patients remain unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from pediatric B-ALL patients were downloaded from GEO. Cell interaction analysis identified ligand-receptor pairs between B-ALL cells and exhausted CD8+ T cell. To confirm the function of CCL3/CCL4/CCL5/CCR5 in prognosis prediction, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed. We further developed an innovative stratified model that integrates CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 through multi-Cox regression. Clustering of scRNA-Seq data revealed an increased proportion of exhausted CD8+ T cells in relapsed B-ALL, especially terminal exhausted CD8+ T cells (CD8_Ex), with increased exhaustion and decreased proliferation scores. Moreover, the CCL3/CCL4/CCL5-CCR5 axis was upregulated in interactions between B-ALL cells and terminal CD8_Ex. Transcriptome data from 221 pediatric B-ALL samples revealed that high CCL3/CCL4/CCL5/CCR5 levels correlate with low overall survival (OS). A multivariate Cox regression model incorporating CCL3/CCL4/CCL5 predicted prognoses. Finally, a model based on the adult B-ALL patients from our center also accurately predicted prognoses. We report for the first time the crucial role of the CCL3/CCL4/CCL5-CCR5 axis in the differentiation of terminal exhausted CD8+ T cells in B-ALL. High expression of CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CCR5 correlates with poor prognosis in B-ALL, suggesting potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Background Blockade of Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) significantly improves progression-free survival in patients with cancers, including melanoma. In addition to unleashing antitumor immunity, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapies disrupt immune regulatory networks critical for maintaining homeostasis in various tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Despite growing reports of cancer- and ICI-related cognitive impairments among survivors, our understanding of the pathophysiology of ICI-related neurodegenerative effects is limited. Methods In this study, we used a murine model of melanoma, cognitive function tests, and neuroimmunological assays to investigate the cellular mechanisms and impact of combinatorial blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 on brain function. Syngeneic melanoma was induced in C57Bl6 mice via intradermal injection of D4M-3A.UV2 melanoma cells. After confirmation of tumor growth, cancer-bearing and non-cancer mice received combinatorial treatment of anti-CTLA-4 (1 mg per dose, twice per week) and anti-PD-1 (200 µg per dose, thrice per week) for three weeks. One month after completing ICI treatment, mice were evaluated for learning, memory, and memory consolidation cognitive function tasks. Neuroinflammation, synaptic and myelin integrity, and immune cell status in the brain were analyzed to examine neuro-immunological changes post-ICI treatment. Results While tumor-related alterations in brain function were evident, combined ICI treatment specifically disrupted synaptic integrity and reduced myelin levels independent of neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity in both cancer-bearing and non-cancer mice brains. Combined ICI selectively impaired hippocampal-dependent cognitive function. This was associated with a two-fold increase in T cell numbers within the brain along with immune activation of myeloid cells, especially microglia. Furthermore, an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model revealed that combination ICI predisposes the CNS to exacerbated autoimmunity, highlighting neuroinflammation-related, and tumor-independent, neurodegenerative sequelae of combination ICI. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that combinatorial blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 destabilizes neuroimmune-regulatory networks and activates microglia, contributing to long-term neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments. Therefore, selectively limiting microglial activation could be a potential avenue to preserve CNS functions while maintaining the therapeutic benefits of rapidly evolving ICIs and their combinations.

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer therapy. However, their efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is limited, highlighting the need to further explore immune microenvironments and novel biomarkers. This study examined lymphocyte populations and immune checkpoint dynamics in early, advanced, and post-progression HCC to better understand immune dynamics in HCC and to help identify predictive biomarkers and immune modulation strategies. Methods Tumoral and non-tumoral liver tissues were analyzed from HCC patients across early (n=25), advanced (n=22), and advanced-beyond-progression (n=15) stages. Lymphocyte profiling was performed using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, focusing on NK cells, T cells, and immune exhaustion markers. An exploratory analysis of this profile and its association with disease progression and recurrence was conducted. Results Early HCC exhibited higher liver-resident NK (lrNK) cell densities in non-tumor regions, which diminished with advanced stages. Increased CD56+ cell infiltration in the tumor core was associated with recurrence. Tumor region showed elevated PD-1, NKG2A, and CD39 expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, indicating progressive immune exhaustion. Advanced HCC stages demonstrated altered NK cell phenotypes, with reduced cytotoxic activation (CD16) and increased residency markers (CXCR6/CD69) in tumor-isolated lymphocytes. Conclusions Progressive immune exhaustion and dysregulation of lrNK and T cells in HCC reflect the evolution of the immune microenvironment originating in the tumor and leaking into the non-tumoral liver, progressively diminishing the cytotoxic capacity of NK and T cells. CD56+ cell density and immune checkpoint profiles are potential biomarkers for therapeutic response and disease monitoring, underscoring the need for personalized immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is characterized by CNS infiltration of autoreactive immune cells that drive both acute inflammatory demyelination and chronic progressive axonal and neuronal injury. Expanding evidence implicates CD8+ antineural T cells in the neurodegeneration that underlies irreversible clinical progression in multiple sclerosis, yet therapies specifically targeting this cell population are limited. CD8+ T cells from patients with MS exhibit increased engagement of the pentose phosphate pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway reduced glycolysis, glucose uptake, NADPH production, ATP production, proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in CD8+ T cells activated by ligation of CD3 and CD28. Pentose phosphate pathway inhibition also prevented CD8+ T cell–mediated antigen-specific neuronal injury in vitro and in both an adoptive transfer–based cuprizone model of demyelination and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Notably, transcriptional profiling of CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients with MS indicated increased pentose phosphate pathway engagement, suggesting that this pathway is involved in CD8+ T cell–mediated injury of axons and neurons in the demyelinated CNS. Inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway disrupts CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming and effector functions, suggesting that such inhibition may serve as a therapeutic strategy to prevent neurodegeneration in patients with progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) derived extracellular vesicles represent a promising vehicle for the activation of adaptive immunity, demonstrating significant potential in the development of cancer nanovaccines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of a functional DCs-derived extracellular vesicles in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Methods A pre-modification strategy was employed to overexpress XCL1 in dendritic cells, enabling their extracellular vesicles to highly express XCL1 protein. In vitro experiments, prostate cancer-bearing mouse models, and OVA-expressing prostate cancer mouse models demonstrated that dendritic cells efficiently internalize extracellular vesicles derived from XCL1-overexpressing mature dendritic cells (DEXXCL1), thereby enhancing the chemotaxis, activation, and antigen-presenting capacity of cDC1 cells. When combined with the immunogenic cell death effect induced by cisplatin, this approach significantly increased the number and cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells, improved the tumor microenvironment, and effectively suppressed prostate cancer tumor growth. Results The coding sequence of XCL1 successfully inserted upstream of the PDGFR transmembrane domain and transfected into dendritic cells, enabling their extracellular vesicles to highly express XCL1 protein. Extracellular vesicles derived from XCL1-overexpressing mature dendritic cells not only exhibited high XCL1 expression, but were also enriched with chemokine receptor CCR7 and MHC I molecules on their surface. This nanovaccines enhanced the uptake of extracellular vesicles by dendritic cells, recruited cDC1 cells within the tumor tissue, and significantly improved their antigen-presenting capacity. When combined with the immunogenic cell death effect induced by cisplatin, which generates a large amount of tumor-associated antigen STEAP1, this strategy effectively enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of CD8+T cells. Moreover, it reduced the proportion of regulatory T cells and immunosuppressive factors, thereby reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment. This approach effectively inhibited tumor growth in mice and prolonged their survival. These findings demonstrate the strong synergistic effects of the nanovaccines and cisplatin in promoting antitumor immunity. Conclusions A novel nanovaccines induces potent antitumor immune responses and, in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, effectively remodels the tumor immune microenvironment. This approach offers a new strategy and preclinical evidence for the immunotherapy of “cold tumors” prostate cancer.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is driven by abnormal type-I and -II interferon activation, affecting a variety of immunocompetent cells. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modulate inflammation but often lack consistent potency. We developed HXB-319, an MSC-based therapy targeting inflammatory pathways in SLE. Previously, HXB-319 was shown to reduce alveolar hemorrhage in an SLE model. Here, we report its effects in a model of SLE that progresses to end stage kidney disease.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
SLE-like disease was induced via intraperitoneal (IP) pristane injection in female BALB/cJ mice, followed by treatment with naïve MSCs or HXB-319. Over 9 months, survival and proteinuria were monitored. Upon euthanasia, kidneys were analyzed for histopathology and gene expression, splenocytes for immune subsets by flow cytometry, and serum for autoantibodies, growth factors and cytokines.


RESULTS
HXB-319 significantly altered plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4+PD-L1+ cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ RORγt+ (Th17 cells) subsets. HXB-310 lowered IFN-γ (p< 0.001), IL-17A (p=0.01), BAFF (p<0.05), and anti-dsDNA (p<0.05), compared to untreated mice. HXB-319, but not naïve MSCs, significantly improved survival, halted progression of kidney disease and stabilized proteinuria (all p < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
HXB-319 demonstrates potential for mitigating SLE associated glomerulonephritis, improving survival and reducing proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive cancer with an increasing incidence worldwide, highlighting the need for research into its pathogenesis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in melanoma progression and consists of cellular components and an extracellular matrix (ECM) rich in cytokines and signaling molecules. The most abundant stromal cells within the TME are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which remodel the ECM and modulate immune responses. Among immune cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) predominate, and their polarization toward the M2 phenotype supports tumor progression. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have diverse functions, including cytotoxic T-cells, helper T-cells that modulate immune response, B-cells forming tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and regulatory T-cells with immunosuppressive properties. Dendritic cells (DCs) also play a complex role in the TME. A notable subpopulation are mature regulatory dendritic cells (mregDCs), which contribute to immune evasion. All of these TME components may drive tumorigenesis. Advancements in melanoma treatment—including immunotherapy and targeted therapies—have significantly improved outcomes in advanced-stage disease. In parallel, emerging approaches targeting the tumor microenvironment and gut microbiome, as well as personalized strategies such as neoantigen vaccines and cell-based therapies, are under active investigation and may further enhance therapeutic efficacy in the near future.">

        <tr id="Inflammation is a self-defense mechanism that controls the homeostasis of an organism, and its alteration by persistent noxious stimuli could lead to an imbalance in the regulation of inflammatory responses mediated by innate and adaptive immunity. During chronic inflammation, sustained exposure of myeloid cells to the various inflammatory signals derived from inflamed tissue could lead to the generation of myeloid cells with an immunosuppressive state, called myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which can exert protective or deleterious functions depending on the nature of signals and the specific inflammatory conditions created by different pathophysiological contexts. Initially identified in various tumor models and cancer patient samples, these cells have long been recognized as negative regulators of anti-tumor immunity. Consequently, researchers have focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying their potent immunosuppressive activity. As a key component of the signal transducing processes, protein kinases play a central role in regulating the signal transduction mechanisms of many cellular activities, including differentiation and immunosuppression. Over the past decade, at least a dozen kinases, including mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TAM RTKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and others, have emerged as key contributors to the generation and differentiation of MDSCs. Here, we discuss the recent findings on these kinases that directly contribute to the immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute cellular rejection of transplanted lung allografts involves activated cytotoxic T cells and reduced Regulatory T (Treg) cell function. Calcineurin inhibitors, the cornerstone of immunosuppressive regimens, suppress T cell cytotoxicity but inhibit Treg proliferation. The DNA hypomethylating agent decitabine (DAC) can abrogate T cell cytotoxicity while stimulating Treg proliferation. Methods We sought to determine the effects of DAC treatment in a murine MHC-mismatched orthotopic lung transplant model. Results Rescue treatment with DAC maintains lung allograft gross and histologic integrity with a reduction in cytotoxic T cell responses. CD4+FoxP3+ T cell depletion in Foxp3DTR mice exacerbated rejection lung injury compared to CD4+FoxP3+ T cell sufficient mice and failed to abolish the protective effect of DAC in this model. The protective effect of DAC was associated with a reduction in cytokine production from host T-cells. Discussion Decitabine could offer a new line of treatment for acute lung allograft rejection, in part via its effects on Tregs.">

        <tr id="The lymphocyte-specific transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is a key player in immune evasion in cancers, with the complex mechanism(s) being barely understood. In this study, we have focused on the role of IRF4 in regulating T cell functions through its transcriptional regulation of programmed death 1 (PD1) and its ligand PD1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), which were identified as IRF4 transcriptional targets in multi-omics analysis. We have shown that IRF4 transcriptionally regulates both PD1 and PD-L1, promoting immune suppression in the context of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection. Co-culturing EBV+ JiJoye lymphoma cells with CD4+ T cells or with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) downregulates CD4+ T cell functions, but the depletion of IRF4 in EBV+ JiJoye lymphoma cells reduces PD1 and PD-L1 expression, and partially restores CD4+ T cell functions. Moreover, CD4+ T cell depletion from PBMCs enhances EBV transformation, and EBV has a greater efficiency in transforming PBMCs from HIV patients with impaired CD4+ T cell functions. These findings support the role of IRF4 in immune evasion by upregulating PD1/PD-L1 during EBV transformation, and that functional CD4+ T cells are essential for limiting EBV transformation.">

Methods 26 KTRs with an average transplant duration of 360 days and 13 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. 11KTRs were included in the SRL-based therapy group and the other 15 in the TAC-based therapy group. Flow cytometry was used to detect the percentages and absolute numbers of MDSCs, T cell populations, HLA-DR+ monocytes, neutrophil CD64 index, and cytokines in peripheral blood. Results In KTRs, the expression of G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs was significantly higher than the HCs, while the expression of HLA-DR+ monocytes, CD38+/CD28+ activated T cells, CD4+ naïve T cells, CD4+ effector memory T cells, and central memory T cells were significantly lower. The use of mTOR inhibitors in KTRs induced changes in the distribution of activated and naïve-memory T cell subsets and decreased proinflammatory cytokines. Discussion In KTRs, G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs accumulated while functionally activated, naïve-memory T cell populations and HLA-DR+ monocytes markedly decreased one year after transplantation. Additionally, the number of MDSCs and T cell subsets following transplantation is likely regulated by mTOR inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Endometrial carcinoma (EC) represents one of the most prevalent malignancies within the female reproductive system. The frequency of its occurrence is on the rise annually, and patients diagnosed at advanced stages face a less favorable prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the significant influence of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) on the initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance of endometrial cancer. The TME encompasses various components such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). These elements contribute to an immunosuppressive milieu by secreting cytokines, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and engaging immune checkpoint pathways like PD-1/PD-L1, thereby supporting tumor immune evasion and resistance to treatment. This review synthesizes current understanding of the EC-TME, focusing on the distinct roles and interactions of its key constituents within the context of EC biology. Furthermore, we explore the rationale and progress for novel therapeutic strategies targeting the TME, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, combination therapies, and nano delivery systems leveraging EVs, aiming to provide insights for improving EC patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Peritoneal metastasis (PM) of gastric cancer (GC) has an immune escape environment. Regulatory B cells (Bregs), characterized by IL-10 production, play an important role in the tumor immunity; however, the function of Bregs in PM remains unclear. We investigated the frequency and effects of Bregs on other immune cells in the PM using clinical specimens and mouse models of PM. In the peripheral blood and ascites, Breg frequency was significantly higher in patients with GC with PM than in those without PM. In clinical PM samples, Breg frequency was an independent prognostic factor. In the mouse PM model, peritoneal tumors showed higher Breg infiltration than subcutaneous tumors. In the PTEN-deficient PM model, activation of Bregs promoted ascites and peritoneal tumor growth, decreased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and increased the infiltration of M2 macrophages. In contrast, treatment with wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, suppressed Breg infiltration, resulting in decreased M2 macrophage infiltration and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration. Bregs are indicated to be involved in immunosuppression of PM and are promising targets for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy against PM.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background and Objectives A pivotal role of cancer (e.g., glioma) microenvironment is primarily executed by tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) in facilitating cancer immune evasion and even resisting immunotherapies. However, the molecular base for governing such functionality of TAMs remains poorly understood. Thereby, we here explore the impact of such a key regulatory transcription factor NFE2L1 (also called Nrf1) on glioma‐relevant TAMs. Methods A set of combining in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches, e.g., by utilizing CRISPR‐Cas9 and overexpression plasmids to modulate NFE2L1 expression, and the resulting phenotypic changes in TAMs were evaluated. Besides, immunofluorescence, RT‐qPCR and flow cytometry were conducted to assay the infiltration of various immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells and M1‐type macrophages, in the glioma microenvironment, as well as their therapeutic response to anti‐PD1 treatment. Results Deficiency of NFE2L1 causes a unique phenotypic switch in the TAMs from its pro‐cancer M2‐type to another anti‐cancer M1‐type, thereby inhibiting malignant progression of glioma. Such NFE2L1‐deficiency leads to significantly increases of CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages within tumor tissues of glioma and hence enhances its sensitivity to anti‐PD1 therapy. Further experimental evidence has provided revealing a synergistic efficacy triggered by combined therapy of CD38 inhibitor with PD1 antibodies, significantly inhibited tumor growth, compared to that of their monotherapy. The mechanistic study unraveled that NFE2L1 enables for directly binding to those ARE sites within the promoter regions of both CD38 and PD‐L1 genes in order to govern their transcriptional expression. Conclusions The aberrant role of NFE2L1 in the malignant progression of glioma was discovered in this study. It is of crucial significance to emphasize the potential of NFE2L1 inhibition as a strategic approach to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic intervention. Overall, this discovery holds a substantial promise for advancement of innovative combination therapies, potentially enhancing treatment outcomes for individuals afflicted with glioma.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The management of HNC is a major global challenge, with chemo-radiotherapy resistance and a low 5-year survival rate. Recently, the FDA has approved anti-PD1/PDL1-based immunotherapies for the better management and longer survival of HNC patients. However, immune-escaping mechanisms mitigate the antitumoral effect of anti-PD-1/PD-L1-based therapies. Dysregulated miRNAs are increasingly recognized as key players in immune evasion mechanisms through the modulation of several immune signaling pathways that are essential for antitumor immune responses. In this study, we aimed to identify miRNAs whose dysregulation is closely associated with immune-escaping mechanisms and lower survival rates in HNC patients. The present study found some key miRNAs that are associated with lower survival rates and immune evasion mechanisms. Targeting the identified miRNAs can help modulate immune evasion mechanisms and possibly enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies, including other immune checkpoint therapies in HNC.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory B cell (Breg), known for its immunosuppressive properties through the provision of IL-10, plays a critical role in the control of inflammatory diseases. Although Breg has been discovered for over two decades in mammals, its existence in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the differentiation mechanism and functional profiles of teleost CD25L+ Breg to gain insights into the origin and evolution of Breg. Methods Flow cytometry, RNA-seq, qPCR, morphological analysis, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, recombinant IL-35 stimulation, cell co-culture in Transwell system were performed to reveal the phenotypic features, differentiation mechanism and suppressive functions of teleost CD25L+ Breg. To elucidate the immunoregulatory role of CD25L+ Breg in vivo, bacterial infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models were established in teleost fish. Systemic and local inflammatory responses were assessed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, histological analysis, and cytokine measurements. Results Phenotypically, we identified a unique IgM+CD25L+ B cell subset, termed CD25L+ B cells, characterized by their capacity to produce IL-10 and IL-12p35 in a cold-blooded vertebrate, the grass carp. Mechanistically, IL-35 stimulation induced the differentiation of CD25L− B cells into CD25L+ B cells, promoting the production of IL-35 and IL-10 via STAT3 activation. Functionally, teleost CD25L+ B cells served as a conventional Breg subtype that exerted its immunosuppressive functions on effector T cells and neutrophils via cell contact or cytokine delivery. Upon bacterial infection, CD25L+ Breg increased earlier than CD25L+ Treg and produced IL-10. In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD model, Breg frequency and IL-10 levels increased significantly during IBD remission, and Breg adoptive transfer could prevent IBD development and contribute to intestinal tissue repair. Conclusions These novel findings reveal that fish have evolved Breg with specialized anti-inflammatory functions, providing evolutionary insights into the phylogenetic origin and functional conservation of Breg from fish to mammals.

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are immunocompromised and highly vulnerable to serious recurrent infections. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are principal sensors of pathogen challenge and are essential in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses to resolve infection. This study identified significant deficiencies in six functionally distinct DC subsets in blood of untreated CLL (UT-CLL) patients and selective normalization of pDCs in response to acalabrutinib (a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. DCs are continuously replenished from hematopoiesis in bone marrow (BM). Four BM developmental intermediates that give rise to cDCs and pDCs were examined and significant reductions identified in UT-CLL patients supporting a precursor/progeny relationship. The deficiencies in blood DCs and BM DC progenitors were significantly associated with alterations in the Flt3/FL signaling pathway critical to DC development and function. The CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI), a highly accurate model to predict progression-free survival and time-to-first treatment (TTFT), revealed that cDC1 and pDC were reduced in High/Very High CLL-IPI compared to Low CLL-IPI patients. Notably, UT-CLL patients with shared DC subset deficiencies had shorter TTFT, uncovering a profound alteration in innate immunity with the potential to instruct therapeutic decision-making.">

        <tr id="Influenza-associated bacterial super-infections in the lung lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Nearly all people have pre-existing memory to influenza virus, which can protect against subsequent infection in the lung. This study explored the role B cells play in protection against bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae) super-infection with previous heterotypic influenza memory. B cell deficiency resulted in an increased inflammatory lung environment and lung tissue injury during super-infection. Loss of B cells increased populations of memory CD8+ T cells in the lung and these CD8+ T cells were transcriptionally and functionally distinct from WT mice. Use of antibody-deficient mouse models showed that this phenotype was specifically due to loss of antibody production from B cells. Passive immunization with influenza-antibody serum in B cell deficient mice rescued the CD8+ T cell phenotype. CD8+ T cell depletion and lethal super-infection challenge experiments showed that the cytotoxic memory CD8+ T cells from B cell deficient mice protect against super-infection bacterial burden and mortality. These findings provide insight into the importance of B cells for regulating immune responses against infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Macrophages exhibit remarkable functional plasticity by dynamically polarizing into proinflammatory or antiinflammatory subsets in response to microenvironmental cues. This duality underpins their pivotal roles in immune defense, tissue homeostasis, and disease progression; however, the molecular mechanisms governing their polarization and crosstalk across various pathologies remain incompletely defined. This review systematically delineates macrophage biology, emphasizing the interplay between subset‐specific signaling networks and their context‐dependent activation in both health and disease. The heterogeneity of macrophages is characterized by detailing the distinctions between tissue‐resident and monocyte‐derived origins, as well as their polarization states. Core pathways regulating phagocytosis, tissue repair, immune modulation, and neuroprotection are dissected, along with their dysregulation in autoimmune disorders, neurodegeneration, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases. Notably, microenvironmental factors such as damage‐associated molecular patterns, pathogen‐associated molecular patterns, and metabolic intermediates dynamically reshape macrophage phenotypes through NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation or signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)‐mediated transcriptional control. Preclinical and clinical evidence underscores potential therapeutic targets and emerging strategies. The significance of this review lies in its integrative analysis of signaling crosstalk, paradoxical pathway roles, and translational implications for precision therapies. These insights into macrophage functions and signaling pathways provide a robust foundation for future disease intervention and personalized medicine.">

        <tr id="Background/Aims Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a severe complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, characterized by immune-mediated tissue damage primarily affecting the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis. However, the pathogenic roles of changes in Treg cell number and function on acute GvHD remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the quantitative and qualitative changes in Treg cells and their clinical and pathogenic implication of acute GvHD. Methods A total of 62 patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation at a tertiary institution from 2019 to 2024 were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry. Treg cell subsets and cytokine production were assessed after T-cell receptor stimulation. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured using cytometric bead array, and Treg cell suppressive function was evaluated through co-culture experiments. Results Patients with acute GvHD showed a decreased frequency of circulating Treg cells, with a notable increase in the CD45RA-FoxP3lo pro-inflammatory subset. Treg cells produced inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α upon stimulation and exhibited reduced suppressive activity. The frequency of TNF-α+ Treg cells correlated with the clinical severity of acute GvHD. Elevated serum levels of IL-6 and IL-21 were associated with the inflammatory conversion of Treg cells. Conclusions During human acute GvHD, frequencies of circulating Treg cells are significantly decreased. Inflammatory change of Treg cells, represented by TNF-α production and reduced suppressive capacity, contributes to the immunopathogenesis of acute GvHD.">

        <tr id="Background A head and neck cancer organoid (HNCO) and peripheral blood T cell co-culture model was established to investigate whether HNCOs can induce the differentiation of peripheral blood T cells into tumor-reactive T cells. Additionally, this study seeks to explore the cytotoxicity of these T cells against autologous tumor organoids, providing theoretical and experimental evidence for the feasibility of this model as a platform for adoptive cell immunotherapy in head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods HNCO single cells were co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) collected and isolated from patients with HNC. The culture supernatant was collected and assayed for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α). The expression of T cell activation markers cluster of differentiation (CD)137 and CD107a was measured by flow cytometry to confirm tumor specificity and cytotoxicity. Additionally, the optimal effector-to-target (E/T) ratio was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and HNCO killing was quantified by fluorescent labeling. Results Of the 27 successfully established HNCO-T cell co-culture systems, 81.48% induced the in vitro differentiation and tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell expansion capable of mediating the killing of mature HNCOs. Conclusion The patient-derived HNCO-T cell co-culture model effectively induced PBL differentiation into tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells with enhanced tumor-killing activities. This model serves as a novel in vitro preclinical tool for advancing personalized adoptive immunotherapy in HNC.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a complex and life-threatening disease process related to a systemic response to severe infection. Due to the challenges of treating patients with sepsis, new therapies are being investigated, including cell-based approaches. Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are immune privileged cells with immunomodulatory properties. Thus, we proposed that TSCs may be beneficial in experimental models of sepsis to regulate the immune response and curtail organ injury. Methods Sepsis was induced by experimental models in mice; cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lung infection with Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae. TSCs were isolated from the chorionic villi of human (h) term placentas, and from mouse (m) placentas using anti-CD117 MicroBeads, and were administered intravenously 6 h after CLP or S. pneumoniae infection. We assessed mortality, bacterial clearance, organ injury, inflammatory response, and production of cytokines and chemokines. Results CD117+ hTSCs did not express human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I or II, and were clonogenic and self-renewing. CLP led to severe mortality by 7 days, and administration of either hTSCs or mTSCs resulted in markedly improved survival compared with control cells or vehicle. hTSCs promoted bacterial clearance and decreased organ injury in the liver, kidney, spleen, and bowel. The elevated innate immune response in the peritoneum, predominantly neutrophils, was attenuated by hTSCs. In addition, neutrophil infiltration into the spleen was less in mice receiving hTSCs, which corresponded with reduced plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. When assessing the lung response to S. pneumoniae infection, administration of hTSCs resulted in fewer bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, and less lung edema and injury. Neutrophils, which were markedly increased in BALF, were diminished and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs was decreased by hTSCs. BALF pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were mitigated by hTSCs to levels of Sham mice, and systemic injury to the liver and spleen was attenuated. Conclusions CD117+ hTSCs are immune privileged cells that when given after the onset of experimental models of infection/sepsis resulted in improved outcomes due to enhanced bacterial clearance, resolving inflammation, and less organ injury. These data support hTSCs as a potential cell-based therapy for sepsis. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13287-025-04479-z.">

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamics of the tumor-immune ecosystem is crucial for advancing neoadjuvant strategies in cancer treatment. This study investigated alterations in the tumor-immune microenvironment related to the response to preoperative combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty patients underwent combination therapy. Biopsy or surgical specimens were obtained before and after treatment. Single-cell-based, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry and image cytometry were employed to assess changes in immune cell densities and profiles. Three distinct immune profiles were identified: hypo-, lymphoid-, and myeloid-inflamed. Significant decreases in tumor volume and increases in CD45+ cells and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) scores were observed in the hypo- and lymphoid-inflamed groups, whereas the myeloid-inflamed group showed minimal changes. After treatment, increased calreticulin expression in tumor cells, together with increased lymphoid cell lineages, was observed in non-recurrent cases. The myeloid-inflamed group exhibited higher expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2, suggesting the presence of a hypoxic and metastasis-promoting environment. Spatial analysis revealed that responders had a high infiltration of T cells within tumor cell nests, whereas non-responders had fewer T cells, with β-catenin expression in cancer cells. Upregulated lymphocyte activation gene 3 in the myeloid-inflammation group, and PD-L1 dynamics suggest potential targets for further therapy. These findings highlight the need for targeted neoadjuvant strategies based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous and aggressive hematologic malignancy, remains challenging to treat due to high relapse rates, chemotherapy resistance, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While traditional therapies like chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have improved outcomes, their efficacy is often limited by toxicity and disease recurrence. Recent advancements in antibody engineering have revolutionized AML immunotherapy, offering precision-targeted strategies to overcome these barriers. This narrative review explores the transformative role of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), and bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) in redirecting immune effector cells, blocking immune checkpoints, and eradicating leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Key innovations include CD33-targeted gemtuzumab ozogamicin, CD123-directed bispecific engagers, and anti-CD47 agents that disrupt “don’t eat me” signals. We highlight breakthroughs in antibody design—such as Fc optimization, trispecific constructs, and conditionally active biologics—that enhance specificity while minimizing on-target off-tumor toxicity. Clinical trials demonstrate promising results, including improved remission rates and survival in refractory/relapsed AML when combining antibodies with hypomethylating agents, venetoclax, or checkpoint inhibitors. However, challenges persist, including AML’s genetic heterogeneity, adaptive immune evasion, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risks. Emerging strategies such as biomarker-driven personalization, TME modulation, and engineered NK-cell engagers are poised to address these limitations. By integrating preclinical insights with clinical data, this review underscores the potential of antibody-based combinatorial regimens to redefine AML therapy, offering durable responses and bridging the gap to curative approaches.">

        <tr id="Bronchiectasis is a chronic airway disease characterized by dysbiosis, persistent inflammation, and permanent structural airway damage. Neutrophilic inflammation is a key pathogenic feature, as indicated by enhanced neutrophil-derived proteases and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), associated with poor prognosis. However, recent studies have identified an eosinophilic endotype in up to 30% of patients, characterized by higher levels of type 2 (T2) cytokines and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). The role of T helper (Th) cells in the dysregulated inflammatory environment of bronchiectasis remains unclear. Evidence suggests that persistent bacterial infection can skew adaptive immunity from Th1 toward Th2 response, while the airway microbiome-IL-17 axis is also a critical regulator of chronic inflammation. T regulatory (Treg) cells have been shown to play a protective role against excessive chronic inflammation by modulating the function of several types of effector cells, including the Th17 subset. However, the capacity of this subset to delay or prevent disease progression remains to be determined Microbial dysbiosis, with loss of diversity and increased quantity of bacterial pathogens, may also be important for disease progression, and emerging evidence indicates that distinct inflammatory endotypes associate with specific microbiota alterations, especially in severe disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the immune cells and cytokine signaling that are involved in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Additionally, we present the main endotypes of bronchiectasis and explore the relationships between the type of inflammation and alterations in microbiota, as well as the potential benefits of targeting specific pathophysiological mechanisms for the management of bronchiectasis. This review also examines how bacterial infection can shift adaptive immunity from Th1 toward Th2 responses, the role of the airway microbiome-IL-17 axis in chronic inflammation and the potential protective role of Treg cells against excessive inflammation. Novel therapeutic strategies are highlighted, with focus on targeting specific cytokine signaling pathways and restoring Th17/Treg balance These developments underscore a shift toward precision medicine in bronchiectasis, emphasizing the importance of identifying specific inflammatory endotypes to tailor treatment strategies effectively.">

        <tr id="Background Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a rare and aggressive pediatric bone malignancy with poor prognosis, driven by therapy-resistant tumor microenvironments (TME). The TME plays a critical role in tumor progression through a complex and dynamic network of reciprocal interactions among immune cells (dysfunctional T cells, immunosuppressive macrophages), stromal components (cancer-associated fibroblasts), and tumor cells. These interactions collectively shape the immune landscape, promote immune evasion, and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Identifying reliable prognostic markers remains a critical challenge. Methods Here we performed an integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, WGCNA, and bulk RNA-seq analyses to investigate tumor-immune interactions. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) intersected with T cell markers identified a total of 174 T cell-associated genes. Functional enrichment analysis and molecular subtyping were performed to explore immune-related pathways. A prognostic model based on CLEC11A, BDP1, and ID3 was constructed using Cox regression and validated in external datasets. Immune infiltration was assessed using the CIBERSORT algorithm. Results T cell marker analyses revealed key roles in pathways such as PI3K-Akt signaling and immune modulation. Molecular subtyping identified two clusters with distinct immune microenvironments: Cluster C1 (immunosuppressive phenotype and poorer prognosis) and Cluster C2 (functionally active immune profile associated with better prognosis). The prognostic model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival (AUC: 0.85, 0.82, 0.78). Additionally, a higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) with low survival rate has been observed in High-risk group. Immune infiltration analysis showed higher CD8+ T cell and dendritic cell activity and immune checkpoint expression in low-risk groups. Experimental validation demonstrated that ID3 silencing inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in ES cell lines. Conclusion Together, our study identified CLEC11A, BDP1, and ID3 as key T cell associated prognostic markers and developed a validated model to predict survival outcomes in ES. Insights into T cell markers and tumor-immune dynamics offer promising advances in prognostic assessment and immunotherapy for ES. Furthermore, the role of ID3 in immune evasion and tumor proliferation underscores its potential as a therapeutic target, providing new avenues for immune checkpoint regulation and personalized treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignant tumor that imposes heavily public health burdens worldwide. Systemic therapies for gastric cancer (GC), such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, have undergone significant advancements. Nevertheless, the extensive application of anti-cancer agents has resulted in an increasing array of challenges related to drug resistance, presenting a substantial barrier in GC treatment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as essential immunomodulators within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of GC, providing novel therapeutic targets due to their capacity for plasticity in reaction to environmental signals. They create a complex network of communication with various immune and stromal cell types, thereby contributing to the immunosuppressive nature of the TME in GC. In this review, we establish the map of the origin and polarization of macrophages in GC. During the process of carcinogenesis, macrophages undergo dynamic phenotypic transitions. Additionally, the interactions between TAMs and tumor cells significantly influence the progression of GC, affecting tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. Furthermore, this intricate immunomodulatory axis notably enhances resistance to immunotherapy, suggesting that targeting TAMs presents substantial therapeutic opportunities for patients with GC. Approaches such as TAM elimination, TAM repolarization, and CAR-M therapy have been validated in numerous studies. We also elaborate on the challenges faced by the development of targeting TAMs, which may provide innovative perspectives on the GC treatment.">

        <tr id="The nucleoside analogue 6-thio-2'-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG, also known as THIO) is a telomere-targeting agent with important clinical potency. It can selectively kill telomerase-positive tumor cells. We previously reported that THIO could successfully induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in multiple mouse tumor cell lines. In this study, we further explored the potential impact of THIO on remodeling the tumor microenvironment, regulating anti-tumor immune responses, and its possible synergistic effects with other therapeutic methods, such as tumor vaccines. Our results showed that THIO could also induce ICD in various human tumor cell lines. The induction of ICD in tumor cells promoted the migration and maturation of antigen-presenting cells. Administration of THIO significantly inhibited the growth of established CT26 and TC-1 tumors in mice. Meanwhile, it enhanced the anti-tumor CTL response and reduced the levels of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in both the spleen and tumor tissues. Additionally, THIO had a direct inhibitory effect on the proliferation and differentiation of MDSCs. Moreover, when combined with bacterial biomimetic vesicles or a nanovaccine, such as THIO with BBV or different Q11-tumor antigen peptide nanofibers, it exhibited enhanced anti-tumor effects and immune responses compared to monotherapy in either “immune hot” TC-1 tumors or “immune cold” B16-F10 tumors. In summary, THIO has the ability to remodel the tumor microenvironment, exert a specific killing effect on tumor cells, and effectively cooperate with tumor vaccines. This broadens the anti-tumor mechanisms of THIO and provides a promising strategy for improving anti-tumor immunotherapies.

        <tr id="The B cell-activating factor (BAFF) system, comprising two ligands and three receptors, plays a pivotal role in adaptive and innate immunity, driving autoimmunity through dysregulated B and T cell survival, differentiation, and cytokine production. This review synthesizes evidence linking BAFF system overexpression to multiple autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), bullous pemphigoid (BP), pemphigus vulgaris (PV), and alopecia areata (AA), where elevated BAFF system molecule levels correlate with autoantibody titers, disease activity, and post-B cell depletion relapse. BAFF-targeted therapies have demonstrated efficacy in reducing disease activity in SLE and SS. Key challenges include interspecies receptor expression discrepancies and context-dependent signalling cascades. Emerging strategies, such as sequential therapy with rituximab followed by belimumab, show promise in treating refractory autoimmune diseases such as BP and PV by counteracting the post-depletion BAFF surge. Despite progress, mechanistic gaps in BAFF-mediated crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity, as well as interspecies-specific pathogenesis warrant further investigation using humanized disease models and single-cell transcriptomic profiling. This review underscores the therapeutic potential of BAFF system modulation while advocating for disease-specific clinical trials to optimize precision-therapeutic targeting in autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="As the diverse functions of neutrophils continue to be uncovered, elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate their differentiation, development, and apoptosis has become crucial for overcoming limitations in the treatment of neutrophil-related diseases. Hematopoietic cell-specific protein 1-associated protein X 1 (HAX1), encoded by the primary pathogenic gene of autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia, serves as a key target for in-depth exploration of neutrophil function. In the Hax1 myeloid knockout C57BL/6J mice and stably transduced HL-60 cells with HAX1 knockdown that we constructed, our results showed that the differentiation of granulocyte-monocyte precursor cells (GMPs) and the maturation of neutrophils were inhibited, significantly reducing the proportion of myeloid cells and neutrophils in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. In addition, HAX1 deletion disrupted mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial membrane potential in neutrophils and increased the protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family members and cleaved Caspase-9. Through RNA sequencing and mRNA validation, we further demonstrated that HAX1 regulates neutrophil apoptosis and maturation via the mitochondrial-mediated classical apoptotic pathway and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated purine-rich box 1 (PU.1) signaling. This study elucidated the critical role of HAX1 in neutrophil differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis, providing new targets for research into neutrophil-related diseases.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown limited efficacy against solid tumors because of poor tissue penetration, constrained activity, and early exhaustion due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although stimulatory cytokines can counteract immune suppression, their systemic administration entails risk of toxicities and counter-regulatory responses. Here, we leveraged a population of tumor-associated TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs) to release interferon-α (IFN-α) and/or orthogonal interleukin-2 (oIL2) at the tumor site. Targeted cytokine delivery rescued CAR T cell functionality against the clinically relevant tumor antigen B7-homolog 3 (B7-H3) in an orthotopic, CAR T cell-refractory, immunocompetent mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM) named mGB2 that recapitulates pathological features of the human disease. Immunophenotypic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that inhibition of premature terminal exhaustion and induction of effector and memory states featuring activation of signaling pathways and transcriptional networks putatively boosted CAR T cell antitumor activity. Furthermore, IFN-α, especially when combined with private oIL2 signaling to CAR T cells, elicited potent endogenous T cell responses against multiple tumor-associated antigens, leading to delayed GBM growth and prolonged mouse survival even with tumors expressing B7-H3 in only a fraction of cells. These data suggest that the combination of TEM-based cytokine delivery and CAR T cells may have synergistic effects and support the further study of this approach for the treatment of patients with GBM.">

However, there has been little success in large-scale clinical trials of myeloid cell modulators. We aim to investigate potential molecular targets for TIMs and disclose the underlying mechanism. Using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we analyzed 24 spontaneous HCC tissues from mouse. Orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor models were established with or without anti-SIRPα antibody treatment. Patient-derived tumor xenografts model (PDX) was used to identify the CD47-SIRPα axis blocked therapy. In 24 murine spontaneous HCC tissues, we observed that the proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) plus macrophages accounts for 40–90% of TIMs and SIRPα was highly expressed in TIMs, especially in macrophages and MDSCs. Through in vivo experiments, we showed that anti-SIRPα therapy inhibited tumor growth, accompanied by increased CD8+ T cells infiltration and decreased TIMs including MDSCs and macrophages. We found that anti-SIRPα inhibited immunosuppressive function, migration and PD-L1 expression of myeloid cells. In a series of in vivo experiments, we demonstrated the anti-tumor and immune-active effect of SIRPα-blocked therapy. Mechanistically, anti-SIRPα inhibited the immunosuppressive function and PD-L1 expression of TIMs through downregulating PI3K/AKT signaling in myeloid cells. At last, anti-SIRPα enhanced the antitumor effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy in orthotopic and spontaneous murine models. Together, SIRPα blocked therapy reversed the immunosuppressive TIME, which provides a promising therapeutic rationale for increasing the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in treating HCC.">

        <tr id="Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airway inflammation and immune dysfunction. However, the molecular alterations and precise origins of immune cells in COPD airways remain poorly understood. Methods Here, CD45+ immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from four COPD patients and four healthy smokers to provide a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of immune cells in COPD airways. Results Notably, CD8+ T cells exhibited increased exhaustion, reduced cytotoxicity, and decreased TCR diversity in COPD airways. Especially, we identified two distinct exhausted CD8+ T cell clusters (CD8Tex_PDCD1 and CD8Trm_LAG3) originating from different developmental trajectories. Regulatory T cells had a reduced proportion and regulatory capacity in COPD airways, while CD4+ tissue-resident memory T cells displayed excessive Th2 responses and diminished Th1 responses. Additionally, monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (Macro_SPP1) underwent lipid metabolic reprogramming and exhibited a shift to an anti-inflammatory phenotype with reduced phagocytosis and protease-antiprotease imbalance in COPD airways. Furthermore, macrophages (particularly Macro_SPP1) showed increased interactions with T cells via SPP1 and GALECTIN signaling, likely contributing to T cell suppression in COPD airways. Conclusion Together, these findings elucidate the dysregulated immune responses in COPD airways and provide a valuable resource for identifying potential therapeutic targets to restore immune homeostasis in COPD.">

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is driven by systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This study aims to characterize the immune landscape in ACLF and identify potential therapeutic targets.


APPROACH AND RESULTS
We employed single-cell RNA sequencing, visium spatial sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis to profile immune cells in ACLF livers compared to acute liver failure (ALF), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and controls. ACLF livers exhibited a distinct immune signature with increased neutrophils, particularly CCL4+ subsets, which drive unresolved inflammation by recruiting additional neutrophils and inflammatory CD14+S100A9+ monocytes. Resident Kupffer cells were reduced, and monocytes differentiated into TREM2+ macrophages with an M1-like pro-inflammatory phenotype, exacerbating inflammation. Additionally, lymphoid cells showed significant dysfunction, with reduced NK cells and relatively expanded T cells exhibiting diminished cytotoxicity or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Cell-cell communication analysis identified the ANXA1-FPR1 axis as a key interaction between T cells and myeloid cells, serving as a negative feedback mechanism to dampen inflammation. Plasma and hepatic ANXA1 levels were elevated in ACLF patients, correlating with disease severity. In preclinical model, the ANXA1 peptide Ac2-26 improved liver function, reduced inflammation, and promoted macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. In vitro, Ac2-26 inhibited CCL4-mediated monocyte chemotaxis and M1 polarization, effects partially blocked by the FPR1 inhibitor Randialic acid B. Mechanically, Ac2-26 activated AMPK and inhibited mTOR signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings provide a comprehensive immune profile in ACLF and highlight ANXA1 as a potential therapeutic target for resolving immune dysregulation and improving outcomes in ACLF.">

        <tr id="Background Cerebral malaria (CM), a fatal neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is partially driven by neuronal injury. Emerging evidence highlights exosomes as vital mediators of mast cell–neuron interactions in neurological disease progression. While mast cells and their exosomes were previously shown to exacerbate experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) severity, the specific role of mast cell-derived exosomes in CM-associated neuronal injury remains unclear. Methods Exosomes were isolated from resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated P815 mast cells (denoted as RE and AE, respectively) and characterized. These exosomes were administered to ECM mice and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected red blood cell (iRBC)-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells to investigate their functional impact and mechanisms. Results Both RE and AE exhibited spherical morphology (20–100 nm diameter) and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81). Compared to infected controls, RE and AE treatments significantly reduced survival time, increased ECM incidence, and exacerbated brain pathology, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, RE and AE administration elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and IL-1β) and increased numbers of neurons expressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1, XBP-1). Notably, AE treatment induced higher morbidity/mortality rates, more severe neuronal injury, and greater ER stress marker expression than RE. In vitro, RE-treated iRBC-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells showed higher GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 mRNA levels than AE-treated cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed three downregulated miRNAs (miR-330-3p, miR-185-5p, and miR-379-5p) and six upregulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-187-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-192-5p) in AE versus RE, all previously implicated in targeting GRP78, CHOP, or XBP-1. Conclusions Mast cell-derived exosomes, particularly those from activated cells (AE), exacerbated ECM neuronal injury through partial activation of ER stress pathways.

        <tr id="Aim/Introduction We aimed to achieve direct quantitative measurement of activated and therapeutically actionable pathways (e.g., Type-I interferon) in target organs of autoimmune disease using flow cytometry of human salivary glands. Sjögren's Disease (SjD) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic inflammation and dysfunction of the lacrimal and salivary glands. Minor salivary glands are routinely biopsied and are used for the histopathological diagnosis of SjD. In this study, we optimized the dissociation, permeabilization, antibody panel, and analytical parameters to characterize both the immune and epithelial cells in the glands, and the activation status of a specified pathway by measuring intracellular phosphorylated proteins. Methods Fresh human MSG biopsies were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and permeabilized under optimized conditions. MSG suspensions were stained for cell surface and intracellular markers then analyzed using nine-color conventional flow cytometry, including two intracellular markers. Results Our optimized dissociation and permeabilization protocols for human MSG preserved key cell surface markers. Our flow cytometry panel identified major immune cell populations and distinguished epithelial cells via cytokeratin-18. We demonstrate the protocol's utility showing differential interferon pathway activity in SjD vs. healthy MSG leukocytes and epithelial cells. We provide guidance on panel selection, analytical capabilities, and the impact of cell yield on resolution using conventional flow cytometry. Conclusion Our optimized protocol enables high-resolution characterization of immune and epithelial cell populations in human MSG, preserving key markers and capturing interferon pathway activity.

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and chronic neuroinflammation. While microglia and astrocytes dominate CNS immune responses, emerging evidence implicates peripheral innate immune cells (PIICs)—including neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—as critical modulators of AD pathogenesis. This review synthesizes recent advances linking PIIC-related genetic polymorphisms to AD susceptibility and progression. We highlight how PIICs traffic into the brain via chemokine signaling, where they exhibit stage-specific effects: early recruitment may limit Aβ deposition via phagocytosis, whereas chronic infiltration exacerbates neuroinflammation and neuronal death. Paradoxically, some PIICs exert immunosuppressive effects that could be harnessed therapeutically. We further discuss preclinical strategies to modulate PIIC function, such as CCR2 inhibition, neutrophil depletion, and MDSC adoptive transfer. By bridging peripheral and central immunity, this review unveils PIICs as promising targets for next-generation AD therapies, advocating for precision immunomodulation tailored to disease stages.">

        <tr id="Background Immunotherapy treatments have significantly improved metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treatment outcomes. Despite recent advancements, the rates of durable response to immunotherapy remain low, and the toxicity profiles of treatment continue to be high. To address these challenges, we report the development of a human carbonic anhydrase-IX (hCA-9)-targeted multifunctional immunotherapy nanoparticles (MINPs) aimed at improving treatment efficacy and reducing toxicity. We hypothesized that these MINPs will facilitate the recognition and elimination of hCA-9-expressing tumor cells by both adaptive immune cells (cytotoxic CD8+ T cells) and innate immune cells (natural killer (NK) cells). Methods Non-targeted and hCA-9-targeted MINPs were prepared by conjugating anti-CA-9, anti-4-1BB, and anti-CD27 antibodies to poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) diblock copolymer NPs. The abilities of different MINPs in activating CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were assessed. In vivo efficacy and mechanistic studies were conducted to evaluate the anticancer activities of different MINPs in immunocompetent hCA-9-transfected mouse RCC tumor models and human ccRCC xenograft models using humanized mice. We also investigated the impact of aging on anticancer efficacy of hCA-9-targeted MINPs in humanized mice. The immune-related side effects associated with the systemic administration of hCA-9-targeted MINPs were characterized. Results Human CA-9-targeted multifunctionalized immunotherapy NPs (MINPs) functionalized with anti-CA-9, anti-4-1BB, and anti-CD27 antibodies outperformed hCA-9-targeted bifunctionalized immunotherapy NPs (BINPs), non-targeted BINPs, and the combination of free antibodies in activating mouse CD8+ T cells and NK cells to kill hCA-9-expressing RCC cells in vitro. In vivo correlative study confirmed that tumor targeting and effective spatiotemporal coactivation of the 4-1BB and CD27 pathways in CD8+ T cells and NK cells are essential for robust antitumor activity. Furthermore, hCA-9-targeted MINPs, but not the combination of free antibodies, inhibited the growth of human ccRCC in hPBMC-humanized mouse models. The anticancer activity of MINPs in mice humanized with hPBMCs from older donors was slightly weaker than in those humanized with younger donors. More importantly, the MINP formulation effectively prevented the hepatotoxicity associated with the systemic administration of immune checkpoint agonistic antibodies. Conclusion This study demonstrates that MINPs are a versatile platform capable of facilitating immune cell engagement and the eradication of targeted ccRCC without causing systemic immune-related side effects.

Notably, the authors link clinical use of dexamethasone with an immunosuppressive myeloid program, potentially high-lighting dexamethason ’ s compounding effect on glioblastoma-associated immunosuppression. Dexamethasone is currently a mainstay therapy used to control peritumoral edema.

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), particularly chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy, has emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment, demonstrating efficacy in hematological malignancies but facing challenges in brain tumors. The combination of ACT with radiation therapy (RT) offers a potential strategy to enhance therapeutic outcomes, as RT can stimulate immune responses by promoting antigen presentation and T cell recruitment. However, a major hurdle is the radiosensitivity of immune cells, leading to their rapid depletion within the radiation field, which undermines the benefits of this combination. This review explores strategies to increase the radioresistance of immune cells, highlighting the need for innovative radioprotective approaches. We discuss the potential of extremophile-derived molecules, such as the Damage Suppressor protein from tardigrades, as novel radioprotectants that could be integrated into ACT protocols. Furthermore, we address key considerations for clinical trial design, including the sequencing of RT and ACT, dosing parameters, and safety considerations. By bridging insights from extremophile biology and immuno-oncology, this work aims to optimize the efficacy of ACT in the challenging context of brain tumors, paving the way for enhanced treatment strategies in neuro-oncology.">

        <tr id="Toxoplasma gondii is a globally prevalent intracellular parasite that infects ∼40 million Americans. The murine immune response to Toxoplasma relies on both toll-like receptor (TLR) 11/12 and immunity related GTPase-mediated (IRGs) responses, which humans lack, making it unclear how the human immune response detects and responds to the parasite. We investigated whether human Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, which detect phosphoantigens through the BTN3A1 receptor, shape the early immune response to the parasite. Using primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we show that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are activated by Toxoplasma-infected cells in a BTN3A1- dependent manner leading to secretion of interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). Additionally, these T cells potentiate IFNγ production by natural killer (NK) cells, likely via TNFα and interleukin (IL)-12 produced during infection. Active parasite invasion is required to stimulate the IFNγ response, and inhibition of the host mevalonate pathway, which limits the synthesis of the phosphoantigen isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), attenuates the cytokine response, indicating Toxoplasma infection increases host phosphoantigens leading to Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation. Our findings identify Vγ9Vδ2 T cells as key effectors that potentiate NK cells in the early human immune response to Toxoplasma, bridging innate and adaptive immunity in the absence of TLR11/12 signaling.">

Seminomas are known for their highly pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) with abundant immune cell infiltration. While previous work has demonstrated that the seminoma-derived cell line TCam-2 induces immune cell activation in co-culture and undergoes phenotypic changes itself, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. To explore the role of direct cell–cell interaction and the effects mediated by soluble mediators such as cytokines, we conducted co-culture experiments of TCam-2 cells with purified human T cells or monocytes, including Transwell assays and treatments with IL-6, TNFα, or their respective blocking antibodies Tocilizumab and Adalimumab. In this way, we found that immune cell activation, indicated by enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an upregulation of activation markers, strongly depended on direct physical contact between both cell types. Nonetheless, we also unveiled the role of soluble mediators in both immune cell activation and promoting a shift in TCam-2 cells from a seminoma-like phenotype to a more dedifferentiated phenotype, suggesting that cytokines critically shape the TME. These observations highlight the complexity of tumor–immune interactions in the seminoma microenvironment, offering new insight into immune-driven dynamics in TGCTs.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection. B-1a cells play a crucial role in maintaining immuno-physiologic homeostasis. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin G (Siglec-G) regulates B-1a cell’s behavior and function. Trogocytosis is the process by which one cell acquires portions of another cell’s plasma membrane and cytoplasm through direct contact. During sepsis, neutrophils accumulate in the lungs and serosal cavities, while B-1a cells decrease. We hypothesized that neutrophil-mediated trogocytosis causes B-1a cell depletion in sepsis, and that targeting this process could preserve B-1a cells and attenuate sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Sepsis was induced in mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Twenty hours after CLP, B-1a cells (CD19+B220lo/-CD23-CD5+) in the pleural and peritoneal cavities were quantified, and neutrophil engulfment of B-1a cells as well as trogocytosis were assessed. We also examine the interaction between Siglec-G and the “don’t-eat-me” signal receptor, CD47. Our data showed that B-1a cell numbers and frequencies in the pleural and peritoneal cavities were significantly decreased in sepsis. Neutrophils co-cultured with B-1a cells significantly increased B-1a cell internalization via trogocytosis. We observed a strong binding interaction between Siglec-G and CD47, which facilitates neutrophil-mediated trogocytosis by compromising CD47 function. We discovered a novel 11-aa therapeutic peptide, named Compound 11 (C11), derived from the CD47 region interacting with Siglec-G. C11 effectively preserved B-1a cell populations, significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, alleviated ALI, and improved survival in sepsis. Our findings highlight the Siglec-G/CD47 axis on B-1a cells as a key regulator of neutrophil-mediated B-1a cell depletion. Targeting this pathway with C11 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate immune dysregulation and improve sepsis outcomes.">

However, the role of distinct neutrophil subsets within the TME in mediating tumor resistance to immunotherapy remains poorly understood. Here, the present study reveals that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (PLAUR)+ neutrophils are enriched in immunotherapy non-responders and correlate with poor prognosis. Through multi-omics analyses of clinical cohorts and preclinical models, PLAUR+ neutrophils identify as a pivotal driver of immunotherapy resistance by shaping an immunosuppressive TME. Mechanistically, spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing reveal that PLAUR+ neutrophils orchestrate immune evasion by CD8+ T cell exclusion and macrophage-dependent immune suppression. Through the structure-based virtual screening, a novel PLAUR inhibitor is identified that could reverse the immunosuppressive phenotype of neutrophils. In various in vivo tumor models, PLAUR inhibitor suppresses tumor growth and potentiates the efficacy of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. These results demonstrate that PLAUR+ neutrophils serve as a critical regulator of immunotherapy resistance and targeting PLAUR is a promising strategy to augment the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in HCC.">

PCs support tumor cell survival, proliferation, and therapy resistance through intercellular communication, metabolic reprogramming, and extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated signaling. This study investigates the mechanisms by which the CLL microenvironment, especially PCs, contributes to drug resistance and disease evolution, with a particular focus on EVs and metabolic remodeling. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to synthesize current findings in this domain.. Key findings reveal that PCs mediate resistance through multiple interconnected mechanisms, including: (1) the CXCL12/CXCR4 retention axis; (2) CD40-CD40L-induced activation of the alternative NF-B pathway; (3) metabolic reprogramming favoring anti-apoptotic profiles; and (4) EV-mediated communication that alters stromal cell behavior. CLL-derived EVs play a critical role in reshaping the bone marrow microenvironment by transferring miRNAs and proteins that alter stromal cell function and metabolism. Additionally, this study identifies a dual metabolic shift in CLL cells, characterized by the simultaneous enhancement of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which is closely linked to microenvironmental dependency. Furthermore, the research uncovers metabolic regionalization within PCs and spatiotemporal heterogeneity in EV distribution.">

We showed in human and mouse lung cancer, that chemotherapy transiently reduced Treg number and switched the mononuclear phagocyte (MP) landscape toward a pro-inflammatory signature but also an increased TGFβ-expressing TAM accumulation over time. Preventing Treg recovery further increased the recruitment of monocytes and limited TGFβ expression upon TAM differentiation, demonstrating that Tregs dampen the pro-inflammatory status of the MP compartment induced by chemotherapy and promote tumor relapse. Anti-TNFR2 antibody treatment during the Treg recovery phase affected the direct interaction between Tregs and MPs, increased the pro-inflammatory signature of the MPs and improved survival in the mouse model.

Among these, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the most extensively studied and have shown significant potential in the post-transplant setting. Tregs are broadly categorized into thymus-derived and peripherally derived subsets. Physiologically, they play key roles in maintaining immune tolerance, including in autoimmune diseases and within the tumor microenvironment. Their immunosuppressive functions are mediated through both contact-dependent and contact-independent mechanisms. Studies investigating the use of Tregs following kidney transplantation have shown encouraging results. This review summarizes the biology of Tregs and highlights current evidence supporting their role in transplant immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The transformation of myeloid leukemia blasts into leukemia‑derived dendritic cells (DCleu) is a notable phenomenon. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in modulating physiological and pathological activities, particularly in immune activation. In the present study, EVs were isolated from DC/DCleu culture supernatants derived from healthy (H) donors (n=9) and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=9) using whole blood (WB) samples, both with and without Kit M (granulocyte‑macrophage colony‑stimulating factor and prostaglandin E1). This was followed by T‑cell enriched mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) with Kit M‑treated and untreated WB. To assess the qualitative and quantitative differences in EVs between Kit M‑treated and untreated samples, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis and multiplex bead‑based flow cytometry were employed. The present findings indicate that DC/MLC supernatant‑derived EVs can be successfully identified, quantified and characterized. Furthermore, these EVs exhibit regulatory properties in both H and AML samples. Results showed that a higher number of CD8+ EVs were detected after DC culture compared with before in both H and AML samples. Thrombocyte‑associated EVs (CD41b+, CD42a+ and CD62P+) significantly increased following DC culture in both groups. While low frequencies of progenitor/blast marker (CD133+) associated EVs were detected in H samples before and after DC culture, their frequencies increased after DC culture in AML samples. Additionally, a higher number of CD8+ and CD2+ EVs were observed after MLC culture compared with before in both H and AML samples. Correlation analyses revealed that improved blast lysis in Kit M‑pretreated samples (normalized to control) associated with the presence of EV subtypes associated with T (CD2+), B (CD20+, 24+), and other cell markers (for example, CD31+, CD146+, CD44+ and CD49e+). This comprehensive approach provides insights into the impact of Kit M on DC/DCleu generation and the subsequent activation of immune cells, leading to differences in EV production between H and AML samples.">

        <tr id="Background CNS stromal cells, especially fibroblasts and endothelial cells, support leukocyte accumulation through upregulation of adhesion molecules and lymphoid chemokines. While chronically activated fibroblast networks can drive pathogenic immune cell aggregates known as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), early stromal cell activation during CNS infection can support anti-viral T cells. However, the cell types and factors driving early stromal cell activation is poorly explored. Aims A neurotropic murine coronavirus (mCoV) infection model was used to better characterize signals that promote fibroblast networks supporting accumulation of antiviral lymphocytes. Based on the early appearance of IgD+ B cells with unknown functions during several CNS infections, we probed their potential to activate stromal cells through lymphotoxin β (LTβ), a molecule critical in maintaining fibroblast-networks in lymphoid tissues as well as promoting TLS in autoimmunity and cancers. Results Kinetic analysis of stromal cell activation in olfactory bulbs and brains revealed that upregulation of adhesion molecules and lymphoid chemokines Ccl19, Ccl21 and Cxcl13 closely tracked viral replication. Immunohistochemistry revealed that upregulation of the fibroblast marker podoplanin (PDPN) at meningeal and perivascular sites mirrored kinetics of RNA expression. Moreover, both B cells and T cells colocalized to areas of PDPN reactivity, supporting a potential role in regulating stromal cell activation. However, specific depletion of LTβ from B cells using Mb1-creERT2 x Ltβfl/fl mice had no effect on T or B cell recruitment or viral replication. B cell depletion by anti-CD20 antibody also had no adverse effects. Surprisingly, LTβR agonism reduced viral control and parenchymal T cell localization despite increasing stromal cell lymphoid chemokines and PDPN. Additional assessment of direct stromal cell activation by the viral RNA mimic poly I:C showed induction of Pdpn and Ccl19 preceding Ltb. Conclusions Neither B cell-derived LTβ or B cells are primary drivers of stromal cell activation networks in the CNS following mCoV infection. Although supplementary agonist mediated LTβR engagement confirmed a role for LTβ in enhancing PDPN and lymphoid chemokine expression, it impeded T cell migration to the CNS parenchyma and viral control. Our data overall indicate that stromal cells can integrate LTβR signals to tune their activation, but that LTβ is not necessarily essential and can even dysregulate protective antiviral T cell functions.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and intrinsic resistance to conventional therapies. Radiotherapy (RT), traditionally valued for its cytotoxic effects, has recently been recognized for its immunomodulatory potential. This mini-review explores the multifaceted interactions between RT and the PDAC immune microenvironment, highlighting mechanisms such as induction of immunogenic cell death, enhancement of antigen presentation, modulation of cytokine and chemokine profiles, and upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules. These effects may transform immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot” ones, providing a rationale for combination strategies with immunotherapy. However, the dense desmoplastic stroma, abundance of regulatory T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells within PDAC present substantial challenges that hinder effective immune activation. Advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies offer new opportunities to better characterize the TME and guide personalized treatment strategies. By synthesizing mechanistic insights and clinical evidence, this review underscores the potential of integrating RT with immunotherapy to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve therapeutic outcomes in PDAC.">

        <tr id="This study employed single-cell sequencing to analyze immune dynamics in pediatric infectious mononucleosis (IM), focusing on EBV-host interactions. EBV primarily infected B-cell subsets, showing distinct tropism from EBV-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, indicating stage-specific infection patterns. Coexpression of lytic (BALF3/5) and latent (EBNA-3A, LMP-2A) genes suggested dynamic infection states. Notably, RPMS1 expression was consistently detected in IM patients, where this oncogenic regulator influences viral latency maintenance and cellular transformation through Notch signaling. NK cell subsets exhibited differential responses: CD16 + CD56dim NK cells demonstrated enhanced EBV cytotoxicity, while CD16 - CD56bright NK cells showed immunoregulatory potential. Clonal expansion of IGHV4-34/59 in B cells (involved in EBV gp350 binding and autoimmunity) suggested dual roles in viral neutralization and pathogenesis. Frequent IGHJ4/IGLJ3 BCR rearrangements informed vaccine design. Elevated COTL1 in T cells correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine release, indicating therapeutic potential. Dysregulated IRF4/PRDM1 in plasma cells reflected interindividual EBV control variability. These findings delineate IM immunopathology, linking EBV persistence to clonal expansion and immune evasion, while providing a framework for targeted therapies (NK cell engineering, IGHV4-directed antibodies, COTL1 modulation) to advance EBV-associated disease treatment.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, a key component of the innate immune system, have emerged as significant players in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer. Traditionally recognized for their role in defending against infections, neutrophils in cancer contribute to both tumor progression and suppression, depending on their activation state and the signals they receive. Neutrophil-driven inflammation within the TME is critical in promoting tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. This review explores the complex role of neutrophils in breast cancer, emphasizing the mechanisms through which they influence tumor inflammation, including their interactions with other immune cells and the signaling pathways involved. Neutrophils can either support tumor progression by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, and reactive oxygen species, or contribute to antitumor responses by directly killing cancer cells and stimulating adaptive immunity. The balance between these opposing functions is heavily influenced by the TME’s cytokine milieu and neutrophil polarization. Key signaling pathways, such as the CXCR2-CXCL8 axis and interactions with tumor-associated macrophages, regulate neutrophil recruitment and activation in the TME, enhancing inflammation and tumorigenesis. Additionally, neutrophils’ ability to form neutrophil extracellular traps further complicates their role, potentially promoting metastasis by trapping circulating tumor cells.">

The alarmin IL-33 and its receptor STimulation-2 (ST2) promote activation of tissue-regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and accelerate malignant progression in solid tumors, but their role in leukemia remains unclear. Here, we show that ST2+ Treg cells are enriched in bone marrow (BM) of humans and mice with AML and promote CD8+ T cells depletion and exhaustion. ST2 deficiency in Treg cells restores CD8+ T cell function, decreasing AML growth via retention of ST2+ Treg cells precursors in lymph nodes. AML-activated ST2+ Treg cells lack T-bet, IFN-γ and Bcl-6, and kill intratumoral CD8+ T cells by amplified granzyme B-mediated cytotoxicity compared to non-AML primed Treg cells. Engineered anti-ST2 antibodies induce ST2+ Treg cells apoptosis to extend survival in AML models. Together, our findings suggest that ST2 is a potential checkpoint target for AML immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The testicular immune microenvironment sustains homeostasis and immune privilege. However, the presence and functional significance of B cells within this specialized niche remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, the intricate crosstalk between resident immune populations and testicular stromal cells that may orchestrate the immunological and endocrine microenvironment during sexual maturation warrants systematic investigation.


OBJECTIVE
To systematically delineate the immune cell atlas and developmental trajectory of testicular leukocytes before and after sexual maturation.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
An integrated analysis of leukocytes in post-sexual maturity (8-week-old) and pre-sexual maturity (2-week-old) mouse testes using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF), was performed. Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) isolated immune subsets, followed by bioinformatics interrogation of cellular heterogeneity and ligand-receptor network analysis to map intercellular communication pathways.


RESULTS
Through scRNA-seq clustering analysis, we resolved 18 distinct leukocyte populations (11 lymphoid and seven myeloid lineages), which were further validated and expanded to 17 phenotypically discrete subsets (eight lymphoid and nine myeloid) via high-dimensional CyTOF profiling. Notably, we identified a rare but functionally significant B lymphocyte population within the testicular compartment. The myeloid compartment exhibited pronounced developmental plasticity, marked by progressive Il1b+Macrophages diminution and regulatory T cell expansion during maturation. Cell communication network analysis revealed intensified ligand-receptor cross-talk between androgen-producing Leydig cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes in post-pubertal testes, providing mechanistic insights into age-dependent immune privilege establishment.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Multi-omics integration reveals dynamic immune remodeling during testicular maturation. These findings underscore the potential involvement of B cells in local immune surveillance while identifying maturation-associated signaling axes between stromal and immune cells. This comprehensive mapping of testicular leukocyte dynamics significantly advances our understanding of reproductive immunology and lays foundation for investigating immune-mediated testicular pathologies.">

In mice, we find that miR‐29a/b suppresses the differentiation of CD8+ T cells and the secretion of pro‐inflammatory and chemotactic factors during severe colitis by inhibiting transcriptional pathways, including those involving the T cell receptor and JAK‐STAT signaling. Furthermore, we identify Ifng, an inflammatory factor that drives immune response and the reshaping of CD8+ T cell fate, as a potential target of the miRNAs. Finally, we show that delivery of miR‐29 mimics to the colon of mice is sufficient to alleviate DSS‐induced inflammation. Together, these data show that miR‐29 plays an important role in suppressing T cell overactivation during inflammatory diseases.">

The interaction between tumor cells and macrophages plays a crucial role in tumor development, supporting angiogenesis, nurturing tumor stem cells, and promoting immune-suppressive TME. Therefore, elucidating the potential mechanisms by which EGFRvIII mutation in GBM cells regulates surrounding immune cells to drive tumor progression may provide new targets for precise immune therapy for specific GBM subtypes or genotypes. In this study, we found that EGFRvIII was the most common form of EGFR mutation, with an incidence rate of 22.13% in glioma patients and 33.3% in GBM patients. Mechanistically, we found for the first time that EGFRvIII-positive GBM secretes high levels of MDK via the ERK-c-Fos signaling pathway. Subsequently, GBM cell-secreted MDK drives macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype and secretion of the cytokine CXCL1 via activation of the macrophage surface receptor LRP1 and downstream pathways. In turn, these macrophages secrete CXCL1, which attracts immune-suppressive cells and TAMs to support GBM growth. In the intracranial glioma model, blocking MDK signaling pathway could inhibit macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype and tumor malignant progression. In summary, our study for the first time found that EGFRvIII-positive GBM can drive macrophage polarization towards M2 phenotype and secretion of immune-suppressive cytokine CXCL1 via the c-Fos-MDK-LRP1 signaling pathway, providing new targets for precise immune therapy for specific GBM subtypes or genotypes.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a fatal central nervous system infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans breaching the blood–brain barrier (BBB), carrying a mortality rate approaching 100% in untreated individuals, while even survivors following treatment often experience neurological complications including optic nerve atrophy, memory impairment, hydrocephalus, and motor dysfunction. Current research has yet to fully elucidate the complex pathological mechanisms of CM, particularly leaving a significant gap in the systemic analysis within the dynamic interaction network of immunity, metabolism, and the gut microbiota. This article systematically integrates the interplay of immune responses, metabolic reprogramming, and the gut microbiome to reveal the pathogenesis of CM across multiple dimensions: in immune regulation, the phagocytic-inflammatory equilibrium in macrophages and CD4 + T cells defends against pathogen invasion, but hyperactivated immune responses may damage the BBB and exacerbate neural injury; metabolically, host iron overload induces ferroptosis, disrupting the BBB via lipid peroxidation, while inositol metabolism provides substrates for cryptococcal capsular synthesis, enhancing its virulence and promoting CNS invasion; the gut microbiota, meanwhile, modulates immune homeostasis via the “gut-brain axis,” with its metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) enhancing BBB integrity and suppressing neuroinflammation through immunomodulation. We propose a combined therapeutic strategy of “immunomodulators + metabolic inhibitors + microbiota intervention,” moving beyond traditional single-factor research paradigms to establish a multi-omics integrated framework for the precise treatment of CM—spanning molecular mechanisms to clinical translation—and propelling the field of neuroinfectious diseases towards a host-pathogen-microenvironment systemic regulation paradigm.">

Results CT-EV showed a significant increase in EV quantity and the production of CTLA4, transforming growth factor β1, and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist compared with ASC-EV. In mitogen-stimulated immune cells from CIA mice, CT-EV significantly reduced IL-6, IL-10, and Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Presumably Secreted (RANTES) levels. Administration of both ASC-EV and CT-EV led to a decrease in macrophage proportions and an increase in T helper type 2 cells and serum IL-4 levels. Furthermore, CT-EV treatment resulted in additional reductions in anti-CII antibody levels, C-telopeptide II concentrations, and the proportion of CD138⁺ cells, thereby contributing to cartilage protection. Conclusions CT-EV demonstrated superior therapeutic effects compared with ASC-EV in the CIA model, highlighting its potential as an effective treatment strategy for RA.

        <tr id="Previously, we reported that targeting IGSF9 could enhance anti-tumor T-cell activity and sensitivity to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, although the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we find that, similar to the regulation of PD-L1 expression, IFNγ also induces the expression of IGSF9 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The siRNA specifically targeting JAK1 and a STAT1 inhibitor blocking IFNγ signal pathway significantly inhibit the expression of IGSF9 and PD-L1. As a tumor-specific immune checkpoint molecule, IGSF9 plays a significant role in promoting tumor escape. The induction of both PD-L1 and IGSF9 by IFNγ in the tumor microenvironment explains why IGSF9 is highly expressed in tumors and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This induction also underpins the strong synergistic effects when combining anti-IGSF9 and anti-PD-1 therapies. Additionally, IGSF9 also mediates the extramedullary infiltration of AML cells, which can be inhibited by depletion of IGSF9 or anti-IGSF9. The binding epitopes of anti-IGSF9 are located within the immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) and fibronectin type-III-2(FnIII-2) domains of IGSF9. Based on these findings, we develop an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting IGSF9 (anti-IGSF9-linker-DXd). This ADC exhibits 99.7% purity, primarily exists in monomeric form, demonstrating excellent homogeneity (DAR=8-10) and specificity. Anti-IGSF9-linker-DXd effectively kills IGSF9-positive tumor cells and exhibits a potent bystander effect. In vivo, anti-IGSF9-linker-DXd almost completely eliminates early- and mid-stage tumors and significantly inhibits the progression of advanced tumors. In summary, our findings underscore the potential of IGSF9 as a novel therapeutic target for AML treatment, highlighting its role in disease progression and the efficacy of targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Human papillomavirus-mediated recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a premalignant neoplasia of the upper airway characterized by significant dysphonia and respiratory obstruction. Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a potential alternative to repeated surgical interventions in RRP. Here, we investigated the intralesional T-cell composition and expression of the immune checkpoints programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) in RRP. We analyzed tissue samples from 30 patients treated at a tertiary care center between 2009 and 2021, including paired samples from individual patients collected at different time points. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for CD4, CD8, CTLA-4, FoxP3, and PD-L1 and correlated with disease severity and previous adjuvant therapies. Overall disease burden and intervention-free survival were not associated with the abundance of CD4+, CD8+, or FoxP3+ T cells, nor with immune checkpoint expression. However, patients with aggressive disease exhibited a higher intralesional FoxP3/CD4 T-cell ratio. Prior intralesional cidofovir treatment was associated with reduced CD4+ T-cell infiltration. These findings suggest that a locally immunosuppressive microenvironment, reflected by an elevated FoxP3/CD4 ratio, contributes to disease severity in RRP. Consistent CTLA-4 expression across all evaluated samples supports further investigation of anti-CTLA-4 therapy, either alone or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. Unfortunately, the inability of lymphocytes to infiltrate the tumor nest, a phenomenon known as immune exclusion, drastically limits ICB responsiveness. Analyzing the immune landscape of matched pre- and early on-treatment biopsies of patients with melanoma undergoing ICB therapy, we observed a significant increase in cytotoxic NK cells in early on-treatment biopsies from nonresponders. Spatial multiomic analyses revealed that, although NK cells colocalized with CD8+ T cells within the tumor bed in responding lesions, they were excluded from the tumor parenchyma in nonresponding lesions. Strikingly, pharmacologic depletion of NK cells in a unique melanoma mouse model exhibiting an immune-excluded phenotype unleashed immune infiltration of the tumor core and tumor clearance upon ICB exposure. Mechanistically, we show that NK cells are actively recruited to immune-excluded areas upon ICB exposure via the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 to suppress tumor infiltration and antitumor function of CD8+ T cells.


SIGNIFICANCE
Immune exclusion is responsible for intrinsic resistance to ICB in about half of nonresponder patients. Our unexpected observation that targeting NK cell biology unleashes the recruitment and antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells in tumors with an immune-excluded phenotype offers a potential therapeutic avenue for this large patient population.

        <tr id="Abstract T‐cell immunoglobulin and mucin‐domain containing‐3 (TIM3), generally known as an immune checkpoint receptor, is expressed on leukemic stem and progenitor cells (LSPCs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and has an active role in LSC self‐renewal. Therefore, TIM3 has been suggested as a potential target for AML treatment. Hence, we explored the feasibility of targeting TIM3 with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cells. Despite the expression of TIM3 on activated T‐cells, TIM3 CAR T‐cells were successfully generated from different healthy individuals with excellent in vitro expansion without signs of fratricide and sustained central‐memory phenotype with minimal expression of exhaustion‐related markers, including complete loss of TIM3 expression. TIM3 loss also did not affect effector functions since TIM3 CAR T‐cells efficiently lysed TIM3+ leukemic cell lines, produced Th1‐predominant cytokines, successfully inhibited the colony‐forming of TIM3+ AML‐derived LSPCs, and showed excellent AML tumor control in xenogeneic mouse models. Notably, TIM3 CAR T‐cells did not affect healthy hematopoietic progenitor cells and healthy mature hematopoietic cells that express TIM3 at moderate levels, suggesting an optimal therapeutic window for the treatment of AML.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Colon cancer is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with significant global incidence and mortality. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in disease progression and treatment response. Among key components of the TME are tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T cells, whose balance influences cancer outcomes.


METHODS
This review analyzes recent findings regarding the role of Treg cells in colon cancer progression by evaluating preclinical and clinical studies that explore immune cell composition, function, and modulation within the TME.


RESULTS
Treg cells demonstrate a dual role in colon cancer. While they suppress effective anti-tumor immune responses, facilitating immune evasion, they may also mitigate chronic inflammation, which contributes to carcinogenesis. High intratumoral Treg levels are correlated with poor prognosis, reduced immunotherapy efficacy, and lower overall survival. Strategies to deplete or reprogram Tregs, such as immune checkpoint inhibition, modulation of T cell plasticity, and selective targeting, have shown promise in enhancing anti-tumor immunity.


DISCUSSION
Complete depletion of Tregs risks inducing autoimmune toxicity. Therefore, a precise understanding of Treg cell subsets and functions is essential. This review highlights the importance of developing targeted immunotherapeutic strategies that modulate Treg activity while preserving immune homeostasis in colon cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Lung structural cells form barriers against pathogens and trigger immune responses following infections. This leads to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells some of which remain within the lung and contribute to enhanced pathogen control following subsequent infections. There is growing evidence that structural cells also display long-term changes following infection. Here we investigate long-term changes to mouse lung epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells following influenza virus infection finding that all three cell types maintain an imprint of the infection, particularly in genes linked to communication with T cells. MHCI and MHCII proteins continue to be expressed at higher levels in both differentiated epithelial cells and progenitor populations and several differentially expressed genes are downstream of the transcription factor, SpiB, a known orchestrator of antigen presentation. Lung epithelial cells from influenza-infected mice display functional changes, more rapidly controlling influenza virus than cells from naïve animals. This rapid anti-viral response and increased expression of molecules required to communicate with T cells demonstrates sustained and enhanced functions following infection. These data suggest lung structural cells display characteristics of immune memory which could affect outcomes that are protective in the context of infection or pathogenic in chronic inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most aggressive and lethal brain tumor in adults and poses significant challenges to patient survival. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the molecular and genetic landscape of GBM, focusing on key oncogenic drivers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which are critical for tumorigenesis and progression. We delve into the role of epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, in driving therapy resistance and tumor evolution. The tumor microenvironment is known for its pivotal role in immune evasion, with tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T cells creating an immunosuppressive niche that sustains GBM growth. Emerging therapies, such as immunotherapies, oncolytic viral therapies, extracellular vesicle-based approaches, and non-coding RNA interventions, are highlighted as promising avenues to disrupt GBM pathogenesis. Advances in precision medicine and innovative technologies, including electric field therapy and locoregional treatments, are discussed for their potential to overcome the blood‒brain barrier and treatment resistance. Additionally, this review underscores the importance of metabolic reprogramming, particularly hypoxia-driven adaptations and altered lipid metabolism, in fueling GBM progression and influencing the therapeutic response. The role of glioma stem cells in tumor recurrence and resistance is also emphasized, highlighting the need for targeted therapeutic approaches. By integrating molecular targeting, immune energetics, and technological advancements, this review outlines a multidisciplinary framework for improving GBM treatment outcomes. Ultimately, the convergence of genetic, metabolic, and immune-based strategies offers transformative potential in GBM management, paving the way for increased patient survival and quality of life.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for systemic sclerosis (SSc), a rare autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and vasculopathy. Recent evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefits of MSCs do not depend directly on their ability to proliferate but rather on their capacity to release extracellular nanovesicles known as exosomes (MSC-Exos). MSC-Exos are rich in bioactive molecules such as microRNAs, which can modulate gene expression and trigger significant biological responses, playing a central role in modulating immune responses, inhibiting fibrotic pathways and promoting tissue repair and angiogenesis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that MSC-Exos can attenuate fibrosis, modulate macrophage polarization, suppress autoreactive lymphocyte activity, and even reverse pulmonary arterial hypertension in animal models of SSc. Compared to cell-based therapies, MSC-Exos offer several advantages, including lower immunogenicity and better safety profile.

These cells exist in two primary forms: tissue-resident macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), each exhibiting distinct functions in neuroimmune responses. Tissue-resident macrophages maintain tissue homeostasis and act as the first line of defense against pathogens, while MDMs are recruited during inflammation, performing both phagocytic and immunomodulatory functions. Despite the recognized roles of these macrophage populations in systemic immunity, their specific contributions to neuroimmune regulation remain poorly understood. This review aims to elucidate the differential roles of tissue-resident macrophages and MDMs in the neuroimmune pathway. We explore their mechanisms of activation, interaction with other immune cells, and involvement in inflammatory processes within the central nervous system (CNS).

Patients with short telomeres also develop immunodeficiency with low CD4+ T cells and impaired general immunosurveillance, particularly against solid neoplasms. We investigated a broad spectrum of lymphocyte subsets and myeloid immune cells from human patients with telomere biology disorders (TBDs) and matched healthy volunteers to understand further how the immune system is affected by telomere dysfunction. We employed mass cytometry (CyTOF) for deep-immunophenotyping peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), followed by high-dimensional data analysis. Cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were assessed in serum. Our results showed profound immune alterations in TBD beyond those observed in aging, with low naïve lymphocytes and thymic hypofunction. We further observed that T helper subsets were markedly skewed, with an inverted TH2/TH1 ratio and low TH17 and TH17.1 levels. T cell activation and exhaustion markers were upregulated, whereas circulating mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells were significantly decreased and overactivated. Several serum cytokine levels were positively correlated with telomere length and blood counts, suggesting an association with marrow function. In aggregate, these findings suggest a pro-inflammatory profile in TBDs. Our data provide new details on how TBD affects immune cells, particularly lymphocytes, which may contribute to the clinical phenotypes.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Several studies have demonstrated the occurrence of secondary tumors as a rare but significant complication of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, underscoring the need for a detailed investigation. Given the limited variety of secondary tumor types reported to date, a comprehensive characterization of the various secondary tumors arising after CAR-T therapy is essential to understand the associated risks and to define the role of the immune microenvironment in malignant transformation. This study aims to characterize the immune microenvironment of a newly identified secondary tumor post-CAR-T therapy, to clarify its pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.


METHODS
In this study, the bone marrow (BM) samples were collected by aspiration from the primary and secondary tumors before and after CD19 CAR-T treatment. The CD45+ BM cells were enriched with human CD45 microbeads. The CD45+ cells were then sent for 10× genomics single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify cell populations. The Cell Ranger pipeline and CellChat were used for detailed analysis.


RESULTS
In this study, a rare type of secondary chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) were reported in a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who had previously received CD19 CAR-T therapy. The scRNA-seq analysis revealed increased inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and an immunosuppressive state of monocytes/macrophages, which may impair cytotoxic activity in both T and natural killer (NK) cells in secondary CMML before treatment. In contrast, their cytotoxicity was restored in secondary CMML after treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
This finding delineates a previously unrecognized type of secondary tumor, CMML, after CAR-T therapy and provide a framework for defining the immune microenvironment of secondary tumor occurrence after CAR-T therapy. In addition, the results provide a rationale for targeting macrophages to improve treatment strategies for CMML treatment.">

        <tr id="T cell-dependent bispecific antibodies (TDBs) are next-generation antibody therapies that link cancer cells and T cells to achieve potent antitumor effects. Despite the successful development of TDBs for hematological malignancies, their efficacy against solid tumors remains limited. Overcoming this challenge requires a deeper understanding of their mechanisms of action. While the basic process of immunological synapse (IS) formation and T cell activation by TDB is known, the detailed effects of IS on the bystander effect and T cell migration, both crucial for therapeutic efficacy, remain unclear. This study investigated these mechanisms using an EGFR/CD3 TDB (hEx3) and EGFR knockout cancer cells (KO). The results revealed that IS formation by TDB induced a bystander effect, leading to damage in surrounding KO, with the extent depending on the proportion of EGFR-positive wild-type cancer cells (WT) and the duration of co-culture. Furthermore, IS formation significantly enhanced T cell cytokine and chemokine secretion, promoting T cell migration. These findings provide critical insights into TDB efficacy mechanisms and highlight the importance of evaluating IS formation in developing new antibody drugs. Establishing a reliable system for assessing IS formation will be essential for advancing TDBs and other antibody-based therapies, particularly against solid tumors.

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) orchestrates a profound disruption of immune balance within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. To better understand these complex immune dynamics, we used high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) profiling to comprehensively characterize the immune landscape of the BM across different stages of myeloma progression, including MGUS (n = 16), smoldering MM (SMM; n = 25), and active MM, both newly diagnosed (n = 43) and relapsed/refractory (n = 104). Our analysis revealed substantial immune remodeling during disease progression, characterized by adaptive immune suppression and extensive infiltration of innate immune populations. Transformation from MGUS to SMM was marked by significant alterations in central and effector memory T helper cells, effector cytotoxic T cells, and an enrichment of monocytic and neutrophil subsets. Active MM stages were further distinguished by increased expansion of myeloid and monocytic lineages, alongside a pronounced reduction in progenitor and transitional B cells. Correspondence analysis demonstrated that specific immune profiles were significantly associated with clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival and overall survival. This study highlights the potential of CyTOF-based molecular profiling to unravel the intricate immune dynamics of the BM microenvironment across MM disease stages, enhancing our understanding of MM pathogenesis and providing a foundation for identifying prognostic biomarkers and tailoring precision immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Vδ1 γδ T cells are key players in innate and adaptive immunity, particularly at mucosal interfaces such as the gut. An increase in circulating Vδ1 cells has long been observed in people with HIV-1, but remains poorly understood. We performed a comprehensive characterization of Vδ1 T cells in blood and duodenal intra-epithelial lymphocytes, obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies of 15 people with HIV-1 on antiretroviral therapy and 15 HIV-seronegative controls, in a substudy of the ANRS EP61 GALT study (NCT02906137). We deciphered the phenotype, functional profile, single-cell transcriptome and repertoire of Vδ1 cells and unraveled their relationships with the possible triggers involved, in particular CMV and microbiota. We also assessed whether Vδ1 T cells may play a role in controlling the HIV-1 reservoir. Vδ1 T cells were mainly terminally differentiated effectors that clonally expanded in the blood with some trafficking with the gut of people with HIV-1. Most expressed CX3CR1 and displayed a highly cytotoxic profile, but low cytokine production, supported by a transcriptomic shift towards enhanced effector lymphocytes. This expansion was associated with CMV status and markers of occult replication, but also with changes in the duodenal and blood-translocated microbiota.

        <tr id="Neutrophils have emerged as key players in tumor progression and are often associated with poor prognosis. Despite ongoing efforts to target neutrophil functions in cancer, therapeutic success has been limited. In this study, we addressed the possibility of blocking STAT3 signaling in neutrophils as a targeted therapeutic intervention in cancer. Conditional deletion of Stat3 in a neutrophil-specific manner (Ly6GcreStat3fl/fl mice) significantly impaired tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Neutrophils isolated from these mice exhibited a strong antitumoral phenotype, with increased MHCII, CD80/86 and ICAM-1 expression. Immune profiling of tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of these mice revealed significant enrichment of CD8+ T cells (granzymeBhi, perforinhi and IFN-γhi) with strong cytotoxic activity. To further translate these findings to human settings, we blocked STAT3 signaling in cancer patient neutrophils via the small molecule inhibitor LLL12 and assessed its effects on patient-derived tumor explants. In agreement with the in vivo mouse data, we observed the expansion and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in such explants. To test the therapeutic applicability of STAT3 targeting, we utilized myeloid cell-selective STAT3 antisense oligonucleotide (CpG-STAT3ASO) to target neutrophils in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Consistent with previous results, neutrophil-specific STAT3 knockdown impaired tumor growth and enhanced cytotoxic T cell activity in the tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes of treated mice. These findings highlight STAT3 signaling as a deleterious pathway supporting the protumoral activity of neutrophils and suggest that neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition is a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy, providing novel insights into targeted therapeutic avenues.">

        <tr id="Background Primary Membranous Nephropathy (PMN) is characterized by dysregulated immune responses, with B cells playing critical roles in disease pathogenesis. However, the immunopathogenic mechanisms underlying B cell involvement in PMN remain elusive. Methods We employed single-cell RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples (PBMC) obtained from 6 patients with PMN and 3 healthy controls (NC) to explore the transformation of B cells and their interaction with immune cells. Results Compared with NC, the most significant alterations were in plasma cells and regulatory B (Breg) cells in PMN patients. Within plasma cells, Subcluster 0 was increased in PMN patients and exhibited enhanced autoimmunity. Breg subset B10 cells were elevated in PMN patients and displayed increased immune regulatory capacity, marked by enhanced cytokine and interleukin-10 production. B cell activating factor (BAFF) and galectin-9, which were secreted by CD14 monocyte, as potential regulators of plasma and Breg cells activity. Additionally, serum galectin-9 levels increased in PMN patients and showed a correlation with proteinuria and renal function in PMN. Conclusions We reveal novel insights into the heterogeneity and functional diversity of B cells in patients with PMN. And revealed distinct roles for subgroup 0 plasma cells and B10 Breg cells in the pathogenesis of PMN. Furthermore, targeting B cells, such as galectin-9, presents promising opportunities for modulating the immune response in patients with PMN.">

        <tr id="Aging significantly influences host immune responses to viral infections, including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV), which is associated with high mortality in elderly patients. Despite its high fatality rate and pandemic potential, effective therapies remain unavailable, and the age-dependent mechanisms underlying SFTSV pathogenesis are not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed a ferret model (an immunocompetent animal model that mimics human SFTSV infections) and performed multi-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing and histopathological analyses. Our results reveal that, upon SFTSV infection, aged ferrets experience extensive decrease of critical immune cells (particularly B and T cells) due to infection-induced cell death and excessive hemophagocytosis in hematopoietic organs, whereas young-adult ferrets rapidly clear the virus with minimal lymphocyte changes. Notably, aged ferrets display marked immune dysregulation, characterized by non-specific activation of T-bet ⁺ age-associated memory B cells (T-bet+ ABCs) and the proliferation of defective plasmablasts (MKI67 ⁺ PB1), which serve as major viral reservoirs and drive systemic viral dissemination. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that the MKI67 ⁺ PB1 subset dominates SFTSV⁺ cells in both aged ferrets and human fatal cases, exhibiting the highest per-cell viral UMI counts. Moreover, monocytes and macrophages in aged ferrets exhibit heightened inflammatory gene expression, contributing to the hyper-inflammatory state observed during infection. Collectively, these insights underscore the critical role of dysregulated memory B cell responses and hyper-inflammation in age-dependent SFTSV pathogenesis, highlighting potential targets for interventions in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Aims Sustained neuroinflammation following ischemic stroke impedes post‐injury tissue repairment and neurological functional recovery. Developing innovative therapeutic strategies that simultaneously suppress detrimental inflammatory cascades and facilitate neurorestorative processes is critical for improving long‐term rehabilitation outcomes. Methods We employed a microglia depletion‐repopulation paradigm by administering PLX5622 for 7 days post‐ischemia; followed by a 7‐day withdrawal period to allow microglia repopulation. Single‐cell transcriptomics, behavioral testing, cytokine arrays, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence were used to assess the effects of microglia repopulation and delineate the transition of reshaped immune microenvironment. Results PLX5622 administration reshaped the poststroke immune microenvironment, promoting neurofunctional recovery. Repopulated microglia adopted a homeostatic phenotype, increasing homeostatic states by ~14.36% and reducing pro‐inflammatory states by ~20.17%. This reshaped environment suppressed T cell exhaustion, limited neutrophil terminal differentiation, and promoted a phagocytic macrophage phenotype. Furthermore, we identified that these transitions in infiltrating immune cells may be driven by reduced chemokine production, enhanced blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and transcriptional reprogramming. Conclusion Transient microglial depletion and repopulation via PLX5622 during the acute phase post stroke facilitate the recovery of neurological function. This immunomodulatory strategy offers a promising and clinically translationally relevant approach to enhance functional recovery following ischemic brain injury.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) and glioblastoma (GBM) are aggressive brain tumors with limited treatment options. Macrophage phagocytosis is a complex, tightly regulated process governed by competing pro-phagocytic and anti-phagocytic signals. CD47-SIRPα signaling inhibits macrophage activity, while radiotherapy (RT) can enhance tumor immunogenicity. How RT and CD47 blockade together modulate macrophage “appetite” and activation states remains poorly understood, particularly in the context of glioma immune evasion and therapy resistance. Methods Human and mouse glioma cell lines were exposed to fractionated RT, anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, or both. Flow cytometry and ELISA quantified the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and expression of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In vitro, phagocytosis assays were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyze transcriptional changes in macrophage subsets that phagocytosed (“eaters”) or did not phagocytose (“non-eaters”) glioma cells. In vivo, efficacy of combination therapy was assessed using orthotopic xenograft and syngeneic mouse models of DMG and GBM. Results RT induced ICD in glioma cells, evidenced by dose-dependent increases in DAMPs such as phosphatidylserine, calreticulin, HSP70/90, and HMGB1. RT and anti-CD47 each promoted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, with a synergistic effect observed when combined. scRNA-seq of phagocytic macrophages revealed transcriptionally distinct subpopulations associated with each treatment, characterized by enrichment in inflammatory, metabolic, and antigen presentation pathways. In vivo, combination therapy significantly reduced tumor burden, extended survival, and polarized tumor-associated macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory (M1-like) phenotype. Distinct macrophage markers (CLEC7A, CD44, CD63) validated scRNA-seq findings in vivo. Conclusions This study highlights that macrophage fate is intimately linked to the molecular properties of what they phagocytose. Phagocytosis is not a singular, uniform process but a dynamic and context-dependent event that drives macrophage specialization and plasticity. By demonstrating that RT and anti-CD47 therapy shape distinct macrophage phenotypes through their effects on tumor immunogenicity, this study provides a framework for understanding how to harness and reprogram macrophage activity for therapeutic benefit. These findings underscore the potential of targeting macrophage plasticity as a strategy to enhance antitumor immunity and improve outcomes in malignant gliomas and other diseases.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite advancements in immunotherapies, the diversity of the tumor microenvironment remains a challenge for cancer treatment. To elucidate microenvironment‐specific differences in antitumor responses, we established patient‐derived ex vivo tumor‐lung slices. We analyzed immune activation profiles after treatment with anti‐CD3/CD28 and the checkpoint inhibitor Nivolumab. Lung slices from non‐tumor, tumor‐adjacent, tumor‐border, and tumor‐central tissue were generated and assessed for viability, cell composition, and immune competence via flow cytometry, soluble factor secretion, and bulk RNA‐sequencing. The tumor‐border contained the highest number of immune cells (8.3‐fold vs. non‐tumor), secreted tumor markers (S100 and CA15‐3), and exhibited high levels of inflammatory mediators (IFNγ, IL‐6, and IL‐2). Treatment with anti‐CD3/CD28 increased the frequency of CD137+/CD8+ T cells and induced cytokine responses dominated by IFNγ, IL‐2, and Granzyme B. While both non‐tumor and tumor‐border tissue responded to anti‐CD3/CD28, the intensities of immune responses were highly varied. Notably, treatment with Nivolumab induced an inflammatory response primarily in the tumor‐border evidenced by IFNγ, IL‐2, and Perforin secretion alongside increased expression of CD107a on CD8+ T cells, in a donor‐dependent manner. Taken together, these data demonstrate how tumor‐border tissue slices can be utilized to study T cell responses in the context of the patient‐specific tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a collagen-binding receptor tyrosine kinase, plays a key role in extracellular matrix remodeling, tumor progression, and immune evasion. However, DDR1’s comprehensive role across diverse cancers and its therapeutic potential in immune-resistant tumors remain poorly defined. We performed a pan-cancer analysis integrating bulk transcriptomic datasets, single-cell RNA sequencing, and pathway enrichment to evaluate DDR1 expression, genetic alterations, and its associations with immune cell infiltration and clinical outcomes. DDR1 was consistently overexpressed in 21 cancer types, correlating with poor prognosis and reduced immune cell infiltration. Mechanistically, DDR1 promoted collagen remodeling, immune exclusion, and upregulated immunosuppressive pathways. Single-cell analysis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) revealed DDR1-high ductal cells associated with reduced cytotoxic T cell infiltration and increased regulatory T cell populations. Therapeutic blockade of DDR1 in an immunocompetent KPC mouse model of PDAC disrupted collagen architecture, enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration, and improved responses to chemotherapy, highlighting a direct link between DDR1 inhibition and immune reactivation. These findings establish DDR1 as a key mediator of collagen-driven immune resistance and a promising therapeutic target for overcoming immune exclusion, especially in PDAC and other collagen-rich solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Introduction Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are critical mediators of intercellular communication and contribute to cancer progression and immune regulation. Methods We characterized EVs isolated from bone marrow (BM) plasma harvested from healthy donors and patients affected by Multiple Myeloma (MM) by Nano Tracking Analysis and by flow cytometry. Results EVs from MM patients were significantly more abundant and enriched in CD138, supporting their partial origin from malignant plasma cells, with additional input from BM resident cells, including monocytes and NK cells. Phenotypic profiling revealed increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules HLA-G, PD-1, and PD-L1 on MM-derived EVs compared to healthy controls. Functionally, MM-EVs suppressed Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced T cell activation, as evidenced by reduced IFN-γ production and CD4+ T cell proliferation. Such effects were partially reversed by HLA-G blockade. Moreover, MM-derived EVs modulated cytokine secretion profiles suppressing IL-2, IFN-α, TNF-α, and IL-6, and enhancing GM-CSF, with some changes attributed to HLA-G and PD-L1 activity. Transcriptomic analysis showed higher HLA-G expression in patients with gain of chromosome 1q, suggesting a link between high-risk cytogenetics and EV-driven immune suppression. While clinical correlations were not observed, likely due to limited sample size, these findings underscore the immunosuppressive role of MM-derived EVs. Discussion HLA-G+, PD-1+, and PD-L1+ EVs contribute to immune dysfunction in MM and represent promising targets to restore anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Sweet syndrome (also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare inflammatory skin disorder characterized by erythematous plaques with a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate. First-line therapy remains oral corticosteroids, which suppresses inflammation non-specifically. Although neutrophils are typically short-lived, how they persist in Sweet syndrome skin and contribute to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized population of antigen-presenting cell (APC)-like neutrophils expressing MHC class II genes that are uniquely present in Sweet syndrome skin but absent from healthy tissue and circulation. Keratinocytes extended neutrophil lifespan 10-fold in co-culture experiments and drove the emergence of an APC-like phenotype in approximately 30% of neutrophils, mirroring observations in patient lesions. Mechanistically, keratinocyte-derived serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) signals through the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) on neutrophils to promote their survival. These long-lived neutrophils actively orchestrate local immune responses by recruiting T cells and inducing cytokine production. Strikingly, dual blockade of SAA1-FPR2 signaling restores neutrophil turnover to baseline levels, with efficacy comparable to high-dose corticosteroids. These findings uncover a keratinocyte-neutrophil-T cell axis that sustains chronic inflammation in Sweet syndrome and highlight the SAA1/FPR2 pathway as a promising target for precision therapy.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a major global health challenge due to its high incidence and mortality rates, emphasizing the critical need for innovative therapeutic strategies. IL-1R2, a member of the IL-1 receptor family, plays a pivotal role in both tumorigenesis and antitumor immunity. However, its precise role in tumor development and its impact on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy in CRC remain poorly understood. We examined tumor progression in wild-type and IL-1R2-deficient mice using an AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated colorectal cancer model treated with combined ICIs therapy. Our findings revealed that IL-1R2 deficient mice exhibited a significant reduction in tumor burden, accompanied by alterations in the carcinogenic program and enhanced immunogenicity of tumor cells. Furthermore, the deletion of IL-1R2 resulted in an increased proportion of exhausted CD8+ T cells, a population commonly enriched for tumor antigen-specific T cells, suggesting an augmentation of tumor-specific immune responses. Moreover, IL-1R2 deletion upregulated genes linked to antigen presentation in dendritic cells, indicating enhanced activation of the adaptive immune system. Collectively, these findings position IL-1R2 as a promising therapeutic target for improving the efficacy of treatment strategies in CRC.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by dense stroma and myeloid-rich microenvironment that confer resistance to immunotherapies. Previous studies demonstrated that disrupting the immune-stroma CXCR4-CXCL12 axis facilitates T cell recruitment and mobility to collaborate with anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy. We sought to test the clinical viability of this immunotherapeutic strategy. 21 patients with metastatic PDAC were enrolled and treated in a phase 2 trial evaluating the effects of the plerixafor/AMD3100 and cemiplimab. Primary endpoint was objective response rate. Blood and tissue biospecimens were collected for correlative analyses. Parallel mouse studies were used to determine potential mechanisms of resistance. Treatments were well-tolerated, but only two patients demonstrated a best response of stable disease. Correlative analyses confirmed significant mobilization of immune cells into circulation as well as increased immune infiltration into the tumor. High-parameter imaging revealed higher levels of CD8+ T cells but also granulocytes and macrophages upon treatment. Spatial analysis showed that treatment resulted in closer proximity between macrophages and T cells but not between granulocytes and T cells. Mouse studies revealed that whereas total granulocyte depletion had no effect on immunotherapeutic efficacy, macrophage-targeting yielded significant benefit. Tumor growth measurements and immune profiling of immunotherapeutic combinations incorporating macrophage-targeting showed that despite the increased T cell infiltration, CXCR4 antagonism was in fact associated with enrichment of CD206hiIA/IElo macrophage subtypes and modestly dampened efficacy. Our findings validate the utility of CXCR4 antagonism as an effective immune-recruiting platform but also underscores the need for strategies that better leverage its effects.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, a first-line defender, has a multifaceted presence in chronic inflammation, autoimmune pathology, and tumor progression. The microenvironmental cues facilitate functional plasticity and phenotypic heterogeneity to neutrophils that enable both their protective and pathogenic roles. Autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) display the presence of dysregulated subsets of neutrophil, such as low-density granulocytes (LDGs) that promote proinflammation and contribute to tissue damage via NETosis and type I interferon-mediated signaling. In cancer, particularly tumors, they exhibit tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) which may polarize either towards anti-tumorigenic ‘N1’ or pro-tumorigenic ‘N2’ phenotypes based on available modulators such as TGF-β and leucine-driven epigenetic modifications. The development in neutrophil biology has introduced several novel therapeutic strategies that allow NET targeting, inhibition of chemokine receptors like CXCR2, and exploration of neutrophil-derived biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. Such findings encourage the importance of neutrophils as both effectors and therapeutic targets in inflammatory and neoplastic conditions.">

        <tr id="While human autopsy samples have provided insights into pulmonary immune mechanisms associated with severe viral respiratory diseases, the mechanisms that contribute to a clinically favorable resolution of viral respiratory infections remain unclear due to the lack of proper experimental systems. Using mice co-engrafted with a genetically matched human immune system and fetal lung xenograft (fLX), we mapped the immunological events defining successful resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues. Viral infection is rapidly cleared from fLX following a peak of viral replication, histopathological manifestations of lung disease and loss of AT2 program, as reported in human COVID-19 patients. Infection resolution is associated with the activation of a limited number of hematopoietic subsets, including inflammatory monocytes and CD3-expressing macrophage-like cells, which are highly enriched in viral RNA and dissipate upon infection resolution. Specific human fibroblast and endothelial subsets also elicit robust antiviral and monocyte chemotaxis signatures, respectively. Notably, systemic depletion of human CD4 + cells, but not CD3 + cells, significantly abrogates infection resolution in fLX and induces persistent infection, supporting the dominant role of peripheral CD4 + monocytes over T-cells in the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings unravel a comprehensive picture of the immunological events defining effective resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues, revealing markedly divergent immunological trajectories between resolving and fatal COVID-19 cases.">

        <tr id="Background: Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is ominous in lung cancer patients. However, comprehensive studies of both innate and adaptive immune responses within the pleural tumor microenvironment remain limited. Methods: We collected samples from patients with heart failure and lung cancer-MPE. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we analyzed alternations in cancer cells, NK cells, DCs, and T cells. Key cytokines involving in cell-cell interactions were quantified using Luminex or ELISA, while HLA-E and aging markers were assessed via immunohistochemistry. Results: Our findings revealed that CD56⁺CD16⁺ and CD56⁻CD16⁻ NK cells exhibited reduced cytotoxicity, mainly through HLA-E-expressing senescent cancer cells interacting with NK cells inhibitory receptor, leading to NK cell dysfunction and reduced XCL2 expression, which might impair cDC1 recruitment. Consequently, aDC2 cells evolved into exhausted phenotype, resulting in inadequate T cell activation. In CD8 T cells, transcription factors such as FOXO1 contributed to diminished cytotoxicity. Despite presence of GZMA CD4 T cells, their cytotoxicity was suppressed in MPE. Th1-like and Th2-like regulatory T cells further inhibited CD4 T cell responses. Key molecules, CXCL16, BAG6, and IL-7, bridging innate and adaptive immunity conferred poor prognosis. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that senescent cancer cells promote immunoevasion through HLA-E, suppressing NK cell cytotoxicity, impairing DC function, and disrupting T cell activation. Cell-cell interaction and imbalanced Th1/Th2 contribute to microenvironmental remodeling, driving disease progression. These findings provide insights into the immunological landscape and therapeutic targets for intervention.">

        <tr id="Background Halo nevi are clinically common and are characterized by a circle of leukoderma around the central melanocytic nevus. Studies have shown that the pathogenesis of halo nevi is similar to that of vitiligo and is associated with the role of CD8⁺ T lymphocytes in melanocyte destruction. Histopathological findings have revealed neutrophil infiltration in halo nevi; however, the specific immune mechanisms involving neutrophils have not been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, we investigated the role of neutrophils in halo nevi using histopathological and immunological analyses. Methods To this end, we examined the infiltration patterns of immune cells in halo nevi, with a particular focus on IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression in neutrophils and its potential immunoregulatory effects. Results The results demonstrated that IFN-γ expression in the lesional skin of halo nevi contributed to the induction of PD-L1 expression in neutrophils. PD-L1⁺ neutrophils promoted apoptosis and suppressed the function of CD8⁺ T lymphocytes. Notably, some halo nevi showed a tendency to spontaneous regression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, and this regulatory mechanism influences the local immune response and may facilitate the repigmentation of the surrounding leukoderma in halo nevi. Conclusions This study is the first to explore the involvement of neutrophils in halo nevi and reveal the potential immunoregulatory role of PD-L1 in this process. The elucidation of this mechanism not only provides a more comprehensive understanding of autoimmune skin diseases but may also offer new strategies for targeted therapy in other related disorders, such as vitiligo.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary PIAS1 is a protein that helps control how cells behave, including how they respond to signals that can lead to cancer. While it has been studied in cancer cells before, we wanted to know what it does in the cells around the tumor, the tumor microenvironment, where immune and other supporting cells live. We found that higher levels of PIAS1 in these surrounding cells were linked to better survival in patients with oral cancer. By studying individual cells from tumors, we saw that PIAS1 was often found in immune and support cells and seemed to help these cells fight cancer. When PIAS1 was missing, the cells showed signs of being more friendly to the tumor and less active in fighting it. Overall, PIAS1 appears to play an important role in helping the body’s own cells resist cancer and could be a useful target for future treatments.">

        <tr id="The immune ecosystem is central to maintaining effective defensive responses. However, it remains largely understudied how immune cells in the peripheral blood interact with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in metastasis. Here, blood analysis of patients with advanced breast cancer revealed that over 75% of CTC-positive blood specimens contained heterotypic CTC clusters with CD45+ white blood cells (WBCs), which correlates with breast cancer subtypes, racial groups, and decreased survival. CTC-WBC clusters included overrepresented T cells and underrepresented neutrophils. Specifically, a rare subset of CD4 and CD8 double-positive T (DPT) cells was 140-fold enriched in CTC clusters versus their frequency in WBCs. DPT cells shared properties with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but exhibited unique features of T cell exhaustion and immune suppression. Mechanistically, the integrin heterodimer α4β1, also named very late antigen 4 (VLA-4), in DPT cells and its ligand, VCAM1, in tumor cells are essential mediators of DPT-CTC clusters. Neoadjuvant administration of anti-VLA-4 neutralizing antibodies markedly blocked CTC–DPT clusters, inhibited metastasis, and extended mouse survival. These findings highlight a pivotal role of rare DPT cells in fostering cancer dissemination through CTC clustering. It lays a foundation for developing innovative biomarker-guided therapeutic strategies to prevent and target cancer metastasis.">

However, we still lack mechanistic understanding of the factors regulating immunity induced by this platform, especially innate pathways. We utilized a human tonsil organoid model to study the regulation of adaptive responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-ɑ was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-ɑ-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-ɑ and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells, including TFH. These data provide key insights into innate pathways regulating ChAdOx1-induced immunity and highlights the promise of this model for vaccine platform mechanistic studies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells actively reprogram their tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote drug resistance and tumor progression. Tumor cell survival critically depends on heterotypic communication with benign cells in the microenvironment, particularly bone marrow‐derived stromal cells (BMSCs). Our three‐dimensional (3D) approach allows us to investigate spatially defined, mutual direct cell–cell interactions between CLL B cells, autologous T cells, and BMSCs, forming complex scaffold‐like structures reminiscent of in vivo conditions. Here, we observe that CLL B cells localized in the core regions of 3D structures upregulate the AP‐1 transcription factor complex, which confers significant protection against therapy‐induced cell death. Additionally, regulatory T cells (Treg) and follicular T helper cells (TfH) are more abundant in the core regions. CLL B cells, in turn, induce contact‐mediated reprogramming of BMSCs, resulting in a novel, distinct BMSC population with inflammation, bone immune evasion, and cancer‐associated fibroblast‐like features. Our findings reveal critical mechanisms by which CLL cells exploit the TME to drive pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance using realistic 3D setups, highlighting the potential of targeting AP‐1 and the stromal compartment in future treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Abstract Inflammation from the hematopoietic compartment is a critical driver of fibrosis and cytopenias in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). We previously demonstrated that tasquinimod ameliorates the MPN phenotype, reducing splenomegaly and normalizing fibrosis in a JAK2V617F‐driven preclinical model. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we now show that tasquinimod primarily targets the malignant JAK2V617F hematopoietic clone, particularly affecting megakaryocytes and monocytes. Tasquinimod downregulates pro‐proliferative pathways, MYC targets, and mTORC signaling, while increasing apoptosis in particularly in JAK2V617F mutant cells. Our data reveal that tasquinimod reverses TGFβ‐driven fibrotic reprogramming of megakaryocytes and monocytes. This reversal is crucial for mitigating the pro‐fibrotic interactions and signaling in the BM, thereby decreasing the activation of stromal cells. Coculture experiments confirm that direct interaction between JAK2V617F hematopoietic cells and mesenchymal stromal cells upregulates S100A8 in stromal cells, independent of TGFβ alone. In line, genetic ablation of S100A9 in the hematopoietic but not stromal compartment significantly improves the MPN phenotype and normalizes BM fibrosis. Our data highlight the hematopoietic origin of the inflammatory signals driving fibrosis. These insights pave the way for potential therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory signaling pathways in MPN to mitigate fibrosis and improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="CD45 plays a central role in immune signal regulation by controlling the spatial dynamics of phosphatase activity through steric segregation of its bulky rigid extracellular domain. To modulate CD45 activity, here we develop and characterize protein engineering approaches to induce multivalent clustering of CD45, effectively mimicking the endogenous local receptor sequestration during immune synapse formation. In doing so, we engineer a biologic that enables precise, tunable control over CD45 surface localization and activity. CD45 sequestration exhibited striking synergy when administered in combination with intratumorally anchored IL-12 therapy, markedly delaying tumor progression and extending survival in syngeneic murine melanoma and carcinoma models. Immune profiling revealed that CD8+ T cells are essential mediators of this synergistic antitumor response. Mechanistically, IL-12 initiates a wave of antigen generation and T cell priming, while CD45 sequestration subsequently enhances tumor-specific CD8+ T cell activation, expansion, and functional states within the tumor-draining lymph node. These findings suggest that CD45 sequestration lowers the activation threshold of T cells, broadens the tumor-reactive T cell repertoire, and therefore promotes more robust tumor-specific T cell responses. Altogether, we establish CD45 as a promising novel target for cancer immunotherapy, capable of potentiating strong anticancer immune responses.">

NK cells are correlated with increased tumor control and better overall patient survival across various types of cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite their promising potential for anti-tumor killing, NK cell function is often diminished within the tumor microenvironment. There are many factors that lead to decreased tumor-infiltrating NK cell killing, including immunoinhibitory factors from tumor cells and resident tissues, acquired immune tolerance, NK cell exhaustion, and the hypoxic state of the tumor microenvironment. Unleashing NK cell activity therefore has high potential to create a new class of immunotherapy that could combat both primary and acquired resistance to current checkpoint inhibitors. In this review we discuss mechanistic details of NK cell tumor killing, NK cell immunosuppression, and gaps in knowledge regarding highly complex microenvironment-specific effects on NK cell function. We also discuss the promise and limitations of emerging NK-cell based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Since their discovery, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have emerged as key players in immune regulation, tissue homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis. Early research focused on defining ILC subsets, including ILC1s, ILC2s, ILC3s, and lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, by distinguishing their development, transcriptional profiles, and effector functions relative to T cells. Subsequent studies characterized the tissue-resident nature of ILCs and mapped their context-dependent phenotypes across diverse organs. In parallel, increasing evidence linked ILC subset imbalances to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and various cancers. Recent work has leveraged circulating ILC frequencies and phenotypes as potential biomarkers for disease severity and progression. Notably, the immunomodulatory, tissue-reparative, and cytotoxic functions of helper ILCs have attracted interest as novel therapeutic avenues. Current strategies to harness ILCs for therapy include ex vivo expansion of autologous or allogeneic ILCs, derivation of ILC-like cells from umbilical cord blood or pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), and engineering of ILCs with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to enhance antigen specificity. Additionally, cytokine modulation and immune checkpoint blockade are being explored to sustain or redirect ILC function in disease contexts. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the functional diversity, plasticity, and tissue residency of ILC subsets, emphasizing their interactions with other immune and stromal cells, and their roles as predictive, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases and cancers. Key translational challenges, including subset heterogeneity, plasticity, tissue-restricted residency, and limited scalability, remain barriers to clinical application. However, emerging multi-omic technologies, single-cell atlases, and synthetic biology approaches are accelerating efforts to map ILC states with unprecedented resolution and guide rational therapeutic design. Looking forward, integration of ILC-based therapies with regenerative medicine, cellular engineering, and immuno-oncology platforms holds promise for developing next-generation precision immunotherapies. By bridging fundamental biology with translational innovation, this field is poised to expand the therapeutic landscape for both autoimmune and malignant diseases.">

However, versican’s contribution to lung inflammation, injury, and immune cell activity during influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a critical knowledge gap. To address our central hypothesis that mesenchymal-derived versican is pro-inflammatory and enhances the innate immune response to IAV infection, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse deficient in mesenchymal-derived versican (B6. Col1a2-CreERT+/−/Vcantm1.1Cwf, Col1a2/Vcan−/−). We report that mesenchymal-derived versican plays a critical role in neutrophil, monocyte, and dendritic cell migration into the lungs and airways early in IAV infection. Intriguingly, mesenchymal-derived versican deficiency had the most substantial negative impact on neutrophil emigration into the lungs. We found that neutrophils were less adhesive to the ECM of Col1a2/Vcan−/− mouse lung fibroblasts (mLFs), which had a significant decrease in versican compared to wild-type mLFs. Additionally, Col1a2/Vcan−/− mLFs treated with poly(I:C) in vitro have reduced cell-associated hyaluronan. These findings suggest that fibroblast-derived versican is necessary for adhesion to lung fibroblasts by neutrophils as they transit into the lung interstitium and airways from the pulmonary vasculature. Our findings demonstrate that mesenchymal-derived versican is a key regulator of the early host immune responses to IAV.">

        <tr id="Background Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a global health crisis complicated by immune dysregulation and T cell exhaustion. CD39, an ectonucleotidase generating immunosuppressive adenosine, is implicated in cancer and chronic infections, yet its spatiotemporal role in TB pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods Multiple publicly available datasets were utilized to evaluate CD39 across TB disease stages, diverse infectious diseases and anti-TB treatment. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated via ROC curves and combined signature analysis. Immune cell infiltration were analyzed using CIBERSORTx. Cytokine profiles and age-stratified associations were examined. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by GSEA. Single-cell analysis of non-human primate granulomas assessed CD39’s temporal dynamics, utilizing Monocle 3 for CD39+ T-cell trajectory analysis. Results CD39 was upregulated in active TB patients versus TB infection (TBI) and healthy controls (HC), correlating with older age, disease severity, and distinct expression patterns compared to other respiratory and systemic infections. CD39 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy over IFN-γ in distinguishing TB from TBI/HC and other respiratory diseases. Combining CD39 with TBX21 or GZMB further improved diagnostic specificity. High CD39 expression correlated with suppressed Th1 and elevated Th2/Th17/regulatory cytokines, alongside pronounced neutrophil infiltration. Age-stratified analysis revealed complex age-dependent associations of CD39 expression with various immune cell types. Single-cell analysis revealed declining CD39 transcriptional activity during prolonged infection despite expanded cellular distribution, linked to early T cell maturation followed by broader immunomodulatory shifts. Decreased CD39 expression with anti-TB treatment correlated with improved immune cell balance and resolved T cell exhaustion. Conclusion CD39 is a critical regulator of immune exhaustion and neutrophil-driven inflammation in TB, with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Targeting CD39 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for TB.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an agnogenic chronic intestinal inflammatory disease. Umbilical cord‐derived mesenchymal stem cell (UMSC) is a potential therapeutic approach against UC; however, the mechanisms underlying their efficacy for UC remain unclear. Methods We performed a single‐arm clinical trial with 6 months follow‐up to assess the efficacy of UMSC in patients with moderate to severe left‐sided UC. The 26 enrolled patients were administered two UMSC doses intravenously. Pre‐ and post‐therapy colon biopsy specimens were analysed by single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq). Dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)‐induced colitis mouse models with or without UMSC injection were used to delineate colon inflammation and T cell function. Results In the clinical trial, the clinical response/remission rates were 80.8/46.2% and 75.0/37.5% after 2 and 6 months of therapy, respectively. Endoscopic and histological examinations showed improvement of colonic mucosa after UMSC therapy in responders. scRNA‐seq data showed that UMSC therapy may suppress pro‐inflammatory features of T lymphocytes and alleviate inflammatory responses by inhibiting the interaction of T cells with B and myeloid cells. In the murine experiment, UMSCs suppressed DUOX2‐mediated oxidative stress to attenuate DSS‐induced colitis by regulating T cell‐mediated immunity. Conclusion UMSC therapy primarily modulates T cell‐mediated immunity to achieve gut mucosal immune reconstitution and maintain mucosal barrier integrity, thereby achieving effective UC recovery. Highlights UMSCs effectively induce clinical remission in patients with active UC via T cell‐mediated immune reconstitution. scRNA‐seq analyses further revealed that UMSC therapy suppressed pro‐inflammatory features of T cells and alleviated inflammatory responses by inhibiting the interaction of T cells with B and myeloid cells UMSCs suppressed DUOX2‐mediated oxidative stress to attenuate DSS‐induced colitis by regulating T cell‐mediated immunity.">

        <tr id="While lymphoid progenitors have demonstrated unexpected plasticity in vivo, their differentiation into myeloid cells under in vitro conditions has been largely dismissed as an artifact or biologically irrelevant. Consequently, the functional properties of these cells remain poorly characterized. In this study, we show that cultured common lymphoid progenitors (cCLPs) differentiate into CD11b⁺CD115⁺ monocytic cells (cCLP-Ms) via IL-6-C/EBPβ signaling. Molecular and phenotypic analyses revealed that cCLP-Ms acquire essential features of myeloid cells, including innate immune sensor expression and phagocytic capacity, while retaining unique characteristics distinct from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), such as reduced MHC class II expression and TNF-α production. Functionally, cCLP-Ms exhibit immunoregulatory properties, effectively suppressing IgE-mediated cutaneous allergic inflammation upon adoptive transfer. These findings highlight the plasticity of lymphoid progenitors and establish a robust platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying myeloid differentiation. This system deepens our understanding of hematopoietic cell lineage flexibility and offers a foundation for exploring therapeutic applications in immune regulation and inflammation.">

        <tr id="Cancer therapies that induce immunogenic cell death such as necroptosis can arm the immune system to clear residual tumor cells. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) signaling can trigger necroptosis, orchestrating immune responses to solid tumors. Whether RIPK3 activity can be exploited for controlling B cell malignancies remains unclear. Here, we establish a strategy to manipulate RIPK3 activity in malignant B cells and promote immune-mediated tumor control. By controlling and visualizing RIPK3 signaling using intravital imaging, we established that RIPK3 activation promoted apoptosis and rapid macrophage engulfment but failed to induce necroptosis due to limited MLKL expression in B-lineage cells. RIPK3-induced cell death could be diverted toward necroptosis with type I IFN and caspase inhibition. Exploiting these findings, we showed that a combination therapy activating RIPK3 with SMAC mimetics while suppressing caspase activity and providing type I IFN resulted in immune-mediated control of B cell tumors. Hence, reprogramming RIPK3 activity represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity to target B cell malignancies.">

        <tr id="Although checkpoint immunotherapy has primarily focused on CD8⁺ T cells, emerging evidence highlights an important role for cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in mediating therapeutic responses. However, research on the functional properties of cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells in the context of immunotherapy is still at an early stage and remains insufficiently defined. Utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets obtained from metastatic melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, we performed transcriptomic profiling of conventional CD4⁺ T cells, excluding proliferative and regulatory (FOXP3⁺) subsets, and compared responders and non-responders as distinct groups. Importantly, our analysis identified distinct clusters that discriminate between responders and non-responders, with cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells occupying a central position within these clusters. In responder-specific clusters, cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells exhibited features of early activation, whereas clusters specific to non-responders were characterized by an exhausted phenotype. Notably, non-responder-specific clusters were positioned proximally to Treg-like clusters, suggesting a potential transition from cytotoxic to regulatory CD4⁺ T cell states in non-responders. Our findings reinforce the emerging concept that cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells play a central role in mediating immunotherapy responses. These results provide a foundation for the development of predictive biomarkers and novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating CD4⁺ T cell differentiation.

        <tr id="BRD4 is an epigenetic reader protein that regulates oncogenes such as myc in cancer. However, its additional role in shaping immune responses via regulation of inflammatory and myeloid cell responses is not yet fully understood. This work further characterized the multifaceted role of BRD4 in anti-tumor immunity. NanoString gene expression analysis of EMT6 tumors treated with a BRD4 inhibitor identified a reduction in myeloid gene expression signatures. Additionally, BRD4 inhibition significantly reduced myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the spleens and tumors of mice in multiple tumor models and also decreased the release of tumor-derived MDSC growth and chemotactic factors. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRD4 in MDSC induced apoptosis and modulated expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins. A BRD4-myeloid specific knockout model suggested that the dominant mechanism of MDSC reduction after BRD4 inhibition was primarily through a direct effect on MDSC. BRD4 inhibition enhanced anti-PD-L1 therapy in the EMT6, 4T1, and LLC tumor models, and the efficacy of the combination treatment was dependent on CD8+ T cells and on BRD4 expression in the myeloid compartment. These results identify BRD4 as a regulator of MDSC survival and provide evidence to further investigate BRD4 inhibitors in combination with immune based therapies.">

        <tr id="Background The immune-balancing role of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1) is well-recognized in contexts of immune dysregulation. Within the anti-tumor context, Tα1 demonstrated to act as an immune-enhancer, with potential roles in immunotherapy-based treatments. However, Tα1 immunomodulatory potential on tumor cells is poorly understood. Additionally, Tα1 pleiotropic effects on immune cells require in-depth investigations to unravel its specific impact on different immune cell populations. Thus, we first aimed to investigate whether Tα1 treatments influenced the transcriptional immune profile of various cancer cell lines. Alongside, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, B, and natural killer cells from healthy donors (HDs) were treated individually with Tα1, to assess its direct effects on each immune cell population. Methods Cutaneous melanoma, glioblastoma, and pleural mesothelioma cell lines and HD immune cell subsets were treated with Tα1 for 48 hours. Total RNA was subsequently isolated, and gene expression profiles were analyzed by the nCounter® SPRINT Profiler. Genes with a log2ratio ≥0.58 and ≤−0.58 in Tα1-treated vs untreated cells were defined as differentially expressed (DEGs) and subsequently evaluated for the enrichment of Gene Ontology terms to identify biological processes potentially affected by Tα1 in tumor and immune cells. Results Tα1 minimally changed cancer cell DEGs and immune-related biological processes, suggesting a comprehensive lack of transcriptional immunomodulatory potential on the tumor counterpart. Conversely, Tα1 exhibited to directly affect the proliferation and/or transcription processes of each studied immune cell subset, with the greatest transcriptional impact observed for activated CD8+ T cells, crucial players in anti-tumor immunity. Conclusion Our findings question the tumor immunomodulatory properties of Tα1, simultaneously underscoring the importance of further investigating Tα1 influence on specific immune cell subsets in the periphery or within the tumor microenvironment of cancer patients. This would contribute to understand Tα1 potential in immunotherapy-based combination strategies, within the anti-tumor setting.">

        <tr id="Lupus nephritis (LN), a serious complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), involves complex immune dysregulation that leads to chronic renal inflammation and progressive tissue damage. Despite decades of use of standard immunosuppressive therapy, treatment responses remain variable, and many patients experience relapses or develop end-stage renal disease. This review synthesizes emerging insights into the immunopathogenesis of LN, drawing on studies from single-cell transcriptomics, signaling pathway analyses and renal tissue immunology. It examines the role of both innate and adaptive immune cells in mediating disease. The therapeutic landscape is rapidly evolving with novel biologics targeting B cell survival and cytokine signaling, small-molecule inhibitors modulating intracellular pathways, and promising developments in cell-based interventions. Notably, recent clinical case series have demonstrated that CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy can induce durable drug-free remission in LN, representing a transformative approach to immune modulation. These advances are further supported by the application of multi-omics platforms to refine biomarker-driven disease monitoring and personalized treatment. Integrating immunologic and technological innovations holds the potential to redefine therapeutic strategies in LN. Precision medicine approaches that leverage targeted therapies, immune resetting modalities, and biomarker-guided clinical decisions may significantly improve long-term renal outcomes and patient quality of life.">

Among the immune components of the TME, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells are key players, whose interactions, particularly their crosstalk, critically shape anti-tumour immunity. The macrophage–NK cell interplay can either promote or suppress immune responses depending on the context, representing both a challenge and a therapeutic opportunity. NK cells are key effectors capable of recognising and eliminating malignant cells without prior sensitisation, whereas macrophages exhibit remarkable plasticity, functioning as either promoters or suppressors of tumour immunity depending on their activation state. This review focuses on current strategies to harness macrophages in cancer therapy, including phenotype repolarisation, selective depletion, and disruption or enhancement of the macrophage-NK cell crosstalk to enhance NK cell-mediated tumour surveillance.

        <tr id="The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the worst pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Studies have shown that severe COVID-19 patients have immune dysfunction. To characterize the dysregulated immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq and scV(D)J-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from mild, moderate, and severe patients. We observed that as the severity of the disease increased, several CD8 + T cell subsets and Treg cells continued to decrease, while CD4 + T subsets, natural killer cells and plasma cells continued to increase. Several aberrantly expressed biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 severity were identified. For example, RPS26 was down-regulated, while the ZFP36, IL-32, and IgM genes were up-regulated with increasing disease severity. Functional analysis showed multiple immune-related pathways, such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-10 production pathways, were dysregulated. As the disease severity increased, intercellular interactions fluctuated. Particularly, naive CD8 + T cells regulated memory and activated CD8 + T cells, and the weakening in Treg cells’ regulation of other immune cells was especially obvious. The expression of the MIF signaling pathway, mediated by CD74 + CXCR4, was higher throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection and the intensity of immune cell-cell interactions mediated by TGF-β was enhanced from mild to severe. Subsequently, scV(D)J-seq analysis showed a decreasing trend in the number of clonotypes, repertoire diversity and clonotypes overlap of monoclonal B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) as the SARS-CoV-2 progresses. The CDR3 sequence length in COVID-19-specific clonotypes showed a bias towards being longer as the severity of COVID-19 increases. Our findings may provide new clues for understanding COVID-19 immunopathogenesis and help identify optimal biomarkers for new therapeutic strategies.

        <tr id="The human Poly ADP-ribose Polymerase (PARP) family comprises 17 enzymes responsible for the transfer of ADP-ribose to proteins, forming poly- or mono-ADP-ribosylation. This post-translational modification regulates DNA repair and programmed cell death, processes affecting cancer biology. PARP inhibitors, including the FDA-approved olaparib, are used to treat BRCA-dependent breast and ovarian cancers. Although therapies with use of PARP inhibitors are showing clinical success, their effects on the immune system remain understudied. Prior work has shown that PARP inhibition can modulate inflammatory responses and alter innate immunity. In this study, we evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of olaparib on myeloid cells in vivo, focusing on bone marrow and spleen. Olaparib treatment altered the composition and activation state of dendritic cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. In the bone marrow, olaparib increased the proportion of cDC2 population, mature neutrophils and inflammatory macrophages expressing CD80. In contrast, splenic myeloid cells exhibited enhanced expression of markers associated with tolerogenic phenotypes, including CD206 and CD124 in neutrophils and macrophages. The spleen also showed an increase in immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (CD206+) and a bias toward the cDC2 subset. These findings indicate that PARP inhibition can induce short-term phenotypic remodeling of myeloid cell populations, promoting a more immunoregulatory profile, especially in the spleen. These changes may contribute to an altered immune landscape with implications for anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that predominantly affects young adults. However, current disease-modifying therapies demonstrate limited efficacy in addressing progressive disease subtypes, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we systematically review the neuroimmune interactions underlying the pathogenesis of MS, with a focus on three key aspects: the immune niche, immune cell types, and cell-based therapies. We first discuss the evolution of brain-immune concepts, from early notions of immune privilege to modern understandings of brain-border immune niches (meninges, choroid plexus, and perivascular spaces). These compartments serve as critical interfaces where peripheral immune cells interact with CNS-resident immune cells. We then analyze the roles of specific immune cell subsets (e.g., T/B cells, myeloid cells and microglia) in disease progression, highlighting their functional heterogeneity across different MS subtypes. Furthermore, we highlight emerging MS immunotherapies-including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T regimens, mesenchymal stem cell interventions, microbiome modulation, and nanodelivery systems, which strategically target mechanistic nodes spanning neuroimmune niche regulation, inflammatory cascade blockade, and CNS neurorestorative capacities.">

        <tr id="The lack of a favorable tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) results in limited response rates to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) across human solid tumors, necessitating the development of novel combination strategies. In this study, we repurposed FK228, an US FDA-approved histone deacetylase inhibitor that is used clinically in non-solid tumor treatment, as a novel ICB sensitizer in solid tumors and revealed the diverse regulatory functions of FK228 in the TIME. FK228 serves as a novel necroptosis inducer in cancer cells by triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress. This in turn enhances the immunogenicity of cancer cells and increases the infiltration of tumor-killing immunocytes, including CD8+ T and natural killer cells, particularly activating tumor-infiltrated CD8+ T cells. Meanwhile, FK228 treatment shifts macrophages toward the pro-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, the combined use of FK228 and a PD-L1 inhibitor significantly delay tumor growth and extend the survival of tumor bearing mice. Overall, our findings reveal new possibilities for the clinical application of FK228 in solid tumors and underscore the critical role of histone deacetylases in maintaining the immune-unfavorable TIME.">

        <tr id="C-C motif chemokine receptor-like 2 (CCRL2) is an atypical chemokine receptor (ACKR) that binds chemerin with high affinity but lacks classical G protein-coupled signaling. Instead, it functions as a non-signaling presenter of chemerin to CMKLR1-expressing cells, modulating antitumor immunity. CCRL2 is highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment and various human cancers, and its expression has been linked to delayed tumor growth in mouse models, primarily through the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis. While CCRL2’s role in immune surveillance is well established, its tumor cell-intrinsic functions remain less clear. Here, we investigated the impact of CCRL2 overexpression and knockout on tumor cell behavior in vitro. Although CCRL2 did not affect proliferation, migration, or clonogenicity in B16F0 melanoma and LLC cells, it significantly influenced spheroid morphology in B16F0 cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CCRL2 modulates innate immune signaling pathways, including TLR4 and IFN-γ/STAT1, with context-dependent downstream effects. These findings suggest that CCRL2 shapes tumor architecture by rewiring inflammatory signaling networks in a cell-intrinsic manner. Further studies in other cancer types and cell models are needed to determine whether CCRL2’s regulatory role is broadly conserved and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target in solid tumors.">

        <tr id="Immunosenescence, the age-related decline in immune function, profoundly impacts cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes by fostering a tumor-promoting microenvironment and impairing immune surveillance. This review delineates eleven molecular hallmarks of immunosenescence, including genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation, which collectively drive immune cell dysfunction and systemic immunosuppression. Aging reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) through recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP), and metabolic reprogramming, contributing to therapy resistance and poor prognosis in elderly patients. While immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) cells show promise, their efficacy in aging populations is limited by T cell exhaustion, myeloid bias, and altered intercellular communication. Emerging strategies—including senolytics, epigenetic modulators (e.g., histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor), and metabolic interventions (e.g., spermidine, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN))—highlight potential avenues to rejuvenate aged immunity. Single-cell multi-omics (single cell RNA-seq, single cell ATAC-seq) further unravel immune cell heterogeneity, revealing tissue-specific chromatin accessibility dynamics and novel targets like interleukin-34 (IL-34) for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. However, challenges persist in translating preclinical findings to clinical practice, necessitating age-tailored trials and biomarker-driven approaches. By integrating mechanistic insights with translational innovations, this review underscores the urgency of addressing immunosenescence to optimize cancer immunotherapy for aging populations, ultimately bridging the gap between aging biology and precision oncology.">

Here, we show that activation of GSDMD in human tumor specimens mainly occurs in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. Significantly, GSDMD deficiency or its inactivation in CD4+ T cells disabled CD8+ T cell–mediated antitumor immunity and caused tumor outgrowth in mice. Further study uncovered that, via inducing IL-2 production, GSDMD was required for CD4+ T cells to provide help to CD8+ T cell function. Mechanistically, GSDMD was cleaved by TCR stimulation–activated caspase-8 to form GSDMD-N pores, which enhanced Ca2+ influx for IL-2 induction. Moreover, GSDMD activation and function were conserved in human CD4+ T cells and associated with favorable prognosis and improved response to anti–PD-1 immunotherapy in colonic and pancreatic cancer. We believe this study identifies a new nonpyroptotic role of GSDMD in tumor immunity, proposing GSDMD as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cardiac myxoma (CM), a rare primary cardiac tumor, poses significant life-threatening risks. Current CM research has remained largely limited to clinical case observations and pathological analyses, thus restricting its clinical therapeutic impact. Fundamental research should be urgently strengthened to better support future CM treatment strategies. In this work, single-cell sequencing is used to elucidated the intricate cellular composition of the CM microenvironments. The mechanisms of heart myxoma cell growth are investigated via proteomics and organoid models, while our western blot analysis reveals cardiac myxoma’s immune evasion strategies. This study successfully characterizes diverse cell types within the CM microenvironment. Notably, ap-CAF cells are found to effectively recruit immune cells via chemokine secretion, fostering immune microenvironment formation. The work’s pseudotime trajectory analysis also demonstrates that CM tumor cells derive from mesenchymal stem cells. Additionally, this work demonstrated that the glycolysis pathway is significantly activated and fuels CM cell growth. Tumor cells exploit the SIRPα-CD47 immune checkpoint to evade the immune system by inhibiting antigen-presenting cell phagocytosis. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) concurrently assume M2 polarization and suppress autoimmune activity through IL-10. This research comprehensively examines CM’s microenvironmental cellular architecture, metabolic features, and immune escape mechanisms. These work’s findings not only deepen the current understanding of CM’s biological nature but also offer vital theoretical foundations for developing safer, more effective CM therapies.">

Several studies in mice and humans have demonstrated a key role for DCs in promoting T cell responses to cancer and augmenting the efficacy of T cell‐based immunotherapies.

These functions contribute to cancer immunity and have been previously linked to the induction of anti‐tumour CD8+ T cells and enhanced responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by sustained synovial inflammation and the gradual destruction of joint structures. Although conventional T cells have historically been viewed as central to RA pathogenesis, increasing attention has recently focused on unconventional T cell subsets, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and gamma delta T (γδ T) cells. Functioning as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, these cells contribute to RA immunopathogenesis by producing cytokines, exerting cytotoxic effects, and interacting with various immune and stromal cells. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the immunological characteristics and pathogenic roles of unconventional T cell subsets in RA. NKT, MAIT, and γδ T cells contribute to the amplification of inflammatory responses and joint tissue destruction through diverse mechanisms, exhibiting unique tissue tropism and functional plasticity. Recently, novel therapeutic strategies have been developed to target these subsets, including modulation of antigen presentation pathways, inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling cascades, and reprogramming of cellular functionalities. Advancements in single-cell omics and spatial immune profiling have facilitated the precise identification and characterization of pathogenic unconventional T cell subsets in the RA synovium, thereby paving the way for personalized immunotherapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), traditionally characterized in innate immune cells, are emerging as critical modulators of T cell function. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), STING, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and natural killer receptors (NKRs) are expressed by CD8+ T cells, where they influence various cellular responses. Primarily serving as noncanonical costimulatory signals, TLRs can modulate T cell activation, differentiation, metabolic fitness, and memory formation. RLRs and STING can promote T cell expansion and cytokine production. Both activating and inhibitory NKRs can also alter T cell cytotoxicity and differentiation. As demonstrated in recent advancements, the capacity of these signaling cascades to enhance T cell responses offers promising therapeutic opportunities in cancer. Clinical strategies are being developed to selectively harness each of these pathways, such as TLR and STING agonists to bolster antitumor responses, and NKR-based approaches to amplify cytotoxic function. Additionally, adoptive T cell therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, are incorporating these innate signaling components to overcome tumor-mediated immunosuppression, enhance functional longevity, and improve therapeutic efficacy. This review discusses the progress made to characterize the role of T cell intrinsic PRR activity in shaping T cell functions and highlights recent advancements in that leverage innate receptor signaling to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.">

The extent and pattern of GM-CSF expression in immune cells have not been fully elucidated. Our goal was to advance this topic using novel GM-CSF reporter/fate reporter transgenic mice. Methods We tracked ongoing and past GM-CSF expression in various immune cells from multiple organs, in steady-state and autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS). Results The GM-CSF expression patterns varied by cell type and organ, with CD4+, CD8+, and CD11b+ cells being the main producers. GM-CSF expression was transient and seemingly permanently lost in most cells over time. In a mouse model of CNS autoimmunity, effector memory CD4+ T cells were the dominant GM-CSF source in the CNS. A large proportion of CD4+ T cells that expressed GM-CSF also expressed CXCR6, but this chemokine receptor did not play a main role in the CNS autoimmunity. Transcriptomic analysis showed notably distinct gene expression profiles between effector memory CD4+ T cells that did and did not express GM-CSF. Discussion These findings identified distinct GM-CSF cellular sources across organs, highlighting the transient nature of GM-CSF expression and the correlation between its expression and the overall phenotype of effector memory CD4+ T cells.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major global health challenge and current therapies are not always effective. In addition, certain immune cell populations, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), pose a significant barrier to immune-based treatments. Some phytochemicals, particularly compounds derived from Allium spp. like Propyl-Propane Thiosulfonate (PTSO), have shown strong immunomodulatory potential in digestive disorders. This study aims to investigate the capacity of PTSO to modulate immune responses and affect tumor progression in CRC models, in vitro and in vivo, with a focus on the immune cell populations that comprise the tumor microenvironment. Methods: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were incubated with PTSO (25 μM for 48 h) and characterized by flow cytometry. These cells (1 × 106) were then injected into NOD scid gamma (NSG) immunodeficient mice, which were simultaneously induced to develop a subcutaneous tumor by injection of HCT116 enriched cancer stem cells (CSCs) colonospheres (60,000 cells/mouse). Results: PTSO reduced MDSC populations, specifically, it significantly reduced monocytic (M-MDSCs, Control: 7.27 ± 0.53% vs. PTSO: 4.70 ± 2.39%; p = 0.0458) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-MDSCs, Control: 5.28 ± 0.99% vs. PTSO: 3.41 ± 1.58%; p = 0.0385) MDSCs. In parallel, PTSO increased T cell subpopulations, particularly interferon gamma (IFNG)-producing cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (Control: 9.52 ± 2.06% vs. PTSO: 15.04 ± 5.01%; p = 0.0685). In the humanized tumor xenograft mouse, the administration of PTSO-pretreated hPBMCs led to a significant reduction in tumor size (Control: 1.43 ± 0.82 cm3 vs. PTSO: 0.44 ± 0.35 cm3; p = 0.0068), accompanied by increased infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes and Natural Killer (NK) cells and downregulation of immunosuppressive genes. These effects resulted in a reduction in cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. Conclusions: The dual effect of PTSO on immune cell populations, reducing immunosuppressive myeloid cells and enhancing effector T lymphocyte and NK cell responses, resulted in an anti-tumor effect, highlighting this bioactive compound as a promising adjuvant in CRC immunotherapy and opening avenues for future research combining immunotherapy with PTSO in alternative models to optimize dosing and enhance translational potential.">

        <tr id="Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies, characterized by a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and resistance to immunotherapy. Obesity, a modifiable risk factor that increases PDAC incidence, exacerbates this immune evasion through metabolic inflammation and adipokine-driven signaling. Recent studies have implicated CXC chemokines, particularly CXCL5, as central mediators in shaping the immune landscape of PDAC. In a pivotal study, Walsh et al delineated a novel mechanism wherein adipocyte-derived cytokines (interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor) induce tumor-derived CXCL5 expression, thereby promoting myeloid-driven immunosuppression in obese PDAC models. Their findings demonstrated that CXCL5 ablation enhances CD8+ T-cell infiltration yet paradoxically increases monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell accumulation and arginase-1 expression, underscoring the complexity of chemokine signaling. Notably, only combinatorial targeting of CXCL5 and programmed cell death protein-1 yields therapeutic benefit, emphasizing the necessity of multiaxis interventions. This commentary synthesizes the mechanistic insights and translational implications of these findings, highlighting CXCL5 as a pivotal node linking metabolic dysfunction to immune resistance and a promising target for combinatorial immunotherapy in PDAC.">

        <tr id="Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections globally, particularly affecting infants, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals. While recent advances in prophylaxis, such as long-acting monoclonal antibodies and maternal immunization, offer promise for prevention, therapeutic options for active infection remain limited. Severe RSV disease is often driven not solely by viral replication but by dysregulated host immune responses, including excessive cytokine production, T helper type 2 (Th2) and T helper type 17 (Th17) cell polarization, and impaired interferon signaling. RSV has evolved sophisticated immune evasion strategies, such as inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, degradation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) via nonstructural proteins 1 and 2 (NS1/NS2), and interference with pattern recognition receptor signaling, particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. These mechanisms result in attenuated innate immune responses and defective adaptive immunity, contributing to viral persistence, immunopathology, and recurrent infections. Moreover, age-dependent vulnerabilities, such as immune immaturity in infants and immunosenescence in older adults, exacerbate disease severity. Excessive immune activation leads to bronchiolitis, airway remodeling, and long-term sequelae including wheezing and asthma. Emerging immunomodulatory therapies aim to restore immune balance, targeting cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-1 beta [IL-1β]), the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, or inflammasome activity. Host-directed therapies and direct-acting antivirals are also under investigation. A better understanding of RSV–host immune interactions is critical for optimizing therapeutic strategies and designing effective vaccines. This review synthesizes current knowledge on RSV immunopathogenesis and highlights immunomodulation as a promising frontier for therapeutic intervention.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity represents a recent concept that elucidates the long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells, enabling them to adapt and respond more effectively to subsequent encounters with diverse pathogens. Initially recognized through the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine, Candida albicans infection, and β-glucan administration, this phenomenon challenges the traditional view that immune memory is exclusive to the adaptive immune system. Trained immunity is characterized by epigenetic and metabolic modifications in innate immune cells that facilitate enhanced responses to infections through mechanisms like chromatin remodeling and altered gene expression. This review focuses on the implications of trained immunity within the lung environment, which is constantly exposed to a plethora of pathogens and environmental irritants. We discuss the roles of various immune cell types, including alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, in mediating trained immunity and how these adaptations may influence pulmonary insults and disease. Furthermore, we highlight the potential for leveraging trained immunity to enhance vaccine efficacy and develop novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related lung conditions. As research progresses, understanding trained immunity in the lung could pave the way for innovative interventions that improve lung health and resilience against infections.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening complications that can arise following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). GVHD occurs when immune cells—primarily T cells—from the graft recognize host cells as foreign entities and initiate an immune response against host tissues. This immune reaction generally involves a diverse array of cytokines, including interleukins (ILs), which play a pivotal role in modulating the immune response, promoting inflammation, and sustaining immune tolerance. Members of the interleukin family are not only directly involved in the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of T cells but also regulate inflammatory responses and the migration of immune cells. Consequently, they significantly influence both the clinical manifestations and prognosis of GVHD. The objective of this study is to review recent advancements in research concerning interleukins and their role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. This study aims to elucidate how interleukins contribute to immune regulation, inflammatory responses, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, we will discuss their potential as therapeutic targets, with the intention of providing novel insights and strategies for the clinical management of GVHD.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
While highly efficacious for numerous cancers, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can cause unpredictable and potentially severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), underscoring the need to understand irAE biology.


METHODS
We used a multidimensional approach incorporating single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) profiling to characterize the peripheral immune landscape of patients receiving ICI therapy according to irAE development.


RESULTS
Analysis of 162 patients revealed that individuals who developed clinically significant irAEs exhibited a baseline proinflammatory, autoimmune-like state characterized by a significantly higher abundance of CD57+ T and natural killer (NK) T cells, plasmablasts, proliferating and activated CXCR3+ lymphocytes, CD8+ effector and terminal effector memory T cells, along with reduced NK cells and elevated plasma ANA levels. In irAE cases, we identified distinct baseline proinflammatory gene signatures, including markedly higher expression of IL1B and CXCL8 in monocytes and CXCR3, TNF, and IFNG in T/NK cells. TNF signaling was the most enriched pathway, while immunosuppressive genes SIGLEC7 and CXCR4 were downregulated. Following ICI initiation, these patients exhibited an enhanced shift toward an activated and inflammatory immune phenotype, including monocyte reprogramming characterized by upregulation of IL18 and elevated gene expression levels of CXCL10. Conversely, post-treatment levels of CXCL8 were decreased in irAE patients. Notably, in patients who did not develop clinically significant irAE, we identified increased baseline abundance of a TGFBIhigh myeloid cluster enriched in immunosuppressive markers such as STAB1. In addition, patients without irAE exhibited upregulation of TNF and AIRE, accompanied by distinct myeloid protumorigenic reprogramming.


CONCLUSIONS
A pre-existing activated, autoimmune-like proinflammatory state drives the development of irAE during ICI therapy through three key axes: increased plasmablast/ANA, heightened interferon-gamma/CXCL10/CXCR3 axis, and amplified TNF signaling. These findings may serve as potential peripheral immune biomarkers for predicting irAE and provide biological insights into the mechanisms governing and mitigating irAE.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor with a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes tumor progression and therapy resistance. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), comprising up to 50% of the tumor mass, are recruited via chemokine axes such as CCL2/CCR2, CX3CL1/CX3CR1, and CXCL12/CXCR4 and adopt an M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype, facilitating immune escape and angiogenesis. Key signaling pathways, including CSF1R, STAT3, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, and HIF-1α, regulate TAM function, making them promising therapeutic targets. Strategies such as TAM depletion, reprogramming, and immune checkpoint blockade (PD-1/PD-L1, and CD47-SIRPα) have shown potential in preclinical models. Emerging approaches, including CAR-macrophage (CAR-M) therapy, nanotechnology-based drug delivery, and exosome-mediated modulation, offer new avenues for intervention. However, clinical translation remains challenging due to GBM’s heterogeneity and adaptive resistance mechanisms. Future research should integrate multi-omics profiling and AI-driven drug discovery to refine TAM-targeted therapies and improve patient outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of TAM-mediated immune regulation in GBM and explores evolving therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming its treatment barriers.">

        <tr id="Background and purpose The tumor microenvironment (TME) is widely acknowledged as a pivotal regulator of cancer progression. However, the dualistic role of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which serve as critical immune hubs within the TME, remains incompletely characterized, particularly with respect to their context-dependent capacity to either inhibit or facilitate tumor development. This review aims to synthesize current understanding of the complex interactions between stromal cells and TLSs, addressing existing gaps in mechanistic insight and exploring therapeutic avenues to exploit TLS plasticity. Key reviewed topics The current study critically reviews the mechanisms by which stromal components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells, contribute to TLS neogenesis through chemokine-mediated recruitment of lymphocytes. Furthermore, it highlights the dual functional roles of TLSs as sites of both anti-tumor immune activation and immunosuppression, notably via the enrichment of regulatory T cells. The clinical implications of mature TLS presence, particularly their association with improved patient prognosis and enhanced therapeutic responsiveness, are also analyzed. Main conclusions TLSs demonstrate a bifunctional nature, wherein their spatial organization and dynamic interactions with stromal elements dictate the balance between immune activation and tolerance within the TME. While mature TLSs are generally correlated with favorable clinical outcomes, their potential to foster immunosuppressive microenvironments necessitates the development of precision-targeted interventions. The interplay between stromal cells and TLSs represents a promising therapeutic axis for modulating the tumor immune milieu. Future perspectives Future research should prioritize strategies aimed at promoting TLS maturation, disrupting immunosuppressive niches, and integrating TLS-modulating agents with existing immunotherapeutic regimens to enhance clinical efficacy. Additionally, the identification of robust biomarkers reflective of TLS functional states and the rigorous validation of stromal-targeted therapies within combinatorial treatment frameworks are imperative for advancing translational applications.

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It follows a dynamic course in which early hyperinflammation coexists and overlaps with progressive immune suppression, a process best described as immunodynamic disruption. Key mechanisms include extensive lymphocyte death, expansion of regulatory T cells, impaired antigen presentation, and persistent activation of inhibitory checkpoints such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). These changes reduce immune competence and increase vulnerability to secondary infections. Clinically, reduced expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen–DR (HLA-DR) on monocytes and persistent lymphopenia have emerged as robust biomarkers for patient stratification and timing of immunomodulatory therapies. Beyond the acute phase, many survivors do not achieve full immune recovery but instead develop a Persistent Immune Remnant, defined as long-lasting immune, metabolic, and endothelial dysfunction despite apparent clinical resolution. Recognizing PIR emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring and biomarker-guided interventions to restore immune balance. To integrate these observations, we propose the SIMMP–Sepsis model (Sepsis-Associated Persistent Multiorgan Immunometabolic Syndrome), which links molecular dysfunction to clinical trajectories and provides a framework for developing precision immunotherapies. This perspective reframes sepsis not only as an acute crisis but also as a chronic immunometabolic syndrome, where survival marks the beginning of active immune restoration.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell best known for fighting infections, but recent studies show they also play complex roles in cancer. Within tumors, neutrophils can adopt opposing identities: the “N1” type combats cancer by killing tumor cells and stimulating immune activity, while the “N2” type does the opposite—supporting tumor growth, blocking immune responses, and aiding disease progression. In this review, we explore how neutrophils respond to different cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immune cell therapy, and therapies using viruses or bacteria. We highlight how different therapeutic environments can drive neutrophils toward either the beneficial N1 or the harmful N2 state. Understanding what determines this polarization is key to improving outcomes. By understanding when neutrophils act in favor of or against treatment, scientists can design better strategies to fight cancer. This knowledge could lead to new therapies that guide neutrophils to support the immune system, reduce tumor spread, and improve the efficacy of current cancer treatments.">

They express specific gene signatures that enable them to occupy tissues without recirculating, thus providing a first response against reencountered pathogens or antigens. TRM have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including autoimmune disorders, infections, and cancers. This has prompted interest in targeting TRM as a potential therapeutic strategy. Epigenetic modifications, which frequently occur in immune cells across various disease states, play a significant role not only in tissue homeostasis but also in disease progression. Emerging evidence suggests that the epigenetic landscape of TRM is altered in pathogenic conditions, impacting their differentiation, maintenance, and function. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the epigenetic regulation of TRM, focusing on key areas such as chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Importantly, a deeper understanding of these epigenetic mechanisms will pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies, such as modulating TRM activity in autoimmune diseases, enhancing tissue-specific immunity through vaccines, or improving immunotherapeutic efficacy in cancer.">

Here, we describe that TH17 cytokines strongly inhibit expression of critical chemokines in epithelial tissues, which leads to blocking infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells into the colon, rendering resistance to DSS-induced colitis and colon cancer. We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of TH17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. Overall, our findings have identified a previously unrecognized critical gap between TH17 cytokines, epithelial chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration through a C/EBPβ-mediated pathway.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are organized aggregates of lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and stromal cells that form at sites of inflammation, providing adaptive immune responses outside of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). Found in various pathological conditions—including chronic infections, cancer, organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and allergy—the presence of TLSs is linked to potentiation of local immunity. TLSs can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on context, and have been implicated as prognostic for disease severity and therapy response. Architecturally, TLSs resemble SLOs with distinct T and B cell areas supported by fibroblasts that secrete chemokines and cytokines that support immune cells. These structures must be created de novo in non‐lymphoid tissues; thus, the steps for TLS formation mimic, but do not completely copy, those of SLO formation. The accumulation of immune cells in tissues in inflammatory settings can initiate remodeling of tissue fibroblasts, leading to TLS formation; this process is common across tissues, although there are tissue‐ and disease‐specific pathways that impact TLS formation in certain contexts. This review will explore the immune‐stromal crosstalk in kidney, lung, and skin TLSs across a range of disease settings, highlighting shared as well as tissue‐specific mechanisms for TLS formation.">

However, recent advancements in single-cell analysis and molecular biology have revealed their remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity, particularly within the context of tumors. This review explores the development and diversity of neutrophils under both physiological and pathological conditions, with a particular focus on their roles in cancer. The discussion encompasses the emergence of distinct neutrophil subtypes, particularly senescent neutrophils, within tumors and their context-dependent functions in tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis, and recurrence. The plasticity of these cells, driven by intrinsic factors and the tumor microenvironment, allows them to be reprogrammed between pro-tumor and anti-tumor phenotypes. This process is influenced by cytokines, metabolic reprogramming, and interactions with other immune cells. The potential of targeting and engineering neutrophil as a therapeutic avenue for cancer treatment is further underscored, including the use of senolytic agents, metabolic inhibitors, and reprogramming strategies. Finally, future research directions are proposed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying neutrophil heterogeneity and plasticity, with the aim of developing novel therapeutic approaches to modulate neutrophil function in cancer.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer, with poor survival rates in advanced stages due to late diagnosis, tumor heterogeneity, and therapy resistance. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in HCC has a crucial role in tumor progression, characterized by a complex interaction of immune cells, stromal components, and immunosuppressive signaling pathways. Chronic inflammation driven by viral infections, metabolic dysfunction, and alcohol consumption triggers an immunosuppressive TME, promoting immune evasion and tumor growth. Immune cell populations, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, and tumor-associated macrophages, contribute to immunosuppression, while cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells exert anti-tumor effects. Recent advances in immunotherapy, mainly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed death-ligand 1 and programmed cell death protein 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, have revolutionized HCC treatment, though response rates remain limited. Combined therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, and ICIs improve patient outcomes. This review discusses the immunological mechanisms contributing to HCC progression, the role of immune cell subsets in tumor evasion, and therapeutic interventions, from conventional treatments to advanced immunotherapies. Ongoing clinical trials, barriers to effective treatment, and future directions to enhance HCC management and patient survival will also be overviewed.">

        <tr id="Malignant melanoma is characterized by high heterogeneity, aggressive metastatic potential, and a profoundly immunosuppressive “cold” tumor microenvironment, contributing to broad therapeutic resistance and suboptimal responses to immunotherapy. Conventional PD-1 inhibitors yield an ORR of only 38%. As an emerging class of immunotherapeutic agents, oncolytic viruses (OV) induce ICD, promoting the release of DAMPs and activating innate immune pathways such as cGAS-STING, thereby transforming “cold” tumors into “hot” phenotypes and eliciting robust anti-tumor responses. Mechanistically, OV therapy increases the proportion of CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) in lymph nodes from 5% to 25% and enhances DC–tumor synapse formation by 300%, facilitating efficient cross-presentation of tumor antigens and T-cell priming. Clinically, T-VEC combined with pembrolizumab achieves a 48.6% ORR with grade ≥3 AEs occurring in <20% of patients—superior to either monotherapy or conventional chemoradiotherapy. Nonetheless, OV therapy faces challenges including tumor heterogeneity, core mechanistic limitations, viral shedding risks, and regulatory hurdles. Over the next 5–10 years, single-cell RNA sequencing is expected to unravel molecular heterogeneity in melanoma, while CRISPR/Cas systems may enable the design of tailored OV to overcome resistance. Additional strategies such as serotype switching, JAK/STAT inhibition, and arming OV with hyaluronidase or STING agonists are under investigation to overcome immune and stromal barriers. Integration of artificial intelligence with biomarkers—such as neutralizing antibody titers, ISG expression, and STING methylation—may further enable personalized OV-based therapies. This review discusses OV therapy’s mechanisms, clinical impact, and future prospects in melanoma treatment.">

Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have facilitated the identification of numerous novel CD8 T cell subsets, each characterized by unique functional properties. As cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the primary focus has been on the cytotoxic capabilities and antigen specificity of these subsets. A recently identified subset, Granzyme k (Gzmk)+ CD8 T cells, has been closely associated with inflammatory diseases, independent of their cytotoxic function. Unlike other granzymes, granzyme K predominantly induces proinflammatory responses in tissues or cells rather than mediating cytotoxicity. This review synthesizes current evidence regarding the regulation, functional roles, and underlying mechanisms of Gzmk+ CD8 T cells in inflammatory conditions.

Chronic inflammation and immune remodeling sustain malignant hematopoiesis and contribute to disease progression from essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) to overt myelofibrosis (MF). Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines—including IL-2, IFN-α, IL-23, and TNF-α—drive abnormal T cell polarization, favoring a pathogenic Th17 phenotype. Lymphocyte subset analysis reveals a predominance of exhausted PD-1+ T cells, reflecting impaired immune surveillance. Concurrently, alterations in neutrophil apoptosis lead to persistent inflammation and stromal activation. GRO-α (CXCL1) is elevated in ET but reduced in MF, suggesting a subtype-specific role in disease biology. Fibrosis-promoting factors such as TGF-β and IL-13 mediate bone marrow remodeling and megakaryocyte expansion, while VEGF and other angiogenic factors enhance vascular niche alterations, particularly in PV. These immunopathologic features underscore novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. In addition to JAK inhibition, targeted strategies such as CXCR1/2 antagonists, anti-TGF-β agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1 blockade) may offer disease-modifying potential. Understanding the interplay between cytokine signaling and immune cell dysfunction is crucial for developing precision immunotherapies in MPNs.">

        <tr id="Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, with chronic liver inflammation being a major risk factor. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have been associated with improved survival and better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in several cancers. However, their role in HCC remains unclear, and findings are often contradictory. Methods: The study investigated the presence and composition of TLSs across multiple liver disease models, including livers containing HCC. TLSs were characterized to identify the essential cellular components for functional lymphoid activity. The functional role of age-associated B cells (ABCs) was further explored by blocking T-bet expression in B cells, thereby preventing their differentiation into ABCs. Results: TLS frequency was increased in livers containing HCC. Characterization confirmed the presence of key immune cell subsets supporting lymphoid function. Blocking T-bet in B cells led to a reduction in ABCs, which resulted in smaller TLS, a specific decrease in hepatic B cells, and reduced tumor lesion size in HCC-bearing mice. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that ABCs promote TLS formation and growth, facilitating B-cell recruitment to the liver and supporting HCC progression. Targeting T-bet–dependent ABC differentiation may represent a novel strategy to limit TLS formation and slow HCC progression.">

While CD123 constitutes a promising target on LSPCs and leukemic blasts, previous CD123-targeting approaches showed limited efficacy and challenging safety profiles. Here, we describe the preclinical efficacy and safety of the bispecific CD123/CD16A innate cell engager “AFM28”, demonstrating superior activity against AML and MDS patient-derived LSPCs and blasts in vitro compared to an Fc-enhanced CD123-targeting antibody, especially towards CD123low and/or CD64+ leukemic cells. AFM28 induces autologous anti-leukemic activity in fresh AML whole blood cultures, demonstrating its potential to enhance NK cell function from AML patients. Responsiveness can be further enhanced by allogeneic NK cell addition. Anti-leukemic activity of AFM28 is confirmed in xenograft mouse models. In addition, AFM28 is well tolerated and demonstrates pharmacodynamic activity in cynomolgus monkeys. Altogether, our results indicate that AFM28 has the potential to reduce relapse-inducing residual disease and promote long-term remissions for patients with AML and MDS with a favorable safety profile.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphoid-derived cells that play a critical role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. Given their ability to recognize and directly kill targets possessing missing or altered self-proteins and to induce indirect killing via recruitment of adaptive immunity, they are in a unique position to modulate host immunologic responses. These complex immune sentinels typically circulate in the peripheral blood and/or reside in lymphoid tissues. As the largest organ, human skin functions in front line immunological defense, though it has not historically been categorized as lymphoid tissue. Whether tissue-resident ILC populations originally derive from conventional circulating NK cells, or whether they interface as developmentally distinct entities with phenotypic overlap within particular inflammatory contexts remains a subject of ongoing investigation. This review seeks to consolidate the currently available literature regarding NK cell and ILC skin homing and innate immune function in healthy vs. lesional human skin (including infection, inflammatory/autoimmune conditions, and cutaneous malignancy). Importantly, we elucidate significant gaps in the understanding of the complex role for NK cells in skin homeostasis and pathology, and posit unique opportunities the accessibility of this secondary lymphoid organ provides for translational studies to improve our understanding of cutaneous immunity.">

        <tr id="Two key players in the immune system, dendritic cells (DCs) and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), interact in a crucial way to fight infectious diseases. DCs play a key role in recognizing pathogens, and ILCs respond to cytokines released by DCs. This response triggers the production of specific effector cytokines that help control pathogens and maintain the body’s barrier integrity. DCs have various receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), that detect microbial components and trigger immune responses. Likewise, ILCs act as essential initial responders in the immune system in viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. Successfully managing diseases caused by pathogens mainly depends on the combined actions of DCs and ILCs, which work to suppress and eliminate pathogens. DCs also play a crucial role in activating innate and adaptive immune cell subsets, including ILCs. Furthermore, the use of DCs in developing vaccines and immunotherapy for cancers, along with the dedication of many researchers to improve immune responses through DCs, has increased interest in the potential of DC therapies for treating and preventing infectious diseases. This review examines approaches that may enhance DC vaccines and boost anti-infection immune responses by fostering better interactions of DCs with ILCs.">

Neutrophils are a new cancer research focus due to their potential to reduce the efficacy of immune-based therapies. This study aimed to deepen understanding of neutrophil function in MM by analyzing freshly isolated myeloid cells from paired focal lesions (FL) and bone marrow (BM) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunofluorescence imaging, and functional assays. We describe three distinct CXCR2+ mature neutrophil subsets: TREM1+CD10+, RETN+LCN2+, and TNFAIP3+CXCL8+, each exhibiting unique phenotypes within the TME. Notably, the TREM1+CD10+ subset was highly prevalent, particularly in FL, demonstrating potent immunosuppressive effects on T cells. This subset's gene signature was correlated with shorter overall survival (OS) in a large MM patient dataset, underscoring its clinical significance. Targeted inhibition of neutrophil activity through CXCR2 blockade, alone or combined with standard anti-MM therapies, significantly reduced tumor burden, improving OS in preclinical MM models. These insights into neutrophil-mediated immunosuppression in MM provide valuable knowledge regarding mechanisms driving immune evasion and reveal new therapeutic approaches to enhance the efficacy of MM treatment.">

 Adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapies have shown limited efficacy against most solid tumors. A key barrier to success is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Beyond local effects, tumors induce systemic immune disturbances that further hinder anti-tumor immunity and promote disease progression. In this study, we investigate how tumor-driven systemic immunosuppression compromises the function of both endogenous and adoptively transferred natural killer (NK) cells, identifying potential strategies to enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes.



 We utilized syngeneic murine cancer models to systematically characterize alterations in immune cell populations within the circulation and spleen. Comprehensive and in-depth assessment of immune cell function, transcriptional activity, and metabolic state was performed using flow cytometry, Seahorse metabolic analysis, RNA sequencing, metabolic tracing, and ex vivo co-culture systems.



 In our PDAC mouse models, tumor burden elicited a robust systemic inflammatory response marked by expansion of myeloid lineage cells, particularly MDSCs, within the TME, peripheral blood, and spleen. Tumor growth led to reduced frequencies and functional deficits in both endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells in circulation and spleen. Depletion of Gr-1+ MDSCs effectively restored NK cell effector functions. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice promote NK cell dysfunction through induction of lipid peroxidation. Notably, we observed pronounced upregulation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)—a central lipid metabolism regulator—in MDSCs, which drove increased lipid oxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Disruption of the ApoE-LDL receptor (LDLR) axis in MDSCs, achieved via genetic ablation, reprogrammed their metabolic activities and significantly reduced their immunosuppressive capacity toward both endogenous and transferred NK cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of lipid utilization rescued NK cell function and, when combined with NK cell adoptive transfer, produced synergistic anti-tumor effects in PDAC models.



 Our results emphasize the pivotal role of MDSC expansion in mediating systemic immunosuppression in tumor-bearing hosts. We identify the ApoE/LDLR axis as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt MDSC-driven immunosuppression, thereby enhancing the efficacy of NK cell–based immunotherapies. These findings underscore the importance of resolving systemic immune dysregulation in cancer patients to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy.

Despite advances in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and targeted therapies, clinical responses remain heterogeneous, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of RCC immunobiology. This review comprehensively examines the immunosuppressive TME of RCC, emphasizing the roles of cytotoxic and immunosuppressive immune cells, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), abnormal vasculature, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in fostering immune evasion. This review summarized emerging biomarkers—including PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden (TMB), gene mutations, and immune-based subtypes—that may predict ICI response. Furthermore, we evaluate current immunotherapeutic strategies, such as ICIs, combination therapies, and novel approaches targeting immunosuppressive cells and metabolic pathways. While combination therapies have improved outcomes, challenges like toxicity and resistance persist, necessitating biomarker-driven patient stratification and optimized treatment sequencing. Future directions should focus on deciphering TME heterogeneity and developing precision immunotherapy strategies to enhance clinical efficacy in RCC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells represent a unique population of innate-like T lymphocytes capable of detecting non-peptide antigens in the context of monomorphic antigen-presenting molecules. Due to their abundance in barrier tissues, reactivity to local inflammatory cues, and cytotoxic and regulatory functions, MAIT cells are poised to shape the dynamics of various tumor microenvironments. Growing evidence suggests that MAIT cells can exert protumor and/or antitumor effects in cancers arising from or metastasizing to mucosal tissues. However, MAIT cell roles in bladder cancer (BCa) remains unclear. Methods To begin to identify MAIT cells in BCa, we stained bladder tumor biopsies for T cell receptor (TCR) Vα7.2+ cells. We then refined a human MAIT cell signature, which enabled us to interrogate a bulk RNA sequencing dataset and conduct correlation analyses linking intratumoral MAIT cell abundance and mortality from BCa. To extend our work to an in vivo setting, we employed a clinically relevant mouse model in which Mr1+/+ B6-MAITCAST (MAIT-sufficient) and Mr1−/− B6-MAITCAST (MAIT-deficient) mice were exposed to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine, a chemical carcinogen associated with tobacco smoke. In additional experiments, MAIT cells were functionally removed through acetyl-6-formylpterin (Ac-6-FP) administration. Effector and regulatory cell types were phenotyped by flow cytometry, and BCa tumor burden and progression were assessed by MRI and/or H&E and Ki67 staining. Results TCR Vα7.2+ cells were readily detectable in several BCa biopsies, and our bioinformatic analyses correlated heavier MAIT cell presence in BCa tumors with poorer overall survival. Similarly, we found higher tumor burdens in Mr1+/+ B6-MAITCAST mice than in Mr1−/− or Ac-6-FP-treated animals. Bladder MAIT cells from tumor-bearing mice exhibited phenotypic MAIT17 bias based on transcription factors they harbored along with increased interleukin-17A and tumor necrosis factor-α production capacities upon stimulation. Finally, FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cell frequencies were elevated in Mr1+/+ mouse bladder tumors, likely contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, a finding that could be recapitulated in our transcriptomic studies on human BCa. Conclusions MAIT cells are abundant in BCa tumor microenvironments where they potentiate Treg cell accumulation and play protumor roles.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY Obesity is a rapidly growing public health crisis associated simultaneously with increased metabolic disease and humoral immune suppression to vaccination or infection. Inflammatory CD11c+T-bet+ B cells (ABCs) increase in spleen and adipose tissue during obesity and exacerbate metabolic dysfunction via antibodies. We now find that during obesity Tbet+ B cells also expand in the liver but not omentum or mesenteric fat. Obese mice also develop increased splenic CXCR5+ TFH and hepatic CXCR5− TPH cells which serve as likely partners for antigen-experienced MHC-II+ ABCs. We also observed that antibodies in obese mice, previously found to contribute to metabolic disease, largely circulate as inflammatory autoantigen-bound immune complexes. Perhaps most striking was our observation that obese mice lacking T-bet in B cells develop increased autoantibody titers and expanded splenic germinal center (GC) B and T helper cells. T-bet+ B cell-deficient mice make a similarly enhanced GC, TFH, TPH response to haptenated-protein vaccination with a corresponding increase in antibody affinity, although there is no additive effect of obesity. These results are consistent with GC inhibition by expanded ABCs demonstrated by others to occur during autoimmunity, suggesting a broadly universal mechanism which may also explain reduced humoral immunity and poor clinical outcomes following infection in patients with obesity and other forms of chronic inflammation.">

 Adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapies have shown limited efficacy against most solid tumors. A key barrier to success is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Beyond local effects, tumors induce systemic immune disturbances that further hinder anti-tumor immunity and promote disease progression. In this study, we investigate how tumor-driven systemic immunosuppression compromises the function of both endogenous and adoptively transferred natural killer (NK) cells, identifying potential strategies to enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes.



 We utilized syngeneic murine cancer models to systematically characterize alterations in immune cell populations within the circulation and spleen. Comprehensive and in-depth assessment of immune cell function, transcriptional activity, and metabolic state was performed using flow cytometry, Seahorse metabolic analysis, RNA sequencing, metabolic tracing, and ex vivo co-culture systems.



 In our PDAC mouse models, tumor burden elicited a robust systemic inflammatory response marked by expansion of myeloid lineage cells, particularly MDSCs, within the TME, peripheral blood, and spleen. Tumor growth led to reduced frequencies and functional deficits in both endogenous and adoptively transferred NK cells in circulation and spleen. Depletion of Gr-1+ MDSCs effectively restored NK cell effector functions. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice promote NK cell dysfunction through induction of lipid peroxidation. Notably, we observed pronounced upregulation of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)—a central lipid metabolism regulator—in MDSCs, which drove increased lipid oxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Disruption of the ApoE-LDL receptor (LDLR) axis in MDSCs, achieved via genetic ablation, reprogrammed their metabolic activities and significantly reduced their immunosuppressive capacity toward both endogenous and transferred NK cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of lipid utilization rescued NK cell function and, when combined with NK cell adoptive transfer, produced synergistic anti-tumor effects in PDAC models.



 Our results emphasize the pivotal role of MDSC expansion in mediating systemic immunosuppression in tumor-bearing hosts. We identify the ApoE/LDLR axis as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt MDSC-driven immunosuppression, thereby enhancing the efficacy of NK cell–based immunotherapies. These findings underscore the importance of resolving systemic immune dysregulation in cancer patients to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Success of cancer immunotherapy (CIT) is intricately influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex ecosystem that encompasses immune cells, stromal elements, and extracellular components. Despite the clinical breakthroughs of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), adoptive cell therapies, cancer vaccines, and other immunotherapeutic interventions, many patients fail to respond and eventually die. Emerging evidence points to cancer stem cells (CSCs) as critical drivers of immune evasion, therapy-resistance, and tumor relapse. CSCs modulate the TME by secreting immune-suppressive factors, recruiting regulatory immune cells, and inducing phenotype-switching of anti-tumor TME subsets, thereby creating a protective niche that hinders immune surveillance. Conversely, the TME protects CSCs through hypoxia, altered metabolism, and immuno-suppressive cell populations. This bi-directional crosstalk supports tumor progression and provides resistance to immunotherapeutic strategies mainly by: (i) escaping immune-recognition and inhibiting active T cells via high immune-checkpoint molecule expression, (ii) creating immunosuppressive pro-tumor environment, and (iii) evading immune-mediated apoptosis of CSCs along with therapy-induced enrichment of their pool. Targeting CSCs in concert with reprogramming the TME via CSC-directed agents, metabolic modulators, or combinatorial immunotherapies, therefore, offers a promising avenue to overcome immunotherapy-resistance and achieve durable clinical responses. This review discusses the deeper mechanistic understanding of CSC-TME interactions, in light of designing next-generation immunotherapies with broader efficacy across diverse tumor types.">

It is characterized by a progressive decline in lung function, significantly affecting prognosis and potentially leading to respiratory failure or even death. The primary pathological mechanisms behind ILD include abnormal immune system activation and pulmonary fibrosis. Current treatment options primarily include immunosuppressive agents, antifibrotic drugs, and oxygen therapy to alleviate symptoms. However, these treatments have notable limitations, including individual variability and uncertain long-term effectiveness, which pose significant challenges in managing CTD-associated ILD (CTD-ILD).In recent years, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have gained considerable attention as a promising therapeutic option for CTD-ILD. This is due to their immunomodulatory, antifibrotic, and tissue repair properties. Both clinical and preclinical studies have shown the therapeutic potential of MSCs in this context. However, this article also discusses the challenges and limitations of MSC-based therapies, highlighting the need for further clinical studies to validate their effectiveness.">

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects nearly one-fourth of the global population, yet effective diagnostics and treatments remain limited. Systemic immune dysregulation plays a key role in MASLD pathogenesis, highlighting the value of immune profiling.


METHODS
In this study, we used high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors (n = 6), MASLD patients (n = 4), and MASLD patients treated with an 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) inhibitor (n = 2). PBMCs were stained with a 29-marker panel to identify 15 immune cell types and assess cytokine expression.


RESULTS
MASLD patients showed increased CD8⁺ T cells, early NK cells, and monocytes, along with reductions in TH2, TH1, late NK, and Treg cells. Cytokine profiling revealed elevated IL-6 expression in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and late NK cells, indicating systemic inflammation. Automated clustering (PhenoGraph, UMAP) identified NK and phagocytic subsets associated with disease and treatment. Notably, 11β-HSD1 inhibition led to downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, IL-6) and partial restoration of immune subsets.


CONCLUSIONS
These results offer a high-resolution view of immune alterations in MASLD and suggest that 11β-HSD1 inhibition may represent a promising immunomodulatory therapeutic strategy.">

 Fractionated focal radiation therapy (RT) induces immunogenic cell death and activates the type I interferon pathway via the cGAS/STING pathway, promoting tumor antigen cross-presentation by conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and driving tumor-specific T-cell activation. However, the impact of RT on tumor regression is often limited by its complex effects on the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME). Several studies have shown that RT increases both the frequency and functional activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), due in part to their intrinsic radioresistance and to RT-induced modulation of recruitment signals such as TGFβ, CCL17, and CCL221-2. In a recent study, we showed that RT combined with immunotherapy can remodel the TiME3, et persistent infiltration of activated Tregs can dampen the full immunostimulatory effects of RT-driven viral mimicry responses4. Here, we evaluated whether combining RT with blockade of the myeloid checkpoint SIRPα could modulate Treg infiltration and activity. Using mouse models of luminal (TSA) and triple-negative (AT3) breast cancer, we tested RT in combination with a blocking anti-SIRPα antibody (MY1; SIRPα-b). While MY1 monotherapy showed minimal activity, its combination with RT led to enhanced regression of irradiated tumors and inhibition of non-irradiated (abscopal) tumor growth in both tumor models. This effect was lost upon conditional cDC depletion using Zbtb46-DTR mice, highlighting the importance of cDCs in mediating the therapeutic synergy. To dissect the immune mechanisms underlying this synergy, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing and CITE-seq on CD45+ tumor-infiltrating cells from TSA tumors treated with RT ± SIRPα-b. We observed a significant reduction in Treg infiltration in SIRPα-b–treated tumors, with or without RT. Furthermore, expression of Treg activation markers OX40, CTLA-4, and GITR was reduced, particularly in the RT + SIRPα-b group. Among infiltrating CD45+ cells, expression of Treg recruiting Ccl22 and Ccl17 chemokines was observed only in a highly activated cluster of CCR7high cDCs expressing SIRPα, CXCL16, PD-L1, and IL-15Rα. Notably, expression of both chemokines was strongly decreased following SIRPα-b treatment, suggesting that SIRPα signaling supports Treg recruitment via this cDC population.Studies to understand the mechanisms of Treg recruitment to the tumor via chemokine secretion by CCR7high cDCs and their role in tumor regression after RT + SIRPα-b are underway. Intra-tumoral CCR7high cDCs are known to support the activation and cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in the tumor through transpresentation of Il-155. Our results suggest that this population also plays a key immunoregulatory role in shaping the TiME. Targeting the CD47/SIRPα axis may thus improve RT efficacy by modulating the dual functions of CCR7high cDCs in both effector stimulation and Treg recruitment.

        <tr id="Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Increasing evidence underscores the pivotal yet paradoxical roles of innate immune cells and their associated cytokines in orchestrating the dynamic landscape of the breast tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Innate immune effectors, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and natural killer (NK) cells, exert dual functions by either initiating robust antitumor responses or facilitating immune evasion, metastatic dissemination, and therapeutic resistance. For instance, MDSCs suppress T and NK cell activity via STAT3/NF-κB signaling and modulate the cytokine milieu through IL-10 and TGF-β. Similarly, M2-polarized TAMs promote angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance via IL-10/STAT3/Bcl-2 pathways. In contrast, NK cells and CD103+ DCs mediate tumor cell cytolysis and prime antigen-specific immunity, though their activity is frequently compromised in advanced disease. Moreover, key cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, TNF-α, TGF-β, and CCL2/5, demonstrate subtype-specific and context-dependent effects, acting as both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing agents through complex signaling networks. This review highlights the dualistic nature of innate immune components in breast cancer, discusses their prognostic and therapeutic implications, and proposes novel intervention strategies, such as TAM repolarization, and cytokine modulation, to reprogram the TIME and restore effective immune surveillance, particularly in aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Nociceptor neurons, which transmit pain signals, also regulate immunity by releasing immunomodulatory neuropeptides. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and melanoma, our research has shown that tumor-innervating nociceptors modulate anti-tumor immunity through the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its interaction with receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1). A retrospective analysis of clinical charts from HNSCC patients revealed that higher pain levels correlated with increased opioid use, perineural invasion, and decreased B-cell infiltration—factors associated with poorer survival outcomes. In silico single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that opioid use in HNSCC patients downregulates nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), an endogenous ligand for opioid receptor-like-1 (OPRL1). We identified B cells as the primary source of N/OFQ and observed that high expression of either Pnoc or Oprl1 correlates with better survival in both melanoma and HNSCC. In a mouse model of oral squamous cell carcinoma (oSCC), we found that nociceptor neurons in tongue tumors overexpress Oprl1 and exhibit severe mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Compared to healthy tissue, oSCC tumors have dense infiltration of nociceptor fibers and N/OFQ-expressing B cells. Pharmacological blockade of Oprl1 reduced HNSCC-induced mechanical pain. In a melanoma mouse model, tumor-innervating neurons also overexpressed Oprl1, and similar overexpression was observed when DRG neurons were co-cultured with B16F10 cells. Activating OPRL1 reduced tumor size, enhanced cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, and relieved cancer-induced thermal hypersensitivity. In contrast, depleting CD19+ B cells or blocking OPRL1 led to increased tumor growth, reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration and cytotoxic potential, exacerbated pain, and elevated CGRP levels. Moreover, we discovered that Ramp1+ B cells express Pnoc, but this expression is suppressed by CGRP. Blocking RAMP1 reduced tumor growth and promoted B-cell Pnoc expression. Overall, these findings suggest that targeting the N/OFQ and RAMP1 pathways could bolster anti-tumor immunity while simultaneously alleviating cancer-induced pain.">

Recent studies have demonstrated that intratumoral microbiota serve as critical regulators of the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting the progression of solid tumors (e.g., gastric, lung, and breast cancers). These microbes modulate immune factors (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α), thereby influencing the activation and infiltration of immune cells, including T cells and macrophage. Additionally, by reshaping the immune landscape, intratumoral microbiota can dysregulate immune checkpoint expression, ultimately affecting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the origins of intratumoral microbiota, their heterogeneity across cancer types, and their intricate roles in modulating immune responses and tumor metastasis. We further discuss innovative therapeutic strategies leveraging the intratumoral microbiota, including engineered bacteria, oncolytic viruses, and nanoparticles, and address existing challenges and potential future research directions. A deeper understanding of these microbial‒host interactions may open new avenues for precise microbiota-based cancer diagnostics and personalized immunotherapeutic strategies.">

However, the roles of specific innate immune cell subpopulations in kidney allograft rejection remain incompletely understood.We performed the spatial transcriptomics using the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) core needle biopsies from human kidney allografts.We demonstrated that non-rejection, AMR, acute TCMR and chronic active AMR have distinct transcriptomic features. Subclusters of monocytes/macrophages with high Fc gamma receptor IIIA (FCGR3A) expression were identified in C4d-positive active AMR and acute TCMR, and the spatial distribution of these cells corresponded to the characteristic histopathological features. Key markers related to monocyte/macrophage activation and innate alloantigen recognition were upregulated, along with metabolic pathways associated with trained immunity in AMR and TCMR.Taking together, these findings revealed that intragraft monocytes/macrophages with high FCGR3A expression play a critical role in kidney transplant rejections.">

Notable advancements in patient survival have been achieved due to the clinical application of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) and bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs). However, the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the bone marrow hinders the effectiveness of these novel immunotherapies, consequently restricting their efficacy. Hence, it is imperative to clarify the exact mechanisms to devise strategies aimed at improving the efficacy of immunotherapy. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of recent research concerning the different T cell subtypes in the immune evasion mechanisms of MM. The review emphasizes the imbalance between the immune surveillance and the immune suppression, and highlight recent studies about unconventional T cells, the metabolic control of immune reactions, and novel therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing immune evasion mechanisms that promote the progression of MM.">

Disulfidptosis has recently been discovered as a non-apoptotic cell death mechanism triggered by intracellular disulfide stress. However, the impact of disulfidptosis within the dynamic modulation of the immune and stromal components in the TME of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains poorly characterized. In the presented study, RNA-seq and clinical data of LUAD patients were downloaded from TCGA; screening for genes associated with disulfidptosis and immune infiltration, revealed that fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) modulates immune infiltration via disulfidptosis regulation. We also in-vitro experiments identified FGA suppression abrogates disulfidptosis through SLC7A11/xCT downregulation and attenuated disulfidptosis while concurrently enhancing malignant phenotypes, including cellular proliferation, migratory capacity, and invasive potential in LUAD models. This study reveals that FGA functions as a tumor suppressor that can impede the tumorigenesis of LUAD by modulating xCT expression, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy enabling modulation of disulfidptosis for LUAD management.">

By integrating data on tumor suppressors, oncogenic factors, cytokines, and chemokines, we performed differential gene expression analyses across immune populations.This analysis identified nine major immune cell subsets, including CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer/T cells (NK/T cells), B cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and macrophages. Notably, elevated CCR7 expression in exhausted CD8+ T cells was associated with improved prognosis, suggesting it as a preliminary candidate for an immunoregulatory target that warrants further investigation. Additionally, CCL5 levels were elevated in Tregs, indicating a possible involvement in their recruitment to the tumor site that requires further validation. Furthermore, differential gene expression analysis identified candidate genes for further mechanistic investigation.This systematic comparison of the TME between tumor and paratumor tissues reveals dynamic changes in the immune landscape, providing insights and suggesting potential targets for further study to enhance understanding and treatment of CSCC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT In spite of the numerous clinical trials conducted on mesenchymal stromal cells and their extracellular vesicles (MSC‐EVs) across a wide range of diseases, the field faces challenges in reaching a consensus on crucial parameters such as source, marker definition, and culture conditions, adding to heterogeneous efficiencies. Nevertheless, there is widespread acceptance of the pro‐inflammatory activation of MSCs with IFN‐γ and TNF‐α to enhance immune modulation. Our study highlights the impact of activation duration on MSC‐EV‐mediated immune modulation of macrophages. Extended activation periods (24 h) revealed elevated levels of IFN‐γ‐induced CD317 on the MSC surface. CD317 is known to tether enveloped viral particles to the cell membrane, impeding viral diffusion and spread. We demonstrated the accumulation of EVs on the MSC cell surface following activation or lentiviral CD317 overexpression. In contrast, CD317 knockdown eliminated the enrichment of EVs on the cell surface, significantly enhancing the MSC‐EV‐mediated immune modulation of macrophages. Considering the pivotal role of IFN‐γ in MSC immune modulation and its inevitable contact in patients, our findings propose CD317 as a potential modulator of MSC‐based therapy efficacy in clinical applications.">

Mouse splenocytes are stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies to activate CD8+ T cells, which are then co-incubated with either cancer cells or cancer cell–derived conditioned media (CM) to evaluate tumor-driven modulation of immune cell functions. The use of unfractionated splenocytes preserves physiological cell–cell interactions, eliminating the need for exogenous interleukin (IL-2) and bypassing flow sorting, which simplifies the workflow and reduces experimental variability. CD8+ T-cell responses are measured via flow cytometry, using markers of proliferation (CFSE dilution), activation (CD69), and effector function (Granzyme B and IFNγ). Additionally, immune-mediated tumor cell death is evaluated by Annexin-V/7-AAD staining. Together, this experimental platform supports the investigation of both cell contact-dependent and contact-independent mechanisms of immune cell modulation in a cost-effective and reproducible setting. Key features • Enables isolation and stimulation of splenocytes to assess CD8+ T-cell responses to cancer cells or their secreted factors. • Supports evaluation of CD8+ T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector function by flow cytometry. • Allows functional assessment of tumor-driven suppression of T-cell activation in co-culture or conditioned media. • Measures cancer cell death resulting from interactions with activated CD8+ T cells in splenocyte co-cultures.">

        <tr id="Introduction Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory treatment option for different T cell-mediated diseases such as cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). While in CTCL the polarization of T cells is shifted towards T helper cells type 1 (TH1) and an immune response against the lymphoma is induced, ECP in GvHD rather leads to the expansion of regulatory T cells (Treg). How ECP regulates the immune response dependent on the underlying disease is still not exactly known. As dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial regulators of the immune response, it is supposed that they are key players in the immunomodulatory effects of ECP. However, due to the scarcity of primary DCs in blood, research has focused on in vitro-generated monocyte-derived DCs so far. Methods Here, we present for the first time how the primary human blood DC subpopulations, i.e., conventional DCs type 1 (cDC1), cDC2, DC3, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDC), directly isolated from blood of healthy donors, respond to in vitro ECP treatment. Results We demonstrate that the exposure to 8-methoxypsoralen and UV-A light irradiation induces apoptosis in Toll-like receptor ligand-activated cDC1 and pDC as well as - to a minor extent - in steady state cDC1, cDC2, and DC3. However, the selective effect of ECP on viability of DC subpopulations was dependent on culture duration (18h vs. 42h) as well as condition (steady state vs. TLR ligand activated). Further, ECP modulates the expression of the co-stimulatory and co-regulatory molecules CD40, CD86, and PD-L1 on DC subpopulations. While ECP did not affect the T cell stimulatory capacity of cDC2 and DC3, ECP-treated cDC1 and - to a minor extent - pDC showed reduced activation of memory T cells and diminished secretion of TH1- and TH17-associated cytokines. Conclusion Thus, especially blood cDC1 are direct targets of ECP and the reduction of their T cell stimulatory capacity might contribute to the clinical efficacy observed in chronic GvHD patients.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a critical global health concern, particularly in regions with high endemicity of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for advanced HCC. Despite encouraging results, primary and acquired resistance to ICIs continues to pose significant challenges in clinical practice. Recent research has identified tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as key contributors to immune evasion and ICI resistance in HCC, primarily through polarization to the M2 phenotype. M2-polarized TAMs secrete a range of immunosuppressive cytokines that inhibit T cell activation and promote tumor progression through processes such as angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These mechanisms compromise the efficacy of ICIs and facilitate tumor expansion and metastasis. This review summarizes the role of TAM-related signaling pathways in driving immune evasion and ICI resistance in HCC, with particular emphasis on the contribution of TAM surface receptors and chemokines in immune suppression. Additionally, the review highlights emerging insights into TAM metabolic reprogramming and transcriptional regulation, which have been closely linked to ICI resistance. Furthermore, we explore promising therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs and their associated signaling pathways to enhance ICI efficacy in HCC. Integrating these novel approaches could potentially overcome TAM-driven immune evasion and ICI resistance, boosting the efficacy of immunotherapy and improving patient prognosis in HCC.">

        <tr id="Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the most prevalent and lethal form of lung cancer worldwide. Among the diverse components of the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are increasingly recognized as key regulators of NSCLC progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. TAMs, particularly those polarized toward the M2-like phenotype, facilitate tumor growth through immunosuppression, angiogenesis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix remodeling. They promote immune evasion via PD-L1, IL-10, and TGF-β signaling, and confer chemoresistance through activation of the IL-6/STAT3 and P2X7/STAT6 pathways. Moreover, high infiltration of M2-TAMs and their expression of immune checkpoint ligands have been associated with poor prognosis and, paradoxically, with improved response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in certain patients. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram TAM phenotypes, inhibit their recruitment, or selectively suppress their immunosuppressive functions. However, challenges such as macrophage plasticity, lack of specific biomarkers, and potential systemic toxicity remain significant barriers. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the biological functions, mechanistic roles, and clinical implications of TAMs in NSCLC, highlighting both their value as prognostic indicators and their potential as therapeutic targets in the era of precision oncology.">

        <tr id="The severity of certain viral infectious diseases varies across the age; we hypothesize that these variations could be related to the variation of immune responses to viral immune complexes (ICs) among the age. This study aimed to investigate monocyte activation in response to ICs in children, adults, and elderly individuals. An experimental in vitro model was established using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. Monocyte activation markers (CD169, CD38, HLA-DR), the negative co-stimulatory molecule (PD-L1), and cytokine production were measured under basal conditions and upon stimulation with human adenovirus 5-IgG immune complex (Ad5-ICs), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes from children and adults displayed similar activation profiles in response to ICs and IFN-α stimulation, characterized by increased expression of CD169 and PD-L1. In contrast, monocytes from elderly individuals exhibited weak or no overexpression of CD169 and PD-L1 coupled with a diminished PBMC cytokine response. Notably, cells from elderly participants produced high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the absence of stimulation. Multiple comparisons confirmed reduced monocyte activation and PBMC cytokine responses in the elderly compared to adults and children. Although children exhibited a significant response to ICs, their secretion of IFN-α, IP-10, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-2 was lower than that observed in adults. Our findings suggest that elderly individuals have poor and dysregulated responses to ICs, likely due to immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. Adults exhibit a robust and balanced response to ICs, while children display a moderate response, possibly influenced by ‘trained immunity’ resulting from frequent early-life exposures to pathogens. These insights highlight the importance of further research to develop age-specific therapeutic strategies to modulate immune function during viral IC exposure.">

 Despite the clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), therapeutic resistance and the unpredictable development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) remain major challenges. While the use of ICIs in combination can improve treatment efficacy, this also leads to an increase in the frequency and severity of irAEs. This has created an urgent need to enhance anti-tumor immunity without triggering immunotoxicity. However, current preclinical models are limited in their ability to model both ICI efficacy and irAE development. This is due to mouse strains commonly used for studying anti-tumor immunity, such as C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, being resistant to ICI-induced irAEs and failing to recapitulate the full spectrum of clinical responses seen in patients with cancer. To overcome these limitations, we generated transplantable, syngeneic tumor models with variable ICI responses using the autoimmune-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. The NOD model, which spontaneously develops multiple autoimmune diseases, exhibits a broad range of irAEs following ICI treatment with a shared etiology to clinical conditions. This approach offers insight into how genetic predisposition to autoimmunity influences both ICI response and irAE susceptibility, enabling us to explore how autoimmune-associated host-intrinsic factors uniquely alter the tumor microenvironment and contribute to ICI resistance. In ICI-resistant NOD tumors, CD8+ T cells exhibited a naïve-like phenotype, marked by elevated TCF-1 and reduced PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression, compared to ICI-sensitive tumors. Despite comparable CD8+ T cell frequency and number, these phenotypic differences led us to investigate other immune cell populations that regulate ICI response and CD8+ T cell activation. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry revealed enrichment of immunosuppressive γδ T cells in ICI-resistant tumors. These γδ T cells highly expressed the transcription factors RORγt+ and TCF1+ and lacked expression of T-bet and the mouse Vγ1 TCR chain, suggesting that distinct γδ T cell subsets may play different roles in tumor control. Functionally, antibody-mediated blockade of the γδ T cell receptor (γδTCR) significantly improved tumor control in ICI-resistant, but not ICI-sensitive, models, implicating γδ T cells in promoting tumor growth. Tumors enriched with immunosuppressive RORγt+ and TCF1+ γδ T cells also exhibited increased B cell infiltration. In B cell-deficient NOD mice, γδ T cells skewed toward T-bet and Vγ1 expression, which correlated with enhanced CD8+ T cell activation. These findings reveal a coordinated immunosuppressive network between γδ T cells and B cells that limits anti-tumor immunity. Given their roles in promoting autoimmunity, these cell types may represent therapeutic targets to boost anti-tumor immunity and overcome ICI resistance without exacerbating irAEs.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are associated with enhanced tumor progression and reduced therapy response rates. Therefore, overcoming the Treg‐mediated immunosuppressive barrier within the tumor to enhance antitumor immune responses is of central interest to advance cancer immunotherapy. To date, no tools exist that can be exploited to dampen Treg function and differentiation in vivo. Here, we show for the first time that the antibiotic thiostrepton exerts a potent inhibitory effect on Tregs. Mechanistically, thiostrepton disrupts Treg differentiation, reduces the expression of Treg activation markers, and inhibits Treg suppressive functions. Accordingly, using an MC38 tumor model, we demonstrate that thiostrepton treatment reduces the number of intratumoral Foxp3+ Treg cells and prevents tumor growth. These effects are conserved in human T cells, as thiostrepton also inhibits the differentiation of human Tregs. Our findings highlight thiostrepton as a promising Treg‐targeting immunomodulatory compound with the potential to enhance antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has transformed the landscape of cancer treatment, offering hope to patients who were once considered beyond the reach of effective care. However, its success is restricted to a limited fraction of patients. This discrepancy in response is largely due to the complex and dynamic nature of the tumor immune-microenvironment. At the heart of this complexity is the concept of cancer immunoediting—a dynamic process through which the immune system both sculpts and is shaped by the tumor. This process unfolds in three key stages: Elimination, Equilibrium, and Escape, each representing a shifting balance between immune defenses and tumor adaptation. Central to this interaction are tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TILs are frontline defenders in targeting tumor cells, while TAMs can either hinder or facilitate tumor growth based on their polarization. As cancer progresses, immune selection pressure induces phenotypic alterations that promote immune evasion, fostering an environment detrimental to effective immune response. This review explores the role of these immunological components in each phase of immunoediting and their impact on the efficacy or failure of immunotherapy. Gaining deeper insight into these interactions is crucial for developing advanced immunotherapies that reshape tumor microenvironment and expand the reach of immunotherapy to more patients.">

        <tr id="Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant clonal proliferative disease originating from hematopoietic stem cells. While treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) effectively eliminates the majority of leukemia cells in patients, residual leukemia cells can still be detected in those achieving deep molecular remission, ultimately leading to drug resistance or relapse. But the exact mechanism is unclear. In recent years, the immune microenvironment has been a hot research topic in hematologic malignancies. CML patients exhibit abnormalities in antitumor immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which possess immune-suppressing functions, inhibit the proliferation and activation of CD4+/CD8+ T cells, Tregs, B cells, and NK cells, and play a central role in the antitumor immune response in a wide range of cancers. Abnormalities in numbers and functions of MDSCs are exhibited in CML patients, which affect the immune status of CML patients through multiple mechanisms. This review summarizes the biological properties of MDSCs, their alterations in CML patients, their roles and specific mechanisms in the development of CML, and how these mechanisms can be leveraged to develop new therapeutic strategies, aiming to provide novel insights and approaches for the treatment of CML.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.">

Microbiota-transformed bile acids act as pivotal signaling molecules. This review systematically dissects how these BAs engage host receptors (e.g., FXR, TGR5, VDR, S1PR2) to influence the differentiation and activity of key innate (macrophages, NK cells, MDSCs, DCs) and adaptive (CD8+ T cells, Tregs, Th1/Th17 cells) immune cell populations within the TIME. We underscore that dysregulation of this microbiota-BA-immune axis, prevalent in gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancers, frequently cultivates a pro-inflammatory, immunosuppressive TIME, thereby facilitating tumor immune evasion and progression. In light of this, we examine emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at reprogramming this axis, including pharmacological BA receptor modulation, microbiota-based interventions (e.g., engineered microbes, FMT, dietary strategies), and their synergistic potential with established cancer treatments like immune checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, this review addresses significant challenges in clinical translation, including inherent axis complexity, inter-individual variability, and methodological hurdles. Future directions highlighted include tackling heterogeneity, employing advanced multi-omics, and developing robust biomarkers for precision immuno-oncology.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Natural killer (NK) cells are pivotal effectors in innate antitumor immunity by mediating cytotoxicity, secreting cytokines, or expressing cell membrane receptors, which facilitate interactions with other immune cells. The cytotoxic activity and immune function of NK cells are governed by dynamic receptor–ligand interactions, cytokine networks, and metabolic–epigenetic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent years, NK cell‐based therapies are emerging as a promising clinical approach for antitumor treatment, owing to their rapid response, unique recognition mechanisms, potent cytotoxic capabilities, and memory‐like characteristics, along with their low risk of posttreatment adverse effects and cost effectiveness. However, immunosuppression and metabolic reprogramming driven by TME subvert NK cell surveillance, impairing its antitumor function. This review comprehensively details molecular mechanisms underpinning NK cell dysfunction, including dysregulated activating/inhibitory receptor signaling, metabolic reprogramming, and epigenetic silencing of effector genes. We further synthesize advances in clinical strategies to restore NK cytotoxicity including ex vivo expansion for adoptive transfer, chimeric antigen receptor‐NK engineering, TME‐remodeling agents, immune checkpoint blockade, cytokine‐based therapies, and NK cell engagers targeting tumor antigens. By bridging mechanistic insights with translational applications, this work provides a framework for rationally designed NK cell‐based immunotherapies to overcome resistance across solid and hematologic malignancies.">

        <tr id="Identifying factors that mediate successful anticancer immune responses is necessary to improve outcomes for patients with advanced cancers. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on mouse melanomas experiencing successful and unsuccessful immune responses and discovered a prominent ferroptosis signature in tumors undergoing immune-mediated regression. Pairing ferroptosis inducers and inhibitors with immunotherapies ex vivo and in vivo highlighted a central role for ferroptosis in stimulating the anti-melanoma immune response. In co-culture models, CD8+ T cells drove melanoma cell ferroptosis by altering the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a crucial antioxidant enzyme known for its role in preventing lipid peroxidation. Direct contact between tumor cells and CD8+ T cells was needed to sustain GPX4 downregulation over time, resulting in ferroptotic cell death. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing data from human melanoma tumors responding to immunotherapy revealed a ferroptosis signature that mirrors the mouse model. Together, these results offer crucial insights into the role of ferroptosis in antitumor immunity and highlight the potential of modulating ferroptosis to enhance immunotherapy responses.">

 Despite recent advances in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) biology and new therapies, this aggressive subtype remains difficult to treat. A key obstacle is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), often dominated by myeloid cells that impair anti-tumor immunity. Radiation therapy (RT), used as an in-situ vaccine, enhances tumor immunogenicity and has shown promise when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in preclinical and clinical settings1-3. We previously found that combining RT with CTLA-4 blockade and a CD40 agonist antibody (CD40a), which activates myeloid cells, led to profound tumor regression and occasional complete responses in a rapidly metastasizing TNBC mouse model4. However, CD40a did not improve control of lung metastases beyond that achieved with RT and CTLA-4 blockade. In tumors, CD40a induced remodeling of dendritic cell and macrophage populations, along with enrichment in B cell–associated gene signatures. As CD40 signaling can promote either effector or regulatory B cell responses depending on context5, we hypothesized that triple therapy induces organ-specific B cell differentiation that may hinder systemic immune control. We first assessed systemic versus local effects of CD40a on B cells in naïve and tumor-bearing (4T1) mice. In both settings, CD40a expanded splenic B cells and increased MHC-II+ expression. In lungs, tumor implantation alone led to increased B cell infiltration, even without CD40a. However, these lung B cells showed reduced activation in untreated tumor-bearing mice, only partially restored by CD40a, suggesting a distinct, potentially immunosuppressive phenotype. To evaluate this in the context of RT + CTLA-4 blockade + CD40a, we analyzed B cells from lungs and tumors via multiparametric flow cytometry and observed that CD40a consistently shifted B cell profiles across compartments. Among B cells, we identified regulatory B cells (Breg) as expressing TIM1, CD138, CD5, CD39, and FasL. CD40a decreased Breg infiltration in tumors but significantly increased it in lungs. In both tissues, Breg marker expression correlated with tumor or lung burden. Given TIM1’s role in IL-10–producing Bregs—and its capacity to suppress T cells independently of IL-10—6-8 we tested a TIM1-blocking antibody in combination with RT + CTLA-4 blockade + CD40a. While TIM1 blockade did not enhance tumor control, it markedly reduced lung Bregs. Our data highlight organ-specific B cell responses following CD40a-based immunotherapy and suggest that lung-resident Bregs may limit systemic immune efficacy. Ongoing work focuses on defining mechanisms of Breg-mediated suppression and, in collaboration with bioengineers, on developing intra-tumoral delivery strategies to reduce systemic immunosuppressive effects of agents like CD40a. 1-PMID: 29180535 2-PMID: 33476307 3-PMID: 30397353 4-PMID: 37620372 5-PMID: 19265127 6-PMID: 25582854 7-PMID: 31511630 8-PMID: 31685302

        <tr id="Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) in brain tumors contain two types of macrophages: tumor‐associated microglia and infiltrating macrophages. This study explored whether these two populations have the same role in brain tumor progression. In an in vitro coculture model using the astrocytoma cells ALTS1C1 with either the microglial cell line BV2 or the peripheral macrophage cell line RAW264.7, only BV2, not RAW264.7, gathers ALTS1C1 into tumor cell clusters. These BV2‐associated clusters limited ALTS1C1 proliferation but not BV2 cell growth. The in vivo studies show that the survival time of mice co‐inoculated with ALTS1C1 and BV2 was prolonged from 30.4 ± 3.1 days to more than 77 days in immune‐competent mice but not in immune‐compromised mice. Examining the tumor microenvironment (TME) by immunohistochemical staining revealed that the co‐inoculation of BV2 increased the CD8 T cells' infiltration and the expression of Granzyme B. Mice bearing with BV2‐containing ALTS1C1 tumor exhibited a reduced level of circulating myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and an elevated level of CD8 T cells in peripheral blood compared to the ALTS1C1 tumor‐bearing group. This study suggests tumor‐associated microglia restrict brain tumor development by limiting tumor cell proliferation and inducing T‐cell‐associated antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Background The programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1 or PD-1) is a key regulatory immune checkpoint and a major target for therapeutic intervention. In oncology, antibodies blocking the PD-1 pathway are used to activate immune cells to promote anti tumour immunity while in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, PD-1 agonist molecules have the potential to achieve immune suppression. NK cells are a specialised population of innate lymphocytes able to recognize a large range of distressed cells including damaged tissues in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Of note, NK cells can upregulate PD-1 expression upon activation and their effector functions can be modulated by the PD-1 signalling pathway. Methods We have generated a novel bispecific inhibitory molecule, comprised of a targeting domain highly specific for a pre-pro-insulin peptide presented by the HLA-A*02 molecules on the cell surface of pancreatic β-cells and a PD-1 agonist effector domain. Suppressive effects of the β-cell tethered bispecific PD-1 agonist molecule on NK cells and NK92-PD-1 cell line activation were assessed through gene expression, cell surface expression of the CD107a degranulation marker, intracellular IFNγ production and Granzyme B secretion. EndoC-b cells proliferation and insulin production were also measured. Results We observed that the bispecific PD-1 agonist molecules tethered to pancreatic b-cells accumulate at the immunological synapse, modify NK cell gene expression and decrease their inflammatory and cytotoxic functions.

        <tr id="Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) has been implicated in multiple inflammatory diseases by regulating pro-inflammatory mediators or altering immune cell polarization. However, the expression and direct functional role of CB1 in T cells remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that primary murine T cells express CB1 and that its novel agonist, BI-5756, directly increases the frequencies of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in primary murine pan T cells after activation. In addition, BI-5756 exhibits an in vivo protective effect against graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), an allogeneic T cell-mediated inflammatory complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), resulting in an improved overall survival with enhanced platelet recovery and reconstitution of bone marrow-derived B and T cells. BI-5756 also directly suppresses tumor cell growth and upregulates MHC I, MHC II, and CD80 on tumor cells, which may subsequently enhance T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses in mixed lymphocyte reaction with A20 cells. The ability of BI-5756 to increase Tregs was significantly abrogated by rimonabant, a potent and selective CB1 antagonist, suggesting that the immunomodulatory effect of BI-5756 is mediated via CB1. In summary, BI-5756, a potent CB1 agonist, increases Tregs while preserving anti-tumor responses in vitro and effectively reduces GvHD in vivo.">

 Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) is a cutting-edge treatment strategy modulating T cell activity and has emerged at the forefront of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) management, yet most patients do not durably respond. Studies have shown that innate immune cells could create an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) thus, resulting in resistance to ICB. Therefore, to design an effective therapeutic strategy, it is imperative to consider the diverse immune cells and their complex interactome. In noncancerous conditions, pro-inflammatory neutrophils release extracellular traps or NETs that interfere with monocyte differentiation to macrophages. However, their interaction and its effect in mediating immune evasion in NSCLCs is poorly understood.



 To study the role of neutrophils in macrophage behaviour, freshly isolated monocytes were differentiated into pro-tumorigenic M2-like macrophages and polarized with or without NETs. These NETs-educated macrophages (NeMacs) were phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry. Functionally, their role in the TME was investigated using a Tumor-Immune-Microenvironment on-chip (TIMEoC) platform. Here, immune cells such as donor matched T cells or neutropils were loaded into a microfluidic channel magnetically attached to active NSCLC spheroids embedded in a collagenous matrix containing NeMacs. T-cell or neutrophil migration and tumor cytotoxicity in the presence of NeMacs were monitored on TIMEoC.



 In the presence of NETs, macrophages presented an immunosuppresive phenotype with significantly reduced expression of CD80, a key co-stimulatory receptor for T cell activation. NeMacs recruited significantly more neutrophils to the tumor than M2-like macrophages. In contrast, NeMacs retarded activated CD8+ T cell migration to the TME and significantly impacted their cytotoxic abilities observed by caspase 3/7 expression. The presence of NeMacs also affected ICB efficacy in vitro.



 Therefore, NETs could reprogram macrophages to create an immune-suppressive TME. This study was able to unveil previously unexplored relationship between NETs and macrophages in NSCLCs which could help identify prospective targets that could augment the current standard of care.

        <tr id="Meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) in humans and pigs is an acute nervous disorder associated with serious sequelae. Bacterial meningitis is tightly associated with immune cell responses and the local immune microenvironment. However, the dynamic changes of the immune system during the disease progression in the brain remains unclear. Here, single-cell mass cytometry analyses are used to comprehensively profile the composition and phenotypes of female mouse brain immune cells at different stages of SS2 meningitis. Ten major immune cell lineages are identified among which T cells and dendritic cells significantly increased during meningitis, with B cells increasing in the late stage. Specifically, SS2+PD-L1+ neutrophils with strong phagocytosis, bactericidal and apoptotic effects accumulate in the acute phase of SS2 infection. Microglia sequentially display the features of homeostasis, proliferation, and activation (enhanced MHCII and TLR2 signals and TNF-α secretion) during the process of meningitis. Both border-associated and monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the process of SS2-induced meningitis, exhibiting upregulation of CD38 and MHCII. Interestingly, CD11c+CD8+T cells are the main contributor of IFN-γ and specifically appeared during SS2 infection. In addition, the appearance of other lymphocytes such as CCR6+/lo B cells, CX3CR1+ NK and MHCII+ ILC3 are related to the progression of meningitis. Moreover, correlation analysis between the composition of immune cell clusters and the SS2 infection process yield a dynamic immune landscape in which key immune clusters, including some previously unidentified, mark different stages of infection. Together, these data reveal the unique infection-stage immune microenvironment during the progression of meningitis caused by SS2 and provide resources for the analysis of immunological pathogenesis, potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for bacterial meningitis.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is defined by a myeloid-enriched microenvironment and has shown remarkable resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (e.g., PD-1 and CTLA-4). Here, we sought to define the role of myeloid immunosuppression in immune resistance in PDA. We report that depletion of CSF1R+ myeloid cells in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy triggers T cell infiltration into PDA but causes compensatory remodeling of the myeloid compartment with limited tumor control. Unexpectedly, combined therapy against multiple myeloid targets including CSF1R, CCR2/5 and CXCR2 was insufficient to overcome treatment resistance. High-dimensional single cell analyses performed on T cell infiltrates in human and mouse PDA revealed upregulation of multiple immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4. Combinatorial blockade of PD-1, LAG-3, and CTLA-4 along with chemotherapy and anti-CSF1R was necessary to trigger activation of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and led to deep, durable, and complete tumor responses, with each immune checkpoint blockade agent contributing to efficacy. Our findings indicate that a comprehensive approach targeting both negative regulatory signals controlling T cell function and the myeloid compartment will be fundamental to unveiling the potential of immunotherapy in PDA.">

        <tr id="B lymphocytes play a critical role in the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome (NS). This comprehensive review explores the phenotypic characteristics, pathogenic mechanisms, and clinical translational value of B cell subsets in different types of nephrotic syndrome. Studies demonstrate that B cells participate in disease development through multiple mechanisms, including autoantibody production, T cell function regulation, and cytokine secretion. In minimal change disease, B cell-mediated immune dysregulation is primarily characterized by decreased CD19+ cells and increased plasmablasts. Membranous nephropathy patients exhibit increased naïve B cells and decreased memory B cells, while focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is characterized by elevated class-switched memory B cells. These B cell subset alterations can serve as biomarkers for disease activity assessment and prognosis prediction. B cell-targeted therapies, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, have demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy in nephrotic syndrome, further confirming the pivotal role of B cells in its pathogenesis. Different pathological types of NS show significant differences in B cell subset changes, pathogenic mechanisms, and therapeutic responses. Primary and secondary nephrotic syndrome exhibit important distinctions in B cell activation mechanisms, subset imbalance patterns, degree of renal tissue infiltration, and autoantibody profiles. Age factors significantly influence B cell development, function, and therapeutic response, with notable differences between pediatric and adult patients in B cell subset distribution, treatment efficacy, and pharmacokinetics. With the application of emerging technologies such as single-cell sequencing, in-depth analysis of B cell subset characteristics and their interactions with other immune cells will provide new insights for developing more precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, current methodological heterogeneity challenges in research, including patient population differences, inconsistent B cell subset definitions, technical platform variations, and non-uniform clinical assessment criteria, limit the comparability of research results and clinical applications. Future efforts need to establish standardized B cell monitoring protocols and precision diagnostic systems, develop next-generation B cell-targeted therapeutic strategies, and deeply explore age-specific mechanisms and systems biology research to achieve precision medicine in nephrotic syndrome.">

        <tr id="Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains a formidable malignancy with persistently poor clinical outcomes. Recent research has underscored the pivotal role of the innate immune system, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a key component of the myeloid lineage, in orchestrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and shaping disease progression. As professional phagocytes of the innate immune system, macrophages not only mediate pathogen recognition and inflammatory responses but also undergo functional polarization in response to local cues. In OSCC, dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, marked by the overrepresentation of species such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis—acts as a chronic inflammatory trigger that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune evasion, and tumor growth. These pathogenic bacteria actively engage innate immune signaling pathways such as TLRs and CSF-1R, skewing macrophages toward an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. M2-like TAMs then contribute to tumor progression by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), promoting angiogenesis, and expressing immune checkpoint ligands such as PD-L1. This review summarizes current knowledge on the bidirectional crosstalk between dysbiotic microbiota and innate immune macrophages in OSCC, highlighting key receptor-mediated pathways and their implications for immune suppression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Targeting microbiota modulation or innate immune reprogramming represents a promising strategy for restoring anti-tumor immunity and enhancing therapeutic efficacy in OSCC.">

        <tr id="Glioblastomas are the most prevalent and malignant primary cancers in the brain. Given the promising prospects of immunotherapeutic approaches, there is increasing interest in obtaining precise knowledge of the immunologic status of the tumour microenvironment for each individual. We explored the feasibility of inferring this tumour immune component in a minimally invasive manner prior to any clinical intervention, taking advantage of the preoperative immune cell counts that can be easily obtained from the clinical records of the patients. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is the most extensive measure calculated from complete counts of peripheral blood. Despite there was an increase in the NLR in high grade tumours of our cohorts of study, we did not find evidence of any correlation between the NLR and different degrees of tumour immune infiltration in glioblastoma. The same negative result was obtained with the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR). In addition, glioblastomas associated with extreme values of peripheral NLR did not exhibit substantial gene expression differences that could be linked to distinct tumourigenic properties. Overall, these results suggest that peripheral immune cell ratios cannot be used to reliably infer the immune microenvironment within the tumour, underscoring the complexity of using peripheral markers to assess local tumour immunity.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Understanding age-associated differences in acute and memory adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and how this contributes to more favorable outcomes in children is critically important.


METHODS
We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell, B cell, and antibody responses in 329 peripheral blood samples collected from non-hospitalized children, adolescents, and adults at three timepoints, including acute and memory timepoints.


RESULTS
Most children produced robust CD4+ T cell responses during infection and developed memory CD4+ T cells; however, young children <4 years old often had undetectable CD4+ T cell responses compared to older children and adults. Young children also generated reduced frequencies of memory B cells; despite this, they mounted substantial and durable neutralizing antibody responses. CD4+ T cell responses in children were biased towards non-spike epitopes, especially in asymptomatic cases. Memory B cells in children were preferentially classical memory or, paradoxically, CXCR3+.


CONCLUSION
These findings support the concept that the kinetics and composition of T and B cell responses shift across age groups and may be associated with milder COVID-19 outcomes in children.">

This review consolidates current knowledge on how environmental factors, tumor-derived signals, and intrinsic metabolic pathways collectively regulate DC development, subset differentiation, and functional adaptability. Acetyl-CoA emerges as a dual-function metabolite, serving not only as an energy carrier but also as an epigenetic regulator that controls DC fate via lipid biosynthesis, mitochondrial metabolism, and chromatin modification. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), DCs may experience immune suppression polarization and insufficient T cell activation due to disrupted acetyl-CoA related metabolic pathways. While existing DC-based therapies remain constrained by TME-induced metabolic limitations, emerging approaches that restore acetyl-CoA related metabolic pathways balance show enhanced antitumor efficacy. The review further examines distinct metabolic adaptations among DC subsets and their relevance to autoimmune diseases, infectious immunity, and transplant outcomes. By integrating current research on targeting DC metabolic targets, we outline strategies for developing immunotherapies that target DC metabolic flexibility. Remaining hurdles include tailoring interventions to specific subsets, refining metabolic manipulation techniques, and addressing TME heterogeneity through combination therapies. These findings position acetyl-CoA as a key therapeutic target for recalibrating immunometabolism circuits, with significant implications for DC-focused cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with limited responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies in most patients. Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a crucial role in immunotherapy outcomes. Among various metabolic abnormalities in the TIME, dysregulated lipid metabolism has emerged as a critical determinant of immune cell fate, differentiation, and function. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the current understanding of the immune landscape in GC, focusing on how altered lipid metabolism reshapes immune cell populations—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. We highlight key metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation(FAO), cholesterol homeostasis, and lipid uptake that impact immune cell activity, contributing to immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Importantly, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting lipid metabolism, including inhibitors of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and discuss their synergistic potential when combined with ICB therapies. In conclusion, lipid metabolic reprogramming represents a promising yet underexplored axis in modulating antitumor immunity in GC. Integrating metabolic intervention with immunotherapy holds potential to overcome current treatment limitations and improve clinical outcomes. Future studies incorporating spatial omics and single-cell profiling will be essential to elucidate cell-type specific metabolic dependencies and foster translational breakthroughs.">

        <tr id="Tumor antigen–escape variants undermine immunotherapy by subverting lymphocyte effector functions and reshaping tumor–immune dynamics. It is essential to delineate functional interplay within immune networks during tumor progression. We investigated whether homeostatic crosstalk between CD8+T cells and natural killer (NK) cells preempts tumor antigen–escape. Adoptive CD8+T cell transfers were administered before (D–7, homeostatic pre-priming) or after (D+1) tumor establishment in Rag1−/− and Rag1−/−γc−/− mice. Antigen presentation, immune activation, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and memory were quantified by flow cytometry, live bioluminescence and confocal imaging. Monoculture, co-culture, and a 3D silica nanofiber carpet mimicking basement-membrane-like topography modeled intercellular interactions. Signaling arrays and motion metrics (Speed-Distance Index, deceleration) were conducted. Human ligand–receptor pairs engaged in CD8+T–NK crosstalk were probed in silico.Pre-tumor D–7 CD8+T cell transfer completely suppressed antigen–escape tumors with NK cells as major effectors showing elevated CD25, CD69, CD107a, and GzmB, marking activated and effector phenotype, and promoting central-memory CD62L⁺CD44⁺CD8⁺TCM precursors. By contrast, post-tumor D+1–transferred CD8+T cells allowed emergence of tumor variants resistant to antigen-specific cytolysis as assessed on day 25, despite those T cells retaining higher intrinsic cytotoxic capacity than the D–7 T cell cohort. Mechanistically, CD8+T and NK cells formed stable contacts through pseudopodial intercellular nanotubes enabling bidirectional membrane exchange and signaling via STAT, Akt, and mTOR pathways, augmenting NK effector function and promoting CD8+TCM differentiation. In silico analysis identified human ligand–receptor pairs engaged in CD8+T–NK adhesion, stimulatory and regulatory axes, including CD200–CD200R, PD-L1–PD-1, and CD18/CD11a–DNAM-1 (CD226). Together, data support a three-phase model of preemptive immunosurveillance initiated by early CD8⁺T–NK crosstalk.Homeostatic conditioning and effector cooperativity between CD8+T and NK cells protect against tumor immune escape. The findings uncover a mechanistic axis of preemptive immunosurveillance that lays the foundation for next-generation preventive immunotherapies to control antigen–escape tumors.">

However, a comprehensive review that highlights recent progress and consolidates past knowledge is still lacking. In this study, we delineated the pre- and postsynaptic structures constituting the IS between T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages. We also detail the specific signaling mechanisms and pathways that modulate the formation and disassembly of the IS, including cytoskeletal remodeling, membrane reshaping, integrin signaling, and force transduction. Following these experimental findings, we systematically review the central roles of IS in maintaining homeostasis and health and outline various diseases arising from IS disorders. Finally, we thoroughly explore targets and treatments related to IS on the basis of preclinical evidence and clinical trials, with the aim of providing further investigatory and therapeutic insights for researchers and clinicians.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, whose progression is intimately linked to the complex dynamics of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Exosomes, once considered mere cellular waste, have emerged as pivotal mediators of intercellular communication within the TME, actively participating in the multistep development of HCC. These nanoscale vesicles play crucial roles in the initiation of precancerous lesions and, by transporting drug resistance-related molecules such as proteins and non-coding RNAs, facilitate the acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapies by tumor cells. Moreover, exosomes contribute to the establishment of pre-metastatic niches by remodeling distant organ microenvironments—inducing hypoxia, metabolic reprogramming, and angiogenesis—which collectively create favorable conditions for tumor cell colonization. They also modulate immune responses by inducing T-cell exhaustion, promoting macrophage polarization, and disrupting normal stromal cell functions, thereby constructing an immunosuppressive microenvironment that enables tumor immune evasion. Given their inherent biocompatibility and targeting capabilities, engineered exosomes have shown promise in cancer therapy, serving as carriers for therapeutic molecules and enabling precise drug delivery through surface modifications. Despite significant advancements, challenges remain in elucidating the in vivo regulatory mechanisms of exosomes, standardizing their isolation and purification processes, and evaluating their clinical efficacy. This review examines the multifaceted roles of exosomes in HCC, aiming to bridge mechanistic insights with precision diagnostics and pave new avenues for liver cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are DNA-protein structures released during a form of programmed neutrophil death known as NETosis. While NETs have been implicated in both tumor inhibition and promotion, their functional role in cancer remains ambiguous. In this study, we compared the NET-forming capacity and functional effects of NETs derived from lung cancer (LC) patients and healthy donors (H). Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood and stimulated in vitro with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce NETosis. Isolated NETs were quantified and assessed for their cytotoxicity against A549 lung cancer cells and their impact on cancer cell migration. Whereas LC neutrophils (LCN) were less cytotoxic to tumor cells than H neutrophils (HN), their NETs maintained similar tumoricidal capacity – 41.6% ± 25.3% (LCN) vs. 46.4% ± 14.5% (HN), ns. Interestingly, we noted a correlation between the amount of NETs and their cytotoxicity to tumor cells. This effect could not be recapitulated with purified genomic DNA, inducing only 3.99% of cytotoxicity to tumor cells, and confirming that intact NETs are required for the anti-tumor activity. LCN displayed an increased frequency of NETosis following PMA stimulation, yet produced significantly fewer NETs per cell – 1569 ± 306 ng (LCN) vs. 2619 ± 313 ng (HN); p = 0.025. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was elevated in LC neutrophils, indicating that the NETosis defect was not due to impaired oxidative burst. LCN had increased expression of immunosuppression (PDL-1) as well as exhaustion and aging markers CD62L and CD11b). Only NETs from HN inhibited the migration of A549 tumor cells, whereas those from LCN failed to suppress, and in some cases appeared to enhance, cell motility. Our data suggest that NETs in lung cancer retain anti-tumor cytotoxicity capabilities but lose their anti-migratory capacity, highlighting their dual role in tumor biology and potential as therapeutic targets.">

This molecular profile limits the effectiveness of targeted therapies, leaving chemotherapy as the mainstay of treatment a strategy often met with limited success due to rapid disease progression and high recurrence rates. Increasing evidence underscores the pivotal role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in driving TNBC pathogenesis, particularly through chronic inflammation and cytokine dysregulation. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-10 orchestrate a complex network of cellular interactions that remodel the TME into an immunosuppressive niche. This inflammatory landscape not only promotes tumor cell proliferation and metastasis but also compromises antitumor immune responses and contributes to therapeutic resistance. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have explored the therapeutic potential of targeting cytokine signaling to disrupt this inflammatory axis and overcome resistance. In this review, we critically examine the multifaceted interplay between cytokines, inflammation, and the TME in TNBC, with a focus on mechanisms of resistance. We further evaluate current and emerging therapeutic approaches targeting the inflammatory axis, highlighting both the promise and the complexities of this evolving landscape.">

        <tr id="A major goal in regenerative medicine is restoring damaged tissues through cell replacement or by activating endogenous repair pathways. Immune modulation is increasingly recognized as essential for creating a permissive environment for regeneration. Bioactive factors secreted by stem and stromal cells -either as soluble molecules or within extracellular vesicles (EVs)- can reshape immune responses, not just by reducing inflammation but by actively promoting pro-resolving, regenerative profiles. For nearly two decades, our research has focused on the therapeutic potential of human term placenta-derived cells, particularly mesenchymal stromal cells from the amniotic membrane (hAMSC). We have shown that hAMSC and their secretome (CM-hAMSC) exert potent immunomodulatory effects in vitro: suppressing T- and B-cell proliferation, downregulating proinflammatory Th1/Th17 phenotypes, enhancing regulatory T cells, and inhibiting naïve CD8 T cell polarization into memory subsets. They also reduce B-cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells and steer monocytes away from dendritic cells and M1 macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. These effects have translated into therapeutic benefits in numerous preclinical models of inflammation-driven disease (including lung/liver fibrosis, sepsis, IBD, cardiac ischemia, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and traumatic brain injury) by tempering inflammation and promoting resolution. Ongoing studies aim to dissect the mechanisms driving these effects, especially whether they are mediated by soluble molecules, EVs, or both. A key area of interest is their ability to modulate the inflammasome pathway, a central driver of innate immunity linked to aging and degeneration. By regulating this pathway, placental factors may redirect chronic inflammation toward regeneration. Given inflammation’s dual role as trigger and barrier in many degenerative conditions, placental cells -especially those from the amniotic membrane- emerge as a powerful paradigm. This lecture will explore how their unique immunological properties can inspire innovative regenerative strategies.">

However, cellular product persistence can be limiting with short functional duration of activity contributing to disease relapse. A variety of manufacturing protocols are used to generate therapeutic engineered T-cells; these differ in techniques used for T-cell isolation, activation, genetic modification, and other methodology. We sought to determine how preselection affected the phenotype of T cells engineered to secrete a CD123xCD3 bispecific engager (ENG-T). These cells were designed to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We evaluated the effect of T-cell selection on transduction efficiency, T-cell activation, short- and long-term anti-AML cytotoxicity, and gene transcription. Unselected, CD4, CD8, and CD4/CD8 pre-selected ENG-T cells have minor differences in T-cell subset components, equivalent activation, and equal cytotoxicity in short-term assays. While unselected and CD4/CD8-selected ENG-T cells have identical CD4:CD8 composition prior to target cell exposure, serial stimulation in vitro showed CD4/CD8 pre-selection supports ENG-T cell survival and long-term activity. Likewise, CD4 and CD4/CD8 pre-selected ENG-T cells display superior anti-tumor efficacy and prolong murine survival in AML xenografts. Unselected ENG-T cells are exposed to cytokines during early manufacture that imprint upregulation of intracellular inflammatory pathways. This early activation likely underpins long-term observed functional differences. Pre-selection of T cells from banked patient biospecimens decreased blast contamination, exposure to inflammatory cytokines, and may improve T-cell expansion during manufacture. Pre-selection of T-cell products should continue to be performed to enhance the quality of clinical cellular therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous condition, arising from a disrupted immune response to infection that can progress to organ failure and carries a high risk of death. In recent years, growing attention has been paid to the role of epigenetic mechanisms—including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and RNA methylation—in shaping immune activity during sepsis. These processes affect immune functions such as macrophage polarization, cytokine release, and the exhaustion of immune cells, and they help explain the shift from an initial phase of overwhelming inflammation to a later state of immune suppression. Epigenetic alterations also contribute to tissue-specific damage, notably in the lungs, kidneys, and heart, and have been linked to disease severity and clinical prognosis. Advances in transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling have made it possible to distinguish molecular subtypes of septic patients, each with distinct immune features and varied responses to treatments such as corticosteroids and metabolic therapies.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and fatal primary brain malignancy in adults, and therapeutic gains have been modest despite multimodal standard care. Immunotherapy offers a promising alternative, yet its performance in GBM is constrained by a profoundly immunosuppressive neuro-immune micro-environment, the physical and functional barriers of the blood–brain interface, and adaptative resistance pathways. In this review we summarise recent progress in myeloid-reprogramming agents, immune-checkpoint modulation, adoptive cellular therapies and device-enabled delivery platforms that seek to revitalise anti-tumour surveillance within the central nervous system. We also discuss enduring challenges—including intratumoural spatial heterogeneity, limited effector lymphocyte trafficking and the scarcity of robust predictive biomarkers—that temper durable responses. By thoughtfully integrating immunologic approaches with radiotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, metabolic modifiers and focussed-ultrasound-mediated blood–brain-barrier disruption, emerging strategies aspire to enhance immune infiltration, bolster antigen presentation and overcome region-specific barriers. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of precision immunotherapy for GBM, offering perspective on future directions and avenues for clinical translation. We hope these insights will assist researchers and clinicians as they endeavour to develop more effective and individualised treatment regimens for patients confronted with this formidable disease.">

        <tr id="Immune organoids have emerged as a ground-breaking platform in immunology, offering a physiologically relevant and controllable environment to model human immune responses and evaluate immunotherapeutic strategies. Derived from stem cells or primary tissues, these three-dimensional constructs recapitulate key aspects of lymphoid tissue architecture, cellular diversity, and functional dynamics, providing a more accurate alternative to traditional two-dimensional cultures and animal models. Their ability to mimic complex immune microenvironments has positioned immune organoids at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy development, autoimmune disease modeling, and personalized medicine. This narrative review highlights the advances in immune organoid technology, with a focus on their applications in testing immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, and cancer vaccines. It also explores how immune organoids facilitate the study of autoimmune disease pathogenesis with insights into their molecular basis and support in high-throughput drug screening. Despite their transformative potential, immune organoids face significant challenges, including the replication of systemic immune interactions, standardization of fabrication protocols, scalability limitations, biological heterogeneity, and the absence of vascularization, which restricts organoid size and maturation. Future directions emphasize the integration of immune organoids with multi-organ systems to better replicate systemic physiology, the development of advanced biomaterials that closely mimic lymphoid extracellular matrices, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize organoid production and data analysis, and the rigorous clinical validation of organoid-derived findings. Continued innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential to overcome existing barriers, enabling the widespread adoption of immune organoids as indispensable tools for advancing immunotherapy, vaccine development, and precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are a specialised subset of immune cells that remain within tissues, playing a vital role in localised immune defence and long-term immunity. Unlike circulating memory T cells, TRM cells do not recirculate to provide rapid and effective responses against previously encountered pathogens at the tissue level. The formation of TRM cells is driven by tissue-specific cues, guiding their differentiation and retention within organs such as the skin, lungs and gut. They are characterised by the expression of unique markers, including CD69 and CD103, which facilitate their retention and longevity in tissues. TRM cells are essential for immune surveillance, effectively detecting and responding to different infections and contributing to tumour suppression. However, TRM cells are also implicated in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, where persistent activation by resident and autoantigens can lead to tissue damage. This pathogenic role is evident in chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, vitiligo and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where TRM cells may drive persistent localised inflammation and contribute to disease progression and severity. Emerging therapeutic strategies seek to modulate TRM cells to balance their protective and pathogenic roles in these inflammatory diseases. Approaches such as checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine modulation and cell-depletion therapies aim to enhance TRM cells' beneficial immune functions while minimising their role in autoimmunity. A deeper understanding of TRM cell development, maintenance and functional diversity is critical for advancing treatments for infectious diseases, chronic inflammation, autoimmune conditions and cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Metabolic adaptations can sustain the pro-neoplastic functions exerted by macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), aggressive and incurable sarcomas that develop either sporadically or in the context of the genetic syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 1, are highly infiltrated by macrophages, whose contribution to MPNST growth remains poorly characterized. Here, we analyze the role played by the molecular chaperone TRAP1, a regulator of mitochondrial metabolic pathways, in shaping the pro-tumoral activity of macrophages associated to MPNST cells. Methods We have studied the phenotypic changes elicited by a MPNST cell-conditioned medium in macrophages with or without TRAP1, and their subsequent ability to support MPNST cell growth and migration and endothelial cell angiogenesis. Results The presence of TRAP1 is required in both naive and M2-like macrophages for eliciting phenotypic changes that lead to the acquisition of pro-neoplastic features. TRAP1-expressing macrophages become able to sustain MPNST cell growth and migration and to exert pro-angiogenic properties on endothelial cells through accumulation of the metabolite succinate and the ensuing activation of a HIF-1α-dependent transcriptional program. Conclusions Our data provide evidence of a molecular crosstalk between MPNST cellular components, in which soluble factors released by cancer cells drive phenotypic changes in macrophages that in turn enhance pro-tumoral biological routines in both MPNST and endothelial cells. TRAP1-dependent metabolic rewiring in macrophages is mandatory for sustaining this interplay, as a TRAP1-succinate-HIF-1α signaling axis orchestrates their acquisition of tumor-promoting features.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immune dysfunction in liver disease contributes to significant morbidities, depending on liver damage severity and aetiology. We previously reported long‐lasting generalized CD8 T cell hyperfunction in chronic HCV infection with advanced fibrosis, yet its separation from viral and fibrosis‐driven effects, as well as clinical outcomes of advanced fibrosis, remains unclear. In a murine model of carbon tetrachloride‐induced progressive liver fibrosis, advanced fibrosis was observed by 12 weeks, with pathologies similar to those of human chronic HCV infection. Blood‐circulating CD8 T cells showed IFN‐γ and granzyme B (GrB) hyperfunction in response to anti‐CD3/28 stimulation, as well as impaired responses to ectopic tumour challenge and anti‐PD‐1/CTLA‐4 immunotherapy. Hyperfunction and impaired tumour responses were retained despite liver insult cessation. In a 45% HFD model, which induced steatosis and minimal fibrosis, IFN‐γ and GrB hyperfunction was also observed in blood‐circulating CD8 T cells. This study highlights a prolonged systemic CD8 T cell dysfunction acquired during progressive liver disease, associated with impaired antitumour and immunotherapy responses. These mirror the bulk CD8 T cell dysfunction observed in advanced liver diseases in humans, suggesting that these models could be valuable for future mechanistic studies aimed at identifying targets to help improve clinical outcomes in chronic liver disease.">

 CD8 T cells are effector cells of the adaptive immune system responsible for mediating protective immune responses in cancer. However, CD8 T cells can also be critical drivers of pathologic responses including autoimmunity. A key feature of these cells is that they must infiltrate tissues to execute their primary function of cell killing. It is well established that naive T cell responses do not originate in these tissues. Rather, prior to antigen-driven activation, naïve T cells are restricted to lymph nodes, spleen, and blood. T cell activation by cognate antigen drives expression of multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors, including programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and/or cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), as well as migration to nonlymphoid tissues. Work over the last two decades has harnessed T cell effector activities by blocking PD-1 and/or CTLA-4, which has revolutionized cancer care and demonstrated remarkable efficacy in diverse cancer types. However, many patients do not respond to checkpoint blockade therapy, and worse, other patients develop autoimmune-like immune-related adverse events (irAEs), limiting the utility of this approach. To maximize the therapeutic benefit of checkpoint blockade without accelerated irAE development, targeted approaches are needed to increase recruitment of protective CD8 T cells to tumors while preventing pathogenic T cell entry into sensitive tissues. However, an inability to granularly measure recruitment into non-lymphoid tissues has created a significant gap in knowledge in: 1) how checkpoint inhibitors impact T cell entry rates into tissues, 2) whether these entry rates are different for tumors and lesional irAE tissues, 3) where recruited cells localize, and 4) the precise functional contributions of recruited versus resident T cells in driving tumor regression or autoimmunity. To fill this gap in knowledge, we are utilizing an intravenous antibody labeling approach to mark CD8 T cells in the blood prior to entry into tissues, an approach which enables a 72-hour window to track tissue entry. Using this approach in the preclinical setting, we are interrogating how PD-1 inhibitors impact CD8 T cell recruitment to tumors as well as the pancreas in the context of Type 1 Diabetes. In our tumor studies, we have found that PD-1 inhibitors induce an increase in the number of recently recruited CD8 T cells, and that these recruited T cells have a less exhausted phenotype than the T cells that have been in the tumor for longer. In our diabetes studies, we have found that PD-1 inhibitors impact CD8 T cells both in the periphery and the pancreas, and in some mice cause an increase in migration to the pancreas. These studies support a model where peripheral CD8 T cell recruitment can positively contribute to productive anti-tumor immunity but can also exacerbate autoimmunity. Thus, our studies emphasize the doubled-edged nature of T cell recruitment, and our future studies will examine ways to both improve recruitment to tumors and mitigate recruitment to lesional irAE tissues.

        <tr id="Cellular immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in oncology, revolutionizing cancer treatment paradigms. Since the groundbreaking development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Yamanaka in 2008, significant progress has been made in generating various iPSCs-derived immunocytes, including T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells. These engineered immune cells offer unprecedented opportunities for personalized cancer therapy as they can be derived from patients’ own cells to minimize immune rejection. In addition, various new techniques are being used for the induction and amplification of iPSCs-derived immunocytes, such as small-molecule techniques, 3D culture systems, nanotechnology, and animal models for the in vivo amplification of immunocytes. Of course, challenges remain in improving immunocyte characteristics. Targeting efficiency needs enhancement to better distinguish tumor cells from healthy tissue, while biological activity must be optimized for sustained antitumor effects. Safety concerns, particularly regarding potential off-target effects and cytokine release syndrome, require further investigation. The immunosuppressive nature of tumor microenvironment also poses significant hurdles for solid tumor treatment. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring the therapeutic potential of iPSCs-derived immunocytes, with researchers investigating combination therapies and genetic modifications to overcome current limitations.">

        <tr id=": Nowadays, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), featuring clinical manifestation of fever with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and multiple organ function impairment, has been paid more and more attention. It has become the pandemic for a few years and a quantity of people died of it. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection may lead to the development of SFTS, which is characterized by decreased counts of lymphocyte subsets, especially T cells, B cells and natural killer cells, and disruptive release of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. However, the deeper mechanism of this disease remains unidentified. To excavate the mechanisms of lymphopenia in SFTSV infection and to introduce the potential therapeutics, this paper focuses on lymphopenia as well as reviews the mechanisms and effects of lymphopenia caused by SFTSV infection, mainly through making analogies with other similar viruses to explain the details of programmed cell death. Other factors such as IL-6,IL-10, TNF-α and some vital immunocytes also play significant roles in eliciting lymphopenia. Eventually, the probable clinical implications have been discussed, mentioning that lymphopenia induced by multiple pathways in SFTSV infection may be associated with the severity of viral disease and opportunistic infection.">

In prior work, analysis of the tumor microenvironment 24 h after therapy completion indicated therapy-induced immune activation. Here, we analyzed systemic immune responses at varying timepoints during treatment to further elucidate the immune-stimulating effects of the therapy. Moreover, we analyzed end-stage tumors to gain insight in potential mechanisms of therapy resistance. Single domain antibody 4AH29 that binds hFAP was labeled with 131I or 225Ac, generating [131I]I-GMIB-4AH29 and [225Ac]Ac-DOTA-4AH29, respectively. These were used to treat C57BL/6 mice bearing subcutaneous TC-1-hFAP tumors. Blood analysis was conducted using flow cytometry, while tumor characterization was performed using flow cytometry and RNA sequencing. Given the distinct properties and doses of both radiopharmaceuticals, no head-to-head comparison was performed. Both treatments activated inflammatory responses in the tumor. Increased PD-1 expression on CD8+ T-cells was observed following both treatments in the tumor and periphery. In the tumor, [131I]I-GMIB-4AH29 therapy uniquely induced the expression of genes involved in tumor cell replication, TNF-α, IL-6/STAT3, IL-2/STAT5 and complement pathways, while in the blood [131I]I-GMIB-4AH29 therapy upregulated SIRPα on monocytes and TIGIT on NK cells, and downregulated CD86 expression on monocytes. Longitudinal blood immune cell analysis showed changes in composition and phenotype early in therapy, e.g. in effector and regulatory T-cells. Overall, this study corroborates the immune sensitizing capacity of α- and β−-emitting radionuclides, triggering a variety of inflammatory effector responses.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for maintaining immune balance by controlling the activation and expansion of other immune cells. Conventional suppression assays often rely on co-culturing purified cell populations, which limits multiplexed phenotyping and physiological relevance. This protocol describes a high-dimensional, single-cell assay for profiling Treg-mediated suppression within a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) system. Tregs are first isolated by cell sorting and then reintroduced into autologous PBMCs at defined ratios. A 52-marker mass cytometry (CyTOF) panel is used to quantify cell division and phenotypic responses across multiple immune subsets. This approach allows for integrated analysis of Treg function with broad compatibility for patient profiling and drug evaluation. Key features • Quantifies Treg-mediated suppression in autologous PBMCs at single-cell resolution. • Enables high-dimensional phenotyping and proliferation tracking across multiple immune subsets using a 52-marker CyTOF panel. • Maintains physiological relevance by assessing suppression in a complex PBMC environment. • Compatible with patient-derived samples and drug perturbation experiments for translational immunology applications">

        <tr id="The absence of cytotoxic effector cells, such as CD8⁺ T cells or Natural Killer (NK) cells, within tumors establishes an immune-cold tumor microenvironment (TME), contributing to poor immunotherapy responses, as observed in ovarian cancer. Although prior studies implicate NK cell exhaustion within the TME related to ferroptosis, the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. This study demonstrates that upon infiltrating the ovarian cancer TME, NK cells activate an integrated stress response (ISR) centered on ATF3. This ATF3-mediated ISR suppresses NRF2 expression, compromising their ability to counteract oxidative stress and ultimately triggering ferroptosis. Critically, we show that co-treatment with the ISR inhibitor ISRIB and NK cells not only prevents NK cell ferroptosis but also synergizes to enhance tumor cell killing. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms driving NK cell exhaustion within the TME and identify ISR inhibition as a promising therapeutic target and intervention strategy for developing NK cell-based therapies against ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background and Aims The pancreatic tumour microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem where tumour cells, cancer‐associated fibroblasts and immune cells interact, often in ways that contribute to tumour growth. The role of interleukin (IL17)A in pancreatic cancer progression is now more defined, and it is known to sustain a pro‐tumoural microenvironment and inhibit the immune response. Here, we explore the effect of combining IL17A depletion with a cancer vaccine to enhance anti‐tumour immunity. Methods We used genetically engineered mice proficient or deficient in IL17A, and orthotopically injected mice with pancreatic tumour cells depleted or not in IL17A, to examine the vaccine effects on tumour growth and immune responses. Both humoral and cellular immune responses were analysed following vaccination in IL17A‐deficient and control mice. Results Mice lacking IL17A—either genetically or through pharmacological depletion—exhibited prolonged survival and smaller tumours, compared to vaccinated controls. Vaccination in IL17A‐deficient mice significantly increased the influx of immune cells, including Natural Killer (NK) and effector/memory CD8 T cells, which displayed higher cytotoxic activity. CD8 T‐cell depletion in these models notably reduced vaccine efficacy, underscoring the essential role of these cells. NK cell depletion in untreated models further demonstrated NK cells’ critical function in controlling tumour growth when IL17A was absent. Overall, IL17A depletion enhanced both antigen‐specific humoral and cellular immune responses, indicating a shift towards a more robust and responsive immune environment. Conclusions Our findings reveal that the absence of IL17A in the pancreatic TME reprograms it into a more immune‐supportive environment, favouring the recruitment of effector/memory immune cells upon vaccination. This approach paves the way for novel therapeutic combinations in pancreatic cancer, where IL17A depletion may boost both immunotherapy efficacy and anti‐tumour responses.">

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma represents the most common principal malignant bone tumor that predominantly appears among teenagers and children. While multimodal treatment methods have greatly evolved with time, survival for recurrent or metastatic disease remains low due to the resistance that accumulates during treatment. Increasing evidence identifies the tumor microenvironment (TME), in particular cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as playing an important role in imposing immune suppression, enhancing tumor aggressiveness, and mediating resistance toward immunotherapy and chemotherapy. This article gives an overview of the derivation, phenotypic heterogeneity, and mechanisms of action of CAFs during osteosarcoma, such as facilitating immune escape, survival signaling, drug efflux, regulation of genes through exosomes, and inhibiting ferroptosis. Furthermore, we present existing and new treatment methods that are centered on CAFs, such as suppression of the paracrine pathway (e.g., IL-6/STAT3, TGF-β), depletion of CAFs lineages by targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and conversion toward tumor-restraining CAFs. Other methods that are gaining popularity are targeting CAFs-releasing exosomes and metabolic liabilities. By shedding light on CAFs-based methods for imposing resistance and trying targeted treatments, this review offers insights into novel therapeutic combinations that can overcome treatment barriers and improve survival outcomes in osteosarcoma regimens.">

        <tr id="In response to an infection, the host T cell compartment develops immunological memory to ensure rapid responses upon re-infection with the same pathogen. However, these memory responses can also modulate immune reactions to unrelated pathogens through bystander activation. Herein, T cells are activated in an antigen-independent manner, often triggered by innate cytokines or Toll-like receptor ligands. To uncover new strategies for modulating immune responses, it is essential to deepen our understanding of this alternative mechanism of T cell activation, particularly in humans. Therefore, we studied the response of human CD8+ T cells to innate bystander stimuli in vitro. Thereby, we measured the induction of activation markers and proliferation using flow cytometry, and depleted or blocked several potential modulatory components to identify mediators of bystander CD8+ T-cell responses. Our study demonstrates that CD8+ T cells can be activated as bystander cells in response to innate stimuli present during a viral infection, including IL-15, IFN-α, and TLR7/8 and 9 agonists (R848 and CpG). Depletion experiments demonstrated that these bystander responses are dependent on monocytes and CD4+ T cells. In addition, we revealed that the bystander responses to the innate stimuli are highly reliant on IL-2 signaling. Altogether, our study underscores the pivotal role of IL-2 in mediating bystander responses of CD8+ T cells to innate stimuli, revealing a novel mechanism of immune response modulation during viral infections.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune neuroinflammation occurs when an individual’s immune cells attack the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerves. Several Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) proteins have been shown to limit pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in myeloid cells and prevent neuroinflammation. They rely on several mechanisms to accomplish this. Their SH2 domain allows them to bind phosphorylated tyrosine residues on surface receptors to prevent downstream signaling while their C-terminal SOCS domain can promote their assembly with Cullin5 (CUL5) to degrade signaling proteins. To date, the role of CUL5 in myeloid-cell-mediated function is poorly understood. Here we show that loss of Cul5 in myeloid cells resulted in reduced neuroinflammation and attenuated progression of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although peripheral CD4+ T cell activation was not overtly affected, Cul5-deficient macrophages in the Central Nervous System (CNS) demonstrated a significant shift toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, characterized by increased expression of Arginase 1. This correlated with an enhanced frequency of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. In contrast to what would be predicted if CUL5 and SOCS proteins work together to degrade pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, Cul5 deletion in myeloid cells selectively enhanced IL-4-mediated Arginase 1 expression. These findings identify CUL5 as an unanticipated pro-inflammatory mediator during neuroinflammation and reveal its potential as a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Traditional chemotherapy, a prevalent cancer treatment modality, is associated with significant side effects and often leads to treatment failure. Non-specific drug distribution and chemoresistance are the main factors contributing to this failure. Certain distinctive characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including hypoxia, acidic pH, and increased interstitial fluid pressure, render cancer cells resistant to conventional treatments. Multiple approaches have been devised to enhance the treatment efficiency of neoplasms and overcome chemoresistance. Nowadays, bacteria-based cancer therapy has garnered significant interest in both preclinical and clinical research, owing to its distinctive mechanism and various applications in eliciting host antitumor immunity. Due to their inherent tumor tropism, elevated motility, and capacity for quick colonization in the conducive TME, bacteria are increasingly being considered for targeted tumor treatment. Bacteria, rich in pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), can efficiently stimulate immune cells even inside the immunosuppressive TME, boosting the particular immune detection and eradication of tumor cells. Furthermore, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (CMVs), and their derived physiological components exhibit analogous functionalities to their parental cells. This review article is representative of the latest innovations in bacteria-based immunosuppressive TME reprogramming. Additionally, the article discusses future directions in this research area, drawing on current advances. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), derived from circulating monocytes recruited to tumor sites via chemotactic signals such as C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), are pivotal components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Functionally polarized into distinct subtypes, TAMs play dual roles: proinflammatory M1-type TAMs enhance antitumor immunity through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, whereas M2-type TAMs promote tumor progression by facilitating angiogenesis, metastasis, and immunosuppression. This polarization is dynamically regulated by different cytokines, various signaling pathways, and metabolic cues within the TME. Spatial distribution analyses revealed that M2-like TAMs predominantly infiltrate hypoxic and stromal regions, where they secrete factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to remodel the extracellular matrix and suppress immune responses via programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and arginase-1 upregulation. Crucially, TAMs interact extensively with immune cells; M2-TAMs secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TGF-β to inhibit cytotoxic T lymphocytes while expanding regulatory T (Treg) cells and impairing natural killer (NK) cell function via altered antigen presentation. Conversely, M1-TAMs synergize with dendritic cells to enhance T-cell priming. Therapeutically, targeting TAMs offers promising strategies, including colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors, CCL2 antagonists, and nanoparticle-mediated repolarization of M2-TAMs toward the M1 phenotype. Emerging genetic approaches, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) editing, aim to disrupt protumorigenic pathways in TAMs. Additionally, TAM-related biomarkers (e.g., CD206 and CD163) are being evaluated for their prognostic and predictive utility in immunotherapies. Despite progress, challenges persist owing to TAM plasticity and TME heterogeneity across cancers. This review synthesizes TAM biology, immune crosstalk, and therapeutic advancements, providing a foundation for novel oncology strategies aimed at reprogramming TAMs to overcome treatment resistance and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that significantly endangers human health and hampers social development. The accumulation of eggs in the liver can lead to granuloma formation and liver fibrosis. Investigating the immune mechanisms involved may reveal new therapeutic targets for schistosomiasis. Methods: We collected liver cells from both schistosome-infected mice with fibrotic livers and healthy mice for single-cell sequencing, which allowed us to explore the heterogeneity of immune cells in the fibrotic livers and to use ligand-receptor analysis to examine intercellular communication. Results: Single-cell sequencing showed significant upregulation of the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis in the fibrotic livers of schistosome-infected mice. Macrophages were the primary source of CXCL16, while CXCR6 was predominantly expressed in T cells. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly increased in the livers of schistosomiasis, as well as CXCR6 in CD4+T cells and CD8+ T cells. Among different T-cell subsets, Th2 cells primarily expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR6. In CXCR6KO mice, we observed a reduced granuloma area and diminished liver fibrosis. CD4+ T cells were notably lower in the livers of CXCR6KO mice compared to wild-type mice, although there were no significant differences in CD8+ T cells and NKT cells. Furthermore, Th2 cells in the livers of CXCR6KO mice were markedly reduced, along with significant decreases in IL-13, IL-5, and IL-4 levels. In vitro, CXCR6 was significantly upregulated under Th2-polarizing conditions. Conclusions: Th2 cells are recruited to the liver via the CXCL16-CXCR6 axis, promoting granuloma formation and liver fibrosis in schistosomiasis. The CXCR6 pathway holds potential as a therapeutic target for treating schistosome-associated liver fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Anti-tumoral immunity requires coordination of diverse responses leading to durable tumor clearance. Immunotherapy leverages specific mechanisms of the immune system to improve effector cell-mediated attack of tumors. We engineered SAR-444245 [SAR'245, formerly known as THOR-707] as a not-alpha interleukin-2 (IL-2) designed for increased half-life and selective targeting of CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells while reducing targeting of immune-suppressive CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). The anti-tumoral efficacy of SAR'245 was investigated using the syngeneic CT-26 mouse model characterized by high infiltration with Tregs and responsiveness to programmed cell-death protein-1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitory antibodies. We evaluated SAR'245 pharmacokinetics and peripheral and intra-tumoral pharmacodynamics employing cytometry, histochemistry, RNAseq and secreted cytokine readouts, and in vivo efficacy as single-agent and in combination with an anti-mouse PD-1 antibody. In CT-26 tumor-bearing mice, SAR'245 administration induced peripheral expansion of CD8+ T and NK cells, including T cell memory subpopulations, without significant Treg expansion. SAR'245 stimulated anti-tumor activity that was enhanced in combination with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitory antibody, promoting both long-term survival and rejection of tumor cells on re-challenge. This agent elevated lymphocytic infiltration of tumors and T cell clonal diversity, eliciting multiple intra-tumoral gene signatures reporting on enhanced effector cell activity and persistence in the tumor microenvironment. Overall, we demonstrate that the IL-2 not-alpha agent SAR'245 induces immune responses that promote infiltration of CD8+ T and NK cells with enhanced effector function, leading to durable antitumoral response. These findings suggest SAR'245 potential for the treatment of solid tumors, particularly in combination with inhibitors of PD-1.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma‐associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are oncogenic human gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) associated with a broad spectrum of malignancies and chronic diseases. However, direct studies of these viruses in humans are limited by ethical constraints, technical challenges, and their strict species specificity. To overcome these barriers, researchers have developed surrogate models, with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) emerging as a tractable and widely utilized system. MHV68 shares key genetic and biological features with EBV and KSHV, providing critical insights into GHV pathogenesis, including viral latency, reactivation, immune evasion, and virus‐host interactions. This review summarizes current cellular and animal models for GHV research, highlighting the advantages and limitations of MHV68 as a model for studying human GHVs. We explore mechanisms of viral gene function, immune modulation, and host responses, and discuss how these models have advanced our understanding of GHV‐associated diseases. Improved model systems will be essential for guiding future experimental approaches and developing targeted therapies for GHV‐driven malignancies and other related disorders.">

        <tr id="Background Gastric cancer (GC) remains a major clinical challenge due to its high mortality and propensity for immune escape, which critically limits the efficacy of immunotherapy. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key factor restricting the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in GC. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activating protein (NKAP), a conserved regulator of the NF-κB pathway, has been shown to drive immune evasion in other cancer types by modulating cytokine networks and immune cell functions. However, the specific role and mechanisms of NKAP in shaping the immunosuppressive TME of GC and contributing to resistance against programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade therapy remain largely unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of NKAP in the GC TME and elucidate its mechanisms in driving immune escape and resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Methods We analyzed datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets and clinical specimens from patients with GC who received neoadjuvant therapy with PD-L1 inhibitors to evaluate NKAP expression and its association with clinicopathological features. In vitro models of mature dendritic cells (mDCs) and murine xenografts were used to investigate the mechanism underlying NKAP’s involvement. NF-κB pathway activation, interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion, and regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation were assessed via luciferase assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and flow cytometry. Changes in the TME and the therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 blockade were evaluated in xenograft models. Results Elevated NKAP expression correlated with advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor tumor differentiation in patients with GC. High NKAP levels predicted higher residual tumor burden post-PD-L1 therapy. Mechanistically, NKAP overexpression activated the NF-κB pathway in mDCs, driving IL-10 secretion and promoting naïve T-cell differentiation into immunosuppressive Tregs. This process fostered an immunosuppressive TME, which diminished the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade in murine models. Conclusions NKAP is a critical regulator of GC immune escape, linking NF-κB–driven IL-10 production in mDCs to Treg-mediated immunosuppression during anti–PD-L1 therapy. Targeting NKAP may reverse resistance to ICIs, offering a promising strategy for improving clinical outcomes in patients with GC.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and the most common malignant myeloid disorder in adults. Extensive research has elucidated the broad spectrum of biological mechanisms contributing to the development of AML and specifically characterized a variety of genetic alterations initiating and defining the disease. However, the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AML remains relatively unexplored; indeed, studies on the contribution of inflammatory signaling to disease initiation in myeloid malignancies have only recently gained attention, marking an emerging area of research. AML has the highest incidence in the elderly, where inflammation plays an even greater role. A granular understanding of inflammatory processes driving leukemogenesis thus promises to guide therapeutic strategies for a patient population where outcomes remain dismal. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of the current knowledge on the role of inflammatory signaling in AML pathogenesis. It discusses the role of inflammation from premalignant states through malignant transformation, dissecting phenotypic, correlative studies from mechanistic evidence. We thereby highlight questions requiring further research to exploit the translational potential of therapies targeting inflammatory signaling and to address challenges with current immune‐modulating treatments. A particular focus is placed on assessing the role of inflammation in the interplay with genetic events as established factors in disease initiation and progression to clarify the current understanding of inflammatory signaling in AML pathogenesis.">

These discoveries have sparked growing interest in therapeutically targeting myeloid cells as a next generation strategy in cancer immunotherapy. As a complementary or alternative approach to T cell-centered immunotherapies, myeloid-directed therapies offer unique opportunities to reprogram the immune landscape, enhance antitumor responses, and overcome resistance mechanisms. In this review, we highlight recent discoveries in myeloid cell biology in cancer and discuss emerging therapeutic targets, with an emphasis on antibody-based therapies that have reached clinical development. We further provide perspective on translational challenges to implement these approaches into the clinic, and discuss how Fc-engineering and rational antibody design can optimize myeloid cell engagement and amplify their immune effector functions. Together, these advances position myeloid-directed immunotherapies as a promising approach to enhance the efficacy and durability of cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Bispecific killer engagers (BiKEs), which harness natural killer cells to deplete target cells, have garnered success in ablating tumor cells but have not been well explored in eliminating primary cells, such as effector cells in autoimmune diseases. Previously, we reported a BiKE that targeted human lymphocytes expressing programmed death-1 (PD-1). The BiKE was shown to promote NK cell-mediated depletion of PD-1+ cells in vitro. Here, we posited that a mouse-specific PD-1 BiKE could be used as a tool to deplete PD-1+ cells in vivo. Methods PD-1 BiKE was designed and produced in an IgG-like format. The BiKE was characterized for its functional binding, ability to facilitate NK cell-PD-1+ cell-cell interactions, and depletion of PD-1+ cells using several in vitro assays. The BiKE was then evaluated for its ability to deplete PD-1+ T cells in vivo using an EL4 tumor model, and the EAE model. Results PD-1 BiKE demonstrated selective binding to PD-1+ T cells encompassing both a cell line (EL4) and primary cells. PD-1 BiKE simultaneously engaged its two targets, PD-1+ and NK cells, and mediated a 63% increase in cell-cell interactions between the two targets. In co-cultures of primary PD-1+ T cells and NK cells, the BiKE reduced the number of T cells by 28%. Importantly, PD-1 BiKE did not reduce PD-1- T cells when co-cultured with NK cells. In vivo, PD-1 BiKE reduced the fraction of inoculated EL4 cells by ~53%. In EAE mice, PD-1 BiKE reduced the average number of primary PD-1+ T cells by 56% and 65% in the spinal cords and brains, respectively. Beyond the IgG-like BiKE, two non-IgG-like BiKEs were also designed and generated and demonstrated strong but distinct binding to PD-1 and CD16. Conclusions The IgG-like PD-1 BiKE bound to both cellular targets, CD16 and PD-1, and was able to deplete primary PD-1+ T lymphocytes in the EAE model. Altogether, the work showcases the effectiveness of using BiKEs to deplete non-malignant cells.">

Bacterial pneumonia poses a substantial global health burden, yet the immunological mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis and resolution are incompletely understood.


METHODS
We generated a large-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of peripheral blood immune cells from 100 individuals: 39 with severe bacterial pneumonia, 31 with mild disease, and 30 healthy controls. Integrating scRNA-seq with clinical and molecular data revealed profound remodeling of the peripheral immune landscape across disease severities.


MAIN RESULTS
Severe pneumonia was characterized by lymphopenia and monocytosis, accompanied by distinct shifts in T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell subset composition. Classical monocytes emerged as central orchestrators of the cytokine storm observed in severe cases, displaying elevated expression of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., S100A8/9/12) and enhanced TLR4-MYD88 signaling. Exhaustion of innate-like CD8+ T cells, marked by upregulation of canonical inhibitory receptors, was a hallmark of severe disease. In contrast, mild pneumonia exhibited robust CD8+ T effector and helper memory cell activation, along with effective humoral immunity, evidenced by plasma cell expansion and coordinated Tfh-B cell interactions. B cells in mild cases showed enhanced antigen recognition, BCR signaling, and co-stimulatory gene expression, whereas those in severe cases displayed signs of dysfunction. Myeloid cell alterations in severe pneumonia included increased monocytic MDSCs and non-classical monocytes, contributing to immunosuppression and complement overactivation, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
This high-resolution atlas of peripheral immune responses in bacterial pneumonia identifies key cellular and molecular drivers of disease severity, providing potential therapeutic targets for immunomodulation and improved outcomes.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (Tumor Microenvironment, TME) is a core regulatory factor in the occurrence, development, and treatment resistance of tumors. Macrophages, as key immune cell components in the TME, have a profound impact on the tumor process (Visser and Joyce in Cancer Cell 41:374–403, 2023). This review aims to systematically elucidate the characteristics and functional differences of macrophage polarization into M1 and M2 phenotypes within the TME. Additionally, it endeavors to dissect the regulatory mechanisms by which metabolic products, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components secreted by tumor cells modulate macrophage polarization (Wang et al. in Mol Cancer 23:268, 2024). Moreover, the metabolic reprogramming of tumorassociated macrophage (TAM) is a core mechanism for their functional shift, and intervening in metabolic pathways holds promise for reprogramming TAMs to inhibit tumor progression (Jin et al. in Nat Cancer 6:239–252, 2025). Within the TME, macrophages can be polarized into classically activated M1 and alternatively activated M2 types (Ge and Wu in Zhongguo Fei Ai Za Zhi 26:228–237, 2023). Accumulating evidence indicates that classically activated M1 macrophages orchestrate anti-tumor immunity by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-12 (IL-12), which collectively activate cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, induce tumor cell apoptosis, and enhance immune surveillance (Luo et al. in Front Immunol 15:1352946, 2024). In contrast, M2 macrophages are induced in the TME and promote tumor angiogenesis, immune evasion, tumor cell proliferation, and metastasis by secreting factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) (Wang et al. in NPJ Precis Oncol 8:31, 2024). Therefore, in-depth research on the mechanisms of macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment provides an important basis for developing new tumor immunotherapy strategies and has significant clinical translational value.">

 Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmunity, and limiting chronic inflammatory diseases. This small CD4+CD25+CD127lo T cell population develops in the thymus and peripheral tissues through expression of the epigenetically stabilized transcription factor FOXP3. Tregs mediate their tolerogenic effects via multiple mechanisms, including secretion of inhibitory cytokines, IL-2 consumption to starve effector T cells, suppression of Teff cells through metabolic disruption, and modulation of antigen-presenting cell maturation and function. Collectively, these mechanisms broadly suppress immune cell activation and effector function. Additionally, Tregs can promote tissue repair, complementing their immunosuppressive effects. Recent advances have focused on harnessing Tregs as a therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases, aiming to restore immune tolerance and repair tissue damage. A key to therapeutic success lies in developing a stable Treg product that preserves functional activity and lineage integrity under inflammatory conditions. Previous studies have shown that polyclonal Tregs can be administered safely to patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases. The cells can be detected in the circulation at least one year after administration and in small studies the cells have been shown to suppress inflammatory cytokines produced by effector T cells.
 In this presentation, I will highlight the differences between blood Tregs and the synovial microenvironment in the joints of healthy donors versus patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Additionally, I will present early preclinical and clinical data on our first engineered product, SBT-77-7101, which expresses a citrullinated protein (CitP)-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) derived from a RA patient-specific anti-citrullinated protein antibody. These CitP CAR-Tregs retain stable phenotypic and epigenetic profiles, remain functional in inflammatory environments, recognize multiple citrullinated proteins present in diseased tissue, and are activated by synovial fluid from patients with RA. Clinical studies of SBT-77-7101 in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Hidradenitis Suppurativa will be summarized. Finally, next-generation Treg engineering strategies aimed at enhancing Treg durability and specificity will be presented including approaches to maximize Treg stability via genome editing and develop synthetic FOXP3-dependent promoters to ensure controlled CAR expression.

        <tr id="B-cell lymphomas are hematologic malignancies characterized by poor prognoses. Immunotherapy has revolutionized B-cell lymphoma treatment by harnessing immune effector cells, but current therapeutic strategies face limitations: suboptimal pharmacokinetics of bispecific antibodies and high complexity and cost of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies. To address these challenges, a bispecific nanosystem (biHSNPs) is developed that exploits the multi-functional customizability of silica nanoplatform to conjugate antibodies targeting cytotoxic T cells or natural killer cells, alongside effector antibodies specific to B-cells. Four biHSNPs with different effector and target antibodies are synthesized. This bispecific nanosystem enables simultaneous binding to immune effector cells and B-cell lymphoma antigens, facilitating the formation of artificial immunological synapses. These synapses promote immune effector cell activation, leading to the release of cytotoxic proteins, while concurrently suppressing tumor cell proliferation and enhancing T-cell activation. In vivo, biHSNPs effectively suppress tumor growth and activate T cells in a xenograft mouse model, showcasing their potential in precision therapy. Moreover, biHSNPs successfully overcome tumor immune evasion through dual-target signal blockade. Using a straightforward and scalable strategy, a bispecific nanosystem is constructed that not only addresses the limitations of current bispecific antibody therapies but also represents a promising approach for the treatment of hematological malignancies.">

 The dynamic evolution of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) during targeted therapy is a critical yet poorly understood determinant of treatment response and resistance. While most studies compare immune states before and after treatment, temporal immune changes during therapy remain largely uncharacterized, limiting development of effective combination strategies. Here, we investigated immune dynamics throughout targeted therapy using mouse melanoma models that recapitulate human therapeutic responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified an inflection point where the inflamed TME during tumor regression, characterized by robust NK cell infiltration, transitions to an immune-excluded state upon onset of drug-tolerant residual disease. We uncovered a unique macrophage subset that orchestrates NK cell recruitment during regression. Depletion of these macrophages using LysM-cre;iDTR mice significantly reduced NK cell infiltration. Extending these findings to human cancer, longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of melanoma and lung cancer patient samples revealed dynamic NK cell infiltration during targeted therapy, establishing a direct link between innate immune remodeling and treatment outcome. Unlike prior prognostic studies assessing immune states at single time points, our results provide mechanistic evidence of a temporal relationship between NK cell infiltration and therapeutic efficacy. Together, these findings position immune evolution as a driver of acquired resistance and identify macrophage–NK cell crosstalk as a therapeutically actionable axis to overcome immune exclusion and improve targeted therapy.

        <tr id="PURPOSE Cotargetable immune pathways for available immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may mediate response and mitigate resistance. Immune profiling may provide insights into potential immunotherapy combinations and guide ongoing clinical trials. This study investigated the transcriptomic expression and clinical implications of B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), a promising immune target. METHODS Altogether, 514 advanced/metastatic samples (pan-solid cancers) were analyzed using RNA sequencing. Transcriptomic expression was normalized to a reference population of 735 tumors and expressed as percentiles. BTLA, BTLA-related markers (herpes virus entry mediator [HVEM], CD160, LIGHT), and currently targetable immune pathway checkpoints (PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 [CTLA-4], lymphocyte-activation gene 3) as well as clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS High BTLA RNA expression (≥75th percentile) was observed in 19% of tumors (96 of 514). Approximately half of these patients (44 of 96) exhibited higher coexpression (RNA) of targetable checkpoints (cluster analysis). High BTLA expression was independently associated with elevated PD-1, CTLA-4, HVEM, and CD160 RNA levels and with a breast cancer diagnosis. Outcome analysis (Kaplan-Meier) indicated that high BTLA expression correlated with significantly longer survival among ICI recipients in univariable analysis, with a trend in multivariable Cox regression (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.17 to 1.08], P = .07). Notably, expression patterns of BTLA, other immune checkpoints, and BTLA-interacting molecules (HVEM, CD160, LIGHT) varied from patient to patient. CONCLUSION High BTLA transcript expression correlates with high transcript levels of PD-1 and CTLA-4 and with high levels of its ligand HVEM. These findings might support combining anti–PD-1 or anti–CTLA-4 therapy with anti-BTLA. BTLA expression varied across cancers and showed diverse coexpression patterns with other immune markers, suggesting that individual immunomic analysis is needed as part of a precision immunotherapy approach to understanding response and resistance.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is a significant challenge in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), necessitating the urgent development of strategies to mitigate its effects. Methods The application of bioinformatics methods to predict the expression level of CD24 in HCC and its relationship with the occurrence and development of HCC. Gene-engineered mice and flow cytometry were used to study the immune cell populations regulated by CD24. Cell metabolism analysis, western blotting, and lactate content measurement were employed to assess the impact of CD24 on lactate secretion by HCC cells. Additionally, cell counting kit 8 and colony formation assays were conducted to evaluate the effect of CD24 on the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib. The integration of RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, cell chemotaxis experiments, and ELISA established a robust framework for understanding CD24-mediated neutrophils immune infiltration. Results In this study, we found that CD24 can recruit neutrophils to infiltrate HCC tissues to form tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and polarize TANs to a protumor phenotype by promoting lactate secretion by HCC cells, thus promoting the progression of HCC. In addition, targeting CD24 can enhance the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib by reducing the accumulation of TANs.

        <tr id="Colon cancer persists as a major global health burden due to therapy resistance and metastasis, with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the microenvironment driving progression through immune evasion and angiogenesis. This review highlights plant-derived therapeutics targeting TAMs to disrupt protumor signaling. Key phytochemicals (e.g., Curcumin, Cucurbitacin B, Astragaloside IV) suppress M2 polarization via NF-κB/STAT3 inhibition, block VEGF/HIF-1α-mediated angiogenesis, and enhance antitumor immunity by downregulating PD-L1. Cannabidiol, Hydroxygenkwanin regulate TAM metabolism. Dietary agents like sulforaphane and β-glucans modulate TAM-gut microbiome crosstalk. Nanoparticle-encapsulated phytochemicals enhance TAM-targeted delivery, while clinical translation requires standardized phytopreparations and biomarker-guided trials. We propose integrating validated botanical adjuvants (e.g., Fucoidan for TLR4 inhibition, dihydroisotanshinone I for CCL2 suppression) with immunotherapies to remodel immunosuppressive niches. Phytotherapy offers a multifaceted strategy to overcome TAM-driven therapeutic barriers in colon cancer, emphasizing plant-based precision medicine to augment conventional treatments.">

        <tr id="Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus affecting 10–20 million people worldwide. While many carriers remain asymptomatic, HTLV-1 infection can trigger intense inflammatory responses which are defined by the sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Central to this process is the HTLV-1 encoded Tax oncoprotein, a viral regulator that drives uncontrolled inflammation by hijacking multiple cellular signaling pathways, such as the RelA/NF-κB signal transduction pathway. CD4 T-cells are the primary targets of Tax-mediated transformation, undergoing uncontrolled proliferation and significantly contributing to chronic immune activation seen in HTLV-1-associated diseases. However, highly activated CD4 T-cells are not alone in fueling this inflammatory “wildfire.” Other immune cells, including CD8 T-cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, also play critical roles in exacerbating the inflammatory milieu. These cells, in conjunction with CD4 T-cells, release a barrage of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α/β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, TNF-α/β, and IFN-γ) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1α/β, RANTES, MCP-3, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), all of which are perpetuating the cycle of immune activation and tissue damage. This hyper stimulated immune response contributes to HTLV-1 replication/dissemination and can lead to the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM-TSP). Despite existing treatments aimed at controlling viral replication, the persistent inflammation in HTLV-1-infected individuals even in asymptomatic carriers (ACs) remains a major challenge, suggesting that targeting these pro-inflammatory responses may be another mandatory therapeutic strategy. In this context, this short-review focuses on the key immune responses that drive HTLV-1-associated inflammation and explores how these high pro-inflammatory responses contribute to the development of HTLV-1-related complications, including HAM-TSP, ATLL, and other associated inflammatory diseases during chronic viral infection.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic immune-mediated fibroinflammatory disorder characterized by dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and storiform fibrosis, often resulting in organ dysfunction. Although glucocorticoids provide initial clinical improvement, relapse is common, underscoring the need for targeted therapies. B-cell depletion therapy has emerged as a promising approach, shedding light on the roles of plasmablasts and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in disease pathogenesis.


AREAS COVERED
This review summarizes recent advances in immunological mechanisms of IgG4-RD, focusing on plasmablasts, activated B cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, other immune cells, and fibroblasts. We highlight how single-cell RNA sequencing and highly multiplex immunofluorescence have uncovered novel immune subsets and their interactions. These technologies have identified previously unrecognized populations, including GZMK+ cytotoxic Tfh cells, MKI67+ B cells, and double-negative type 3 B cells, offering unprecedented resolution into disease mechanisms.


EXPERT OPINION
Single-cell technologies have revolutionized our understanding of IgG4-RD immunopathogenesis and potentially revealed disease heterogeneity across clinical phenotypes. These insights hold promise for biomarker development and precision therapeutic strategies. Future directions should include spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, improved animal models, and translational efforts to bridge mechanistic discoveries with targeted treatment for this complex multi-organ disease.">

        <tr id="Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors of glial origin accounting for about 80% of the central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. Glioma cells are known to form a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) capable of inhibiting T cell activation and protecting tumors from elimination by the immune system. One of the predominant immune inhibitory mechanisms in the TME are immune checkpoints: a complex system of membrane-bound ligands on tumor and immune cells that interact with surface receptors on T lymphocytes and affect their activation and cytotoxicity. There is mounting evidence regarding the role of immune checkpoints expressed in gliomas, in particular, their most aggressive form – glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In this review, we discuss the immune checkpoints with proven expression in gliomas, their ligands, related signaling pathways, co-expression profiles, and the effects of immune cells on antitumor activity. We collected data not only on the canonical immune checkpoints (e.g. PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4) but also on novel and alternative ones including soluble mediators and enzymes. We review data describing the correlation of immune checkpoint expression with patient survival as well as co-expression with other molecules involved in glioma development. Where possible, we analyzed the differences between immune checkpoints in low-grade (LGG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG). Negative effects of several immune checkpoints on T cells could be eliminated by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction between checkpoint ligands and receptors. Therefore, alongside with traditional approaches and T cell-based immunotherapy, the antibody-mediated blockade of immune checkpoints could be considered as a potentially promising therapeutic approach against gliomas.">

        <tr id="The innate immune system plays a dual role in both mediating pathogenic processes following tissue damage and acting as a barrier to effective therapeutic delivery. Strategies that evade immune clearance while modulating host immune components offer promising solutions for treating complex chronic diseases, such as fibrosis. Here, an innate immune checkpoint material-based strategy is presented in which mesenchymal stromal cells, coated with a soft conformal microgel and functionalized with the CD47 self-marker agonist, effectively evade clearance by tissue resident macrophages. These engineered cells reverse persistent fibrotic damage in the lungs through a paracrine mechanism. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies a transitional antigen-presenting macrophage subpopulation that mediates these reparative effects. By combining immune cloaking with the presentation of local signals encoded in the gel coatings, this strategy can be used to design secretory cells for long-term tissue remodeling, enabling a living pharmacy for chronic tissue damage.">

        <tr id="In the ever-evolving landscape of cancer therapy, while cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy aim to eradicate malignant cells, they also inadvertently trigger cellular senescence in both cancerous and microenvironmental tissues. Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) can act as a barrier against tumor growth by halting cell proliferation in the short term, but the long-term persistence of therapy-induced senescent (TISnt) cells may pose a significant challenge in cancer management. Their distinct characteristics, like senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), metabolic dysregulation, and immune evasion, make them exhibit remarkable heterogeneity to orchestrate the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in therapy resistance. However, how these TISnt cells functioning differently in cancer progression, and the intricate mechanisms by which they remodel the senescence-associated immunosuppressive microenvironment present challenges for improving anticancer therapy. Therefore, this review summarizes the heterogeneous TISnt cell phenotypes contributing to an accumulated senescent state, outlines their multidimensional interactions in the senescent microenvironment, and discusses current senescence-targeting strategies. Building on the current understanding of TIS, we propose potential avenues for improving TIS-targeting methodologies in the context of head and neck cancer, a representative heterogeneous malignancy, which can substantially enhance the efficacy of the “one-two punch” sequential treatment approach for head and neck cancer.">

        <tr id="Resistance to immune-mediated destruction is a fundamental hallmark of cancer. Although several mechanisms have been identified that facilitate immune evasion, the transcriptional programs that orchestrate this process remain poorly understood. Here, through a genome-wide CRISPR activation screen in human cancer cells subjected to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing, we identified ZNF296, a transcription factor highly expressed in epithelial cancers, as a key driver of tumor resistance to both NK and cytotoxic T cell (CTL)-mediated immunity. In mouse models, inhibition of ZNF296 significantly enhanced both NK and T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, leading to a marked reduction in metastasis and increased infiltration of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, ZNF296 induced strong transcriptional repression of interferon-stimulated genes and key immunostimulatory ligands critical for NK and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. At the molecular level, ZNF296 directly interacted with and recruited the NuRD chromatin remodeling and deacetylase complex to the promoters of its target genes to suppress expression. Notably, treatment with low-dose romidepsin, an FDA-approved inhibitor targeting HDAC1, a core component of the NuRD complex, effectively restored NK and T cell-mediated killing in cancer cells with high ZNF296 expression. Collectively, these findings establish ZNF296 as a key regulator of immune evasion, driving resistance to both NK and T cell-mediated antitumor immunity, and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome immune resistance in epithelial cancers.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disorder due to the abnormal proliferation of clonal Plasma Cells (PCs) characterized by the increase of monoclonal immunoglobulins1. The interaction between MM cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is crucial to the progression and treatment of the disease. The PCs interaction with the hematopoietic cells induce the secretion of cytokines and growth factors, by establishing circuits that support PCs activation. In this context the malignant TIGIT positive PCs are able to interact with the T lymphocytes, a process that fuel the immune evasion, typical of the MM2. Our knowledge about the BM myeloma microenvironment is still poorly defined as well as the cellular interaction between PCs. We exploited BM biopsies of 22 MM patients. TIGIT was expressed in 86% (19/22) of evaluable samples. Among patients with PCs % >60% or FLC ratio >100, 92% were TIGIT+. Morphological differences were evident between groups: TIGIT-negative PCs were larger and altered, while TIGIT-positive PCs showed polarized nuclei and proximity to neutrophils. TIGIT-positive samples displayed increased neutrophils undergoing NETosis, as confirmed by neutrophil elastase and Ly6b co-expression (p=0.0067). Elevated IL-6 (p=0.0003) and IL-8 (p=0.004) in TIGIT-positive samples suggest a proinflammatory microenvironment promoting neutrophil recruitment and NETosis. In MM, the Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio combines a marker of inflammation and the reduced cell turnover, reflecting alteration in the immune system. TIGIT expression in the bone marrow of MM patients is associated with more aggressive disease features and an inflammatory microenvironment enriched with NET-forming neutrophils. These findings support TIGIT as a potential biomarker of disease severity and a therapeutic target in MM.">

The sustained effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1) treatment is limited to a subgroup of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, highlighting the need to identify targetable biomarkers that synergize with PD1 blockade. Abnormal cholesterol metabolism plays a critical role in HCC progression, along with growing evidence indicating its complex immunomodulatory effects within the tumor microenvironment. However, the interplay between cholesterol homeostasis and immune evasion remains elusive.


METHODS
Transcriptomic and clinical data from HCC datasets were analyzed to identify cholesterol metabolism-related targets. Multiplex immunostaining and flow cytometry were applied to examine the immune landscape association with squalene epoxidase (SQLE) in human and murine tumors. Mechanistic studies were conducted in vitro, and co-culture experiments of tumor cells and T cells were followed by metabolomics and transcriptome analyses. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in mouse HCC models.


RESULTS
We demonstrated that elevated SQLE expression in human HCC was associated with poor clinical outcomes and correlated with reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic knockdown of SQLE in tumor cells promoted CD8+ T cell proliferation and activation in co-culture experiments. Untargeted metabolomics identified 27-hydrocholesterol, an oxysterol derived from tumor cells, as a key factor impairing CD8+ T cell function via cholesterol dysregulation. SQLE inhibition in tumor cells suppressed oxysterols secretion, therefore overcoming cholesterol restrictions and enhancing the immune responses of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, SQLE targeting with terbinafine restored antitumor immunity and synergized with anti-PD1 therapy in HCC.


CONCLUSION
Targeting tumorous SQLE restores CD8+ T cell function by overcoming cholesterol restrictions via oxysterol-SREBP2 signaling, highlighting SQLE as a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in HCC.">

Single-cell mass cytometry analysis reveals an increase in the M-MDSC like LS AML as compared to those of lineage-consistent KMT2A-r AML, and single-cell transcriptomics identify distinct expression patterns of immunoregulatory genes within this population. Furthermore, in vitro assays confirm the immunosuppressive capacity of LS AML cells against T cells, which is analogous to that of MDSCs. These data provide insight into the immunological aspects of the complex pathogenesis of LS AML, as well as development of future treatments.">

Porcine-to-human islet xenotransplantation offers a promising solution to type 1 diabetes. This study investigates the use of Belimumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits B cell activating factor (BAFF) as part of an immunosuppressive regimen in porcine-to-non-human primate xenotransplantation.


METHODS
Porcine islets were transplanted into Rhesus monkeys with an immunosuppressant regimen. Blood samples were collected from the monkeys pre- and post-treatment, and single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to investigate immune cell landscape changes, focusing on B cells.


RESULTS
UMAP clustering of B cells identified five distinct subsets. Notably, Belimumab treatment significantly reduced the proportion of both CXCR5+ and CXCR5- atypical memory B cells, which possess the potential to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells. Furthermore, differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed a comprehensive functional impairment, along with significant downregulation of activation markers such as CD69 and CD83, across all B cell subsets.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study elucidates the mechanism of action of Belimumab in non-human primate models, serving as preclinical subjects for B-cell-targeted therapy research in a xenotransplantation context. Significantly, our data indicate that Belimumab not only reduces the proportion of antibody-secreting atypical memory B cells but also induces functional impairment across all B cell subsets. Given the potential pathogenic roles of atypical memory B cells in autoimmunity and other related settings, their reduction by Belimumab could play a crucial role in regulating B-cell-mediated immune responses in pig-to-non-human primate pancreatic islet xenotransplantation. Thus, our findings highlight the prospective utility of Belimumab as a B cell suppressant in future clinical xenotransplantation applications.">

        <tr id="Persistent antigen exposure during chronic viral infection and tumor development drives CD8 T cells into an exhausted, hypofunctional state. Understanding the molecular pathways that enforce T-cell exhaustion is critical for improving current immunotherapies. Previously, we have shown the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) regulates CD8 T-cell function through LPA receptor 5 (LPAR5) signaling, including demonstrating that Lpar5-/- CD8 T cells exhibit enhanced tumor clearance in murine models of melanoma. Importantly, significantly elevated levels of LPA have been identified in individuals with different cancers and persistent viral infections such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus. To investigate the role of Lpar5 in the differentiation and maintenance of exhausted CD8 T cells, we utilized the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection model. In response to infection with LCMV Clone 13, but not Armstrong, one-quarter of Lpar5-/- animals succumbed to infection, and this was accompanied by an increased frequency of LCMV-specific Lpar5-/- CD8 T cells maintained in a less terminally exhausted state. Using P14 transgenic mice, we demonstrate that Lpar5 acts in a cell-intrinsic and temporal manner to regulate CD8 T-cell accumulation and exhaustion programming during Clone 13 infection. The enhanced accumulation of Lpar5-/- P14 cells during the acute phase of Clone 13 infection appears to be regulated by Lpar5-mediated changes in T-cell survival and not through trafficking or proliferation. RNA sequencing analyses and surface phenotyping show that Lpar5 likely regulates CD8 T-cell exhaustion through modulation of NK receptor expression, including the CD94/NKG2A inhibitory axis.">

        <tr id="Adoptive transfer of NK cells can induce complete remissions in 30-50% of patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoma. While blood chimerism occurs, attaining functional homing to the site of tumor without exhaustion has been elusive. During chronic infections and tumorigenesis, exposure to activating stimuli weakens the effector activity of NK cells. Despite this knowledge, there is little known about the mechanisms that govern this dysregulation and whether these disparate activating stimuli use distinct pathways to downregulate effector immunity. In this study, we reveal that chronic NK cell activating receptor (NKAR) stimulation and chronic IL-15 exposure impart distinct modes of dysregulation, with NKAR stimulation inducing a tissue resident-like state that resembles that of tumor-infiltrating NK cells in cancer patients. Using loss- and gain-of-function studies, we identify the transcription factor KLF2 as a master regulator of the NK cell response to chronic activation and provide evidence that KLF2 overexpression promotes NK cell cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and chemotaxis, and inhibits the development of dysfunctional, tissue resident-like features. Using KLF2 reporter mice, we show that in certain tissues, tissue resident NK cells are predominantly KLF2-negative while circulating NK cells in these tissues are overwhelmingly KLF2+. Lastly, using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we demonstrate that conditional KLF2 deficiency in NK cells leads to altered homing and the acquisition of tissue resident-like features in vivo. Together, these findings highlight the profound changes NK cells undergo during prolonged activation and advance our understanding of how some NK cell therapies fail during malignant relapse.">

 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) represent opposing failures of immune regulation—tumor-driven suppression versus unchecked autoreactivity—yet both exploit the BAFF/APRIL–TACI (TNFRSF13B) axis. Continuous TACI engagement activates NF-κB signaling, promoting leukemic cell survival and rescuing autoreactive B cells from deletion. While therapies such as BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors shrink CLL tumors, they often impair immune competence; similarly, broad B-cell depletion in SLE curbs autoantibodies but heightens infection risk. A strategy that dismantles pathogenic B-cell programs while sparing protective immunity remains urgently needed.



 To assess whether genetic or antibody-mediated TACI blockade (i) suppresses CLL progression and restores anti-tumor immunity, and (ii) re-establishes self-tolerance across lupus models.



 Cancer arm: Eµ-TCL1 CLL cells, with or without TACI, were transplanted into wild-type mice (n ≥ 4/group); tumor burden, cytokines, and T-cell subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry. Microarray and real-time PCR profiled the transcriptional impact of TACI loss. Primary human CLL samples (≥ 4) underwent migration assays, T-cell co-culture ± anti-TACI antibody, and CRISPR-mediated TACI knockdown before NSG mouse engraftment. Autoimmunity arm: TACI deletion was introduced into BAFF-Tg, Lyn-/-, and Sanroque mice (n ≥ 4/strain). Plasma-cell frequencies, germinal-center dynamics, Tfh activity, autoantibody titers, renal pathology, and serum cytokines were assessed. Safety endpoints included weight, hematology, and vaccine-response assays.



 TACI loss restrained pathogenic B-cell programs across both disease contexts. In CLL, mice engrafted with TACI-/- cells showed delayed disease progression, lower tumor incidence, normalized IL-6/IL-10 levels, and restored T-cell subsets versus TACI+/+ controls. TACI-deficient CLL cells downregulated IL-10, TNF, PD-L1, and PD-L2, restored immunoglobulin levels, and re-established T-cell–dependent antigen responses. Mechanistically, TACI enhanced CLL cell migration and splenic homing, promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment; findings were validated in primary CLL cells and PDX models. In lupus models, TACI deletion restored B-cell homeostasis. BAFF-Tg TACI-/- mice exhibited normal plasma-cell frequencies and reduced autoantibodies and IFN-γ. Lyn-/- TACI-/- mice showed fewer plasma cells, lower cytokine production, and preserved renal structure. Sanroque TACI-/- mice displayed corrected Tfh activity and normalized autoantibody levels. Protective immune responses were maintained across all models without overt immunodeficiency.



 TACI blockade restores immune balance by impairing leukemic B-cell survival and migration while preserving humoral responses. Simultaneously, it re-establishes tolerance and prevents end-organ damage in lupus. These findings support TACI inhibition as a cross-disease therapeutic strategy unifying cancer immunotherapy and autoimmunity control.

        <tr id="Liver transplantation remains the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease (ESLD); however, immune rejection significantly hampers its long-term success. Dendritic cell-derived exosomes (DEXs) have emerged as a promising tool for inducing immune tolerance and enabling precise immunomodulation in liver transplantation, owing to their unique bidirectional immunoregulatory capabilities. This review systematically summarizes the biological characteristics and functional properties of DEXs, with a particular focus on their multidimensional regulatory mechanisms within the hepatic transplant immune microenvironment. These include: the mechanisms and pathways by which DEXs mediate immune tolerance; the synergistic immunoregulatory roles of DEXs and exosomes derived from other immune cells. Furthermore, we explore the potential of DEXs for integrated diagnostic and therapeutic applications, engineering upgrades to treatment strategies, and their prospects for clinical translation. Despite their promise, several challenges persist, including difficulties in exosome isolation and purification, prolonged preparation times, bioengineering limitations, and the lack of effective in vivo tracking methods. We propose that advancements in artificial intelligence, biomaterials science, and interdisciplinary technologies may help overcome these barriers, facilitating the precise isolation, functional optimization, and clinical translation of DEXs. This review emphasizes the molecular immunoregulatory networks governed by DEXs and discusses their translational pathways, aiming to promote individualized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in liver transplantation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunity response following vaccination and infection toward the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant remains limited in chronic liver disease (CLD) population. This study aims to investigate humoral and cell-mediate immunity to Omicron BA.4/5 among CLD patients with/without breakthrough infections (BI). This longitudinal study characterized immune responses to Omicron infection across three CLD patient groups: vaccinated without BI (group 1, n = 10), vaccinated with BI (group 2, n = 43), and unvaccinated infected (group 3, n = 7). SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies/T-cell responses and lymphocyte phenotypes were quantified by ELISA and flow cytometry. Logistic regression identified immunological correlates of BI event, viral clearance and liver disease progression. Dynamic immunity changes after infection analyzed using Spearman’s correlation. Patients in group 2 exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against wildtype (WT) and Omicron BA.4.5, anti-RBD IgG, and total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to groups 1 and 3. Comparable T cell responses were observed between two vaccinated groups, stronger than unvaccinated individuals. Hybrid immune (vaccination plus infection) elicited stronger NAbs-WT, total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, anti-RBD IgG, MBCs, and Omicron-specific IFN-γ+/IL-4+CD4+T cells compared to primary Omicron infection. Besides, severe liver disease was not only a risk factor for BI, but also impaired Omicron-specific IFN-γ+CD8+T, CD38+CD4+T, and CD45RA+CD8+T cells responses after infection. Importantly, IgG+/IgM+MBCs and NAbs showed positive associations with central memory (CD45RA−CD62L+CD4/8) or naive (CD45RA+CD62L+CD4) T cells. Low levels of CD45RA+CD62L+CD8+T cells and resting MBCs were identified as the independent risk factors for viral clearance and disease progression, respectively. BI predominantly stimulates humoral immunity without enhancing cellular responses. Weaker immune response induced by primary Omicron infection underscores the need for additional vaccinations in vaccine-naïve CLD patients. The positive correlations between humoral/cellular immunity and memory/activated T cells reveal their coordinated role in adaptive immune defense against SARS-CoV-2. These findings emphasize the importance of regular immune monitoring and timely interventions to optimize protection for CLD patients against emerging Omicron subvariants.">

        <tr id="Macrophages and T cells communicate under homeostatic and pathological conditions. Previous studies elucidated biochemical crosstalk between macrophages and T cells. However, recent technological advances in multiplex tissue imaging reveal that these cells are often located proximally. Notably, recent clinical studies link the proximity of macrophages and T cells to cancer outcomes. These observations suggest that physical contact between the two cell types might influence their phenotype and activity. However, systematic investigations of the potential role of physical contact between these cells are lacking. To address this gap, we developed three-dimensional (3D) coculture assays to study the potential role of physical contact between naïve macrophages and activated CD8+ T cells cultured in 3D Matrigel matrix. Under contact conditions, macrophages and T cells were coencapsulated in the same matrix, whereas under no-contact conditions, they were cultured in matrix, separated by a Transwell membrane. Our findings indicated that T cells changed their migration behavior by stopping and moving over the surface of naïve macrophages during coculture. We quantitatively determined T cells establish durable contact with macrophages, which informed our hypothesis that physical interactions between macrophage-T cells may induce phenotypic changes. Physical contact led to a 3-fold increase in IFN-γ secretion, a key effector molecule of CD8+ T cells. The increase in IFN-γ was mediated by JAK and led to a 2-fold upregulation of ICAM-1 and increased PD-L1 expression. Our findings point to a model whereby activated T cells migrate toward macrophages and are held in proximity by ICAM-1 adhesion molecules, leading to increased production of IFN-γ and PD-L1 expression. These results establish that physical contact is an important determinant of macrophage and T cell states. Broadly, our study establishes a foundation to use biomaterials as a tool to provide mechanistic insights into heterotypic cell interactions to enable rational manipulation of the immune response.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) are essential components of the innate immune system, functioning as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In hematological malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), TLRs influence inflammation, disease progression, and therapeutic response. This review highlights the prognostic relevance of TLR expression, the role of the MyD88 signaling pathway in clonal evolution, and the dual nature of TLR‐mediated immune responses, either promoting antitumor activity or contributing to leukemogenesis. Notably, TLR dysregulation in MDS and AML is associated with poor prognosis and genomic instability, whereas in CML, TLRs contribute to a protective microenvironment via NOD‐like and TNF‐α pathways. Therapeutic strategies targeting TLRs, including agonists and antagonists, show promise in enhancing antitumor responses, especially when combined with agents like purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitors. Furthermore, genetic variations in TLR pathways may influence individual susceptibility to infection and cancer progression, reinforcing the relevance of personalized medicine. Overall, this review underscores the need for continued research into TLR modulation as a foundation for innovative therapies in hematologic cancers.">

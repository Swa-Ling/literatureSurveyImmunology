        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Background Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are major global health challenges, and their coexistence in patients presents unique clinical complexities. Interestingly, patients with both lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and COPD show reduced responses to conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapies but demonstrate enhanced sensitivity to immunotherapy. Methods We investigated this phenomenon using a cohort of 248 LUAD patients undergoing immunotherapy. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was performed on 187,123 cells from tumor samples, adjacent normal tissues, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six treatment-naïve LUAD patients—three with COPD and three without. To further validate these findings, we conducted multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemical (mfIHC) analysis on 34 additional treatment-naïve LUAD patients and analyzed an independent cohort of 65 LUAD patients undergoing immunotherapy. Results We found that COPD-associated LUAD tumors exhibited distinctive features, including elevated expression of human leukocyte antigen I (HLA-I) on malignant cells and a less aggressive tumor phenotype. The immune microenvironment in these tumors was more active, with increased infiltration of NK cells, effector CD4+ T cells, and effector CD8+ T cells. Additionally, we observed higher numbers of exhausted C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13+ CD8+ T cells and mature dendritic cells enriched in immunoregulatory molecules expressing immune checkpoint genes. These findings were confirmed in both the mfIHC cohort and the independent immunotherapy cohort, where we observed that COPD-related features correlated with improved responses to immunotherapy. Conclusion Our study reveals that COPD leads to elevated HLA-I expression and a more active immune microenvironment in LUAD tumors, characterized by enhanced cytotoxic immune cell infiltration and a shift towards immunoregulatory profiles. These features correlate with improved immunotherapy responses, highlighting the potential for optimizing treatment strategies in LUAD patients with COPD.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Advanced melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that has spread and cannot be surgically removed. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved survival for some patients by helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. However, reliable methods to predict which patients will benefit are still lacking. This study investigated whether analyzing both tumor and blood samples before treatment could help identify patients most likely to benefit from ICIs. By studying gene activity in tumors and immune cell types in the blood, we found that patients with low immune activity in their tumors had poorer outcomes. Conversely, those with higher levels of a specific immune cell type in their blood—PD-1+ effector memory CD4+ T-cell—tended to respond better to treatment. These findings suggest that combining both tumor and blood analysis could support more personalized and effective treatment decisions for patients with advanced melanoma.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant non-cancerous cell type in glioblastoma (GBM) and heavily influence GBM biology, contributing to tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, immune evasion, and neovascularization. Current in vitro models that utilize IL-4/IL-13 stimulation fail to capture the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of TAMs observed in vivo. In this study, we utilize a serum-free indirect co-culture model with patient-derived xenolines to polarize primary human macrophages and characterize their molecular and functional phenotypes. We demonstrate that xenoline-polarized macrophages diverge from classical M1/M2 states and instead adopt transcriptional signatures reflective of TAM subsets identified from patients. Notably, macrophages polarized with the radiation-therapy selected xenoline, JX14P-RT, exhibited gene expression patterns enriched for interferon response and hypoxia, mirroring recurrent GBM samples. In contrast, JX14P TAMs showed enrichment in phagocytic gene sets. Functional validation of these phenotypes revealed discrepancies between the transcriptionally predicted and observed phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of integrating phenotypic validation in sequencing studies. Altogether, our findings establish xenoline-polarized macrophages as a useful alternative to traditional models that can be used to study immune-interactions in vitro.

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Although effective for immunologically hot tumors, immune checkpoint inhibitors minimally affect tumors that are not T cell inflamed, including breast cancer. An alternate strategy to combat immune cold breast tumors may be to reeducate innate immunity. This study identifies strategies to skew neutrophils to acquire tumoricidal properties. Systemic Toll-like receptor (TLR)–induced inflammation, concomitant with mitochondrial complex I inhibition in breast tumors, increases neutrophil cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells and independently of CD8+ T cell immunity. These therapy-entrained neutrophils enhance secretory granule production, increasing expression of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase machinery and inducing a respiratory burst. Moreover, systemic administration of TLR agonists elevates nuclear factor κB signaling in neutrophils to increase production of secretory granule and NADPH oxidase machinery components, whereas complex I inhibitors are required to potentiate oxidative damage. In summary, we describe a class of neutrophils, educated by the combined action of inflammatory mediators and metabolic inhibitors, having tumoricidal functions.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and associated receptors remains poorly characterized. We applied a single-cell multi-omics approach (CITE-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy donors, before and after in vitro TNF stimulation. Using integrated analysis of surface protein expression and transcriptomic data, we focused on phenotypic and transcriptional changes in dendritic cell populations. DCs from RA patients exhibited elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, indicative of an inflammatory phenotype, and showed marked responsiveness to TNF. Upon stimulation, RA-derived DCs upregulated genes involved in antigen presentation (CD83, LAMP3), lymph node migration (CCR7, ADAM19), and inflammation (TRAF1, IL24) whereas such activation was absent in healthy controls. Our data reveal a TNF-responsive, pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in dendritic cells from RA patients and underscore the relevance of the TNF receptor profile in shaping DC function. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of RA and identify dendritic cells as potential targets for personalized immunomodulatory therapy.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs) are an abundant, phenotypically plastic cell population that is critical for initiating a robust antitumor response. To properly combat cancer cells, TAMCs must sense and transduce both soluble and vital biophysical cues imparted by the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite ample research enumerating the deleterious effects of a primary tumor’s ECM on TAMCs’ functionality, few studies have evaluated the contribution of mechanosensitive cation channel(s) underlying these detrimental changes. Methods Our study aimed to evaluate the significance of the mechanosensitive cation channel PIEZO1 in TAMCs’ phenotype and effector functionality. To do so, we generated CD11b-conditional Piezo1 knockout mice, orthotopically inoculated them with rhabdomyosarcoma 76–9, an aggressive syngeneic rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, and evaluated tumor burden, pan-immune compartment changes, and intrinsic myeloid and lymphoid transcriptomic and functional changes. Results Genetic deletion of Piezo1 in CD11b-expressing cells significantly hindered primary and metastatic tumor burden. Intratumorally, we observe enhanced infiltration of CD11b+ dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8+, but not CD4+, T cells. This phenotype was driven by CD11b+ DCs that have undergone transcriptional changes related to improved antigen presentation and T cell activation. Despite being canonically inefficient cross-presenters in the wildtype state, Piezo1 KO CD11b+ DCs, specifically the cDC2A subpopulation, efficiently cross-prime CD8+ T cells on exposure to exogenous particulate antigens. Conclusions Here, we report for the first time an association between mechanosensation and cross-presentation by cDC2A cells. Our findings may be impactful to improving the continued development of DC vaccines whose success hinges on proper antigen processing and presentation to cytotoxic T cells in the TME.">

        <tr id="Background Early administration of IL-6R blockade is effective in adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD), but the underlying immune alterations during combined immunotherapy remain unclear. Methods We employed high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry and an unbiased bioinformatics pipeline to characterize the immune landscape in treatment-naïve AOSD patients, stable AOSD patients after 24 weeks of IL-6R blockade plus methotrexate and prednisone, and matched healthy controls. Cytokine profiling was conducted using a high-throughput cytometric bead array, and potential regulatory networks were identified using the PerformanceAnalytics package. Validation was performed via flow cytometry and mRNA sequencing. Results We identified 22 peripheral immune cell populations and characterized their composition and phenotypic markers. Treatment-naïve AOSD patients exhibited significant depletion of CD4+ T cells and B cells, along with excessive activation of CD8+ T cells and a previously unreported CD45+CD3−CD19−CD10−CD66a+ population, findings that were validated in an independent AOSD cohort. mRNA sequencing revealed the proinflammatory role of CD8+ T cells. Notably, these dysregulated immune profiles were markedly restored following immunotherapy. IL-18, IL-21, and IFN-γ demonstrated strong associations with adaptive immune cells and AOSD clinical indices. Conclusions Combined IL-6R blockade effectively modulates immune dysregulation in refractory AOSD, reversing key pathological immune alterations and highlighting its therapeutic potential.

        <tr id="Background T-cell exhaustion is a major barrier to effective antitumor immunity and limits the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. This study investigates the role of suppressor of T-cell signaling 2 (STS2, also known as UBASH3A) in regulating CD8+ T-cell exhaustion within the tumor microenvironment. Methods We used genetic ablation of STS2 in mouse models to assess tumor control and responses to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade therapy. CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were characterized through flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell transcriptomics. Mechanistic studies included co-immunoprecipitation, protein degradation assays, and endocytosis measurements to elucidate the interplay between STS2 and PD-1. Results STS2 expression progressively increased with T-cell exhaustion. Genetic deletion of STS2 enhanced tumor control and improved responses to anti-PD-1 therapy. STS2-deficient CD8+ TILs maintained a more functional state, exhibiting enhanced effector activity, proliferation, and antitumor efficacy while resisting terminal exhaustion. Mechanistically, we discovered that STS2 physically interacts with PD-1 and modulates its expression, endocytosis, and degradation at the protein level. Conclusions Our findings establish STS2 as a multifaceted regulator of T-cell exhaustion and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for enhancing antitumor immunity and improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes.">

        <tr id="Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), a lethal manifestation of acute lung injury, remains a critical public health concern due to the absence of targeted therapies. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for immunopathology during DAD progression are largely undefined. Here, by integrating single cell RNA sequencing, functional assays, and genetic/pharmacological interventions in a mouse model of ricin-induced DAD, we revealed a significant accumulation of neutrophil with an activated phenotype that plays a critical role in immunopathology. We observed the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during DAD, which further intensified inflammation and tissue injury. IL-17A signaling activity was upregulated in DAD-affected lungs, while IL-17A deficiency or functional blockade significantly attenuated neutrophil recruitment, NET generation, and tissue damage. Mechanically, IL-17A stimulates lung resident fibroblasts to produce the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1. Notably, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) emerged as the dominant source of IL-17A, highlighting a triad of interactions among ILC3, fibroblast, and neutrophil in DAD pathogenesis. This finding delineates a pathogenic IL-17A-neutrophil-NET axis that amplifies lung immunopathology after ricin-induced DAD, a deeper understanding of these relationships may pave the way for mitigate DAD immunopathology and other lung inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Lupus nephritis is recognized as a common and severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus, without an optimal therapeutic strategy currently available. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold therapeutic promise, their efficacy varies substantially, likely due to their plasticity and capacity to adopt pro-inflammatory (MSC1) or anti-inflammatory (MSC2) functional states in response to different microenvironments. Here, we report for the first time that IL-27, via JAK1–STAT1 signaling, up-regulates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in MSCs, driving MSC differentiation toward an IDO-positive MSC2 phenotype with low immunogenicity. These IDO-positive MSC2 cells produce kynurenine and kynurenic acid, the metabolites of tryptophan, which bind to the intracellular aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This interaction stimulates an increase in the anti-inflammatory factor TSG-6 and induces the differentiation of regulatory T cells. Notably, IL-27-conditioned MSC2 demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy compared to conventional MSCs in a murine lupus nephritis model. In conclusion, this study revealed that IL-27 is a critical modulator of MSC immune plasticity and presented a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing IL-27-enhanced MSC2 for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by multilayered dysregulation of immune cell homeostasis, spanning B cell effector dysfunction, T follicular helper (Tfh) cell hyperactivity, and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) tolerance breakdown. Advances in high-parameter immunophenotyping, single-cell multiomics profiling, and spatial multiomics have redefined SLE pathogenesis, revealing stage-specific immune network perturbations. These discoveries have propelled mechanism-driven therapeutic strategies, including CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy for B cell depletion, disruption of T–B cell synaptic signaling (CD40L inhibitors), and restoration of pDC tolerance (anti-BDCA2 antibodies). While patient heterogeneity poses challenges for universal therapeutic efficacy, emerging strategies integrating molecular endotyping and cellular biomarkers hold promise for overcoming these limitations. By aligning targeted therapies with the immunophenotypic signatures of individual patients, precision medicine approaches are expected to optimize treatment efficacy, minimize off-target effects, and ultimately enhance long-term clinical outcomes in SLE. This review synthesizes current insights into how immune cell perturbations contribute to SLE pathogenesis, modulate disease flares, and determine therapeutic refractoriness, with a critical synthesis of recent clinical trial outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play dual roles in cancer, either promoting or suppressing tumor progression, complicating therapeutic approaches. TAMs include recruited macrophages (recMacs), derived from circulating monocytes, and tissue-resident interstitial macrophages (IMs). We recently identified a heterogeneous population of chemokine-expressing IMs, including subsets that support tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation during lung inflammation. Here, we show that IMs can be either pro- or anti-tumorigenic, depending on the subset. Using Pf4ᶜʳᵉCx3cr1ᴰᵀᴿ mice to deplete CD206hi IMs expressing Cxcl13, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10, we demonstrate their essential role in TLS formation, lymphocyte recruitment, and tumor suppression in melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma. In contrast, Ccl2-expressing IMs promote tumor growth by recruiting pro-tumorigenic recMacs. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the distinct localization and chemokine profiles of these subsets. Finally, CCR5 blockade with the FDA-approved inhibitor Maraviroc during neoantigen vaccination improved tumor control by preventing the migration of immunosuppressive, antigen-presenting recMacs (moDCs). These findings support the development of macrophage-targeted therapies by identifying pro-tumorigenic subsets and recMac trafficking as actionable targets, while preserving macrophage populations that sustain anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Despite the therapeutic benefit of immune checkpoint blockade in cancers, there is no consensus on its effect in infectious diseases. Here we investigated whether blocking the immune checkpoint T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domains (TIGIT) increases T cell immunity in active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. TIGIT expression in both peripheral blood and lung lesions in tuberculosis patients was assessed, and the correlation with clinical features analyzed. The functional status of TIGIT+ and TIGIT−CD8+ T cell subsets in tuberculosis patients was analyzed by flow cytometry and transcriptome analysis. To investigate the regulatory effect of TIGIT, the function of CD8+ T cells in tuberculosis patients and bacterial load in a tuberculosis mouse model were assessed after in vitro and in vivo TIGIT blockade. In active tuberculosis patients, TIGIT expression on CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood was significantly upregulated and positively correlated with disease severity. TIGIT expression in lung lesions was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis than in patients infected with other pathogens. TIGIT+CD8+ T cells exhibited higher activation and differentiation levels, increased expression levels of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules, and showed gene expression features of natural killer-like cytotoxic effector CD8+ T cells. TIGIT blockade increased the ability of human CD8+ T cells to produce effector molecules and kill intracellular bacteria in vitro. Importantly, blocking TIGIT reduced lung bacterial burden in mice infected with M. tuberculosis. The findings reveal that in active tuberculosis patients, activated CD8+ T cells express TIGIT and blocking TIGIT enhances CD8+ T cell function and promotes clearance of M. tuberculosis. The findings also suggest that TIGIT limits T cell immunity in tuberculosis and implicate TIGIT blockade as a novel strategy for tuberculosis therapy.">

We analyzed RNA sequencing data from 55 glioma patients, estimating immune infiltration with CIBERSORTx and immune cell states via Ecotyper. IDH-wildtype gliomas showed significantly higher immune cell infiltration (p = 0.002), notably of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages, and a greater proportion of exhausted T cells compared to IDH-mutant gliomas. Clustering based on immune profiles revealed two groups. Cluster A, enriched for IDH-wildtype cases, exhibited heightened immune infiltration but also marked immunosuppression. Cluster B, which included both IDH-wildtype and mutant cases, showed lower levels of immune infiltration. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) cultured from IDH-wildtype tumors demonstrated limited expansion following anti-PD-1, a CSF1R inhibitor, or a STAT3 inhibitor treatment, without clear cluster-specific differences. Tumor-reactive TILs were mainly observed in cluster A. These findings highlight that IDH-wildtype gliomas have an immunosuppressive and heterogeneous microenvironment, potentially limiting responses to single-agent immunotherapies. A personalized, multi-targeted approach addressing multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms may be essential to improve immunotherapy outcomes in this aggressive glioma subgroup.">

        <tr id="Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is an effective treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, yet the mechanisms underlying immune reset and sustained remission remain incompletely understood. This study provides a longitudinal immune profiling of patients undergoing AHSCT, with a specific focus on immune reconstitution at two years post-AHSCT.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 22 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients at baseline and multiple time points post-AHSCT. Immune reconstitution was characterized using high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry to assess phenotypic changes in B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells.AHSCT led to profound alterations in immune cell populations. B-cell recovery was marked by a rapid expansion of naïve B cells, while memory B cells and plasmablasts remained depleted. Notably, patients with evidence of inflammatory disease activity (EIDA) post-AHSCT exhibited higher pre-transplant frequencies of non-switched IgD+IgM+ memory B cells, raising the possibility of a potential biomarker for treatment response. Myeloid-cell reconstitution showed a decline in classical monocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, potentially shifting the immune balance toward a more tolerogenic state. CD4 T-cell reconstitution demonstrated a shift from central memory (Tcm) to effector memory (Tem) phenotypes, with a selective depletion of polyfunctional Th1/Th17cells lacking PD-1 expression. Clusters enriched for PD-1+ Tem CD4 T cells appeared to differ between patients with and without EIDA. Furthermore, an increase in atypical naïve CCR7⁻CD62L⁻ CD4 T cells was observed in EIDA patients, raising questions about their role in the pathophysiology of MS. CD8 T-cell reconstitution followed a similar pattern, with a shift from a naïve/Tcm-dominant to a Tem-skewed population, albeit with substantial interpatient variability. Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells showed a sustained decrease, possibly reflecting microbiota alterations post-transplant.Taken together, these findings provide an exploratory characterization of immune reconstitution following AHSCT, highlighting candidate biomarkers and mechanisms that warrant validation in larger cohorts to guide patient stratification and monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered immune cells, particularly CAR T lymphocytes and CAR natural killer (NK) cells, have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. However, their therapeutic efficacy and safety can be influenced by the tumor microenvironment, particularly the presence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs are immunomodulatory cells which can alter the function of tumor-infiltrated immune cells in both supportive and suppressive ways. Results obtained in recently conducted experimental studies demonstrate that MSCs modulate proliferation, cytotoxicity, cytokine production and anti-tumor activity in CAR-expressing immune cells in both a juxtacrine and a paracrine manner. While MSCs can enhance CAR cell viability and persistence through trophic support, they may also impair cytotoxic function and promote an immunosuppressive phenotype under certain conditions. Understanding the dualistic nature of MSCs in CAR-based immunotherapy for malignant diseases is critical for optimizing clinical outcomes. Additionally, MSCs may serve as vehicles for targeted delivery of immunomodulatory agents, and should be considered as active components in the design of next-generation CAR-based immunotherapies. Accordingly, in this review article we emphasize molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in MSC-dependent modulation of CAR-expressing immune cells, paving the way for more efficient CAR-based immunotherapy for malignant diseases.">

        <tr id="Persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) is a severe condition that may follow sepsis and is characterized by ongoing inflammation and immune suppression, diminishing quality of life and potentially causing death. The role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in PICS, despite their association with thrombopoiesis, is not well understood. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile MKs in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained from 11 patients, including six with PICS, five with sepsis, and five healthy controls, to determine the diversity and molecular signatures of the MKs. Five subgroups of MKs are identified (MK1-MK5), and their proportions vary across the groups. MK1 and MK2 are predominant in PICS. Gene Ontology analysis shows that genes related to antigen processing and presentation and IL-17 signaling are enriched in MK1, whereas genes associated with platelet degranulation and neutrophil activation are enriched in MK2. Moreover, the expression level of CCL5 is markedly increased in MKs. Ligand-receptor analysis reveals dynamic interactions among MKs and T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages, suggesting a broad role of MKs in immune homeostasis. In PICS model mice, MKs regulate systemic inflammation by reducing the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A and promoting lung tissue repair. Our findings establish MKs as essential components of the immune system in PICS and provide new insights into their potential as therapeutic targets for post-sepsis immune dysfunction.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Macrophages play essential roles in generating a tolerogenic resident environment, but the interactions between bacteriophages and their action in macrophage tolerance memory remain unknown. Here, we find that gut bacteriophage exposure in vivo induces tolerance immunity via reprogrammed macrophages which significantly enhances protection against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Bacteriophage-memory macrophages orchestrate LPS-challenge responses into tolerization or hyperresponsive gene expression clusters in a function-specific manner. The tolerized gene cluster encodes pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the induction cluster is a defense-specific response including anti-inflammatory cytokines, antiviral and antimicrobial effectors, and negative regulators of inflammation. Mechanistically, this augmented defense response is dependent on increased expression of IL-10, but not suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, bacteriophages suppressed LPS-induced pro-inflammatory genes by repressing histone acetylation target enhancers that coordinate chromatin accessibility to limit inflammation. Thus, our study identifies the function and mechanism of reprogramming actions for bacteriophage in moderating LPS immune responses.">

        <tr id="Orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1, Nur77) plays a crucial role in regulating immune cell metabolism and function within the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus influencing cancer progression and serving as a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. A comprehensive review discussing the multifaceted roles of NR4A1 in immune cells and the exploitation of that knowledge for therapeutic development is lacking in the field. This review explores diverse functions of NR4A1 in tumor-associated immune cells, including T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. NR4A1 contributes to immune regulation by impacting cytokine production, cell differentiation, and immune cell exhaustion. We highlight how NR4A1 in immune cells within the TME may be either a positive (e.g., macrophages in colon cancer) or negative prognostic factor (e.g., T cells in melanoma), depending on the cancer and immune cell context. Additionally, this review also highlights potential therapeutic strategies targeting NR4A1, leading to its inhibition, activation, or degradation to restore immune cell function and enhance anti-tumor immunity. Such therapies could potentially improve patient outcomes by altering immune cell behaviors, blocking intrinsic tumor growth pathways, or via both mechanisms. However, the development of NR4A1-targeted therapies will be dependent on further research to better understand lineage-specific roles of NR4A1 and the underlying mechanisms across different cancer types and immune cells.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) significantly contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and targeted inhibition of MDSCs is a potential therapeutic strategy against cancer. Here, we identify macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as a critical regulator of MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression in breast cancer. The present study demonstrates that MARCO is expressed on MDSCs, and breast tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) enriched with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promote MDSC differentiation and amplify immunosuppressive activity by up-regulating MARCO. Genetic ablation of MARCO in a murine breast cancer model attenuated tumor growth, accompanied by reduced monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) and total tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), along with enhanced infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Furthermore, we developed a specific MARCO down-regulation-promoting monoclonal antibody that impeded TDE-induced MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression. In vivo, MARCO down-regulating antibody suppressed tumor growth and reprogrammed the TME by diminishing immunosuppressive MDSCs and TAMs and revitalizing CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Strikingly, combining the MARCO down-regulating antibody with PD-1 blockade synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. This work establishes MARCO as a key regulator of MDSC-mediated immunosuppression and presents a compelling case for the inclusion of MARCO as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial damage. However, the involvement of immune cells and the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells remain poorly understood. We successfully established a mouse model of viral myocarditis induced by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury at different time points. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) was performed at the peak of immune cell infiltration to characterize the immune landscape of infected cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Macrophage depletion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition were performed to validate the immune‐stromal crosstalk. Peak immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury occurred on the 7th day of infection. scRNA‐seq revealed that endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) were the most substantially expanded cell populations in the hearts of mice with viral infection. Trem2 macrophage, characterized by tissue repair gene signatures, was the predominant MNP subcluster in the infected heart, while tip cells and capillaries were the most expanded endothelial cell clusters. Cell–cell communication analysis identified increased macrophage–endothelial cell interactions during CVB3 infection. Macrophage‐derived VEGFA secretion, partially induced by CVB3 infection and apoptotic cardiomyocyte debris, promoted angiogenesis, while macrophage depletion resulted in reduced VEGFA secretion and endothelial proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the protective role of angiogenesis in myocarditis progression. In summary, these results elucidated a cardioprotective role of macrophage‐driven angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during viral myocarditis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for inflammatory heart diseases.">

        <tr id="Objective Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by infection, characterized by high clinical heterogeneity and complex immunopathological mechanisms. Immune dysregulation plays a central role in its progression. This study aims to investigate the compositional changes of immune cells, characteristics of intercellular communication, and potential regulatory mechanisms of N⁶-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in sepsis, with a particular focus on the functional remodeling of platelets. Methods This study integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE167363 dataset) from sepsis patients with m6A methylation sequencing data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Through systematic analysis, we compared the differences in immune cell composition, developmental trajectories, intercellular communication, and m6A modifications among healthy controls, survivors, and non-survivors, and further screened for key m6A-regulated target genes. Results The analysis revealed that platelets gradually accumulated during the progression of sepsis, while B cells, T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) exhibited a trend toward platelet-like phenotypic remodeling. Cell–cell communication analysis showed a marked decline in communication strength among immune cells as the disease worsened, particularly a significant weakening of the APP–CD74 signaling pathway between platelets and B cells, indicating impaired immune network synergy. m⁶A methylation sequencing revealed distinct remodeling of m⁶A peaks and dysregulation of related regulatory factors in non-survivors. Further integrative analysis identified RPA1 as a key m⁶A-regulated target gene, whose expression was closely associated with APP and co-regulated by multiple m6A-modifying factors. Conclusion This study reveals disruptions in immune cell interactions and an m6A-dependent mechanism of platelet functional remodeling during sepsis progression. The identification of the key target gene RPA1 offers new insights into the immunopathological mechanisms of sepsis and lays a theoretical foundation for future precision interventions and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Unresolved inflammation and fibrosis are the two key features of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive form of steatotic liver disease that can evolve into cirrhosis and liver cancer. Although innate immunity has been well studied in MASH, the role of CD4⁺ T cells remains underexplored despite their potential to coordinate immune responses by providing help to other immune cells, promoting inflammation, or regulating immune activity through effector and regulatory subsets. To better understand the role of CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of MASH, we comprehensively characterized hepatic CD4+ T cells in murine and human MASH at a single-cell protein, transcriptional, and functional level. Mass cytometry and CITE-sequencing revealed a marked shift in intrahepatic CD4⁺ T-cell composition in MASH, with enrichment of Th1, regulatory, and cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells. Similar phenotypic changes were mirrored in the peripheral blood and validated in human MASH samples. Functional assays demonstrated increased production of IFNγ and TNFα by hepatic CD4⁺ T cells, highlighting their proinflammatory effector activity. Transcriptomic profiling identified Tnfrsf4 (OX40) upregulation in hepatic CD4⁺ T cells during MASH. Therapeutic blockade of the OX40L-OX40 axis reversed hepatic fibrosis and improved histologic disease scores in mice with established MASH, and also decreased inflammatory markers in a human ex vivo liver model. Together, these studies provide a proteogenomic single-cell atlas for hepatic CD4⁺ T cells and uncover a CD4⁺ T cell-dependent immunopathogenic circuit as a promising immunotherapeutic target to alleviate MASH and liver fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Background Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapies represent a promising approach for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse, yet their efficacy is hindered by immunosuppressive factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in the tumor microenvironment. This study investigated the effects of TGF-β on NK cell cytotoxicity and migration using 2D and 3D co-culture models that mimic the leukemic microenvironment. Methods TGF-β production was evaluated in AML-derived leukemic cell lines and mesenchymal stromal cells (hTERT-MSCs) using ELISA. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to analyze global gene expression changes in TGF-β-treated primary human NK cells. NK cell cytotoxicity and migration were assessed in 2D monolayer and 3D spheroid co-cultures containing hTERT-MSCs and leukemic cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results Both leukemic cells and MSCs produced TGF-β, with increased levels observed in MSCs after co-culture with primary AML blasts. RNA sequencing revealed that TGF-β altered key gene pathways associated with NK cell cytotoxicity, adhesion, and migration, supporting its immunosuppressive role. In functional assays, TGF-β exposure significantly reduced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a time-dependent manner and impaired NK cell infiltration into 3D spheroids, particularly in models incorporating MSCs. Additionally, MSCs themselves provided a protective environment for leukemic cells, further reducing NK cell effectiveness in 2D co-cultures. Conclusion TGF-β suppresses both NK cell cytotoxicity and migration, limiting their ability to eliminate leukemic cells and infiltrate the bone marrow niche (BMN). These findings provide novel insights into TGF-β–mediated immune evasion mechanisms and provide important insights for the future design of NK-based immunotherapies and clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by pancytopenia and decreased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow, it can be either congenital or acquired, predominantly affecting adolescents and the elderly, with higher incidence in Asia compared to Europe and America. Current treatment options include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or immunosuppressive agents, yet proximately a third of patients fail to reach long-term survival. AA is primarily driven by immune-mediated destruction of HSPCs, initiated by self-activated T cells. Early stages feature a Th1 response, which later shifts to Th17 and effector memory CD8+ T cells. Key cytokines including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) play crucial roles in this immune dysregulation, influencing HSPCs and contributing to bone marrow failure. Furthermore, bone marrow macrophages (MΦ), particularly M1 subtype, are implicated in AA via the TNF-α/TNF-α receptor pathway, leading to T cell activating and subsequent HSPC damage. Interestingly, MΦ with high expression of IL-27Ra have been demonstrated to contribute to HSPC destruction in AA murine models. Beyond their role in thrombosis, platelets also participate in immune regulation. Some studies suggest that platelet may modulate T cell responses through mechanisms such as Akt-PGC1α-TFAM pathway or PF4-mediated activity, which could play a role in AA. However, direct evidence connecting platelet regulation to T cell-mediated HSPC damage is limited, and current research has largely focuses on CD8+ T cells. Moving forward, it is essential to investigate the interactions between platelets, CD4+ T cells, and mitochondrial energy metabolism. In this review, we propose that platelet-derived factors such as PF4 and TGFβ may activate mitochondrial pathways, influencing T cell activation and leading to HSPC destruction in AA. This hypothesis could provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AA and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies (Highlight).">

        <tr id="Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical sentinels of the immune system, serving as indispensable bridges between innate and adaptive immune responses. DCs are a heterogeneous population, with subsets playing specialized roles in immune defense, tolerance, or disease development. Among these, the recently redefined DC3 subset has gained attention for its unique features and potential roles in health and disease. This review focuses on the phenotypic, functional, and developmental diversity of DC subsets—primarily DC3s—and their contributions to cancer. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors is characterized by varying degrees of immune cell infiltration, including DCs. Within the TME, DCs play diverse roles, either promoting anti-tumor responses or facilitating immune evasion. Key subsets include conventional type 1 and type 2 DCs (cDC1s and cDC2s), as well as plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). DC3s share certain features with cDC2s and monocytes but are distinct in their phenotype, function, and ontogeny. Functionally, DC3s can prime and activate T cells, skewing CD4+ T cells towards Th17 and stimulating CD8+ T cells with a tissue-resident memory phenotype. In cancer, their presence correlates with diverse outcomes depending on the TME: DC3 presence is linked to increased survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and oropharyngeal cancer while in non-small-cell lung cancer and melanoma it is associated with immunosuppression. The emerging understanding of DC3s highlights the complexity of DC biology and its relevance to diseases. The dynamic immunomodulatory functions of DC3s open new avenues for developing targeted therapies against cancer and immune-mediated disorders.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV and who initiated antiretroviral therapy (PLH) at the chronic stage of the infection are generally exposed to persistent inflammation. We here assessed the impact of the interferon (IFN)/JAK-STAT pathway on myeloid cells from PLH and the potential of a JAK1/2 inhibitor, Baricitinib, to prevent IFN-driven myeloid cell activation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 16 chronically infected and virologically suppressed PLH were compared to 15 healthy uninfected individuals (UI) before and after exposure to type 1 IFN, type 2 IFN, and Baricitinib. First, we report an increased activation profile on monocytes and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) from PLH compared to UI, associated with a higher expression of PD-L1 and CD11b ex-vivo, and elevated transcription of pd-l1, cxcl-10 and ifnar1. Then, we unveil the role of type 1 and 2 IFN as inducers of PD-L1 expression at the transcriptional and protein level and highlight an increased response to IFN in PLH myeloid cells, associated with the delay before antiretroviral therapy initiation and the level of CD4 T cell depletion. Last, we describe the preventive effects of Baricitinib on IFN-driven PD-L1 expression. Our study shows that PLH harbor signs of myeloid cell activation, associated with increased type 1 and 2 IFN-signaling, which could be reversed by JAK1/2 inhibitors in vitro.

        <tr id="Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines stimulate the immune system to target cancer antigens, representing a promising option for immunotherapy. However, clinical trials have demonstrated limited effectiveness, emphasizing the need for enhanced immune responses. Improving the production of DC vaccines, assessing their impact on immune components, and observing responses could improve the results of DC-based therapies. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a heterogeneous population of innate immune components that generate cytokines and modulate the immune system, potentially enhancing immunotherapies. Recent research highlights the different functions of ILCs in cancer, demonstrating their dual capabilities to promote tumors and exhibit anti-tumor actions. DCs and ILCs actively communicate under physiological and pathological conditions, and the activation of ILCs by DCs or DC vaccines has been shown to influence ILC cytokine production and function. Gaining insights into the interaction between DC-activated ILCs and tumors is essential for creating exciting new therapeutic strategies. These strategies aim to boost anti-tumor immunity while reducing the support that tumors receive. This review examines the effect of DC vaccination on host ILCs, illustrating the complex relationship between DC-based vaccines and ILCs. Furthermore, it explores some exciting strategies to enhance DC vaccines, aiming to boost anti-tumor immune responses by fostering better engagement with ILCs.">

        <tr id="Targeting inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major unmet need. Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2LD) selectively increases regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers in patients with coronary artery disease. Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor analyses and show that IL-2LD clonally expands effector Treg cells in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The clonally expanded Treg cells upregulate key immunosuppressive and metabolic pathways and show an increased number of predicted ligand–receptor interactions. These Treg cells also display similar predicted antigen specificities, which cluster with published sequences specific to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. By tracking the T cell receptors of single cells over time, we identify an inflammatory polarization of the T cell compartment after myocardial infarction, which is restrained by IL-2LD. We identify BACH2 as a repressor of the Treg effector program. However, BACH2-mediated regulation is bypassed with IL-2LD. Overall, these results lend insight into the IL-2-driven clonal expansion program in human Treg cells, with important therapeutic implications for patients with cardiovascular and other immune-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells are well recognized for their role in immune regulation; however, their role in tissue regeneration is not fully understood. This study demonstrates such a role of Tregs in a published preclinical murine model of spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis (PF) expressing a human PF related mutation in the Surfactant Protein-C (SP-C) gene (SFTPCI73T). Genetic crosses of SP-CI73T mice with Foxp3GFP and Foxp3DTR lines were utilized to study Treg behavior during PF development. We found that FoxP3+Tregs accumulate during the transition from inflammation to fibrogenesis, peaking at 21-28 days after mutant SftpcI73T induction localizing to both perivascular and distal fibrotic lung regions. Diphtheria toxin mediated ablation of Tregs at 17 days worsened fibrosis and increased levels of TGFβ and inflammatory cytokines. Tregs expressed Th2 markers (Gata3+) and elaborated factors including amphiregulin (Areg) and Osteopontin (Spp1). Reductionist experiments showed that lung Tregs enhanced organoid formation when co-cultured with alveolar epithelial cells and adventitial fibroblasts, an effect size mimicked using Areg and Spp1 in combination. Our findings demonstrate that immune-mesenchymal-epithelial signaling crosstalk is present in the distal lung wherein Tregs play a protective role by limiting fibrosis and promoting tissue repair, highlighting their broader function beyond immune modulation in lung injury. HIGHLIGHTS In a preclinical model of spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis, regulatory T cells (Tregs) were found to infiltrate the lung coincident with the resolution of early injury and transition to fibrogenesis. Depletion of Tregs at this transition worsened lung injury and enhanced fibrogenesis. Tregs recovered from the fibrotic lung are Type 2 skewed – GATA3+ and produce growth factors (e.g. Amphiregulin, Osteopontin) that promote lung tissue repair in ex vivo organoid models.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Growing evidence links immune dysfunction, notably impaired IFNγ production, to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), but understanding of the immune phenotype in CPA patients remains limited. Methods To investigate this, we recruited 25 CPA patients and 25 controls with bronchiectasis, isolating immune cells from peripheral blood for detailed flow cytometric phenotyping at resting state and after ex vivo stimulation with the TLR2/Dectin-1 agonist Zymosan. Results CPA patients exhibited pronounced neutrophilia and a reduced frequency of conventional dendritic cell (DC) subsets at baseline compared to bronchiectasis controls. Post-stimulation, DC and monocyte subsets in CPA patients showed significantly lower expression of activation markers. Notably, cDC1s displayed reduced IL-12p40, TNFα, and CD86 expression. CPA patients with a history of tuberculosis (TB) had significantly higher frequencies of activated cDC1s. Machine learning analysis validated these immunological parameters as predictive of CPA status. Conclusion Our findings suggest that immune dysfunction in CPA involves DC and monocyte impairments, potentially contributing to IFNγ deficiency through reduced IL-12 production and co-stimulatory capacity in cDC1s. These results also hint at the presence of innate immune memory in CPA patients with prior TB. Our study advances understanding of the immune dysfunction underlying CPA.">

        <tr id="Background Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (VCA) is an important therapeutic option for patients that incur debilitating injuries to the face or limbs. The complexity and immunogenicity of tissue types within VCA grafts pose unique challenges and necessitate the use of intensive immunosuppression; however, graft rejection remains a challenge in VCA. Methods Deep proteomic profiling and high dimensional analysis with cytometry time of flight were used to define the cell types and effector mechanisms elicited by VCA in BALB/c (H-2Kd) > C57BL/6 (H-2Kb) limb recipients. Spleen and cervical draining lymph nodes were collected post-transplant days 1, 3, 5, and 7 (n =4–6 mice/group/day). We identified dynamic, coordinated signatures in T cell and monocyte populations associated with VCA allograft rejection. Results In comparison to syngeneic transplant recipients, allogeneic recipients exhibited significant alterations in the immune cell populations within secondary lymphoid tissues. These changes included very early expansion of double-negative TCRβ- T cells, including IL-17A-producing γδ T cells, and patrolling monocytes. Subsequently, CD8+CD62L+ T cells and CD8+ effector/effector memory T cells (Teff/Tem), Ly6ChiCCR2hiCX3CR1low classical monocytes, CD4+ Teff/Tem, and CD8+CD25hiCCR7low Teff/Tem were increased by day 5. CD8+CD25hiCCR7low Teff/Tem with the highest expression of IFN-γ, perforin, and granzyme B were enriched by day 7. Conclusions High dimensional proteomic analysis reveals multiple innate and Teff/Tem subsets in acute rejection following VCA. In particular, IL-17A-producing γδ T cells and classical monocytes may be particularly important in initiating the alloimmune response in VCA recipients.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized cancer therapy, but their use is limited by the development of autoimmunity in healthy tissues as a side effect of treatment. Such immune-related adverse events (IrAE) contribute to hospitalizations, cancer treatment interruption, and even premature death. ICI-induced autoimmune diabetes mellitus (ICI-T1DM) is a life-threatening IrAE that presents with rapid pancreatic β-islet cell destruction leading to hyperglycemia and life-long insulin dependence. While prior reports have focused on CD8+ T cells, the role for CD4+ T cells in ICI-T1DM is less understood. We identify expansion of CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells expressing IL-21 and IFN-γ as a hallmark of ICI-T1DM. Furthermore, we show that both IL-21 and IFN-γ are critical cytokines for autoimmune attack in ICI-T1DM. Because IL-21 and IFN-γ both signal through JAK/STAT pathways, we reasoned that JAK inhibitors (JAKi) may protect against ICI-T1DM. Indeed, JAKi provide robust in vivo protection against ICI-T1DM in a mouse model that is associated with decreased islet-infiltrating Tfh cells. Moreover, JAKi therapy impaired Tfh cell differentiation in patients with ICI-T1DM. These studies highlight CD4+ Tfh cells as underrecognized but critical mediators of ICI-T1DM that may be targeted with JAKi to prevent this grave IrAE.">

        <tr id="Background The treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), a leading cause of mortality in patients with colorectal cancer, is complicated by type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to investigate the CRLM immune microenvironment in the context of T2D and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods A hyperglycemic CRLM mouse model was established. Seven single-cell RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed, including three peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) datasets (from healthy donors and T2D patients) and four datasets with 20 CRLM samples and matching PBMCs datasets, to explore the immune characteristics and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment in CRLM with concurrent T2D. Results CD8+T cells exhibited dysfunction and exhaustion in liver metastasis from patients with CRLM and T2D; the proportions of various CD4+T cell subpopulations were also altered, and the number of myeloid cells and their function was increased. Myeloid cells in CRLM from patients with T2D exhibited high expression levels of CCL3, which recruited peripheral blood monocytes expressing high levels of CCR1, leading to an accumulation of myeloid cells and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Recruited cells exhibited enhanced T cell communication abilities, indicating an augmented immunosuppressive capacity. In addition, CCR1 expression in peripheral blood monocytes from patients with CRLM was closely correlated with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, suggesting that CCR1 expression levels may predict immune cell phenotype and prognosis in patients with CRLM and T2D. Conclusions Our study revealed complex changes in the tumor microenvironment of patients with CRLM and T2D. In particular, a novel mechanism was identified by which hyperglycemia regulates immunosuppression: the CCL3–CCR1 signaling axis. This finding offers a novel potential therapeutic target for patients with CRLM and T2D and provides an important theoretical basis for the future prediction of the prognosis of these patients.">

The present review provides a comprehensive analysis of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity from both local and systemic perspectives, with particular emphasis on CD8+ T cells as primary effectors. The review discusses how the complex trafficking between the tumor microenvironment (TME), surrounding lymphoid tissues and peripheral circulation creates multiple opportunities for tumors to evade immune surveillance. Within the TME, T-cell exclusion mechanisms, antigen specificity and the spectrum of T-cell exhaustion states, from progenitor exhausted T cells to terminally exhausted T-cell phenotypes, are reviewed. Beyond the local TME, the crucial roles of tumor-draining lymph nodes and tertiary lymphoid structures in maintaining sustainable antitumor immunity, as well as the significance of circulating T cells as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, are analyzed. This systemic perspective provides insights into the dynamic nature of antitumor immunity and suggests potential strategies for next-generation immunotherapies, including combination approaches targeting multiple immune compartments to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Objective: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Chemotherapy is associated with side effects, such as damage to myeloid cells and a reduction in the number of immune cells in patients. In addition, tumor cells hijack the mitochondria of immune cells through tunnel nanotubes, thereby weakening immune ability. Methods: In this study the effects of direct mitochondria transplantation on cancer cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic sensitivity were determined, as well as anti-tumor immunity in in vitro and in vivo lung cancer models. Results: A combination of mitochondrial transplantation and cisplatin chemotherapy was shown for the first time to significantly improve immune infiltration of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and overcome the shortcomings of cisplatin chemotherapy, including damage to myeloid cells and a reduction in the number of immune cells. Conclusions: The findings of the current study provide valuable recommendations for enhancing immune infiltration and augmenting anti-tumor efficacy during chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. In addition, the findings support “mitochondrial transfer” as a novel paradigm in tumor treatment.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells play critical roles in maintaining immune tolerance and tissue homeostasis, but impede anti-tumor immunity. Recent work has established how Treg cells metabolically adapt within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and these adaptations frequently provide a functional advantage over effector T cells. Further, enhanced Treg cell function in the TME may contribute to the limited efficacy of current immunotherapies, especially immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Here, we review recent progress in understanding mechanisms of Treg cell heterogeneity and function in tumors, with a particular focus on cellular metabolism as an underlying factor by which Treg cells are uniquely poised to thrive in the TME and contribute to tumorigenesis. We describe how cellular metabolism and nutrient or metabolic communication shape Treg cell lineage identity and function in the TME. We also discuss the interplay between ICB and Treg cell metabolism and function, and highlight current strategies targeting Treg cell metabolism specifically in the TME. Understanding metabolic control of intratumoral Treg cells provides excellent opportunities to uncover new or combination therapies for cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Immunosenescence describes the gradual remodeling of immune responses, leading to disturbed immune homeostasis and increased susceptibility of older adults for infections, neoplasia and autoimmunity. Decline in cellular immunity is associated with intrinsic changes in the T cell compartment, but can be further pushed by age-related changes in cells regulating T cell immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent inhibitors of T cell activation and function, whose induction requires chronic inflammation. Since aging is associated with low grade inflammation (inflammaging) and increased myelopoiesis, age-induced changes in MDSC induction and function in relation to T cell immunity were analyzed. Results MDSC numbers and functions were compared between “healthy” young and old adults, who were negatively diagnosed for severe acute and chronic diseases known to induce MDSC accumulation. MDSCs were either isolated from peripheral blood or generated in vitro from blood-derived CD14 cells. Aging was associated with significantly increased MDSC numbers in the monocytic- (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSC subpopulations. MDSCs could be induced more efficiently from CD14 cells of old donors and these MDSCs inhibited CD3/28-induced T cell proliferation significantly better than MDSCs induced from young donors. Serum factors of old donors supported MDSC induction comparable to serum factors from young donors, but increased immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs was only achieved by serum from old donors. Elevated immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs from old donors was associated with major metabolic changes and increased intracellular levels of neutral and oxidized lipids known to promote immunosuppressive functions. Independent of age, MDSC-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation required direct MDSC– T cell contact. Besides their increased ability to inhibit activation-induced T cell proliferation, MDSCs from old donors strongly shift the immune response towards Th2 immunity and might thereby further contribute to impaired cell-mediated immunity during aging. Conclusions These results indicate that immunosenescence of innate immunity comprises accumulation and functional changes in the MDSC compartment, which directly impacts T cell functions and contribute to age-associated impaired T cell immunity. Targeting MDSCs during aging might help to maintain functional T cell responses and increase the chance of healthy aging.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite causative links to lymphoproliferative disorders, little is known about early events governing KSHV infection in B lymphocytes. IL‐6 signaling plays a critical role in KSHV‐mediated disease, with human IL‐6 (hIL6) levels correlating with viral load and disease progression. This dynamic is even more complex due to the coexistence of hIL6 and KSHV‐encoded viral IL‐6 (vIL6) in these diseases. We hypothesize that hIL6 and vIL6 play critical, separable and collective roles in the early stages of KSHV infection in B cells. In this study, we use our ex vivo model of KSHV infection in human tonsil lymphocytes to investigate the relative contributions of vIL6 and hIL6 to early infection events in human B cells. We demonstrate that vIL6 and hIL6 collectively suppress KSHV infection in B cells restricting the distribution of KSHV within B cell subsets. We show that vIL6 manipulates hIL6 expression in a subset‐specific manner, and that vIL6 and hIL6 differentially influence the differentiation of germinal center and plasmablasts. Taken together, these results suggest a novel paradigm in which KSHV uses vIL6 to abrogate the GC‐mediated maturation pathway for antibody secreting cells that is driven by hIL6 signaling.">

        <tr id="Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is characterized by a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that enables EOC progression and limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. In this study, we demonstrated that isogenic BRCA2-mutated PEO1 and BRCA2-wild type PEO4 EOC cells induced immunosuppressive TMEs through distinct mechanisms. PEO1 cells produced IFNγ-induced PD-L1 and expressed CD39 and CD73 for generating adenosine. Treatment with the adenosine antagonist CGS15943 reversed PEO1 cell-mediated suppression of effector T cell activation. In contrast, PEO4 cells secreted IFNγ-induced CXCL10 and promoted up-regulation of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Treatment with the CXCL10/CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 attenuated PEO4 cell-induced Tregs and decreased IL10 production. In vivo, administration of a monoclonal antibody against CXCR3 effectively hindered the progression of tumor ascites and prolonged survival in the p53(-/-) ID8 EOC syngeneic mouse model. Additionally, AMG487 treatment synergized with the VEGFA inhibitor bevacizumab, significantly reducing tumor ascites and extending mouse survival. Collectively, our results reveal that EOC leverages CXCL10-induced Tregs or adenosine signaling to dampen T cell-mediated anti-cancer immune responses. These findings suggest that targeting CXCL10/CXCR3 and adenosine signaling could effectively counter immunosuppression of EOC, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for improving patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Introduction Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a recently characterized subset of lymphocytes with critical effector and regulatory functions. Based on distinct phenotypic markers and cytokine secretion profiles, ILCs are classified into three subtypes: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) is characterized by heightened cytokine levels and dysregulated inflammatory responses, potentially affecting immune cell composition. In this study, we aimed to assess the frequency and absolute number of ILCs in the BM and peripheral blood (PB) of healthy individuals (HI) and compare them to those in MDS-BM. Methods ILC subsets were identified and quantified using multiparameter flow cytometry and histological analysis of BM and PB samples. Results ILC1 populations were consistently detected in all PB and BM samples. In contrast, ILC2 and ILC3 subsets were present in both BM and PB of healthy individuals but were largely absent in MDS-BM samples. Additionally, our findings suggest the existence of a potential maturation trajectory for BM-resident ILCs. Discussion These data indicate a disruption in the ILC maturation continuum within the MDS-affected BM compared to healthy BM, potentially contributing to the immunopathogenesis of MDS.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that plays a critical role in disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, exhibit dual functions, either promoting or suppressing tumor growth depending on their phenotype and interactions within the TME. The presence of immune evasion mechanisms, such as the loss of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression, upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, and metabolic reprogramming (hypoxia-induced glycolysis and lactate accumulation), further contributes to immune suppression and poor treatment responses. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, response rates remain highly variable, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven patient selection and combinatorial therapeutic strategies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of immune cells in the TME of HNSCC, discusses the mechanisms underlying immune escape, and explores emerging immunotherapeutic and epigenetic-targeting approaches aimed at enhancing antitumor immune responses and improving clinical outcomes.">

 Background:
 Despite the transformational impact of immune checkpoint blockade, many cancer patients do not experience long-term survival. T cells with innate immune signatures can secrete inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and deliver potent cytotoxic signals potentially ideal for tumor immunity. The novel double-stranded RNA sensor RIG-I agonist SLR14 improved the control of murine melanoma. We tested the hypothesis that SLR14 transforms T cells to a cytotoxic state in immunologically “cold” human tumor specimens.
 Methods:
 We developed an approach, called PERCEPT, to directly test the response of patient tumor and immune samples to novel and established therapies
 ex vivo
 using perturbational single-cell RNA sequencing (Table). We obtained 9 surgical resections from primary or metastatic melanoma and Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) tumors and lymph node metastases and made suspension replicates of tumor and infiltrating immune cell co-cultures. We stimulated for 42-48 hours (Table). We Flourescently Activated Cell Sorted live cells and then barcoded for multiplexed single-cell sequencing using 10x scRNAseq. We used CINEMA-OT to identify factors associated with response and resistance to the perturbations tested. We developed and validated CRISPR-KO MCC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, and co-cultured with CD14+ monocytes or monocyte-derived DCs.
 Results:
 Stimulation with RIG-I agonist SLR14 induced expression beyond canonical IFN-stimulated genes in tumor cells, NK cells, and T cells. SLR14 stimulates tumor-infiltrating T cells into antiviral states in tumor-immune co-cultures and primes
 in vitro
 T-cell production of IFNγ. However, MCC immune infiltrate responsiveness to IFN or SLR14 was notably decreased compared to the melanoma samples, and perturbational computational analyses with CINEMA-OT identified the cytokine midkine (MDK) associated with nonresponse in MCC. Knockout of MDK restored response to IFN and SLR14 by MCC and SCLC tumor cell lines, as well as co-cultured CD14+ monocytes or monocyte-derived DCs.
 Conclusions:
 Our approach revealed that midkine, a multifunctional cytokine, suppresses innate immune sensing of IFN and SLR14 in both tumor and immune cells, disrupting the tumor immunity cycle at multiple points. We show that this effect, while comparatively infrequent in melanoma, is pronounced in MCC and SCLC. Our study thus uses a direct assessment of patient tumor and immune samples to identify a novel resistance mechanism enriched in neuroendocrine tumors MCC and SCLC.

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) is commonly labeled a “cold tumor” due to its dense population of immunosuppressive cells, particularly M2-like macrophages, which contribute to its resistance to therapy. Thus, there is a pressing need to shift the macrophage polarization towards M1 and revitalize the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to improve BC prognosis. In this study, we leveraged published RNA-sequencing data and performed multiplex immunohistochemistry on clinical specimens to identify NR4A3 as a promising biomarker for favorable outcomes in BC. High NR4A3 expression correlates with an inflamed TIME, characterized by heightened T-cell infiltration and activation. NR4A3 was preferentially expressed in macrophages and fostered M1-like macrophage polarization through direct binding to p65, thereby enhancing NF-κB transcriptional activity. Overexpression of Nr4a3 in tumor-infiltrating macrophages significantly inhibited the growth of E0771 tumors in a syngeneic mouse model, accompanied by increased T-cell infiltration and elevated production of functional cytokines. Conversely, suppression of Nr4a3 in macrophages compromised T-cell recruitment and diminished their anti-tumor capabilities. Consistent with these findings, co-culture experiments involving human T cells and NR4A3-overexpressing THP1 cells further demonstrated enhanced T-cell functionality. Collectively, our findings uncover a novel role for NR4A3 in macrophage polarization and TIME remodeling, offering a potential biomarker for favorable BC prognosis and a therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.">

        <tr id="Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) typically present with widespread metastasis, obscuring a temporal understanding of tumor-immune dynamics. To address this, we perform multi-site global proteomics alongside matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. We order the protein expression profiles using an unbiased pseudotime analysis, recapitulating clinical observations of metastatic progression, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlates with immune cell infiltration, the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to counterbalance γδ T cell abundance, and an increased abundance of exhausted CD8⁺ T cells. The accumulation of Tregs at metastatic sites correlates with SNX8 expression, a critical regulator of the STING pathway. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruit Tregs via MHC class II, fostering an inflammatory phenotype with limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Together, our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with both localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC.">

        <tr id="Lung metastasis remains a leading cause of cancer mortality, driven not only by primary tumors but crucially by dynamic interactions within the premetastatic niche (PMN). Emerging evidence reveals that organ‐specific PMN formation precedes tumor cell arrival, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to metastatic colonization. Primary tumor‐derived factors interact with lung resident cells, promoting the recruitment of bone marrow‐derived cells and creating a favorable microenvironment for the migrating tumor cells. Despite progress, systematic integration of PMN's multilayered regulatory mechanisms—from mechanism to clinical application remains lacking. The review summarizes recent studies investigating the effects of PMN in the entire process of lung metastasis. Our discussion revolves primarily around extracellular vesicles, extracellular matrix remodeling, proinflammation, immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming. We emphasize the impact of various treatment strategies for primary tumors on the PMN in clinical practice, while also summarizing current diagnostic methods and exploring new therapeutic possibilities in the PMN. Finally, we propose a roadmap for future investigations into the lung PMN, highlighting prioritized research axes that bridge mechanistic discoveries with bench‐to‐bedside translation of PMN‐targeted interventions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives The beneficial influence of exercise on outcomes such as infection control and cancer prevention has been attributed partly to the immune system response during physical exertion. CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in immune surveillance, and in this study, we performed an in‐depth analysis of the impact of supramaximal high‐intensity exercise (HIIT) on CD8+ T‐cell dynamics and function, which are currently lacking in the literature. Methods CD8+ T cells obtained from healthy human subjects before and after 3 × 30 s of HIIT were analysed ex vivo for viability and expansion properties, metabolic function using SeaHorse, IFN‐gamma release using EliSpot, phenotype using RNA‐seq and flow cytometry, and cytotoxic capacity by co‐culture with HEK293T cells. Results Exercise led to a threefold increase in CD8+ T‐cell count, and CD8+ T cells obtained after exercise had a more cytotoxic profile. Post‐exercise CD8+ T cells had a lower glycolytic capacity than pre‐exercise cells, and incubation of pre‐exercise CD8+ T cells with post‐exercise serum replicated this metabolic shift, suggesting a systemic effect of exercise on CD8+ T‐cell metabolism. Importantly, CD8+ T cells maintained their viability and expansion properties despite the metabolic challenges induced by exercise. Functionally, post‐exercise CD8+ T cells showed increased release of IFN‐gamma and an enhanced unspecific cell killing capacity as demonstrated by co‐culture with the immortalised cell line HEK293T. Conclusion The pronounced increase in the total number of circulating CD8+ T‐cells with an increased cytotoxic capacity suggests a potential improvement in immune surveillance after acute HIIT.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract with rising incidence and an unclear etiology. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have recently emerged as key regulators of mucosal immunity and tissue homeostasis and are increasingly implicated in IBD. Unlike adaptive lymphocytes, ILCs do not require antigen recognition and clonal expansion to respond rapidly to environmental cues and shape immune responses. In a healthy gut, ILCs maintain intestinal homeostasis by guarding the epithelial barrier, protecting against pathogens, and mounting proper responses to external insults. However, their altered differentiation, proliferation, recruitment, activation, and interaction with other host cells, microbiota, and environmental stimuli may contribute to IBD. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding murine and human ILCs in the context of intestinal inflammation and IBD. A deeper understanding of ILC-mediated immune mechanisms may offer novel therapeutic strategies for restoring intestinal homeostasis and improving personalized management of IBD.">

        <tr id="Background Aging is linked to various dysfunctions of the immune system, including the decline of its primary developmental source: the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. This decline leads to chronic inflammation, increased vulnerability to infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and reduced vaccine efficacy. As individuals age, the HSC niche undergoes significant changes, including greater adipocyte accumulation and alterations in the molecular microenvironment, which may influence the development and function of immune cells. Among these cells, the impact of the aging HSC niche on dendritic cell (DC) function is less understood. Heterochronic autologous HSC transplantation is a promising intervention to prevent age-related disorders, contributing to the extension of healthspan and longevity, however, several murine experiments failed to produce the expected results, which led us to presume that the problem lies within the old HSC niche. Therefore, we created in vitro models of young and old HSC niches and examined how these microenvironments affect the differentiation and maturation and functionality of BM-derived DCs (BMDCs). Results An analysis of the conditioned media from young and aged HSC niches revealed that the environment of aged niches exhibited an increased presence of adiponectin. This media was subsequently utilized in BMDC differentiation and maturation protocols, with their effects closely monitored. Our results indicate that the old HSC niche microenvironment promotes premature BMDC activation, characterized by elevated MHC class II expression and enhanced allostimulatory capacity of BMDCs at their immature stage. Additionally, LPS stimulation of BMDCs, used to induce DC maturation, significantly increased CD86 expression on BMDCs from the aged niche. However, these cells did not show superior allostimulatory capacity compared to their counterparts from the young niche environment. By analyzing the BMDC cytokine profile, we observed that when cultured in aged niche-conditioned media, the BMDCs secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6, indicating a heightened proinflammatory activation state. Conclusions Collectively, our findings suggest that aging-related changes within the HSC niche can considerably alter DC functionality by disrupting their normal development from BM precursors. These results emphasize the significance of this phenomenon and its implications for immunosenescence.

 Background:
 Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that engage in direct cytotoxic responses against malignant cells and promote pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironments. While studies have predominantly focused on conventional NK cell subsets, recent findings uncovered adaptive and tissue-resident (TR) subsets with unique functional properties. The influence of distinct NK cell subsets on tumor immunobiology and clinical outcomes remains unknown.
 Methods:
 Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of primary, therapy-naïve tumors from 276 patients across 14 cancer types, as well as 39 patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), was accessed through publicly available datasets. We employed systematic computational analyses to phenotype and examine intra-tumoral NK cells. Gene signatures for NK cell subsets were applied to bulk RNA-sequencing from 212,105 tumor samples to delineate their associations with clinical outcomes using the Caris CODEai database.
 Results:
 Six main subsets of NK cells were identified in solid tumors, including conventional CD56
 dim
 and CD56
 bright
 NK cells, alongside adaptive, TR adaptive, TR CD56
 bright
 , and TR CD56
 bright
 /adaptive subsets. Across cancer, TR adaptive NK cells emerged as the most prognostic subset, with high infiltration conferring significantly longer overall survival (HR[95% CI] = 0.68[0.66-0.69], p < 0.001) than conventional CD56
 dim
 and CD56
 bright
 subsets. This was also observed in cohorts of head and neck, non-small cell lung, and esophageal cancers, particularly those treated with ICB. Notably, elevated TR adaptive NK cell infiltration was more prognostic than high tumor mutational burden in these settings. This was most apparent in ICB-treated head and neck cancers (HR = 0.48[0.41-0.57], p < 0.001 vs HR = 0.90[0.76-1.04], p = 0.16). Additionally, TR adaptive NK cells were strongly correlated to the infiltration of CD8
 +
 T cells and B cells in tumors. Underlying these observations, our scRNA-seq analyses demonstrated that TR adaptive NK cells exhibit the highest immunomodulatory activity of all subsets, expressing high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (
 CCL3
 ,
 CXCL13
 , and
 IFNG
 ) and low levels of immunosuppressive cytokines (
 TGFB1
 ). Mechanistically, this activity was linked to the upregulation of transcription factors associated with NK cell activation, function, and persistence and downregulation of genes related to stress response and exhaustion. Interestingly, scRNA-seq from paired pre- and post-ICB-treated tumors revealed a unique expansion of cytotoxic
 GZMB
 + TR adaptive NK cells after treatment.
 Conclusions:
 TR adaptive NK cells represent a novel subset of NK cells that may drive anti-tumor immune responses, particularly in the context of ICB treatment. Features of this unique population may be harnessed to design more effective NK cell-based therapies against solid tumors.

        <tr id="Neutrophils are the first line of defense in nonspecific immunity (innate immunity) and interact with other immune cells to participate in specific defense mechanisms (adaptive immunity). Studies have shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) mediates tumor development and recruits neutrophils into tumors to become tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), an important part of TME, and achieve extended lifespan. TANs can be differentiated into the antitumor or protumor phenotype, and play an important role in tumor occurrence, proliferation and recurrence, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, cell necrosis, and so on. Here, we summarize the TAN origin and subtypes found through Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in different types of tumors in recent literature, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their antitumor and protumor effects on tumors. We focus on the interaction between TANs and immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory TME, as well as signal pathways such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) associated with TAN phenotype transition. Based on the summarized mechanisms, we focus on the potential application and latest strategies of TAN-based immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and combination therapy in the preclinical study and clinical trials of tumors. The discussion on promising therapy encompasses five key areas: inhibition of the tumor-promoting effect of TANs, enhancement of the antitumor effect of TANs, targeting the interaction between TANs and the TME, reprogramming of TANs, and drug delivery carriers. Finally, we discuss the potential of TANs and their related markers as emerging biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of cancer patients.">

 Background:
 Reprogramming or repolarizing tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has emerged as a novel strategy in tumor immunotherapy, leveraging their remarkable plasticity. Our previous studies have demonstrated that SLAMF8, predominantly expressed in macrophages, is a promising biomarker for predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aims to elucidate further the regulatory role of SLAMF8 in TAMs and its influence on the tumor immune microenvironment.
 Methods:
 In vitro, M2 macrophage and TAM models were established to investigate the regulatory role of SLAMF8 in macrophage immunophenotypic transition and its impact on CD8+ T cell function using qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and co-culture assays. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis of RNA-seq data and western blotting were conducted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. In vivo, SLAMF8-specific small interfering RNA (siSLAMF8) was utilized to inhibit SLAMF8 expression in subcutaneous colorectal cancer (CRC) tumor models. Subsequent observations included tumor growth monitoring and analysis of immune cell infiltration via flow cytometry. Furthermore, two subcutaneous tumor models, one sensitive and one resistant to PD-1 therapy, were constructed to explore potential synergistic effects between SLAMF8 inhibition and anti-PD-1 treatment.
 Results:
 In vitro studies reveal that SLAMF8 facilitates the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, contributing to the immunosuppressive characteristics of TAMs and dysfunction of CD8+ T cells. Inhibiting SLAMF8 in vivo significantly delayed colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the infiltration of anti-tumor TAMs (CD86+ F4/80+) and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (IFNγ+ GZMB+ CD8+ T cells) was augmented, while the infiltration of pro-tumor TAMs (CD206+ F4/80+) and exhausted CD8+ T cells (PD1+ LAG3+ CD8+ T cells) was reduced in tumors treated with SLAMF8-specific small interfering RNA (siSLAMF8). Additionally, targeting SLAMF8 enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. Mechanistically, Western blotting experiments confirmed that the phosphorylation levels of key molecules in the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways were significantly increased in SLAMF8-overexpressing macrophages.
 Conclusions:
 Inhibition of SLAMF8 delays tumor growth, enhances the sensitization to ICI therapy, and reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment by modulating TAMs via the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT3 pathways in CRC. These findings reveal the potential of SLAMF8 as a therapeutic target for immunotherapy focused on TAMs.

While αβ CAR-T therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in hematological malignancies, its efficacy in solid tumors remains constrained mainly by factors such as antigen heterogeneity, immunosuppressive microenvironments, and on-target/off-tumor toxicity. To overcome these limitations, emerging CAR platforms that utilize alternative immune effectors, including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and γδ T lymphocytes, are rapidly gaining traction. This review systematically analyzes the mechanistic advantages of CAR-NK, CAR-M, and CAR-γδ T cell therapies, while critically evaluating persistent challenges in clinical translation, including limited cell persistence, manufacturing scalability, and dynamic immune evasion mechanisms.

        <tr id="Standing as the most aggressive form of primary malignant tumor, Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors with marked heterogeneity represents one of the enormous challenges in glioma treatment. Myeloid cells, which includes neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, microglia, and macrophages, play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment of GBM. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), T cells and natural killer (NK) cells exert anti-tumor functions, whereas myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can promote tumor progression by suppressing these immune responses. Therefore, MDSCs play a critical role in shaping the effectiveness of immunotherapy. TME has constrained the ability of traditional GBM treatment approaches to significantly enhance prognostic outcomes for patients. This category encompasses conventional therapies like surgical resection and radiation therapy, along with cutting-edge methodologies such as immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a high-mortality cancer due to its aggressive nature and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which enables evasion of immune surveillance. Despite chemotherapy and targeted therapies, 5-year survival is ~ 30%, necessitating novel immunotherapies. AML suppresses cytotoxic T/NK cells by co-opting regulatory pathways, creating an “immune paradox.” Emerging strategies aim to disrupt this evasion. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 nivolumab and anti-CD47 magrolimab, combined with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), enhance T-cell activity and phagocytosis, especially in TP53-mutated AML. Therapeutic vaccines targeting leukemia-associated antigens (e.g., WT1, PRAME) via dendritic cell fusion show early success in prolonging remission. Combinatorial approaches, like HMAs with STING agonists or dual checkpoint blockade, target multiple immunosuppressive pathways to overcome resistance. Challenges include TME heterogeneity, therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells, toxicities (e.g., anemia, cytokine release syndrome), relapse from clonal evolution, and a lack of predictive biomarkers. Autologous therapies face economic and logistical hurdles, driving demand for scalable solutions. Advances in single-cell genomics, AI, and synthetic biology are identifying novel targets (TIM-3, TIGIT, VISTA) and improving patient stratification. Integrating these innovations may transform AML into a chronic condition, bridging preclinical potential to clinical impact. In this review, we aim to evaluate mechanisms, challenges, and future directions of immunotherapies in AML with highlighting ICIs and vaccination to improve therapeutic outcomes.">

In immature DCs, GSK-3β is continuously active, and its inhibition has been shown to enhance DC maturation and function. As a key upstream kinase of β-catenin, GSK-3 inhibition activates β-catenin in both human and murine DCs—a pathway traditionally linked to its immunomodulatory effects. However, our recent findings challenge this paradigm by uncovering β-catenin-independent, dual roles of GSK-3β in DCs. Our study reveals that while GSK-3β enhances DC-mediated cross-priming of CD8 T cells, it concurrently impairs the generation of memory CD8 T cells. These findings have significant implications for vaccine development and cancer immunotherapy, where both effective T-cell priming and durable memory responses are critical. This mini-review provides an in-depth analysis of mechanistic insights into GSK-3β’s paradoxical functions and discusses potential strategies to fine-tune GSK-3 activity for optimized immunotherapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression heavily relies on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In the ccRCC TME, the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) drive a self-perpetuating cycle of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance through diverse interactions between cells and molecules. Furthermore, heterogeneous CAFs facilitate tumor growth through metabolic reprogramming and modulate immune suppression by driving the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which promote a multilayered immunosuppressive network. In addition, CAFs reshape the mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM), hinder the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and further exacerbate immune escape. Moreover, CAF-derived exosomes can confer resistance to chemoradiation therapy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) secreted by CAFs synergizes with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to facilitate adaptive resistance to targeted therapy. Emerging therapeutic strategies—including fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted CAR-T cells and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) inhibitors—can partially reverse this immunosuppressive property. Combination therapies employing immune checkpoint inhibitors and VEGF antagonists exhibit promising synergistic effects, although the clinical translation remains hampered by CAF heterogeneity, dual functional roles, and the lack of specific biomarkers. Future studies should integrate single-cell sequencing and spatial multi-omics techniques to comprehensively analyze the spatio-temporal dynamic heterogeneity of CAF subpopulations and develop precision treatment strategies based on molecular subtyping, aiming to break the vicious cycle of “CAF-TME-resistance” in ccRCC.">

        <tr id="Background T cells are crucial in destroying pancreatic β cells, resulting in insulitis in type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, only 1% to 2% of infiltrating CD8+ T cells are specific for islet autoantigens. The mechanisms driving non-cognate T cells to the islets and their potential pathogenic roles remain unclear. Methods We analyzed the frequency and function of circulating gut-tropic immune cells in 99 patients with T1D and 57 healthy controls. We also analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing on pancreata from 10 T1D donors, 11 autoantibody-positive donors, and 15 non-diabetic controls. Correlation analysis was performed to elucidate the relationship between gut-tropic cells and clinical variables. In NOD mice, we examined gut-tropic T cell frequencies, cytokine profiles, and cytotoxicity at different disease stages. Additionally, we investigated the role of integrin α4β7 on gut-tropic T cells function and migration. Results Gut-tropic CD8+ T cells are reduced in peripheral blood but elevated in pancreatic islets of patients with T1D, correlating with impaired β-cell function. Gut-tropic CD8+ T cells exhibited stronger cytokine production than non-gut-tropic counterparts. In NOD mice, gut-tropic cells increased in the islets and decreased in the blood during insulitis progression. Gut-tropic CD8+ T cells showed augmented cytokine production and cytotoxicity against islet cells. Integrin α4β7 was a key mediator of the pathogenicity of CD8+ T cells and upregulated by the inflammatory signals. Insulitis directly drove gut-tropic CD8+ T cells migrating to inflamed islets. Conclusions Gut-tropic CD8+ T cells bridge the intestinal immune system and the pathogenesis of T1D, offering potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.">

A key mediator of immune evasion in ovarian cancer is the infiltration and activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which suppress antitumor immunity and foster therapeutic resistance. Emerging therapeutic strategies to target Tregs—such as cytokine modulation, checkpoint blockade, metabolic inhibitors, and epigenetic regulators—are critically evaluated for their potential to restore antitumor immunity. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding how the ovarian TME shapes Treg biology, highlighting mechanisms such as cytokine signaling, chemokine-driven recruitment, metabolic reprogramming, and immune checkpoint interactions, as well as the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, including tissue-resident and follicular subsets, and their clonal expansion in response to tumor antigens.

Disruption of the tightly regulated balance between immune activation and tolerance induction leads to the development and worsening of immune-related liver diseases. T cells play diverse crucial roles in the immune system, and they have long been known to induce inflammation through direct tissue damage by effector molecules and the recruitment of effector cells via chemokines. Additionally, T cells interact with B cells to induce autoantibodies, promoting tissue inflammation and dysfunction through the deposition of IgG and immune complexes in the tissues. Recent advances in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have elucidated the role of T cells in the progression and recovery of liver fibrosis. Moreover, comprehensive and unbiased information can now be obtained from small samples of human and mouse tissues, which advances our understanding of tissue-specific functions of T cells, including resident memory T cells, peripheral helper T cells, and tissue Tregs. However, significant unmet needs remain in the fields of immune-related liver diseases. In this review, we discuss the T cell biology and its role in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which are non-viral liver diseases exhibiting a strong involvement of immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, the latest therapeutic concepts for the diseases and associated drugs targeting T cells have been overviewed.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are a type of tissue-restricted memory T cells with terminal differentiation and a memory function. They exist in mucosal tissues for a long period. In the absence of disease, TRM cells promote essential inflammation, which reinforces the intestinal barrier and prevents bacterial translocation. However, in inflammatory or autoimmune environments, TRM cells are hyperactivated. This heightened activity causes the host to release excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in local immune imbalances and damage to the barrier, ultimately leading to tissue lesions. Numbers of studies have shown that TRM cells play a crucial role in the development and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), suggesting that targeted regulation of TRM cells homeostasis may be an important strategy for treating IBD. Here, we compiled the existing understanding of the role of TRM cells in IBD, with particular emphasis on the associated mechanisms and approaches for targeting TRM cells in IBD treatment. This review will serve as a foundation for a better understanding of IBD development and enhancing the effectiveness of clinical treatments for IBD.">

However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

 Background:
 The liver is a frequent site of metastasis and carries a poor prognosis in patients with non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Patients with liver metastases (LM) derive limited benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), due to hepatic myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) mediated T cell elimination. Here, we used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to perform single cell, highly multiplexed, analysis of LM and primary lung tumors to investigate how vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) influences T cell depletion within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of LM.
 Methods:
 We comprehensively characterizedthe TIME in LM and primary lung tumors in 21 patients with NSCLC or SCLC using IMC. A panel of 40 antibodies was assembled to interrogate immune subsets and VEGF pathway markers. Each antibody was conjugated to a unique metal isotope. After validation, the antibody cocktail was used to stain the biopsies. Tissue images were segmented using Mesmer, and hierarchical clustering was applied to single-cell expression data to identify phenotypes. Similar clustering of cell neighbor profiles was applied to obtain spatial motifs. Phenotypic and motif frequencies, together with functional expression across phenotypes, were compiled from all samples and compared across conditions.
 Results:
 Initial visualization of the raw, unsegmented data revealed higher infiltration of CD8
 +
 and CD4
 +
 T cells in LM compared to the lung TIME. After segmentation, marker expression heatmaps uncovered complex cell-cell interaction ecosystems. The liver samples were enriched with M2 macrophages (CD163
 +
 ), MDSC (CD11b
 +
 ), and proliferative endothelial cells (CD105
 +
 ) whereas the lung samples were enriched in tumor cells (TTF1
 +
 for NSCLC and INSM1
 +
 /synaptophysin
 +
 for SCLC) and T cells (CD4
 +
 , CD8
 +
 ). Spatial neighborhood profiling of NSCLC liver tissues identified 12 neighborhood types, showing a general trend of mutual exclusivity between MDSCs and CD4
 +
 /CD8
 +
 T cells across neighborhoods. Notably, CD8
 +
 T cells in MDSC-enriched neighborhoods exhibited consistently higher FAS expression, a key apoptotic marker. Heterogenous FAS and VEGF signaling across neighborhoods suggested a mixed immune-suppressive and vascularized response in the liver TIME, supporting VEGF’s role in mediating MDSC-driven hepatic CD8
 +
 T cell depletion in patients with LM.
 Conclusions:
 Our findings highlight significant differences in the TIME between LM and primary lung tumors, with LM demonstrating a more immunosuppressive and VEGF-enriched milieu. The spatial association of MDSCs with CD8
 +
 T cells, along with elevated FAS expression and VEGF signaling suggests a mechanistic role for VEGF in driving immune evasion within liver tumors. These results underscore the potential of VEGF blockade as a therapeutic strategy to overcome T cell suppression and improve ICI efficacy in patients with lung cancer metastatic to liver (NCT05588388, PI Sankar).

        <tr id="Mouse models serve as a means of examining immune changes when genes of interest are knocked out (KO). One group of immune gene-producing cells that have been identified is type 2 innate lymphoid cells (Ilc2). These cells are involved in the production of Th2 equivalent immune responses and signal cytokine production during the resolution of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis parasite infection in mice lungs. However, many questions about Ilc2 activity in the gut remain. To study this, retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα)-deficient mice were infected with adult N. brasiliensis and arranged into four treatment groups. Ten days post-infection (dpi), mouse ileum tissue was extracted for RNA-Seq. The RORα-deficient mice showed little change in gene expression at 10 dpi (N = 51) when compared to the WT mice at 10 dpi (N = 915), displaying dysregulation within the mouse gut. Based on the results, the gene expression in the gut of Ilc2-deficient mice denoted that the inability to craft Ilc2 cells left the mice unable to mount classical helminth immune responses involving humoral, mast cell, and antibody Th2-driven reactions. Overall, the results showed the importance of Ilc2 in the gut during N. brasiliensis infections and the effect that the lack of these cells had on immunity.">

        <tr id="Introduction The prognostic management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a challenge for clinicians. This study aims to construct a novel risk model for AML patient through comprehensive analysis of scRNA and bulk RNA data to optimize the precise treatment strategies for patients and improve prognosis. Methods and Results scRNA-seq classified cells into nine clusters, including Bcells, erythrocyte, granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), hematopoietic stem cell progenitors (HSC/Prog), monocyte/macrophagocyte (Mono/Macro), myelocyte, neutrophils, plasma, and T/NK cells. Functional analysis demonstrated the important role of inflammation immune response in the pathogenesis of AML, and the leukocyte transendothelial migration and adhesion in the process of inflammation should be noticed. ssGSEA method identified four core cells including GMP, HSC/Prog, Mono/Macro, and myelocyte for subsequent analysis, which contains 1,594 marker genes. Furthermore, we identified AML-associated genes (2,067genes) and DEGs (1,010genes) between AML patients and controls usingGSE114868dataset. After performing intersection, univariate Cox, and LASSO analysis, we obtained a prognostic model based on the expression levels of five signature genes, namely, CALR, KDM1A, SUCNR1, TMEM220, and ADM. The prognostic model was then validated by two external datasets. Patients with high-risk scores are predisposed to experience poor overall survival. Further GSEA analysis of risk-model-related genes revealed the significant differences in inflammatory response between high-and low-risk groups. Conclusion In conclusion, we constructed an inflammation related risk model using internal scRNA data and external bulk RNA data, which can accurately distinguish survival outcomes in AML patients.">

        <tr id="Background Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has shown limited efficacy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-15 has been identified as a novel immune evasion biomarker, while the role of Siglec-10 in the specific immune suppressive tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Methods Immunohistochemical assays were employed to investigate the correlation of the expressions of Siglec-10 and Siglec-15 with the clinicopathological features as well as the prognosis of immunotherapy in patients with HNSCC. The Gene Expression Omnibus datasets were used to identify the upstream transcriptional regulators of SIGLEC10 in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the downstream biological functions it mediates. These findings were then validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The impact of Siglecg deficiency on the efficacy of immunotherapy and the activation of CD8+T cells was analyzed in mouse HNSCC tumor-bearing models. Results The expression of Siglec-G/10, rather than that of Siglec-15, was positively correlated with immune suppressive marker programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and was associated with cervical lymph node metastasis, poorer pathologic stage, and lower sensitivity to immunotherapy. Siglecg deficiency rescued the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment, as evidenced by decreased TAM-associated phenotype and increased CD8+T cell infiltration and activation, which inhibited tumor growth significantly. Single-cell sequence and transcription factor prediction revealed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) could induce Siglec-G/10 transcription. Interleukin (IL)-4 could upregulate Siglec-G/10 expression significantly via STAT6 activation, as proved by overexpression and inhibition of STAT6. Signal transduction mechanism revealed that Siglec-G/10 could promote TAM differentiation and activation via increasing HIF1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α) expression. Furthermore, Siglecg deficiency could enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor, and increase the infiltration and cytotoxic functions of CD8+T cells. Conclusions Our results suggest that high Siglec-G/10 expression aggravates the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and impedes the immunotherapy efficacy in HNSCC, which indicates that targeting Siglec-G/10 may represent a promising therapeutic option for improving the immunotherapy efficacy in HNSCC.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constitutes more than 90% of the primary tumor of the liver. Metabolic reprogramming is decisive in promoting HCC development. The new metabolic program drives the surrounding immune cells to an immune suppressive commitment, enabling tumor survival. The enhanced metabolic activity of cancer cells leads to competition for essential nutrients, depriving non-malignant cells of critical resources. Simultaneously, the accumulation of metabolic byproducts within the tumor microenvironment (TME) selectively favors innate immune responses while impairing adaptive immunity. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy underscore the importance of targeting both immune cell function and metabolic pathways. In this context, reprogramming the metabolism of effector and regulatory immune cells represents a promising therapeutic avenue. This review focuses on a relatively underexplored aspect of liver cancer immunology, the immunosuppressive role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) driven by metabolic alterations and how these mechanisms contribute to the suppression of effective anti-tumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Introduction Severe injury, including burn trauma, leads to profound immune dysfunction, yet the mechanisms driving these changes remain incompletely defined. This lack of understanding has hindered efforts to modulate the immune response effectively. Additionally, a clear biomarker profile to guide clinicians in identifying burn patients at high risk for poor clinical outcomes is lacking. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as novel mediators of immune dysfunction in various pathologies. Prior studies in mouse models have demonstrated that plasma EVs increase following burn injury and contribute to immune dysfunction. Furthermore, EVs have potential as biomarkers for predicting extended hospital stays in burn patients. This study hypothesizes that human EVs, purified early and late after burn injury, will exhibit immune reprogramming effects similar to those observed in mice and that specific EV protein cargo may serve as biomarkers of immune and physiological responses to burn injury. Methods EVs were isolated from the plasma of burn-injury patients at early (<72h) and late (≥14 days) time points post-injury. Using unbiased immune transcriptome and bioinformatic causal network analyses, the immunomodulatory effects of these EVs were assessed in human THP-1 macrophages. Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics and pathway analyses were conducted to characterize the protein cargo of EVs from both human and mouse models at different post-burn phases. Results Early post-burn human EVs induced significant immune reprogramming in macrophages, increasing pro-inflammatory signaling while suppressing anti-inflammatory pathways. In contrast, late post-burn EVs exhibited an immunosuppressive profile, with downregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways and upregulation of anti-inflammatory signaling. Proteomic analyses revealed that human and mouse EVs contained unique and overlapping protein cargo across different time points. At day 7 post-burn, mouse EVs were enriched in circulation/complement and neuronal proteins, whereas by day 14, reductions in membrane and metabolism-associated proteins were observed. Similarly, in human EVs at 14 days post-burn, increased levels of circulation/complement, immune, and transport proteins were detected. Conclusions EVs from burn-injury patients at distinct time points differentially modulate immune responses in macrophages, mirroring the temporal immune phenotypes observed in clinical settings. These findings suggest that EV-macrophage interactions play a crucial role in burn-induced immune dysfunction and highlight the potential of EV protein cargo as biomarkers for immune status and patient outcomes following burn injury.">

        <tr id="Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that expand aberrantly in cancer and exhibit potent immunosuppressive properties. They contribute to tumor progression through both immunological and nonimmunological mechanisms. Immunologically, MDSCs suppress antitumor responses by inhibiting effector cells such as T cells and NK cells, facilitating immune evasion. Nonimmunologically, they promote tumor growth and metastasis through processes such as the epithelial‒mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and premetastatic niche formation. MDSC accumulation is closely linked to accelerated tumor progression, including resistance to both immunotherapies and conventional treatments, making these cells critical therapeutic targets. Clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of MDSC‐targeted strategies to improve treatment efficacy. However, challenges remain in achieving specificity and effectiveness in MDSC‐targeted therapies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of their biology. This review summarizes the origin, classification, and biological characteristics of MDSCs, their dual roles in tumor progression, and their clinical significance. We also discuss recent advances in clinical and preclinical studies, including both traditional targeted therapies and emerging innovative strategies. By integrating current findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective on the role of MDSCs in cancer and valuable insights for advancing cancer treatment and drug development.">

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-(L)1 pathways have revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since last decade. However, the efficacy is still limited because the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) restricts ICI-primed T cell immunity. Therefore, it is quite crucial to block the potential mechanisms in inducing immunosuppression to improve ICI efficacy. Immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) 5 is an important immunosuppressive molecule expressed in a wide range of myeloid cells and predicts tumor progression. Our group was the first to report ILT5 expression in solid tumor cells (colorectal cancer). However, the expression and function of ILT5 in NSCLC are still unknown.
 Methods:
 ILT5 expression in NSCLC tissues and tumor cell lines was determined by PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. The impact of tumor-derived ILT5 on T-cell phenotypes and functions was evaluated using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. ILT5-regulated downstream signals and molecules were determined by RNA sequencing, PCR, western blotting, and flow cytometry. Tumor transplantation and immunotherapeutic models were established in C57/BL6 and NSG mice to explore the effect of ILT5 on tumor progression and the synergies of ILT5 blockade with ICIs.
 Results:
 ILT5 is highly expressed in NSCLC cells, predicting poor patient survival. ILT5 induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion rather than senescence and apoptosis in the TME. Mechanistically, ILT5 upregulated PD-L1 through the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn increased PD-1 expression in CD8
 +
 T cells and induced their exhaustion. PIR-B (ILT5 orthlog in mice) overexpression in mice induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion and tumor growth in vivo, while PIR-B knockdown had the opposite effect. More importantly, inhibition of ILT5 synergistically enhanced the tumoricidal effect of PD-1 inhibitor in NSCLC immunotherapeutic models.
 Conclusions:
 Enriched ILT5 expression in NSCLC cells induces CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion via activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR-PD-L1 pathway. ILT5 inhibition synergistically enhanced the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor. Our findings identifies a novel mechanism for tumor immunosuppression and develops a promising strategy for improving ICI efficacy.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is characterized by CNS infiltration of autoreactive immune cells that drive both acute inflammatory demyelination and chronic progressive axonal and neuronal injury. Expanding evidence implicates CD8+ antineural T cells in the neurodegeneration that underlies irreversible clinical progression in multiple sclerosis, yet therapies specifically targeting this cell population are limited. CD8+ T cells from patients with MS exhibit increased engagement of the pentose phosphate pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway reduced glycolysis, glucose uptake, NADPH production, ATP production, proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in CD8+ T cells activated by ligation of CD3 and CD28. Pentose phosphate pathway inhibition also prevented CD8+ T cell–mediated antigen-specific neuronal injury in vitro and in both an adoptive transfer–based cuprizone model of demyelination and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Notably, transcriptional profiling of CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients with MS indicated increased pentose phosphate pathway engagement, suggesting that this pathway is involved in CD8+ T cell–mediated injury of axons and neurons in the demyelinated CNS. Inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway disrupts CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming and effector functions, suggesting that such inhibition may serve as a therapeutic strategy to prevent neurodegeneration in patients with progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) derived extracellular vesicles represent a promising vehicle for the activation of adaptive immunity, demonstrating significant potential in the development of cancer nanovaccines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of a functional DCs-derived extracellular vesicles in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Methods A pre-modification strategy was employed to overexpress XCL1 in dendritic cells, enabling their extracellular vesicles to highly express XCL1 protein. In vitro experiments, prostate cancer-bearing mouse models, and OVA-expressing prostate cancer mouse models demonstrated that dendritic cells efficiently internalize extracellular vesicles derived from XCL1-overexpressing mature dendritic cells (DEXXCL1), thereby enhancing the chemotaxis, activation, and antigen-presenting capacity of cDC1 cells. When combined with the immunogenic cell death effect induced by cisplatin, this approach significantly increased the number and cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells, improved the tumor microenvironment, and effectively suppressed prostate cancer tumor growth. Results The coding sequence of XCL1 successfully inserted upstream of the PDGFR transmembrane domain and transfected into dendritic cells, enabling their extracellular vesicles to highly express XCL1 protein. Extracellular vesicles derived from XCL1-overexpressing mature dendritic cells not only exhibited high XCL1 expression, but were also enriched with chemokine receptor CCR7 and MHC I molecules on their surface. This nanovaccines enhanced the uptake of extracellular vesicles by dendritic cells, recruited cDC1 cells within the tumor tissue, and significantly improved their antigen-presenting capacity. When combined with the immunogenic cell death effect induced by cisplatin, which generates a large amount of tumor-associated antigen STEAP1, this strategy effectively enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of CD8+T cells. Moreover, it reduced the proportion of regulatory T cells and immunosuppressive factors, thereby reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment. This approach effectively inhibited tumor growth in mice and prolonged their survival. These findings demonstrate the strong synergistic effects of the nanovaccines and cisplatin in promoting antitumor immunity. Conclusions A novel nanovaccines induces potent antitumor immune responses and, in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, effectively remodels the tumor immune microenvironment. This approach offers a new strategy and preclinical evidence for the immunotherapy of “cold tumors” prostate cancer.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is driven by abnormal type-I and -II interferon activation, affecting a variety of immunocompetent cells. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modulate inflammation but often lack consistent potency. We developed HXB-319, an MSC-based therapy targeting inflammatory pathways in SLE. Previously, HXB-319 was shown to reduce alveolar hemorrhage in an SLE model. Here, we report its effects in a model of SLE that progresses to end stage kidney disease.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
SLE-like disease was induced via intraperitoneal (IP) pristane injection in female BALB/cJ mice, followed by treatment with naïve MSCs or HXB-319. Over 9 months, survival and proteinuria were monitored. Upon euthanasia, kidneys were analyzed for histopathology and gene expression, splenocytes for immune subsets by flow cytometry, and serum for autoantibodies, growth factors and cytokines.


RESULTS
HXB-319 significantly altered plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4+PD-L1+ cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ RORγt+ (Th17 cells) subsets. HXB-310 lowered IFN-γ (p< 0.001), IL-17A (p=0.01), BAFF (p<0.05), and anti-dsDNA (p<0.05), compared to untreated mice. HXB-319, but not naïve MSCs, significantly improved survival, halted progression of kidney disease and stabilized proteinuria (all p < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
HXB-319 demonstrates potential for mitigating SLE associated glomerulonephritis, improving survival and reducing proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis.">

        <tr id="Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation offers a cure for a variety of blood disorders, predominantly affecting the elderly; however, its application, especially in this demographic, is limited by treatment toxicity. In response, we employ a murine transplantation model based on low-intensity conditioning protocols using antibody-mediated HSC depletion. While aging presents a significant barrier to effective HSC engraftment, optimizing HSC doses and non-genotoxic targeting methods greatly enhance the long-term multilineage activity of the transplanted cells. We demonstrate that young HSCs, once effectively engrafted in aged hosts, improve hematopoietic output and ameliorate age-compromised lymphopoiesis. This culminated in a strategy that robustly mitigates disease progression in a genetic model of myelodysplastic syndrome. These results suggest that non-genotoxic HSC transplantation could fundamentally change the clinical management of age-associated hematological disorders, offering a prophylactic tool to delay or even prevent their onset in elderly patients.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in supporting acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell survival, proliferation, and drug resistance through various mechanisms, including the release of soluble factors, direct cell-cell interactions, and the creation of a leukemia-supportive niche. Conversely, MSCs also demonstrate potential inhibitory effects on AML, including the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and the modulation of immune responses. These contrasting effects highlight the complexities of MSC-AML interactions and emphasize the need for further research to understand their therapeutic potential fully. Targeting MSCs represents a promising avenue for AML treatment. Strategies aimed at modifying MSC-mediated support of AML cells, such as inhibiting pro-survival signaling pathways, disrupting the leukemia-supportive niche, and enhancing the immune-stimulatory functions of MSCs, could offer novel therapeutic approaches. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of current research. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the dual effects of MSCs in AML, to identify biomarkers that predict patient response to MSC-targeted therapies, and to develop strategies to overcome potential challenges associated with MSC-based interventions. In conclusion, understanding the multifaceted role of MSCs in AML pathogenesis is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic approaches. By harnessing the potential of MSCs and targeting their interactions with AML cells, we can explore novel strategies to improve treatment outcomes and enhance the overall management of this challenging hematological malignancy.

        <tr id="Introduction Acute cellular rejection of transplanted lung allografts involves activated cytotoxic T cells and reduced Regulatory T (Treg) cell function. Calcineurin inhibitors, the cornerstone of immunosuppressive regimens, suppress T cell cytotoxicity but inhibit Treg proliferation. The DNA hypomethylating agent decitabine (DAC) can abrogate T cell cytotoxicity while stimulating Treg proliferation. Methods We sought to determine the effects of DAC treatment in a murine MHC-mismatched orthotopic lung transplant model. Results Rescue treatment with DAC maintains lung allograft gross and histologic integrity with a reduction in cytotoxic T cell responses. CD4+FoxP3+ T cell depletion in Foxp3DTR mice exacerbated rejection lung injury compared to CD4+FoxP3+ T cell sufficient mice and failed to abolish the protective effect of DAC in this model. The protective effect of DAC was associated with a reduction in cytokine production from host T-cells. Discussion Decitabine could offer a new line of treatment for acute lung allograft rejection, in part via its effects on Tregs.">

        <tr id="Dickkopf-1(DKK1) is a classical Wnt antagonist, which is released at the initiation of Leishmania major infection through platelet TLR1/2 activation. Using BALB/c mice deficient in platelet MyD88 (MyD88PKO) or platelet DKK1 (DKK1PKO), we assessed whether the transmission of activation signals through MyD88 and subsequent release of DKK1 are critical in regulating the immune response to L. major. At the site of infection, the levels of neutrophil platelet aggregates and activated neutrophils of MyD88(PKO) and DKK1(PKO) mice were reduced. Further, these mice mounted anti-leishmanial Th1-responses and failed to develop progressive lesions. In contrast, WT BALB/c-infected mice developed progressive disease associated with elevated IL-10-producing Th1 and Th2 T cells. Further, elevated CD206+ M2 macrophages and tolerogenic DC-10 cells, which favor parasite proliferation, were observed. In vitro, DKK1 promoted DC IL-10 production and blocked TNFα-induction of IL-12. Overall, these results indicate that platelet-DKK1 promotes disease progression through the induction of tolerogenic DCs and subsequent pathological Th2 and IL-10-Th1 T cell-responses. Summary statement Platelet DKK1 produced in response to TLR1/2 signaling by Leishmania parasites drives development of non-healing responses. In vivo/ in vitro analyses indicate that the mechanism underlying this process is the promotion of tolerogenic dendritic cells, driving Th2 and Th1-IL-10 T cell responses. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are functionally diverse stromal regulators that orchestrate tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance through dynamic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent advances in single‐cell multiomics and spatial transcriptomics have identified conserved CAF subtypes with distinct molecular signatures, spatial distributions, and context‐dependent roles, highlighting their dual capacity to promote immunosuppression or restrain tumor growth. However, therapeutic strategies struggle to reconcile this functional duality, hindering clinical translation. This review systematically categorizes CAF subtypes by origin, biomarkers, and TME‐specific functions, focusing on their roles in chemoresistance, maintenance of stemness, and formation of immunosuppressive niches. We evaluate emerging targeting approaches, including selective depletion of tumor‐promoting subsets (e.g., fibroblast activation protein+ CAFs), epigenetic reprogramming toward antitumor phenotypes, and inhibition of CXCL12/CXCR4 or transforming growth factor‐beta signaling pathways. Spatial multiomics‐driven combinatorial therapies, such as the synergistic use of CAFs and immune checkpoint inhibitors, are highlighted as strategies to overcome microenvironment‐driven resistance. By integrating CAF biology with translational advances, this work provides a roadmap for developing subtype‐specific biomarkers and precision stromal therapies, directly informing efforts to disrupt tumor‐stroma coevolution. Key concepts include spatial transcriptomics, stromal reprogramming, and tumor‐stroma coevolution, offering actionable insights for both mechanistic research and clinical innovation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The bone marrow (BM) niche plays a critical role in the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), while the central nervous system (CNS) is a common site of dissemination. Existing in vitro models of childhood ALL lack complexity and fail to recapitulate the in vivo microenvironments. This study aimed to improve ALL in vitro models by integrating key elements of the BM and CNS niches. We optimized the culture medium by evaluating the impact of cytokines and human platelet lysate in medium, which significantly improved ALL cell viability (p < 0.05) with a maximum viability of 54.61% achieved. Expression of cancer‐associated fibroblast (CAF) markers in human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hMSCs) and human Meningeal Cells (HMCs) were examined, but co‐culture with primary ALL cells did not induce an increase in CAF marker expression in our stromal cells. ALL cells exhibited enhanced viability in 5% oxygen compared to 21% oxygen (p < 0.05). The final BM and CNS models demonstrated superior survival of ALL cells (p < 0.05) compared to more simple models with a maximum viability achieved of 92.25% for BM model and 92.99% for CNS. These findings indicate that mimicking BM and CNS microenvironments enhances the survival of primary ALL cells in vitro.">

        <tr id="Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus infection affecting half of the world’s population for which therapies are lacking. The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who develop severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. These signatures are exacerbated in patients with overweight/obesity compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic potential compared to non-SD. Using transcriptional and proteomics approaches we show decreased type-I Interferon responses in SD, suggesting defective innate immunity may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional T and NK-cell signatures underpin dengue pathogenesis and may represent novel targets for immunomodulatory therapy in dengue.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and therapeutic resistance are profoundly influenced by the dynamic interplay within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The HCC TME comprises a complex network of cellular components, including cancer-associated fibroblasts, tumor-associated macrophages, and infiltrating immune cells, alongside non-cellular factors such as extracellular matrix proteins, cytokines, and angiogenic mediators. These elements collectively promote immune evasion, stromal remodeling, and neovascularization, driving tumor aggressiveness and treatment resistance. Emerging evidence suggests that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may offer a promising strategy to reprogram the immunosuppressive HCC TME through multimodal mechanisms, such as immunomodulation to enhance anti-tumor immunity and deplete regulatory cell populations, stromal normalization to attenuate fibroblast activation and pathological matrix deposition, and anti-angiogenic effects to restrict tumor vascularization. Notably, TCM compounds exhibit synergistic potential when combined with conventional therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and cytotoxic regimens, potentially enhancing efficacy while mitigating adverse effects. However, key challenges persist, such as intratumoral heterogeneity, pharmacokinetic variability of herbal formulations, and the need for rigorous preclinical-to-clinical translation. Future investigations should prioritize systems-level dissection of TCM-mediated TME modulation using omics technologies, rational design of TCM-based combination therapies guided by mechanistic studies, and standardization of clinically translatable TCM regimens. This review synthesizes current understanding of TME-driven HCC pathogenesis and highlights the emerging paradigm of TCM as a complementary modality to recalibrate the tumor-immune-stroma axis for improved therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is on the rise, yet current clinical treatments are limited. Previous studies have identified impairments in both systemic and local iron metabolism in IBD patients. However, the impact of iron dyshomeostasis on the development and pathogenesis of IBD remains elusive. In this study, we confirmed iron deposition in inflamed intestinal lesions of IBD patients and mice with DSS‐induced colitis, accompanied by distinct distribution patterns of the iron storage protein ferritin. To reveal the role of ferritin in the involvement of pathology of IBD, we constructed intestinal epithelial cell‐ or myeloid‐specific ferritin H (FtH) knockout mice and demonstrated that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain iron‐loaded ferritin. These EVs are internalized by macrophages via the macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (Msr1), leading to the activation of inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, thereby exacerbating colitis severity. Genetic deletion of FtH in IECs or blockage of macrophage ferritin uptake, either through Msr1 inhibitor fucoidan or through Msr1 knockdown (KD), suppressed inflammatory symptoms. Thus, EVs containing iron‐loaded ferritin released from IECs activate macrophages and contribute to IBD development, supporting that IBD patients with iron deficiency anaemia are often prescribed iron supplementation in a remission phase, other than in an active phase of the disease. Pharmacological inhibition of this ferritin secretion and engulfing process provides a therapeutic target for the disease.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory B cell (Breg), known for its immunosuppressive properties through the provision of IL-10, plays a critical role in the control of inflammatory diseases. Although Breg has been discovered for over two decades in mammals, its existence in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the differentiation mechanism and functional profiles of teleost CD25L+ Breg to gain insights into the origin and evolution of Breg. Methods Flow cytometry, RNA-seq, qPCR, morphological analysis, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, recombinant IL-35 stimulation, cell co-culture in Transwell system were performed to reveal the phenotypic features, differentiation mechanism and suppressive functions of teleost CD25L+ Breg. To elucidate the immunoregulatory role of CD25L+ Breg in vivo, bacterial infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models were established in teleost fish. Systemic and local inflammatory responses were assessed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, histological analysis, and cytokine measurements. Results Phenotypically, we identified a unique IgM+CD25L+ B cell subset, termed CD25L+ B cells, characterized by their capacity to produce IL-10 and IL-12p35 in a cold-blooded vertebrate, the grass carp. Mechanistically, IL-35 stimulation induced the differentiation of CD25L− B cells into CD25L+ B cells, promoting the production of IL-35 and IL-10 via STAT3 activation. Functionally, teleost CD25L+ B cells served as a conventional Breg subtype that exerted its immunosuppressive functions on effector T cells and neutrophils via cell contact or cytokine delivery. Upon bacterial infection, CD25L+ Breg increased earlier than CD25L+ Treg and produced IL-10. In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD model, Breg frequency and IL-10 levels increased significantly during IBD remission, and Breg adoptive transfer could prevent IBD development and contribute to intestinal tissue repair. Conclusions These novel findings reveal that fish have evolved Breg with specialized anti-inflammatory functions, providing evolutionary insights into the phylogenetic origin and functional conservation of Breg from fish to mammals.

        <tr id="Influenza-associated bacterial super-infections in the lung lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Nearly all people have pre-existing memory to influenza virus, which can protect against subsequent infection in the lung. This study explored the role B cells play in protection against bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae) super-infection with previous heterotypic influenza memory. B cell deficiency resulted in an increased inflammatory lung environment and lung tissue injury during super-infection. Loss of B cells increased populations of memory CD8+ T cells in the lung and these CD8+ T cells were transcriptionally and functionally distinct from WT mice. Use of antibody-deficient mouse models showed that this phenotype was specifically due to loss of antibody production from B cells. Passive immunization with influenza-antibody serum in B cell deficient mice rescued the CD8+ T cell phenotype. CD8+ T cell depletion and lethal super-infection challenge experiments showed that the cytotoxic memory CD8+ T cells from B cell deficient mice protect against super-infection bacterial burden and mortality. These findings provide insight into the importance of B cells for regulating immune responses against infection.">

 Background:
 Recurrent abnormalities of immune surveillance-related genes play a crucial role in DLBCL progression. Prior studies have shown that CD58, a key adhesion molecule that acts as a ligand for the T-cell costimulatory molecule CD2, is frequently mutated or deleted in certain hematological malignancies. Downregulation or loss of CD58 is linked to resistance to ICB therapy in melanoma and CAR-T therapy in B-cell malignancies. Nevertheless, the role of CD58 in cancer is not yet well understood.
 Methods:
 Comprehensive analysis of the genetic characteristics of
 CD58
 were performed through targeted deep sequencing (n=176), whole exome sequencing (n=38), and RNA-sequencing (n=162) in patients with de novo DLBCL. To investigate the mechanistic impacts of CD58 alterations on co-inhibitory molecules expression and immune cell function, we performed bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of tumor samples and conducted co-IP, flow cytometry and co-culture assays in vitro.
 Results:
 We identified that
 CD58
 mutation rate was 9.1%, and the copy number loss rate was 44.7% among all enrolled DLBCL patients. Notably,
 CD58
 genetic alterations, along with low CD58 expression, significantly correlated with reduced rates of response to R-CHOP therapy and inferior progression-free and overall survival. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that CD58 expression in tumor cells was negatively correlated with CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion/dysfunction status. CD58 inhibited the activity of the JAK2/STAT1 pathway by activating the Lyn/CD22/SHP1 axis, thereby limiting PD-L1 and IDO expression. Elevated PD-L1 and IDO expression in CD58 deficient DLBCL cells led to immune evasion and tumor-intrinsic resistance to CAR T-cell therapy. Direct activation of CD58-CD2 costimulatory signaling in combination with anti-PD-L1 blockade or IDO inhibitor sensitized CD58-deficient DLBCL to CAR T-cell therapy.
 Conclusions:
 Our study comprehensively characterized
 CD58
 genetic alterations in DLBCL. We demonstrated that CD58 downregulation or mutation led to upregulation of PD-L1 and IDO expression mainly by regulating the LYN/CD22/SHP1 axis. Our findings provide novel insights for individualized therapy for DLBCL patients with CD58 mutation or deletion.

        <tr id="Background A head and neck cancer organoid (HNCO) and peripheral blood T cell co-culture model was established to investigate whether HNCOs can induce the differentiation of peripheral blood T cells into tumor-reactive T cells. Additionally, this study seeks to explore the cytotoxicity of these T cells against autologous tumor organoids, providing theoretical and experimental evidence for the feasibility of this model as a platform for adoptive cell immunotherapy in head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods HNCO single cells were co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) collected and isolated from patients with HNC. The culture supernatant was collected and assayed for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α). The expression of T cell activation markers cluster of differentiation (CD)137 and CD107a was measured by flow cytometry to confirm tumor specificity and cytotoxicity. Additionally, the optimal effector-to-target (E/T) ratio was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and HNCO killing was quantified by fluorescent labeling. Results Of the 27 successfully established HNCO-T cell co-culture systems, 81.48% induced the in vitro differentiation and tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell expansion capable of mediating the killing of mature HNCOs. Conclusion The patient-derived HNCO-T cell co-culture model effectively induced PBL differentiation into tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells with enhanced tumor-killing activities. This model serves as a novel in vitro preclinical tool for advancing personalized adoptive immunotherapy in HNC.">

        <tr id="The phenotypic heterogeneity and functional diversity of macrophages have been increasingly appreciated, particularly regarding their roles as innate immune cells in shaping transplantation outcomes. However, their functions in vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) remain underexplored. In this review, we first describe the development of macrophages and the heterogeneity of macrophage differentiation, then present current insights into macrophages’ involvement across key stages of VCA, including ischemia–reperfusion injury at the peri-transplantation stage, and the outcomes following transplantation, including acute rejection, chronic rejection, and development of transplantation tolerance. The existing evidence supports that macrophages significantly influence both short- and long-term VCA graft survival. The presence of vascularized bone marrow within some VCA grafts further suggests the involvement of donor bone marrow-derived macrophage population and adds another layer of complexity to immune dynamics. Collectively, current understanding highlights the macrophage as a promising target for therapeutic intervention and warrants continued investigation into their diverse functions and potential for improving VCA outcomes.">

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamics of the tumor-immune ecosystem is crucial for advancing neoadjuvant strategies in cancer treatment. This study investigated alterations in the tumor-immune microenvironment related to the response to preoperative combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty patients underwent combination therapy. Biopsy or surgical specimens were obtained before and after treatment. Single-cell-based, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry and image cytometry were employed to assess changes in immune cell densities and profiles. Three distinct immune profiles were identified: hypo-, lymphoid-, and myeloid-inflamed. Significant decreases in tumor volume and increases in CD45+ cells and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) scores were observed in the hypo- and lymphoid-inflamed groups, whereas the myeloid-inflamed group showed minimal changes. After treatment, increased calreticulin expression in tumor cells, together with increased lymphoid cell lineages, was observed in non-recurrent cases. The myeloid-inflamed group exhibited higher expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2, suggesting the presence of a hypoxic and metastasis-promoting environment. Spatial analysis revealed that responders had a high infiltration of T cells within tumor cell nests, whereas non-responders had fewer T cells, with β-catenin expression in cancer cells. Upregulated lymphocyte activation gene 3 in the myeloid-inflammation group, and PD-L1 dynamics suggest potential targets for further therapy. These findings highlight the need for targeted neoadjuvant strategies based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="Bronchiectasis is a chronic airway disease characterized by dysbiosis, persistent inflammation, and permanent structural airway damage. Neutrophilic inflammation is a key pathogenic feature, as indicated by enhanced neutrophil-derived proteases and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), associated with poor prognosis. However, recent studies have identified an eosinophilic endotype in up to 30% of patients, characterized by higher levels of type 2 (T2) cytokines and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). The role of T helper (Th) cells in the dysregulated inflammatory environment of bronchiectasis remains unclear. Evidence suggests that persistent bacterial infection can skew adaptive immunity from Th1 toward Th2 response, while the airway microbiome-IL-17 axis is also a critical regulator of chronic inflammation. T regulatory (Treg) cells have been shown to play a protective role against excessive chronic inflammation by modulating the function of several types of effector cells, including the Th17 subset. However, the capacity of this subset to delay or prevent disease progression remains to be determined Microbial dysbiosis, with loss of diversity and increased quantity of bacterial pathogens, may also be important for disease progression, and emerging evidence indicates that distinct inflammatory endotypes associate with specific microbiota alterations, especially in severe disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the immune cells and cytokine signaling that are involved in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Additionally, we present the main endotypes of bronchiectasis and explore the relationships between the type of inflammation and alterations in microbiota, as well as the potential benefits of targeting specific pathophysiological mechanisms for the management of bronchiectasis. This review also examines how bacterial infection can shift adaptive immunity from Th1 toward Th2 responses, the role of the airway microbiome-IL-17 axis in chronic inflammation and the potential protective role of Treg cells against excessive inflammation. Novel therapeutic strategies are highlighted, with focus on targeting specific cytokine signaling pathways and restoring Th17/Treg balance These developments underscore a shift toward precision medicine in bronchiectasis, emphasizing the importance of identifying specific inflammatory endotypes to tailor treatment strategies effectively.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT
Loss of tolerance and the production of self-reactive autoantibodies by the humoral immune system are central to the pathogenesis of many glomerular diseases. These antibodies are produced by plasmablasts and plasma cells, the end-products of B cell lineage development within the bone marrow and secondary lymphoid tissues. In addition to antibody production, B cells also present antigen to T cells and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. Non-targeted immunosuppression has shown efficacy in glomerular disease, but is associated with multiple side effects, and there remains a high proportion of patients with resistant disease. In this manuscript, we will review the biology of antibody secreting cells, and focus on therapeutics that specifically target B cells and plasma cells. We will review B cell depletion strategies, including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, BAFF and APRIL inhibition and B cell receptor inhibition highlighting their role in different glomerular diseases and outline reasons for therapeutic resistance. We will also review plasma cell directed therapies including proteasome inhibition and anti-CD38 therapies, and discuss novel treatments including CAR-T therapy and bispecific T cell engagers.">

Here, we analyzed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from skeletal muscle of IBM, other myositis, and control patients to identify and quantify these mDC subsets and characterize their contribution to IBM inflammation. Our findings reveal that all three mDC subsets are relatively increased and activated in muscle of IBM patients and correlate with IBM-specific inflammatory markers.

 Background:
 Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is typically reversible in CAR-T therapy, while hyperinflammatory syndromes like macrophage activation-like syndrome (MAS-L) and high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IEC-HS) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early interventions are critical for improving outcomes. We aim to analyze clinical cytokine assays and cellular phenotypes early in hyperinflammatory syndromes to identify profiles for severe cases to inform management decisions.
 Methods:
 This study included 113 CAR-T patients (pt) (September 2019-March 2024) with cytokine profiles (CP) performed at the second tocilizumab dose or with suspected hyperinflammatory states (CP1), followed by assessments at 24 hours (CP24) and 48 hours (CP48). 52 pts consented to blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cell immune phenotyping at pre-treatment (pre-LD) and day 1 for PB.
 Results:
 Among the 113 pts, CRS pts (N=74), when compared to MAS-L(N=19) & IEC-HS (N=20) at CP1, had lower levels of TNF (median in pg/mL; 31, 62.9, 47.7) , IL-18 (794, 1353, 2011), and MCP-1 (689, 2722, 2485.5). While MAS-L and IEC-HS had similar CP1 profiles, CP24 and CP48 differed between them: TNF & MCP-1 levels decreased in MAS-L but remained elevated or increased in IEC-HS. IL-18 was stable in MAS-L but increased steadily daily in IEC-HS. Infections were more frequent in IEC-HS (CRS: 43%; MAS-L: 58%; IEC-HS: 85%; p=0.002). Notably, patients who died with persistent
 E. faecium
 bacteremia had higher IL-18 in CP48. In the 52 pts with cell phenotypes available by flow, 33 had CRS, 18 MAS-L and 8 IEC-HS. The correlation between cell phenotypes and cytokine levels showed that elevated TNF at CP1 correlated with increased non-classical monocytes in pre-LD BM and higher NK and NK-T cells in pre-LD PB. Similarly, elevated IL-18 CP48 levels correlated with increased CD8 T-cells, NK-T cells, and intermediate monocytes in pre-LD PB, as well as increased NK cells at both pre-LD and day 1 (Table).
 Conclusions:
 We report distinct cytokine profiles in IEC-HS early in the inflammatory course post-CAR-T therapy. These elevated cytokines correlate with specific immune cell subsets, including BM-resident monocytes, intermediate monocytes with heightened cytokine trafficking and inflammatory capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility for identifying potential biomarkers for early risk stratification and targeted interventions.

        <tr id="Innate immune memory (trained immunity) refers to the ability of innate immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, to retain a long-term imprint of a prior stimulus through epigenetic and metabolic adaptations, enabling amplified responses upon restimulation. Recent studies have classified innate immune memory into central and peripheral types. Central innate immune memory originates in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the bone marrow, where epigenetic reprogramming generates a sustained inflammatory bias, contributing to chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, and stroke. Peripheral innate immune memory occurs in monocytes or macrophages that acquire heightened responsiveness after repeated exposure to stimuli in peripheral tissues. This review explores the mechanisms underlying both central and peripheral innate immune memory, their roles in chronic inflammatory diseases, focusing on cardiovascular diseases, and potential strategies to target innate immune memory for therapeutic purposes. Advancing the understanding of these processes could facilitate the development of novel approaches to control inflammatory diseases and immune-related disorders.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignant tumor that imposes heavily public health burdens worldwide. Systemic therapies for gastric cancer (GC), such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, have undergone significant advancements. Nevertheless, the extensive application of anti-cancer agents has resulted in an increasing array of challenges related to drug resistance, presenting a substantial barrier in GC treatment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as essential immunomodulators within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of GC, providing novel therapeutic targets due to their capacity for plasticity in reaction to environmental signals. They create a complex network of communication with various immune and stromal cell types, thereby contributing to the immunosuppressive nature of the TME in GC. In this review, we establish the map of the origin and polarization of macrophages in GC. During the process of carcinogenesis, macrophages undergo dynamic phenotypic transitions. Additionally, the interactions between TAMs and tumor cells significantly influence the progression of GC, affecting tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. Furthermore, this intricate immunomodulatory axis notably enhances resistance to immunotherapy, suggesting that targeting TAMs presents substantial therapeutic opportunities for patients with GC. Approaches such as TAM elimination, TAM repolarization, and CAR-M therapy have been validated in numerous studies. We also elaborate on the challenges faced by the development of targeting TAMs, which may provide innovative perspectives on the GC treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Cancer cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating antigen presentation, allowing them to escape detection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and resist immunotherapy. Dendritic cells (DCs), one of the potent antigen-presenting cells in cancer immunity, are essential for initiating adaptive immune responses. Unfortunately, DC functions are disrupted by the tumor microenvironment. Suppressive cytokines, for instance, can impair DC maturation, reduce antigen-presenting capacity, or induce DC apoptosis. A novel strategy against such challenges is reprogramming cancer cells into DC-like cells. By inducing transcription factors, cancer cells can be directed to develop a DC phenotype, which is characterized by enhanced antigen-presenting markers, co-stimulatory molecules, and an increased ability to prime naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, showing enhanced immune activation and tumor regression. However, limitations remain, including reprogramming efficiency, tumor heterogeneity, and safety issues that require further refinement. This review provides fundamental knowledge about DC in the tumor microenvironment and cell fate reprogramming, recent advances in reprogramming cancer cells into DCs, and eventually discusses perspectives for translating this approach into clinical settings. This innovative reprogramming strategy holds the potential to overcome current limitations in cancer immunotherapy, offering a novel avenue for durable anti-tumor immunity">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown limited efficacy against solid tumors because of poor tissue penetration, constrained activity, and early exhaustion due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although stimulatory cytokines can counteract immune suppression, their systemic administration entails risk of toxicities and counter-regulatory responses. Here, we leveraged a population of tumor-associated TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs) to release interferon-α (IFN-α) and/or orthogonal interleukin-2 (oIL2) at the tumor site. Targeted cytokine delivery rescued CAR T cell functionality against the clinically relevant tumor antigen B7-homolog 3 (B7-H3) in an orthotopic, CAR T cell-refractory, immunocompetent mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM) named mGB2 that recapitulates pathological features of the human disease. Immunophenotypic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that inhibition of premature terminal exhaustion and induction of effector and memory states featuring activation of signaling pathways and transcriptional networks putatively boosted CAR T cell antitumor activity. Furthermore, IFN-α, especially when combined with private oIL2 signaling to CAR T cells, elicited potent endogenous T cell responses against multiple tumor-associated antigens, leading to delayed GBM growth and prolonged mouse survival even with tumors expressing B7-H3 in only a fraction of cells. These data suggest that the combination of TEM-based cytokine delivery and CAR T cells may have synergistic effects and support the further study of this approach for the treatment of patients with GBM.">

However, there has been little success in large-scale clinical trials of myeloid cell modulators. We aim to investigate potential molecular targets for TIMs and disclose the underlying mechanism. Using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we analyzed 24 spontaneous HCC tissues from mouse. Orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor models were established with or without anti-SIRPα antibody treatment. Patient-derived tumor xenografts model (PDX) was used to identify the CD47-SIRPα axis blocked therapy. In 24 murine spontaneous HCC tissues, we observed that the proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) plus macrophages accounts for 40–90% of TIMs and SIRPα was highly expressed in TIMs, especially in macrophages and MDSCs. Through in vivo experiments, we showed that anti-SIRPα therapy inhibited tumor growth, accompanied by increased CD8+ T cells infiltration and decreased TIMs including MDSCs and macrophages. We found that anti-SIRPα inhibited immunosuppressive function, migration and PD-L1 expression of myeloid cells. In a series of in vivo experiments, we demonstrated the anti-tumor and immune-active effect of SIRPα-blocked therapy. Mechanistically, anti-SIRPα inhibited the immunosuppressive function and PD-L1 expression of TIMs through downregulating PI3K/AKT signaling in myeloid cells. At last, anti-SIRPα enhanced the antitumor effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy in orthotopic and spontaneous murine models. Together, SIRPα blocked therapy reversed the immunosuppressive TIME, which provides a promising therapeutic rationale for increasing the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in treating HCC.">

        <tr id="The occurrence of ascites is a frequent complication associated with the decompensation of liver cirrhosis. While it is known that cirrhosis leads to altered immune responses in the periphery, the immunological milieu of ascites remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role and origin of natural killer (NK) cells in cirrhosis‐associated ascites. Using high‐dimensional flow cytometry and cytokine analysis, we analyzed matched peripheral blood and ascites fluid alongside liver and duodenum samples to discern tissue‐specific differences. Interestingly, a subset of peritoneal NK cells displayed high expression of the tissue‐residency receptor CD103. This subset of CD103+ ascites NK cells was distinct from blood, liver, and intestinal NK cells and presented with a less activated phenotype coupled with reduced effector capacity. Investigating their origin, we could identify that cytokines present in ascites, here predominantly IL‐15 in synergy with IL‐21 and TGFβ, can induce CD103 expression and that ascites supernatant further facilitates this process. These results indicate that the ascites in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis harbor a heterogenous subset of CD103+ NK cells that is likely induced by the cytokine milieu.">

        <tr id="Background Cerebral malaria (CM), a fatal neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is partially driven by neuronal injury. Emerging evidence highlights exosomes as vital mediators of mast cell–neuron interactions in neurological disease progression. While mast cells and their exosomes were previously shown to exacerbate experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) severity, the specific role of mast cell-derived exosomes in CM-associated neuronal injury remains unclear. Methods Exosomes were isolated from resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated P815 mast cells (denoted as RE and AE, respectively) and characterized. These exosomes were administered to ECM mice and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected red blood cell (iRBC)-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells to investigate their functional impact and mechanisms. Results Both RE and AE exhibited spherical morphology (20–100 nm diameter) and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81). Compared to infected controls, RE and AE treatments significantly reduced survival time, increased ECM incidence, and exacerbated brain pathology, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, RE and AE administration elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and IL-1β) and increased numbers of neurons expressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1, XBP-1). Notably, AE treatment induced higher morbidity/mortality rates, more severe neuronal injury, and greater ER stress marker expression than RE. In vitro, RE-treated iRBC-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells showed higher GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 mRNA levels than AE-treated cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed three downregulated miRNAs (miR-330-3p, miR-185-5p, and miR-379-5p) and six upregulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-187-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-192-5p) in AE versus RE, all previously implicated in targeting GRP78, CHOP, or XBP-1. Conclusions Mast cell-derived exosomes, particularly those from activated cells (AE), exacerbated ECM neuronal injury through partial activation of ER stress pathways.

        <tr id="Abstract Cervical cancer progression is not solely driven by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection but is profoundly influenced by the local immune microenvironment, particularly chronic cytokine imbalances. Unlike the acute cytokine storms observed in infections or sepsis, cervical cancer is characterized by a persistent, low-grade, “smoldering inflammatory response” that fuels tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8 sustain a tumor-supportive milieu, promoting angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and resistance to apoptosis, while immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β dampen anti-tumor immune responses and facilitate immune escape. This review explores chronic cytokine dysregulation in cervical cancer, examining how the prolonged, dysregulated cytokine network shapes the tumor microenvironment, remodels stromal interactions, and influences immune cell recruitment and function. We highlight key cytokines involved in these processes and discuss their clinical significance as potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Understanding these sustained inflammatory processes is critical because they represent a distinct biological landscape compared to acute inflammatory reactions and offer unique windows for therapeutic intervention. The paper reviewed emerging therapeutic strategies targeting these chronic cytokine pathways, including cytokine blockade, immune modulation, and combination approaches integrating immunotherapies or nanomedicine. Addressing chronic cytokine dysregulation holds promise for improving cervical cancer management and patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The role of extracellular vesicles has been extensively studied in physiological and pathological conditions, and growing evidence has pinpointed them as key players in tumor progression, regulation of the metastatic niche, and modulation of anti-tumor immune responses. Indeed, a dynamic transfer of extracellular vesicles between cancer cells and immunological or non-immunological cells homing in the tumor microenvironment exists, and the balance between their release by cancer cells and by normal cells determines cancer progression. Here, we focused on the role of extracellular vesicles in the dysregulation of the bone marrow environment in pediatric tumors such as acute leukemias and neuroblastomata, whose poor prognosis is strictly related to the involvement of such anatomical site. Acute leukemias arise from bone marrow progenitors, whereas approximately 50% of neuroblastoma patients have bone marrow metastases at diagnosis. Thus, here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the bone marrow dysregulation in pediatric acute leukemias and neuroblastomata with particular emphasis on the involvement of extracellular vesicles.">

Dexamethasone is currently a mainstay therapy used to control peritumoral edema.

        <tr id="Prostate malignant tumors are notably common within the male urinary tract and present significant challenges in medical treatment. A crucial aspect of understanding the progression of these tumors involves examining the immune microenvironment, particularly the multifaceted role played by macrophages. These immune cells have dual functions: on the one hand, they can inhibit tumor growth, while on the other hand, they can also facilitate and accelerate the progression of prostate cancer. Investigations have shed light on the mechanisms through which macrophages contribute to cancer promotion. These mechanisms include their involvement in mediating inflammatory responses, the secretion of chemokines that attract other immune cells, and the production of macrophage extracellular traps (METs), all of which may create favorable environments for tumor development. In the context of advanced prostate cancer, immunotherapy has emerged as the primary treatment modality. However, the effectiveness of this approach often falls short, leading to disheartening prognoses for patients undergoing such therapies. The suboptimal efficacy and poor outcomes associated with immunotherapy may be correlated with the activity of macrophages within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Specifically, the infiltration of macrophages into tumor tissues, along with elevated levels of these cells in the peripheral blood, has been identified as an indicator of a poor prognosis for individuals with prostate cancer. This study provides a deeper understanding of the cancer-promoting effects of macrophages and the various mechanisms by which they operate, including the roles of chemokines and the production of macrophage extracellular traps in both the onset and progression of prostate cancer. Furthermore, we explored how these factors are related to local tumor infiltration and systemic macrophage counts, which are associated with unfavorable survival outcomes for patients with this disease.">

        <tr id="Background Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) mediate cancer immune suppression by promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment that inhibits effective anti-tumor immunity. However, they are still a poorly understood, heterogeneous mix of neutrophil subsets. This study aims to determine the Siglec expression profile on several neutrophil subsets and assess their immunosuppressive ability. Methods We identified CD16high and CD16low neutrophil subsets from the low-density fractions of human peripheral blood and compared them to high-density neutrophils. We profiled the expression of the entire family of Siglecs on these three key neutrophil populations under steady-state conditions in healthy subjects as well as cancer patients. Moreover, the ability of these populations, isolated from healthy subjects, to suppress T cell proliferation was assessed. Results Two distinct subpopulations were investigated within the low-density fraction of human peripheral blood (CD15+CD66b+CD16low and CD15+CD66b+CD16high) and compared to high-density neutrophils (CD15+CD66b+CD16high). We found that in addition to CD33 (Siglec-3), Siglec-5/-14, -7, and -9, are differentially expressed on the CD16low and CD16high low-density subsets in both healthy, steady-state subjects, and cancer patients. Upregulated expression of CD33 on the CD16low cells led to the initial speculation that they are MDSCs. As the differential expression of Siglec-9 between these two populations was striking, we used CD16 and Siglec-9 double staining to quantify these populations, which demonstrated that the CD16lowSiglec-9low population is greatly upregulated in cancer patients. The CD16high low-density and high-density neutrophils, but not the CD16low low-density neutrophils from healthy subjects, inhibited T cell proliferation, indicating that the CD16lowSiglec-9low population are not MDSCs. Conclusions These results demonstrate that Siglecs are differentially expressed on neutrophil subsets, and along with CD16, may be used to help further define what is a PMN-MDSC. Consistent with current observations by others, PMN-MDSCs may encompass an array of neutrophil subtypes, including low-density neutrophils, and point to the need for more work to precisely define the genetic signatures of PMN-MDSCs.">

        <tr id="Type II testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common solid malignancies in young men and are classified into seminomas and non-seminomatous subtypes. Seminomas are known for their highly pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) with abundant immune cell infiltration. While previous work has demonstrated that the seminoma-derived cell line TCam-2 induces immune cell activation in co-culture and undergoes phenotypic changes itself, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. To explore the role of direct cell–cell interaction and the effects mediated by soluble mediators such as cytokines, we conducted co-culture experiments of TCam-2 cells with purified human T cells or monocytes, including Transwell assays and treatments with IL-6, TNFα, or their respective blocking antibodies Tocilizumab and Adalimumab. In this way, we found that immune cell activation, indicated by enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an upregulation of activation markers, strongly depended on direct physical contact between both cell types. Nonetheless, we also unveiled the role of soluble mediators in both immune cell activation and promoting a shift in TCam-2 cells from a seminoma-like phenotype to a more dedifferentiated phenotype, suggesting that cytokines critically shape the TME. These observations highlight the complexity of tumor–immune interactions in the seminoma microenvironment, offering new insight into immune-driven dynamics in TGCTs.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Lipid metabolism has emerged as an important regulator of acute viral infections by affecting viral replication and the host immune response. In contrast, the role of host lipid metabolism during chronic viral infection has been less explored. The current study aims to define the role of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a primary physiologic receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), during natural gammaherpesvirus infection. Gammaherpesviruses are highly prevalent cancer-associated pathogens that induce and manipulate germinal center responses to establish life-long infection of B cells. Importantly, gammaherpesvirus-infected germinal center B cells are thought to be the target of viral transformation. In this study, we found that global SR-BI deficiency led to increased gammaherpesvirus lytic gene expression in the lungs during the acute stage of infection. Chronic gammaherpesvirus infection of the SR-BI-deficient host was associated with exaggerated germinal center responses and increased differentiation of self-reactive B cells that persisted during the long-term stage of chronic infection. Interestingly, SR-BI-deficient germinal center B cells, although more numerous, failed to support efficient gammaherpesvirus infection. The exaggerated germinal center response was also observed following immunization of the SR-BI-deficient host, unveiling the novel role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of physiological and gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center responses. IMPORTANCE Lipid metabolism affects diverse acute viral infections. In contrast, less is known about the effect of lipid metabolism on chronic virus infection, including in the context of an intact host. Host lipid homeostasis is maintained via a combination of endogenous lipid synthesis that takes place in most cell types and cellular interaction with exogenous, circulating lipids. This study focuses on defining the interaction between SR-BI, a primary HDL receptor, and natural gammaherpesvirus infection. We found that SR-BI deficiency led to increased expression of lytic gammaherpesvirus genes during acute gammaherpesvirus replication in the lungs. Importantly, chronic gammaherpesvirus infection unveiled the physiological role of SR-BI as a negative regulator of the germinal center response, a B cell differentiation process that is critical for physiological B cell responses and that is manipulated by gammaherpesviruses to establish chronic infection.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are major immune components of the tumor microenvironment, promoting tumor growth and limiting the efficacy of chemotherapy in almost all cancer indications. While Tregs are well known for their immune suppressive activity toward the adaptive immune system, less is known about their regulatory activity toward the innate compartment. We showed in human and mouse lung cancer, that chemotherapy transiently reduced Treg number and switched the mononuclear phagocyte (MP) landscape toward a pro-inflammatory signature but also an increased TGFβ-expressing TAM accumulation over time. Preventing Treg recovery further increased the recruitment of monocytes and limited TGFβ expression upon TAM differentiation, demonstrating that Tregs dampen the pro-inflammatory status of the MP compartment induced by chemotherapy and promote tumor relapse. Anti-TNFR2 antibody treatment during the Treg recovery phase affected the direct interaction between Tregs and MPs, increased the pro-inflammatory signature of the MPs and improved survival in the mouse model. Targeting the crosstalk between tumor-associated Tregs and the MP compartment limits the reconstitution of an anti-inflammatory environment following chemotherapy and improves therapeutic outcome.">

        <tr id="The transformation of myeloid leukemia blasts into leukemia‑derived dendritic cells (DCleu) is a notable phenomenon. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in modulating physiological and pathological activities, particularly in immune activation. In the present study, EVs were isolated from DC/DCleu culture supernatants derived from healthy (H) donors (n=9) and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=9) using whole blood (WB) samples, both with and without Kit M (granulocyte‑macrophage colony‑stimulating factor and prostaglandin E1). This was followed by T‑cell enriched mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) with Kit M‑treated and untreated WB. To assess the qualitative and quantitative differences in EVs between Kit M‑treated and untreated samples, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis and multiplex bead‑based flow cytometry were employed. The present findings indicate that DC/MLC supernatant‑derived EVs can be successfully identified, quantified and characterized. Furthermore, these EVs exhibit regulatory properties in both H and AML samples. Results showed that a higher number of CD8+ EVs were detected after DC culture compared with before in both H and AML samples. Thrombocyte‑associated EVs (CD41b+, CD42a+ and CD62P+) significantly increased following DC culture in both groups. While low frequencies of progenitor/blast marker (CD133+) associated EVs were detected in H samples before and after DC culture, their frequencies increased after DC culture in AML samples. Additionally, a higher number of CD8+ and CD2+ EVs were observed after MLC culture compared with before in both H and AML samples. Correlation analyses revealed that improved blast lysis in Kit M‑pretreated samples (normalized to control) associated with the presence of EV subtypes associated with T (CD2+), B (CD20+, 24+), and other cell markers (for example, CD31+, CD146+, CD44+ and CD49e+). This comprehensive approach provides insights into the impact of Kit M on DC/DCleu generation and the subsequent activation of immune cells, leading to differences in EV production between H and AML samples.">

Importantly, ISM1 is also expressed by cells with a hematopoietic stem cell phenotype in the lung and plays a role during hematopoiesis. Under inflammatory conditions, ISM1 levels are also altered. Given that the intestine is one of the tissues with the highest ISM1 gene expression, in this work, we characterized the immunophenotype of ISM1-producing cells in the small intestine of uninfected or Salmonella Typhimurium-infected mice. We found a variety of ISM1+-expressing cells, including CD45+ cells, EpCAM+ cells, and, importantly, we also found different subsets of cells carrying hematopoietic stem cell markers (LSKs) expressing ISM1, and their frequency was perturbed during infection. Finally, we also found that isthmin1 is secreted into the intestinal lumen, and its concentration was increased during S. Typhimurium infection. Our findings suggest that increased luminal ISM1 secretion during mucosal infection may serve as a potential novel biomarker of pathogen-mediated inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background CNS stromal cells, especially fibroblasts and endothelial cells, support leukocyte accumulation through upregulation of adhesion molecules and lymphoid chemokines. While chronically activated fibroblast networks can drive pathogenic immune cell aggregates known as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), early stromal cell activation during CNS infection can support anti-viral T cells. However, the cell types and factors driving early stromal cell activation is poorly explored. Aims A neurotropic murine coronavirus (mCoV) infection model was used to better characterize signals that promote fibroblast networks supporting accumulation of antiviral lymphocytes. Based on the early appearance of IgD+ B cells with unknown functions during several CNS infections, we probed their potential to activate stromal cells through lymphotoxin β (LTβ), a molecule critical in maintaining fibroblast-networks in lymphoid tissues as well as promoting TLS in autoimmunity and cancers. Results Kinetic analysis of stromal cell activation in olfactory bulbs and brains revealed that upregulation of adhesion molecules and lymphoid chemokines Ccl19, Ccl21 and Cxcl13 closely tracked viral replication. Immunohistochemistry revealed that upregulation of the fibroblast marker podoplanin (PDPN) at meningeal and perivascular sites mirrored kinetics of RNA expression. Moreover, both B cells and T cells colocalized to areas of PDPN reactivity, supporting a potential role in regulating stromal cell activation. However, specific depletion of LTβ from B cells using Mb1-creERT2 x Ltβfl/fl mice had no effect on T or B cell recruitment or viral replication. B cell depletion by anti-CD20 antibody also had no adverse effects. Surprisingly, LTβR agonism reduced viral control and parenchymal T cell localization despite increasing stromal cell lymphoid chemokines and PDPN. Additional assessment of direct stromal cell activation by the viral RNA mimic poly I:C showed induction of Pdpn and Ccl19 preceding Ltb. Conclusions Neither B cell-derived LTβ or B cells are primary drivers of stromal cell activation networks in the CNS following mCoV infection. Although supplementary agonist mediated LTβR engagement confirmed a role for LTβ in enhancing PDPN and lymphoid chemokine expression, it impeded T cell migration to the CNS parenchyma and viral control. Our data overall indicate that stromal cells can integrate LTβR signals to tune their activation, but that LTβ is not necessarily essential and can even dysregulate protective antiviral T cell functions.

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) are characterized by a loss of self-tolerance, driven by diminished regulatory T cell (Treg) function and elevated Th1/Th17 responses. Existing therapies broadly suppress the immune system without correcting this imbalance, often leading to adverse effects. LPX3, a novel small-molecule T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing 3 and 4 (Tim-3/4) receptor agonist, was developed to restore immune tolerance via Treg induction. In this study, LPX3 was formulated into a liposomal oral delivery system, enabling efficient uptake through the gastrointestinal tract and lymphatic targeting. In vitro and in vivo analyses confirmed LPX3’s ability to expand CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in a dose-dependent manner. In a MOG-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS, both prophylactic and therapeutic oral administration of LPX3 significantly delayed disease onset, reduced symptom severity, and improved survival. Importantly, efficacy was achieved without antigen co-delivery, indicating an antigen-independent mechanism of immune modulation. LPX3 liposomes showed deep lymph node penetration and colocalization with immune cells, supporting its functional delivery to key immunological sites. These findings suggest LPX3 is a promising candidate for treating autoimmune diseases by re-establishing immune regulation through oral, antigen-agnostic tolerance induction.">

        <tr id="Reciprocal signaling between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and the surrounding bone-marrow microenvironment (BMME) promotes AML progression through several mechanisms. One of the most important mechanisms is the induction of Galectin-3 (Gal-3) expression by AML cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs). Emerging evidence indicates that Gal-3 upregulation in the BMME promotes AML cell adhesion and survival, leading to the development of chemotherapy resistance, relapse, and poor prognosis. Identifying the biological function and critical signaling pathways of Gal-3 may contribute to overcoming acquired drug resistance and preventing post-treatment relapse. Gal-3 is involved in several molecular signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, JAK/STAT, JNK, Wnt/β-catenin, PLC/PKC and NF-κB, which are interconnected to promote AML cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy. This review focuses on the biological effects, molecular mechanisms of action and regulation of Gal-3 in the pathogenesis and progression of AML. The therapeutic potential of potent synthetic small-molecule Gal-3 inhibitors in high-risk patients with AML is also discussed based on preclinical and clinical evidence from several human diseases. Currently, the effect of these Gal-3 inhibitors in AML has not been investigated either in vitro or in vivo. The findings provide a rationale for targeting Gal-3 that may be a very promising therapeutic approach, especially for patients with relapsed/refractory AML, and may enhance the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and/or immune checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, a key component of the innate immune system, have emerged as significant players in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer. Traditionally recognized for their role in defending against infections, neutrophils in cancer contribute to both tumor progression and suppression, depending on their activation state and the signals they receive. Neutrophil-driven inflammation within the TME is critical in promoting tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. This review explores the complex role of neutrophils in breast cancer, emphasizing the mechanisms through which they influence tumor inflammation, including their interactions with other immune cells and the signaling pathways involved. Neutrophils can either support tumor progression by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, and reactive oxygen species, or contribute to antitumor responses by directly killing cancer cells and stimulating adaptive immunity. The balance between these opposing functions is heavily influenced by the TME’s cytokine milieu and neutrophil polarization. Key signaling pathways, such as the CXCR2-CXCL8 axis and interactions with tumor-associated macrophages, regulate neutrophil recruitment and activation in the TME, enhancing inflammation and tumorigenesis. Additionally, neutrophils’ ability to form neutrophil extracellular traps further complicates their role, potentially promoting metastasis by trapping circulating tumor cells.">

        <tr id="Introduction and Objective: EVs are membrane-bound nanoparticles that contribute to cell:cell communication. β cell EV PD-L1 protein is increased by interferon (IFN) exposure and is able to bind and inactivate CD8+ T cells, suggesting a role in the interplay between β cell destruction and survival in T1D. However, mechanisms underlying β cell PD-L1 incorporation into EVs and its physiological effects are not completely understood.
 Methods: NIT-1 β cells were transfected with siRNA for STAT1+2 (vs. scramble control), then treated with 24h 2000 U/mL IFN-α (vs. vehicle). Murine NIT-1 β cells were transfected with PD-L1 to make PD-L1 overexpressing (PD-L1 OE) EVs. Anti-CD3 and CD28-activated nonobese diabetic mouse (NOD) splenocytes were treated with PD-L1 OE EVs. Flow cytometry-based assays tested functional impacts on CD4+ T cells. To test translational relevance, EV PD-L1 was quantified in pancreas slice perifusate from human organ donors with (n=11) or without (n=12) T1D using the ExoView-R200 imaging platform.
 Results: IFN-α treatment doubled β cell EV PD-L1 cargo without increasing EV numbers; this increase was abrogated by genetic STAT1/STAT2 inhibition. Compared to wild-type EVs, PD-L1 OE EVs suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation (0.4-fold reduction in CTV dye dilution) and decreased CD69 and CD25 activation marker expression. Anti-PD-L1 antibody pre-treatment reversed these effects, confirming a specific role for EV PD-L1 in CD4+ T cell suppression. Pancreas slice EVs exhibited significant heterogeneity in EV PD-L1 content, but overall EV PD-L1 was increased in donors with T1D vs. nondiabetic controls.
 Conclusion: β cell EV PD-L1 is increased in pancreas slice perifusate from donors with T1D. STAT pathway activation is required for IFN-induced β cell EV PD-L1 shuttling. Increased β cell EV PD-L1 modulates CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, suggesting a key role in the β cell:immune system dialogue surrounding β cell destruction in T1D.

        <tr id="Experimental Objective: During red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, inflammation promotes the production of anti-RBC alloantibodies that can cause significant hemolytic events. Avoiding RBC antigen exposure is the only strategy to prevent RBC alloimmunization in transfusion recipients. Identifying mechanisms that inhibit alloimmunization may lead to novel prophylactic interventions. One potential regulatory mechanism is the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of antioxidant pathways. Pharmacologic Nrf2 activators induce antioxidant production and improve the sequelae of inflammatory diseases. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that a Nrf2 activator, 1-[2-cyano-3-,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oyl]-imidazole (CDDO-Im), regulates inflammation-induced RBC alloimmunization. Methods: WT and Nrf2-deficient mice were treated with inflammatory stimuli and CDDO-Im prior to transfusion with RBCs expressing the KEL antigen (KEL+ RBCs). Anti-KEL IgM and IgG were measured in the serum of transfused mice. Nrf2-activated gene expression and interferon activity were measured in mice and human macrophages pre-treated with CDDO-Im and interferon stimuli. Results: Here, we report that CDDO-Im induces Nrf2-activated gene expression and inhibits type 1 interferon activity, which promotes RBC alloimmunization in transfusion models. In mice transfused with KEL+ RBCs, pre-treatment with CDDO-Im inhibited inflammation-induced anti-KEL antibody production and increased the post-transfusion recovery of KEL+ RBCs in a Nrf2-dependent manner. CDDO-Im also inhibited RBC alloimmunization in mice with pre-existing inflammation. Conclusions: These results indicate that the activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway regulates RBC alloimmunization to the KEL antigen in a pre-clinical model. If these findings translate to other models and human studies, Nrf2 activators may represent a potential prophylactic intervention to inhibit alloimmunization.">

Advances in single-cell and spatial technologies have begun to reveal how microenvironmental cues (including cytokines, chemokines, and cell–cell interactions) shape eosinophil behavior in health and disease. These insights are critical for understanding why certain patients respond variably to therapies targeting eosinophils and related type 2 pathways. By dissecting eosinophil heterogeneity in real human tissues, researchers may identify new biomarkers, refine endotyping approaches, and develop more precise therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes emerging concepts of eosinophil biology in inflammatory conditions, highlights the impact of spatial context on eosinophil functions, and discusses the future of advanced phenotyping in guiding personalized treatments.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The testicular immune microenvironment sustains homeostasis and immune privilege. However, the presence and functional significance of B cells within this specialized niche remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, the intricate crosstalk between resident immune populations and testicular stromal cells that may orchestrate the immunological and endocrine microenvironment during sexual maturation warrants systematic investigation.


OBJECTIVE
To systematically delineate the immune cell atlas and developmental trajectory of testicular leukocytes before and after sexual maturation.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
An integrated analysis of leukocytes in post-sexual maturity (8-week-old) and pre-sexual maturity (2-week-old) mouse testes using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF), was performed. Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) isolated immune subsets, followed by bioinformatics interrogation of cellular heterogeneity and ligand-receptor network analysis to map intercellular communication pathways.


RESULTS
Through scRNA-seq clustering analysis, we resolved 18 distinct leukocyte populations (11 lymphoid and seven myeloid lineages), which were further validated and expanded to 17 phenotypically discrete subsets (eight lymphoid and nine myeloid) via high-dimensional CyTOF profiling. Notably, we identified a rare but functionally significant B lymphocyte population within the testicular compartment. The myeloid compartment exhibited pronounced developmental plasticity, marked by progressive Il1b+Macrophages diminution and regulatory T cell expansion during maturation. Cell communication network analysis revealed intensified ligand-receptor cross-talk between androgen-producing Leydig cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes in post-pubertal testes, providing mechanistic insights into age-dependent immune privilege establishment.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Multi-omics integration reveals dynamic immune remodeling during testicular maturation. These findings underscore the potential involvement of B cells in local immune surveillance while identifying maturation-associated signaling axes between stromal and immune cells. This comprehensive mapping of testicular leukocyte dynamics significantly advances our understanding of reproductive immunology and lays foundation for investigating immune-mediated testicular pathologies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immune resilience is the capacity of the immune system to recover from sepsis-induced organ injury and reestablish host defense. While sepsis survivors are often viewed as immunocompromised, recent studies suggest that some may acquire adaptive immune traits that enhance resistance to secondary infections. Methods We employed a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model to study polymicrobial sepsis and subsequent immune responses. Listeria monocytogenes was used as a model intracellular pathogen to assess immune protection. We analyzed myeloid cell phenotypes using single-cell RNA sequencing and evaluated lipid metabolic changes through quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, serum cytokine assays, and plasma lipidomics. Results Sepsis-surviving mice showed enhanced resistance to Listeria infection. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed transcriptional reprogramming in splenic CD11b+Ly6Chigh myeloid cells, including downregulation of lipoprotein lipase and lipid efflux genes. CD11b+ myeloid cells exhibited increased lipid droplet accumulation, accompanied by elevated serum interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) levels. Plasma lipidomics identified systemic lipid remodeling, with increased phosphatidylserine and decreased phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol levels. Discussion Our findings suggest that sepsis survival induces lipid metabolic reprogramming in myeloid cells, contributing to enhanced immunity against intracellular pathogens. These insights reveal potential therapeutic targets within lipid metabolic pathways to improve host defense in sepsis survivors.">

        <tr id="The role of CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear. Similarly, the posttranscriptional regulation of the highly heterogenic CD8+ T cell populations and their effector function in IBD also remains poorly understood. Here, we find that miR‐29a and ‐29b (miR‐29a/b) regulate T cell fate, and their expression is higher near damaged colon tissue in patients with IBD compared to controls. In mice, we find that miR‐29a/b suppresses the differentiation of CD8+ T cells and the secretion of pro‐inflammatory and chemotactic factors during severe colitis by inhibiting transcriptional pathways, including those involving the T cell receptor and JAK‐STAT signaling. Furthermore, we identify Ifng, an inflammatory factor that drives immune response and the reshaping of CD8+ T cell fate, as a potential target of the miRNAs. Finally, we show that delivery of miR‐29 mimics to the colon of mice is sufficient to alleviate DSS‐induced inflammation. Together, these data show that miR‐29 plays an important role in suppressing T cell overactivation during inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID) are characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and increased susceptibility to infections. However, non‐infectious comorbidities (NICM) are also frequent manifestations of the disease. We search for distinctive immunophenotypes in CVID patients with NICM. Data were obtained from the clinical records and laboratory analyses of 42 CVID patients. Descriptive statistics, median comparisons, bivariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Median comparison of the immunological variables among patients with or without NICM revealed significant decreased levels of serum IgG, percentages of naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, total B cells and CD56dim NK cells in peripheral blood from CVID patients with NICM together with an increase in the percentages of effector memory (EM) CD4+ and terminally differentiated effector memory (EMRA) CD8+ T cells. By using logistic regressions, we determined the likelihood of exhibiting blood immunological abnormalities in patients with NICM vs. those without NICM. Finally, discriminant analyses and ROC curves established that percentages of CD4+ EM T cells and CD8+ EMRA T cells > 47.4% and 40.2% from the total CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, respectively, might be associated with NICM in CVID. These differences were also observed in CVID patients with Polyclonal lymphocytic infiltration. These data suggest subpopulations of effector T cells as potential biomarkers of NICM in CVID. Prospective studies are needed to determine the usefulness of our findings in the prognosis of CVID.">

 Background:
 CUE-101 is a novel fusion protein designed to selectively engage and expand HPV16-specific T-cells to promote an anti-tumor immune response in HPV+ malignancies. CUE-101 is comprised of the HPV16 E7
 11-20
 epitope, HLA-A*0201, and a reduced affinity human IL2. In this single-arm Phase 2 trial (NCT04852328), CUE-101 is administered to HLA-A*0201+ patients with HPV16+ LA-OPSCC in three schedules (A, B, and C) before curative-intent surgery and adjuvant therapy or definitive chemoradiation therapy. Primary endpoints were safety of CUE-101 and changes in the frequency of HPV16 E7
 11-20
 -specific CD8+ T cells in blood and tumor. Correlates in TIL for Schedules A and B are presented here.
 Methods:
 CUE-101 (4 mg/kg IV) was administered 14 days (Schedule A), 14 and 7 days (Schedule B), or 7 days (Schedule C) before curative-intent treatment. Biopsies of the primary tumor were collected before CUE-101 administration and within 2 days prior to curative-intent therapy. Single-cell RNA and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing (scRNAseq, 10X Genomics) was performed on fresh sorted CD8 T-cells. HPV16 E7
 11-20
 dextramer staining and flow cytometry assessed reactivity to HPV E7. Multiplex immunofluorescent (mIF) tissue staining with a 30-marker Phenocycler panel (Akoya Biosciences) assessed tumor, myeloid, and T-cell states. Changes in T-cell clonal frequency were significant if fold change >2 and fisher exact test adjusted p <0.05. Changes in cell populations after treatment were evaluated by two-tailed paired student’s t-test.
 Results:
 Of 20 total patients enrolled, paired biopsies from 13 of sufficient quality were analyzed by scRNAseq, flow cytometry, and mIF. In a joint analysis of Schedules A (n=7) and B (n=6), we identified multiple T-cell clones that significantly expanded following CUE-101 treatment, representing 4-51% (mean 18.3%) of tumor-infiltrating CD8 cells by scRNAseq. Among these, we found significant enrichment for phenotypes of chronic T cell activation (PD1+CD39+, often associated with tumor reactivity, p =0.041). In agreement with this finding, flow cytometry of TIL showed increased CD8+CD39+ cells (mean 10.9%, p =0.026) among CD45 cells, and a small increase in NK cells (1.7%, p =0.005). Absolute cell counts by mIF confirmed these trends. Direct dextramer staining of TIL samples has not specifically identified HPV E7
 11-20
 reactive T cells pre- or post-treatment, therefore cloning of TCRs from expanded T-cells is being performed to enable functional testing of HPV reactivity.
 Conclusions:
 Significant clonal expansion of intra-tumoral CD8 T-cells with signatures associated with tumor reactivity were observed within 2 weeks of CUE-101 administration in HPV16+ LA OPSCC. Studies in blood and of T-cell specificities are ongoing.

        <tr id="Human papillomavirus-mediated recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a premalignant neoplasia of the upper airway characterized by significant dysphonia and respiratory obstruction. Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a potential alternative to repeated surgical interventions in RRP. Here, we investigated the intralesional T-cell composition and expression of the immune checkpoints programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) in RRP. We analyzed tissue samples from 30 patients treated at a tertiary care center between 2009 and 2021, including paired samples from individual patients collected at different time points. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for CD4, CD8, CTLA-4, FoxP3, and PD-L1 and correlated with disease severity and previous adjuvant therapies. Overall disease burden and intervention-free survival were not associated with the abundance of CD4+, CD8+, or FoxP3+ T cells, nor with immune checkpoint expression. However, patients with aggressive disease exhibited a higher intralesional FoxP3/CD4 T-cell ratio. Prior intralesional cidofovir treatment was associated with reduced CD4+ T-cell infiltration. These findings suggest that a locally immunosuppressive microenvironment, reflected by an elevated FoxP3/CD4 ratio, contributes to disease severity in RRP. Consistent CTLA-4 expression across all evaluated samples supports further investigation of anti-CTLA-4 therapy, either alone or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Since the lung is a mucosal barrier organ with a unique immunologic environment, mechanisms of immunoregulation in lung cancer may differ from those of other malignancies. Consistent with this notion, we found that CD8+ T cells play a paradoxical role in facilitating, rather than ameliorating, the growth of multiple lung adenocarcinoma models. These include spontaneous, carcinogen-induced, and transplantable tumor cell line models. Specifically, we found that CD8+ T cells promote homing of CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells to the tumor bed by increasing levels of CCR5 chemokines in the tumor microenvironment in an IFN-γ and TNF-α dependent manner. Contrary to their canonical role, these Th1 cytokines contributed to accelerated growth of murine lung adenocarcinomas while suppressing the growth of other malignancies. Surprisingly, lung cancer cells themselves can serve as a dominant source of IFN-γ, and deletion of this cytokine from cancer cells using CRISPR/Cas-9 decreases tumor growth. Importantly for translational applications, a high level of IFN-γ was also found in human lung cancer patients at both the mRNA and protein level. Our data outlines what we deem a novel and previously undefined lung cancer specific immunoregulatory pathway that may be harnessed to tailor immune based therapy specifically for this malignancy.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. Unfortunately, the inability of lymphocytes to infiltrate the tumor nest, a phenomenon known as immune exclusion, drastically limits ICB responsiveness. Analyzing the immune landscape of matched pre- and early on-treatment biopsies of patients with melanoma undergoing ICB therapy, we observed a significant increase in cytotoxic NK cells in early on-treatment biopsies from nonresponders. Spatial multiomic analyses revealed that, although NK cells colocalized with CD8+ T cells within the tumor bed in responding lesions, they were excluded from the tumor parenchyma in nonresponding lesions. Strikingly, pharmacologic depletion of NK cells in a unique melanoma mouse model exhibiting an immune-excluded phenotype unleashed immune infiltration of the tumor core and tumor clearance upon ICB exposure. Mechanistically, we show that NK cells are actively recruited to immune-excluded areas upon ICB exposure via the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 to suppress tumor infiltration and antitumor function of CD8+ T cells.


SIGNIFICANCE
Immune exclusion is responsible for intrinsic resistance to ICB in about half of nonresponder patients. Our unexpected observation that targeting NK cell biology unleashes the recruitment and antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells in tumors with an immune-excluded phenotype offers a potential therapeutic avenue for this large patient population.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibit a dual role in tumor progression and antitumor immunity. However, understanding the functional states and molecular mechanisms of antitumor TAMs remains a challenge. Herein, we show that intratumoral administration of a combination of agonists against TLR3 and CD40 (hereafter termed myeloid cell treatment, MCT) reprogrammed TAMs in situ to adopt a protective antitumor phenotype in an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model, and that this led to tumor regression. Single-cell RNA sequencing of TAMs from different tumor stages and post-MCT revealed a transient antitumor TAM phenotype, present at 12h post-MCT, characterized by markers such as iNOS and CD38, which was replaced by TAMs co-expressing tumor-limiting and promoting features by 72h post-MCT. Maintenance of antitumor TAMs required repeated MCT administration, and this promoted the activation of CD8+ T cells and long-term tumor eradication. Mechanistically, ROS and TNF-α were pivotal in TAM-mediated tumor control. Our findings uncover the vulnerability of transient TAM reprogramming and show that it can be overcome by repeated MCT administrations to sustain efficient antitumor immune responses.">

Methods Peripheral blood samples were collected from CLL patients (n = 52) and healthy controls (n = 30). ILC2 proportions and IL-9 levels were assessed using flow cytometry and ELISA. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to stain GATA3, CRTH2, and IL-9 in cervical lymph nodes from CLL patients (n = 10) and control subjects with reactive lymphadenitis (n = 10). Correlation analysis between ILC2s and IL-9 was conducted using the Spearman test. ILC2s were sorted and cultured from CLL patients, followed by co-culture experiments with PBMCs of healthy controls and MEC-1 cells, with or without anti-IL-9 antibody intervention. Flow cytometry was used to measure the proportions of ILC2s, Treg cells, PD-1+/TIGIT+/CTLA-4+ Treg subsets, and granzyme B+/perforin+ CD8+ T cells, along with MEC-1 cell apoptosis. Results The proportions of ILC2s and Treg, along with serum IL-9 levels, were significantly elevated in CLL patients (P < 0.05). Peripheral blood ILC2s were positively correlated with IL-9 (r = 0.609, P < 0.001). The average fluorescence intensity of GATA3, CRTH2, and IL-9 in the cervical lymph nodes of CLL patients increased significantly (P < 0.001), and IL-9 showed colocalization with GATA3 and CRTH2. In vitro, IL-9 levels in the supernatant of sorted ILC2s from CLL patients increased. Treatment with anti-IL-9 antibody significantly reduced the PD-1+ Treg and TIGIT+ Treg cells while increasing granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant effect on Treg, CTLA-4+ Treg, and perforin+ CD8+ T cells (P > 0.05). Additionally, anti-IL-9 antibody significantly increased early apoptosis (P < 0.05). Conclusion ILC2s affect CD8+ T cells and Treg cells through IL-9, weakening the anti-tumor effects of CD8+ T cells and enhancing the immunosuppressive effects of Treg cells, thereby contributing to CLL pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Abstract 
A variety of body tissues contain tissue-resident memory CD8+T cells – long-lived multifunctional effector cells formed during the immune response to infection, which populate previously infected tissue long term. The localization of these cells is determined due to expression of a set of adhesive molecules that hold the cell in a specific tissue microenvironment, as well as the lack of molecules involved in exiting into the blood and lymphatic vessels. The program for establishing such cell phenotype can apparently be launched at various stages of T cell maturation during the immune response. Resident memory CD8+ T cells protect tissues from viruses and other intracellular parasites, kill transformed cells, and in some cases participate in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. The accumulation of resident memory T cells can be induced by vaccination, and targeting these cells by vaccines, along with triggering a protective humoral response, appears desirable for the prevention of many intracellular infections. At the site of pathogen entry, resident memory CD8+ T cells can provide tissue protection quicker than circulating T cells, which is essential for preventing rapidly evolving viral infections. Localization of memory CD8+ T cells in tissues allows the pool of these cells to be increased without obvious restrictions. Accordingly, it is possible to carry out a large number of different vaccinations to stimulate these cells without losing the vaccines effectiveness. Finally, not all pathogens antigenic epitopes recognized by CD8+ T cells undergo rapid and systematic changes such as the surface B-cell epitopes of the same pathogens. Additional recruitment of resident memory CD8+ T cells in response to a vaccine may ensure greater coverage of pathogen variants and contribute to developing heterosubtypic immunity. The review presents data on resident memory CD8+ T cells in various tissues, their participation in the immune response to infections and vaccinations, as well as molecules that control their localization.">

Therefore, TIM3 has been suggested as a potential target for AML treatment. Hence, we explored the feasibility of targeting TIM3 with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cells. Despite the expression of TIM3 on activated T‐cells, TIM3 CAR T‐cells were successfully generated from different healthy individuals with excellent in vitro expansion without signs of fratricide and sustained central‐memory phenotype with minimal expression of exhaustion‐related markers, including complete loss of TIM3 expression. TIM3 loss also did not affect effector functions since TIM3 CAR T‐cells efficiently lysed TIM3+ leukemic cell lines, produced Th1‐predominant cytokines, successfully inhibited the colony‐forming of TIM3+ AML‐derived LSPCs, and showed excellent AML tumor control in xenogeneic mouse models. Notably, TIM3 CAR T‐cells did not affect healthy hematopoietic progenitor cells and healthy mature hematopoietic cells that express TIM3 at moderate levels, suggesting an optimal therapeutic window for the treatment of AML.">

        <tr id="CD4+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are essential for immune protection in the lungs, providing rapid responses against respiratory pathogens. Unlike circulating memory T cells, CD4+ TRM cells persist in the tissue parenchyma and possibly inducible lymphoid tissues, where they facilitate pathogen clearance through cytokine production and interactions with local immune cells. While CD8+ TRM cells are well studied, the role of CD4+ TRM cells in immunity remains less defined and is the focus of this review. Distinct subsets, based on the effector TH1, TH2, TH17 and T follicular helper (TFH)-like tissue-resident helper (TRH) cells, contribute to antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and vaccine-induced immunity. CD4+ TRM cells play a key role in infections, enhancing immune responses and supporting antibody production. However, they are also implicated in chronic inflammation, allergies and fibrosis. Given their importance, vaccines aiming to elicit lung-resident CD4+ TRM cells, particularly via mucosal delivery, have shown promise in inducing long-term protective immunity. Intranasal vaccination strategies, such as live-attenuated influenza virus and tuberculosis vaccines, have successfully generated CD4+ TRM cells, highlighting their potential for respiratory pathogen control. In this review, we focus on CD4+ TRM cells, their differentiation, maintenance and role, especially in the lungs.">

        <tr id="Purpose
The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM2) creates an immunosuppressive environment, but the effects of anticancer treatment on TREM2 and the tumor microenvironment (TME) are not well established. This study investigates the impact of chemotherapy on TREM2-expressing macrophages within the lung adenocarcinoma TME.


Materials and Methods
Using single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of paired normal-appearing lung tissue (NL) and tumor (Tu), human and mouse lung cancer tissue, and THP-1 cells, we observed the effects of anticancer drugs on them.


Results
Myeloid cells (MY) were the second-most abundant non-epithelial component in the Tu, though less prevalent than in NL. Specific MY subclusters abundant in Tu showed overexpression of TREM2. In lung cancer-induced Kras-G12D mice, M2 proportion increased in Tu compared to NL; cisplatin increased TREM2+ M2 proportion in Tu. TREM2+ cells in Tu showed interactions with cell clusters showing characteristics of interstitial macrophage such as mo-lineage, mono-Mc, and CD163/LGMN cells via FN:CD44 and MIF:CD74+CXCR4, suggesting that they influence the recruitment of those cells to Tu and TME reshape. In M0-state THP-1 cells, cisplatin and osimertinib treatments induced polarization towards M1 and M2 states and increased TREM2 expression. Cisplatin promoted uptake of phosphatidylserine-coated latex beads by M0 cells, whereas osimertinib reduced uptake by polarized macrophages. These findings suggest anticancer treatments impact the lung immune microenvironment by altering the TREM2+ cells.


Conclusion
Given TREM2's central inhibitory role in the tumor immune environment, effects of chemotherapeutic agents should be considered in developing TREM2-targeting therapies.">

 Background:
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy with a median survival of 9–11 months. Despite the addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to frontline chemotherapy, improvements remain limited. SCLC evades anti-tumor immunity by suppressing major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and antigen presentation (AP). The variability of MHC repression across molecular subtypes of SCLC and high-grade neuroendocrine tumors is not fully understood. This study analyzed clinical SCLC and neuroendocrine tumor samples to identify molecular subtypes and regulators of MHC repression, enhancing the understanding of immune evasion.
 Methods:
 Molecular profiling was conducted on 944 SCLC and 5056 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors using next-generation DNA (592-gene panel/whole exome), RNA (whole transcriptome) sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. Transcriptomic profiling of 40 SCLC cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) was also performed.
 Results:
 Key regulators and gene networks driving MHC-I suppression in SCLC and other high-grade neuroendocrine tumors were identified. Canonical (MHC-I and II) and non-canonical AP expression scores characterized the spectrum of MHC-I repression across subtypes. Low MHC-I scores correlated with reduced immune signatures (e.g., T cell-inflamed, NK cell, and STING pathway signatures; Spearman = 0.87, 0.58, 0.62, respectively) and predicted poor OS and PFS to immunotherapy. Enhancer network and gene expression analyses identified actionable regulators of MHC-I repression, including interferon signaling. Knockout studies of top MHC-I regulators and single cell analyses revealed non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) genes (like DNAPKCs) inversely correlated with HLA-A/B/C expression. DNAPKCs inhibition upregulated MHC-I, TAP1, and TAP2, enhanced antigen-specific T-cell-mediated cytolysis in SCLC. This inhibition activated the STING pathway, increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and enhanced MHC Class-I. Combining DNAPKCs inhibitor NU1774 with anti-PD-L1 reactivated MHC-I and led to significant tumor regression in aggressive murine SCLC models, supporting new combination therapies.
 Conclusions:
 We identified molecular subtypes and actionable pathways to restore MHC-I expression in SCLC, advancing understanding of immune evasion mechanisms. DNAPKCs is established as a key therapeutic target, enhancing PD-L1 blockade by reactivating antigen presentation. The developed MHC-I expression scores and associated biomarkers offer predictive tools for identifying patients likely to benefit from immunotherapy. These findings support biomarker-driven, personalized approaches to improve treatment for SCLC, addressing a critical unmet need in this devastating cancer.

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a major driver. Despite the pivotal role of viral infections in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME), the mechanistic differences among HBV-, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-, and non-B non-C (NBNC)-associated HCC remain poorly understood. By integrating the largest publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of HCC (160 samples from 124 patients) with multi-scale protein-level validation using multiplex immunofluorescence and tissue microarrays (198 HCC specimens), HLA-DR⁺ tumor cells are identified as a distinctive feature of HBV+HCC. These tumor cells uniquely express MHC class II molecules, typically restricted to antigen-presenting cells, and correlate with immune checkpoint activation and PD-L1 expression, potentially contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment specific to HBV+HCC. Trajectory analysis revealed distinct CD8⁺ T-cell differentiation pathways in HBV+HCC, characterized by enhanced exhaustion and stem-like phenotypes. HLA-DR⁺ tumor cells are associated with increased recruitment of CD8⁺ T cells and correlated with T-cell exhaustion, potentially contributing to a suppressive TME. Clinically, high proportions of HLA-DR⁺ tumor cells are linked to poor survival outcomes, especially when accompanied by elevated PD-L1 expression, suggesting that HLA-DR⁺ tumor cells may serve as a potential predictive biomarker for immunotherapy efficacy in HCC. Collectively, the findings highlight HLA-DR⁺ tumor cells as a distinctive feature of HBV-associated HCC (HBV+HCC), providing novel insights into possible immunosuppressive mechanisms and therapeutic targets for immunotherapy in this disease context.">

At the center of this process are CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), which have emerged as pivotal mediators to ensure immunological equilibrium. This review explores the sophisticated mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates the differentiation, expansion, and functional specialization of Tregs, orchestrating intestinal immune tolerance to support host-microbiota mutualism. We discuss the role of microbial-derived structural components and metabolites in shaping the immunoregulatory fitness of Tregs. Additionally, we explore the impact of gut microbial dysbiosis, where disrupted microbial-immune crosstalk compromises immune tolerance, contributing to the development of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Finally, we highlight the potential of microbiota-based strategies to recalibrate intestinal immunity and restore immune tolerance.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy for systemic sclerosis (SSc), a rare autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and vasculopathy. Recent evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefits of MSCs do not depend directly on their ability to proliferate but rather on their capacity to release extracellular nanovesicles known as exosomes (MSC-Exos). MSC-Exos are rich in bioactive molecules such as microRNAs, which can modulate gene expression and trigger significant biological responses, playing a central role in modulating immune responses, inhibiting fibrotic pathways and promoting tissue repair and angiogenesis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that MSC-Exos can attenuate fibrosis, modulate macrophage polarization, suppress autoreactive lymphocyte activity, and even reverse pulmonary arterial hypertension in animal models of SSc. Compared to cell-based therapies, MSC-Exos offer several advantages, including lower immunogenicity and better safety profile. This review provides an overview of the immunomodulatory, antifibrotic, and angiogenic properties of MSC-Exos and explores their potential as novel cell-free therapy for SSc.">

        <tr id="Plasma cell survival is influenced by various factors, including soluble mediators, intrinsic and extrinsic signals as well as adhesion molecules defining the bone marrow microenvironment. The role of their induction, turnover and competition dynamics among different antigen-specific bone marrow plasma cell subsets is not well understood. This study addresses the co-expression of CD19 and CD56 on both antigen-specific and total human bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC) using multiparametric flow cytometry and data from a previous single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) study. While the RNA-seq data reflects characteristics of total BMPC, flow cytometry data enables detailed comparison of antigen-specific subsets, such as tetanus toxoid (TT)- and receptor binding domain (RBD, a region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein)-specific BMPC. CD56 expression is enriched among CD19- BMPC, particularly on those expressing IgG. RBD-specific BMPC typically lack CD56 expression, while TT-specific BMPC exhibit a substantially enriched CD56+CD19- BMPC population. Phenotypic and transcriptional characteristics (CD19 and NCAM1 [CD56] co-expression) together with distinct transcriptional profiles (including cell-cell adhesion, endopeptidase activity) and IgG/IgA expression identified remarkable differences between RBD-specific and TT-specific BMPC. These findings suggest that CD56 likely facilitates tissue retention of rather long-lived BMPC lacking CD19 expression. Given the emerging potential of selective BMPC subsets, this study may provide a rational for optimized vaccination protocols, as well as for selective plasma-cell targeting in autoimmunity. In this context, CD56+CD19- BMPC emerge as potential candidates for a long-lived and stable compartment.">

Here, we studied whether the cancer secretome is a determinant of such tumor phenotype. Methods We quantified immune histologic markers in paraffin-embedded DIPG samples and healthy brainstem controls. We identified and quantified cytokines in frozen tissue samples, DIPG culture supernatants, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from patients and controls. We studied the phenotype of mesenchymal cells, brain microvascular endothelial cells and macrophages following their exposure to DIPG secretomes. Results We found profuse infiltration of anti-inflammatory CD163+ microglia/macrophages in the brains of 23 DIPG patients, compared to low levels in 5 controls. In DIPG, B7-H3 was predominantly expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin (CD90+) transformed to pericytes (PDGFRβ+). In frozen samples from 14 patients with DIPG and 4 controls, we identified a common secretome pattern, with osteopontin and chitinase-3-like 1 (CHI3L1) overexpressed in DIPG. Such proteins were abundant in the culture supernatants of 7 DIPG models. Osteopontin and CHI3L1 concentrations in the CSF of 18 patients were significantly higher than in 18 controls (P < 0.0001). In vitro, DIPG supernatants and recombinant osteopontin or CHI3L1 induced phenotypic changes in (i) mesenchymal cells, which turned into B7-H3+ pericyte-like cells, (ii) endothelial cells, which organized complex tube networks and overexpressed the blood-brain barrier marker BCRP, even in subcutaneous xenografts, and (iii) macrophages, which were polarized towards the M2-like type. Conclusions DIPG cells secrete proteins that create an immunosuppressed niche.">

        <tr id="Mitochondria are integral to the regulation of CD8+ T cell function, critically influencing processes such as activation, differentiation, and long-term persistence during immune responses. Emerging evidence highlights the detrimental impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on CD8+ T cell activity, contributing to immune exhaustion and impairing both antitumor and antiviral immunity. This underscores the importance of understanding and modulating mitochondrial dynamics to optimize T cell-based immunotherapies. In this review, a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the essential mitochondrial processes-including biogenesis, redox homeostasis, and metabolic reprogramming is provided-that govern CD8+ T cell function and are intricately linked to their therapeutic potential. The current strategies aimed at enhancing mitochondrial function in CD8+ T cells are also examined, focusing on both metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial-targeted interventions. Despite these promising approaches, several significant challenges remain, such as achieving selective targeting, addressing mitochondrial plasticity, and mitigating off-target effects. Overcoming these obstacles will be crucial to improving the clinical efficacy and safety of mitochondrial modulation therapies. As the understanding of mitochondrial dynamics within CD8+ T cells continues to evolve, there is growing potential to leverage these insights to improve immune-based therapies across a range of diseases, including cancer and viral infections.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in modulating excessive immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis in humans. Notably, therapeutic strategies employing autologous and allogeneic Tregs have shown promising signs of efficacy in the treatment and prevention of graft versus-host disease (GvHD), transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases. Treg cells are typically obtained from peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood, but the largely antigen-experienced memory state of peripheral blood Tregs and the limited number of Tregs that can be isolated from cord blood remain obstacles. However, recent studies have identified the thymus as a novel and promising source of Tregs, overcoming the abovementioned limitations. Currently, human thymus-isolated regulatory T cells (thyTregs) are being investigated in phase 1/2 clinical trials to assess their safety and efficacy in both autologous and allogeneic settings.

        <tr id="Abstract Background As sentinel cells of innate immunity, macrophages exhibit microenvironment-driven functional plasticity critical for immune regulation and tissue homeostasis, yet maladaptive metabolic reprogramming-induced polarization dysregulation exacerbates disease progression by manifesting immune dysfunction. Summary This review systematically deciphers the metabolic signatures governing macrophage polarization – spanning amino acid metabolism, glycolytic flux, lipid dynamics, and iron homeostasis – while dissecting how pathological microenvironments (encompassing tumor niches, atherosclerotic plaques, and obese adipose tissue) co-opt these pathways to drive pathogenesis. Crucially, this analysis demonstrates that cellular metabolism dictates macrophage phenotypic/functional states across disease contexts, with comprehensive decoding of their metabolic networks emerging as imperative for developing next-generation immunotherapies. Key Messages Therapeutically, pathogenic polarization may be reversed through strategic interventions targeting metabolite-sensing receptors, pharmacologically blocking metabolic checkpoints, and reprogramming core metabolic modalities to restore immunoregulatory competence.">

        <tr id="In the past decade, immunotherapies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) have been approved for solid tumors. However, some patients demonstrate suboptimal clinical outcomes due to resistance. The tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly affects the efficiency of immunotherapy by mediating interactions between tumor and non-tumor cells, including dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These non-tumor cells often exhibit two phenotypes with altered functions, and tumor cells drives their transition towards tumor promotion through tumor-education. Tumor-educated cells (TECs) are cells influenced by tumor cells, which acquire immune-suppressive phenotypes and promote tumor progression through resistance to anti-cancer therapies. These cells undergo modifications in response to signals from the tumor, which can influence their roles in tumor progression. Their dynamic interactions with tumor cells contribute to the reshaping of the TME, facilitating cancer growth and immune modulation. This review summarizes research on TECs in TME, explores mechanisms related to tumor education, and discusses their role in tumor progression and immunotherapy resistance. Additionally, potential therapeutic approaches targeting these cells are also reviewed, which may complement current treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Introduction T-cell exhaustion is a major mechanism of immune evasion. Recently, the therapeutic and prognostic implications of progenitor exhausted T cells (Tpex) and terminally exhausted T cells (Ttex) have been explored in various cancer types. This study explored the immunogenomic characteristics and prognostic implications of Tpex and Ttex in colorectal cancers (CRCs). Methods We performed multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) using antibodies against CK, CD3, CD8, TCF1, and FOXP3 to assess diverse subsets of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in 517 patients with stage III or high-risk stage II CRCs. We compared the infiltration level of these TIL subsets with the genetic profiles of CRCs, including microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and mutations in 40 tumor-associated genes across five biological pathways. Results CD8+ T cell density, the CD8/CD3 ratio, and the Ttex/CD8+ T cell ratio were elevated in microsatellite instability-high and tumor mutational burden-high tumors. Survival analysis showed that, higher CD8+ T cell density, higher regulatory T cell/CD3+ T cell ratio, and higher Ttex/CD8+ T cell ratio exhibited better 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates. When tumors were categorized into CD8-high, CD8-low/Ttex-low, and CD8-low/Ttex-high groups, the CD8-high and CD8-low/Ttex-high groups showed better 5-year RFS than the CD8-low/Ttex-low group. Discussion Ttex infiltration is associated with MSI and TMB status and may serve as a prognostic marker of CRCs.">

 Background:
 Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is critical for cancer immunity, but its therapeutic use is limited by systemic toxicity and a narrow therapeutic window. To address this, we developed TEV-56278, an antibody-cytokine fusion protein currently under investigation in a Ph1 dose escalation clinical study. TEV-56278 is designed to deliver an attenuated form of IL-2 (AttIL2) to PD-1-expressing T cells. Unlike similar compounds, TEV-56278 binds to a distinct epitope of PD-1, allowing for combined use with PD-1 blocking antibodies. In mice models, it induced elevation of T cell percentages within tumors and mediated tumor regression without systemic toxicity. To characterize TEV-56278’s mechanism of action and identify potential response/resistance signatures in human samples, we conducted a multiomic analysis on patient-derived tumor fragments (PDTF).
 Methods:
 PDTF from 15 renal cell carcinoma patients were treated ex vivo with TEV-56278 [100 µg/ml], aldesleukin [100 ng/ml, as positive control], or a control PD-1 non-targeted-AttIL-2 [100 µg/ml]. Baseline and treated PDTFs were dissociated and sorted for live immune cells and single-cell multiomic profiling was performed. The multiomic dataset includes measurements of cell abundance, cell type-specific RNA and protein expression and clonality of T cell subsets. Cytokine production was measured by multiplex ELISA. All measurements were input into Immunai’s ImmunoDynamics Engine, a proprietary machine learning framework to determine the mechanism of action of TEV-56278.
 Results:
 TEV-56278 induces pSTAT5 in PDTF model, supporting highly localized activity of AttIL-2 moiety. TEV-56278 selectively triggers IL-2 signaling in PD1
 high
 T cells and promotes reinvigoration of exhausted CD8+ T cells. In contrast, aldesleukin induces broader transcriptional changes in both PD1
 low
 and PD1
 high
 cell types. TEV-56278 elicits varying degrees of immune activation and a secreted profile associated with immune cell infiltration and PD-1 responsiveness (e.g. CXCL10, CCL20, IL12 p40). The features associated with stronger response are being evaluated to inform indication and patient selection on future trials.
 Conclusions:
 We performed in-depth characterization of TEV-56278 in a human tumor ex vivo system that incorporates features of the tumor microenvironment and models the dynamic response of TEV-56278. This study confirms that TEV-56278 targets IL-2 activity to PD-1 expressing T cells within the tumor microenvironment and induces strong immune response, thereby promoting anti-tumor activity. Understanding the mechanisms that drive variable responses in PDTF may improve precision immuno-oncology efforts and help optimize our clinical development strategy.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) continues to cause more than 1 million deaths annually, due to pathogen persistence in lung macrophages and dendritic cells derived from blood monocytes. While the accumulation of monocyte-derived cells in the Mtb-infected lung partially depends on the chemokine receptor CCR2, the other chemoattractant receptors regulating trafficking remain undefined. We used mice expressing knock-in/knockout reporter alleles of Ccr2 and Cx3cr1 to interrogate their expression and function in monocyte-derived populations of the lungs and draining mediastinal lymph nodes during Mtb infection. CCR2 and CX3CR1 expression varied across monocyte-derived subsets stratified by cell surface Ly6C expression in both organs. We found that the expression of CCR2 predicted the dependence of monocyte-derived cells on the receptor for lung and lymph node accumulation. CCR2-deficient mice were also observed to have worsened lung and lymph node Mtb burden. While CX3CR1 deficiency, alone or in combination with CCR2 deficiency, did not affect cell frequencies or lung Mtb control, its absence was associated with altered positioning of monocyte-derived dendritic cells in mediastinal lymph nodes. We found that the combined loss of Ccr2 and Cx3cr1 also worsened Mtb control in the mediastinal lymph node, suggesting a rationale for the persistent expression of CX3CR1 among monocyte-derived cells in pulmonary tuberculosis. IMPORTANCE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the respiratory pathogen responsible for the deadliest infectious disease worldwide. Susceptible humans exhibit ineffective immune responses, in which infected phagocytes are not able to eliminate the pathogen. Since recruited monocyte-derived cells serve as reservoirs for persistent infection, understanding how these phagocytes accumulate in the lung and why they are unable to eliminate Mtb can inform the development of therapies that can synergize with antimicrobials to achieve faster and more durable Mtb elimination. Monocyte-derived cells express the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1, but the role of the latter in Mtb infection remains poorly defined. The significance of our study is in elucidating the roles of these receptors in the trafficking of monocyte-derived cells in the infected lung and mediastinal lymph node. These data shed light on the host response in tuberculosis and other pulmonary infections.

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives Traumatic injury triggers the rapid release of damage‐associated patterns (DAMPs). Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play key roles in sensing, processing, and presenting DAMPs to naïve T cells. These heterogeneous immune cells express the adhesion GPCR EMR2/ADGRE2, which is likely regulated by DAMPs. Methods We analysed the various blood DC and monocyte subsets in trauma patients and uninjured volunteers using flow cytometry. EMR2 and its closest relatives, CD97/ADGRE5 and EMR3/ADGRE3, were quantified on these subsets to gain insights into their (patho)physiological regulation. Results Following trauma, conventional and plasmocytoid DCs nearly disappeared from the circulation, which is inversely correlated with injury severity and adverse clinical parameters 120–240 h post injury. Alterations in EMR2 and CD97 on DCs were relatively minor. Classical monocytes increased, while non‐classical monocytes showed a sustained decline in both absolute number and percentage, in a manner dependent on injury severity after trauma. EMR2 expression increased across all monocyte subsets, whereas CD97 showed little change. EMR3 expression decreased and remained low in classical monocytes, while it markedly increased in non‐classical monocytes. These temporal patterns in adhesion GPRC expression were largely independent of injury severity and were observed in all injured patients. Conclusion Circulating DC and monocyte subsets underwent significant compositional changes after trauma, often correlating with injury severity and other clinical parameters. Despite structural similarities, EMR2, CD97, and EMR3 showed distinct regulatory patterns on monocyte subsets, suggesting different functional roles in the immune response to injury.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable haematological malignancy. The bone marrow immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in MM progression. Our previous studies have shown that natural killer (NK) cell function is depleted in the bone marrow microenvironment of patients with MM. Therefore, it is urgent to explore the mechanisms underlying NK cell depletion and identify potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we focused on the mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets of MM osteoblasts that promote bone marrow NK cell depletion. The receptor activator of NF-kappa B (RANK) expression in bone marrow NK cells of patients with MM was significantly higher than that in normal controls. Serum receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL) levels in patients with MM were also significantly higher than those in normal controls. MM cells can induce RANK expression in NK cells. Moreover, it is osteoblasts-not bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-that secrete more RANKL. Blocking RANKL with denosumab resulted in increased CD107a expression, decreased KIR3DL1 expression, and increased release of perforin and granzyme B in NK cells. Additionally, apoptosis was significantly increased in MM cells. Bone marrow osteoblasts in patients with MM may inhibit NK cell function via RANK/RANKL. Furthermore, denosumab combined with lenalidomide or pomalidomide can improve bone marrow NK cell function in these patients.">

While neutralizing antibodies are effective at preventing viral entry, virus-specific CD8⁺ T cells play a vital role in eliminating infected cells and inducing an antiviral state, which curbs disease progression. Among these, CD8⁺ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells persist long term in the lungs, where they serve as first responders and rapidly expand upon secondary respiratory virus infection to provide local protection. The establishment and maintenance of lung CD8⁺ TRM cells require not only local cytokine signals but also antigen presentation. Specific subsets of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells also influence the quality and durability of CD8⁺ TRM cell responses. This review summarizes key findings on CD8⁺ T cell dynamics during respiratory viral infections, with a particular focus on CD8⁺ TRM cell formation and function. We also highlight the importance of local antigen presentation in driving TRM development and discuss how this knowledge can inform vaccine strategies aimed at eliciting robust, long-lasting mucosal immunity.">

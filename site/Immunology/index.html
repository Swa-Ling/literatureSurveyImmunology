        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The immune tumor microenvironment (TME) is increasingly recognized as a dynamic ecosystem where B cells play pivotal roles in modulating therapeutic responses, particularly in the context of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. While B cells have traditionally been viewed as bystanders in tumor immunity, recent evidence suggests they may actively influence anti-tumor immunity, albeit with conflicting reports regarding their pro-tumor or anti-tumor roles. This study explores the crucial roles played by B cells and their secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) in shaping melanoma responses to ICB therapy. We show a significant enrichment of B cells in ICB therapy responders compared to non-responders, pre-treatment, through retrospective analyses of melanoma patient tumors. Functional assays demonstrate that B cell depletion impairs T cell-mediated tumor cytotoxicity, underscoring the importance of B cells in anti-tumor responses. To investigate the clinical relevance, EVs were isolated from melanoma patient tumors, and fractioned into tumor and immune subpopulations. MiRNA profiling of CD19+ EVs identifies miR-99a-5p as a top candidate, among several others, upregulated in responders. Functional assays show that miR-99a-5p silencing in B cells diminishes T cell-mediated anti-tumor activity, suggesting its role in promoting B cell-mediated immune responses. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p influences B cell maturation within the TME by mediating class-switch recombination. Our findings highlight the important role of B cells and their derived EVs in shaping the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting B cell-related pathways.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 induce durable responses in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the therapeutic response after CAR-T cell treatment remains incompletely understood. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and spectral flow cytometry-based analyses of bone marrow-resident immune cells from B-ALL patients before and after CAR T-cell treatment. We observed profound changes in the microenvironment in response to CAR T cell-mediated inflammation, including an increase in myeloid cells. Significant induction of the IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling was associated with expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and endogenous exhausted CD8+ T cells. PD1 expression in endogenous T cells post-treatment was associated with a lack of durable response in the cohort of patients analyzed. Further, we revealed that HIF1α, VEGF, and TGFBR2 are key players in the intercellular communication between CAR T cells and the immune niche, driving widespread T-cell dysfunction. Infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells led to increased accumulation of human MDSCs, exacerbation of a hypoxic environment and T-cell exhaustion in HSPC-humanized mice bearing a human tumor. In conclusion, CAR T-cell-mediated myeloid activation is associated with pathways of immune dysregulation that may antagonize the effects of therapy. Key points The tumor immune context post-treatment affects CAR T-cell fate and endogenous immunity in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. IFN response, hypoxia, and TGF-β-signaling result in endogenous T-cell exhaustion and compromise CAR T-cell efficacy.">

        <tr id="Monocytes are essential for replenishing homeostatic macrophages in the intestine. However, they also accumulate in significant numbers when intestinal homeostasis is disrupted in diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The molecular pathways governing monocyte behaviour across these different contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we profile the monocyte / macrophage compartment in human IBD using single-cell RNA sequencing and identify a discrete population of monocytes that accumulate in IBD, which we term inflammation associated monocytes (IAMs). These can be identified by the expression of CD319, CD274 and CCRL2, and demonstrate increased expression of IBD susceptibility genes. By performing cross-species analysis, we show an analogous population of IAMs accumulate during chemically induced colitis in mice. Using transgenic fate mapping approaches, we show these cells likely derive from a discrete precursor in the bone marrow (BM) and are locally imprinted to produce heightened IL-1β and TNF in mouse and humans. Importantly, we show that co-incident with a hyper-inflammatory phenotype, these same cells uniquely and specifically express aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1) in response to local Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) receptor signalling, to limit unrestricted cytokine production. Thus, the intestinal environment after injury instructs both inflammation and recovery specifically within a transitioning population of monocytes that are absent in health.">

        <tr id="Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is characterized by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and severe immune cell infiltration. How tumor-derived EBV or viral products regulate macrophage polarization within NPC microenvironment remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the exosome-mediated intercellular communications between EBV+ NPC cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We demonstrate that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression correlates with poorer metastasis/recurrence-free survival in NPC patients. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that LIF is highly expressed by both tumor cells and macrophages. The uptake of NPC-derived exosomes by human monocyte-derived macrophages induced an immunosuppressive polarization and enhanced LIF expression, exhibiting a reduced cytotoxicity against primary cancer cells. Blocking LIF suppressed the pro-tumor functions mediated by tumor-derived exosomes, in both in vitro and in vitro zebrafish xenografts model. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic analysis (scRNA-seq) suggested that tumor- derived exosomes remodeled the NPC microenvironment by increasing the proportion of a pro-tumoral TAM subtype, CCL18-MΦ. Intercellular analysis revealed that exosome-treated macrophages could modulate T cell cytotoxicity and promoting Treg-mediated immunosuppression. Collectively, EBV shapes the tumor microenvironment by driving macrophage toward an immunosuppressive phenotype via exosome cargos, facilitating a pro-tumoral niche and contribute to NPC progression.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterised by an overwhelming immune response and high fatality. While most research has focused on its acute phase, many sepsis survivors remain immunologically weakened leaving them susceptible to serious complications from even mild infections. The mechanisms underlying this prolonged immune dysregulation remain unclear, limiting effective interventions. Here, we analysed whether sepsis induced long-term “training” in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), imprinting changes that persist in their myeloid progeny. Peripheral blood analysis of 8 sepsis survivors, 12 patients with septic shock, and 10 healthy donors revealed a significant expansion of CD38+ progenitors in survivors, with increases in megakaryocyte-erythroid and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and reduced mature neutrophil counts. This shift suggests impaired granulopoiesis, favouring immature, immunosuppressive granulocytes. Differentiated macrophages from survivors’ HSPCs exhibited impaired metabolic pathways after lipopolysaccharide stimulation, with downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis genes, indicating altered immune metabolism. Pathway analysis revealed enhanced type-I interferon (IFN) and JAK-STAT signalling in survivors’ macrophages, reflective of potentially tolerance-prone reprogramming. Finally, exposing healthy donor HSPCs to IFNβ during macrophage differentiation reduced HSPC proliferation, increased apoptosis, and induced a metabolic shift towards glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings suggest that sepsis induces lasting reprogramming in HSPCs leading to myeloid progeny with altered immune memory that might drive immune dysregulation in survivors. These data open avenues to explore potential targets to better manage long-term immune alterations in sepsis survivors. KEY POINTS Sepsis induces long-term alterations in HSPCs, leading to the expansion of immature progenitors and metabolic dysregulation of their progeny. Type-I IFN signalling reprograms macrophage differentiation, affecting their metabolic function and reducing cell proliferation.">

        <tr id="Crosstalk between autophagy, host cell death, and inflammatory host responses to bacterial pathogens enables effective innate immune responses that limit bacterial growth while minimizing coincidental host damage. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) thwarts innate immune defense mechanisms in alveolar macrophages (AMs) during the initial stages of infection and in recruited bone marrow-derived cells during later stages of infection. However, how protective inflammatory responses are achieved during Mtb infection and the variation of the response in different macrophage subtypes remain obscure. Here, we show that the autophagy receptor Tax1bp1 plays a critical role in enhancing inflammatory cytokine production and increasing the susceptibility of mice to Mtb infection. Surprisingly, although Tax1bp1 restricts Mtb growth during infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Budzik et al. 2020) and terminates cytokine production in response to cytokine stimulation or viral infection, Tax1bp1 instead promotes Mtb growth in AMs, neutrophils, and a subset of recruited monocyte-derived cells from the bone marrow. Tax1bp1 also leads to increases in bacterial growth and inflammatory responses during infection of mice with Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular pathogen that is not effectively targeted to canonical autophagy. In Mtb-infected AMs but not BMDMs, Tax1bp1 enhances necrotic-like cell death early after infection, reprogramming the mode of host cell death to favor Mtb replication in AMs. Tax1bp1’s impact on host cell death is a mechanism that explains Tax1bp1’s cell type-specific role in the control of Mtb growth. Similar to Tax1bp1-deficiency in AMs, the expression of phosphosite-deficient Tax1bp1 restricts Mtb growth. Together, these results show that Tax1bp1 plays a crucial role in linking the regulation of autophagy, cell death, and pro-inflammatory host responses and enhancing susceptibility to bacterial infection. Author Summary Although macrophages are the first innate immune cells to encounter Mycobacterium tuberculosis during infection, M. tuberculosis has evolved the ability to persist in them. Recent studies highlight that some types of macrophages are more permissive to M. tuberculosis replication and survival than others, but the mechanisms for cell type-specific differences in M. tuberculosis growth are only beginning to be understood. We found that the host factor, Tax1bp1 (Tax-1 binding protein 1), supports M. tuberculosis growth during animal infection and in specific subsets of innate immune cells, including alveolar macrophages while restricting M. tuberculosis in bone marrow-derived macrophages. We also found that Tax1bp1 has a similar phenotype in enhancing the pathogenesis of another intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes. Compared to bone marrow-derived macrophages, in alveolar macrophages, Tax1bp1 enhances the release of inflammatory mediators and leads to necrotic-like host cell death, which is known to enhance M. tuberculosis growth. Phosphorylation of Tax1bp1 in alveolar macrophages promotes M. tuberculosis growth. Our research highlights that Tax1bp1 is a host target for host-directed therapy against M. tuberculosis and controls host responses to M. tuberculosis in a cell type-specific manner.">

This highlights the needs to develop novel therapy for HIV-1 related diseases in PWH. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic effect of CD24-Fc, a fusion protein with anti-inflammatory properties that interacts with danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and siglec-10, in chronic HIV-1 infection model using humanized mice undergoing suppressive cART. Our findings show that CD24-Fc treatment significantly reduced inflammation and immune hyperactivation in vivo when combined with cART. CD24-Fc mediated resolution of inflammation was associated with improved recovery of CD4 T cells, reduced immune activation, restored central memory T cells and reversal of immune cell exhaustion phenotype. Notably, CD24-Fc treatment rescued CXCR5+ CD8 central memory T cell (TCM) which correlated with increased polyfunctionality in HIV-specific T cells in humanized mice and in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PWH. This restoration of CXCR5+ memory CD8 T cells was associated with HIV replication inhibition, delayed viral rebound and reduced HIV-1 pathogenesis upon cART cessation. This study suggests that CD24-Fc treatment could represent a promising new therapeutic strategy for managing chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH. Author summary Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) cannot block viral gene expression from activated HIV proviral DNA in reservoir cells, contributing to chronic immune activation and inflammation associated diseases in people with HIV (PWH). The therapeutic treatment of anti-inflammatory fusion protein CD24-Fc in humanized mice during suppressive cART (i) resolves inflammation and chronic HIV-1 immune pathogenesis during suppressive cART, (ii) rescues CXCR5-expressing CD8 memory T cells and enhances antiviral response in humanized mice and PWH PBMCs, (iii) delays virus rebound and reduces viral pathogenesis after cART cessation. Thus, CD24-Fc could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating chronic systemic inflammation and associated diseases in PWH.">

        <tr id="Chronic HIV infection drives B-cell dysfunction associated with the accumulation of tissue-like memory (TLMs) and activated memory B cells (MBCs) but decline in resting memory B cells. TLMs express multiple inhibitory receptors and lack response to soluble antigens. However, their origin and the mechanisms driving their expansion in HIV infection remain unclear. By using bulk BCR sequencing of memory B cell subsets from elite HIV controllers and an ART-controlled cohort, we revealed that TLMs (CD21- CD27- B cells) were significantly less mutated but also less diverse than other MBCs, suggesting an enrichment for innate-like B cells or that they belong to a less mature subset. Subsequent detailed multi-omics study of an immune response in an elite controller to a transient HIV viraemia demonstrated a functional increase in Env-reactive IgG and MBCs with non-TLM phenotype. Single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of PMBCs enriched for B cells revealed an orchestrated TNF-alpha response followed by interferon alpha and gamma response across all B cells subsets. We noted an emergence of innate-like extrafollicular PLD4+ plasmablasts and previously undepreciated heterogeneity of a stable TLM population. We identified two distinct TLM subsets: TLM1 (T-betlow) and TLM2 (T-bethi) that differed in their differentiation stage, isotype use and mutational burden. Surprisingly, both subsets (TLM1 more than TLM2) were enriched for IGHV4-34 segment use (associated with self-reactivity) and displayed a persistent activation and BCR signalling signature, indicating (with other BCR indices) a strong presence of innate-like B cells. However, pseudotime analyses revealed that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment. This study provides a new insight into multifaceted functional B-cell response to transient HIV viraemia as likely happens during the early phase of anti-retroviral therapy cessation, highlighting the TLM heterogeneity and the contribution of innate-like B cells which might have important clinical implications for anti-HIV vaccine and therapy design.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 antibodies (aPD1) can be effective in treating advanced cancers. However, many patients do not respond and the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. In this study, we profile a cohort of patients with locally-advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma undergoing aPD-1 therapy using single-cell RNA sequencing, high-definition spatial transcriptomics in tumors and draining lymph nodes, and spatial immunoreceptor profiling, with long-term clinical follow-up. We find that successful responses to PD-1 inhibition are characterized by an induction of B-cell receptor (BCR) clonal diversity after treatment initiation. These induced BCR clones spatially co-localize with T-cell clones, facilitate their activation, and traffic alongside them between tumor and draining lymph nodes to enhance tumor clearance. Furthermore, we validated aPD1-induced BCR diversity as a predictor of clinical response in a larger cohort of glioblastoma, melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, suggesting that this is a generalizable predictor of treatment response across many types of cancers. We discover that pre-treatment tumors harbor a characteristic gene expression signature that portends a higher probability of inducing BCR clonal diversity after aPD-1 therapy, and we develop a machine learning model that predicts PD-1-induced BCR clonal diversity from baseline tumor RNA sequencing. These findings underscore a dynamic role of B cell diversity during immunotherapy, highlighting its importance as a prognostic marker and a potential target for intervention in non-responders.">

        <tr id="Patients with cancer often receive chemotherapy to control tumor progression and reduce disease symptoms. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents not only kill rapidly growing cancer cells but also reduce normal cells including myeloid cells, the main innate immune population involved in fighting infections and repairing tissue damages. Rapid loss of myeloid cells caused by chemotherapy triggers myelopoiesis, a process in which the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow regenerate myeloid cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages, to reconstitute the myeloid cell compartment. We previously reported that chemotherapy with an alkylating agent cyclophosphamide (CTX) in mice leads to repopulation of myeloid cells that acquire immunosuppressive activities within the monocyte subset. However, detailed information on the cellular composition and molecular identity of these chemotherapy- induced immunosuppressive monocytes is lacking. Here, we investigated how the various myeloid cell subsets in the bone marrow of mice respond to CTX chemotherapy through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis (scRNAseq). We found that myeloid progenitor cells and monocytes were reduced 2 days after chemotherapy but rebounded and surpassed their pretreatment levels by day 7. Further scRNAseq analysis of pre-enriched monocytes revealed that the monocyte population was heterogenous, and that chemotherapy tilted myelopoiesis towards the production of neutrophil-like monocytes (NeuMo). We identified Cxcr4 and Cx3cr1 as suitable markers for isolation of chemotherapy-induced NeuMo and demonstrated that these cells were suppressive to T cells. Together with the evidence that CTX-induced monocytes can promote breast cancer metastasis in mice, our data reveal the heterogeneity of the monocytes reemerging after chemotherapy and identify the NeuMo subset as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer.">

        <tr id="Mucosal melanoma (MucM) is a rare cancer with a poor prognosis and low response rate to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) compared with cutaneous melanoma (CM). To explore the immune microenvironment and potential drivers of MucM’s relative resistance to ICI drugs, we characterized 101 MucM tumors (43 head and neck [H&N], 31 female urogenital, 13 male urogenital, 11 anorectal, and 3 other gastrointestinal) using bulk RNA-Seq and immunofluorescence. RNA-Seq data show that MucM has a significantly lower IFN-γ signature levels than CM. MucM tumors of the H&N region show a significantly greater abundance of CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic cells, and higher IFN-γ signature levels than MucM from lower body sites. In the subcohort of 35 patients with MucM treated with ICI, hierarchical clustering reveals clusters with a high and low degree of immune infiltration, with a differential ICI response rate. Immune-associated gene sets were enriched in responders. Signatures associated with cancer-associated fibroblasts, macrophages, and TGF-β signaling may be higher in immune-infiltrated, but ICI-unresponsive tumors, suggesting a role for these resistance mechanisms in MucM. Our data show organ region–specific differences in immune infiltration and IFN-γ signature levels in MucM, with H&N MucM displaying the most favorable immune profile. Our study might offer a starting point for developing more personalized treatment strategies for this disease.">

        <tr id="Integrated approaches that help understand how tumors, as immune-surveilled ecosystems, respond to chemotherapy are crucial for developing effective antitumor treatments. We previously showed, in immunodeficient context, that antimitotic chemotherapy induced cGAS/STING pathway amplifying antitumor response through a paracrine IFN-1 secretome. We herein studied tumor progression and response to treatment using an immunocompetent murine model. scRNAseq analysis revealed that paclitaxel treatment altered tumor cell phenotypes, favoring tumor cells with a gene expression signature indicative of active NF-κB pathway with secretory phenotype. Treatment coincidently reduced IFN-I signature cells during tumor progression. The resulting secretory shift correlated with neutrophil recruitment to the tumor, particularly CXCR2+ neutrophils, thereby contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 receptor by navarixin reactivated antitumor immunity, enhancing NK cell infiltration and tumor cytotoxicity. Navarixin combination with paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor volume and metastasis. Targeting the NF-κB-driven secretory phenotype, in particular through neutrophil modulation, holds promise for improving TNBC treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immune cells determine the role of the tumor microenvironment during tumor progression, either suppressing tumor formation or promoting tumorigenesis. We analyzed the profile of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of control mouse skins and skin tumors at the single-cell level. We identified 15 CD45+ immune cell clusters, which broadly represent the most functionally characterized immune cell types including macrophages, Langerhans cells (LC), conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), conventional type 2 dendritic cells (cDC2), migratory/mature dendritic cells (mDC), dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC), dermal γδ T cells (γδT), T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural killer cells (NK), type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), neutrophils (Neu), mast cells (Mast), and two proliferating populations (Prolif.1 and Prolif.2). Skin tumor progression reprogramed immune cells and led to a marked increase in the relative percentages of macrophages, cDC2, mDC, Tregs, and Neu. Macrophages, the largest cell cluster of immune cells in skin tumors. In addition, macrophages emerged as the predominant communication ‘hub’ in skin tumors, highlighting the importance of macrophages during skin tumor progression. In contrast, other immune cell clusters decreased during skin tumor progression, including DETC, γδT, ILC2, and LC. In addition, skin tumor progression dramatically upregulated Jak2/Stat3 expression and the interferon response across various immune cell clusters. Further, skin tumor progression activated T cells and NK cells indicated by elevated expression of IFN-γ and Granzyme B in skin tumors. Meanwhile, a pronounced infiltration of M2-macrophages and Tregs in skin tumors created an immunosuppressive microenvironment, consistent with the elevated expression of the Stat3 pathway in skin tumors. In summary, our study elucidates the immune cell landscape of epidermal neoplasms, offering a comprehensive understanding of the immune response during skin tumor progression and providing new insights into cancer immune evasion mechanisms.">

While the immune system is known to help regulate tissue damage, immune mechanisms involved in RT-induced intestinal toxicity are not fully understood. Following CT-guided localised intestinal irradiation, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry revealed RT-induced chemokine-dependent recruitment of innate immune cells. Deletion of C-C chemokine receptor (Ccr)1, Ccr2, Ccr3 and Ccr5, blocked recruitment and worsened radiation induced toxicities, suggesting an important role for an innate immune cell population in limiting RT-mediated bowel damage. Furthermore, CCR2-deficient mice showed exacerbated weight loss and intestinal permeability, while the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes alleviated symptoms. Mechanistically, IL-17 cytokine production by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), a critical factor in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, was found to be reduced in irradiated CCR2−/−, however the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes resulted in increased IL-17 levels.

        <tr id="Background Hepatocellular carcinoma represents a significant global health challenge, affecting over a million patients annually, arising mainly from chronic liver diseases, with a majority being related to viral infections. However, despite the groundbreaking clinical results of immune checkpoint blockades and adoptive cell therapies, we still face non-responders accompanied by high rebound rates after resection. Considering that the main concern is to overcome a highly specialized immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of the individual patient, the characterization of the particular tumor microenvironment and the source of the immune cells used in ACT is of immense importance. Approved ACT therapies mainly use modified peripheral blood cells from individuals. At the same time, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are underrepresented even if they have garnered interest due to their potential to target tumor-specific antigens more effectively. Methods In this study, we employed allogenic and autologous immune cell sources for expansion and stimulation, resulting in adoptive T-cell transfer experiments determining the effector cell differentiation and the related anti-tumor effects by the possible implementation of re-stimulation. Results We determined a high success rate in expanding and stimulating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with consistent CD8 T-cell fractions from HCC patients. To showcase the effectiveness of stimulated T-cells from different sources, we generated cell lines derived from the margin and center of an HBV-induced HCC with a highly immune-suppressive TME. We found effective immune responses supported by cell death induction, ferroptosis, proptosis and apoptosis triggered by all sources of T-cells depending on the area of derived tumor cells. Conclusion Effector T-cell fractions derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes present a viable source for cell-based immune therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in HCC patients, especially after resection, to suppress rebound strategies of the parental tumor on an individual level.">

        <tr id="Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) promotes prostate cancer (PCa) development and lethality, with immunosuppressive properties in other disease models. These studies investigated the tumor-intrinsic immune effects of IGF-1 in PCa to understand mechanisms underlying its poor immunotherapy response. Transcriptional profiling of human (DU145, 22Rv1) and murine (Myc-CaP) PCa cells revealed, through pathway enrichment, that cytokine signalling, antigen processing and presentation, and other immune regulatory pathways, were most suppressed by IGF-1. We went on to investigate changes in the expression of components of two key pathways responsible for cancer cell recognition by immune cells and immune evasion: antigen processing and presentation, and PD-L1 checkpoint expression. These pathways are crucial for determining immunotherapy response. IGF-1 downregulated transporters associated with antigen processing (TAPs), endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 (ERAP-1), and Class I component β2-microglobulin, without major changes in Class I allele expression. These effects were associated with reduced presentation of Class I complexes on the Myc-CaP cell surface suggesting altered peptide transport, processing, and/or presentation. In contrast, IGF-1 upregulated immune checkpoint CD274 (PD-L1) via IGF receptor/AKT/ERK-dependent signaling. Analysis of public data (TCGA Firehose Legacy PCa) revealed increased CD274 expression in PCa with high endogenous IGF1 and IGFBP5, markers of high IGF axis activity. Additionally, in primary PCa (n=32), multiplex immunofluorescence revealed higher PD-L1 expression in the central tumor of men with high serum IGF-1 promoting cancer cell immune evasion in PCa. These findings indicate a novel mechanism by which IGF-1 mediates immunosuppressive effects in malignant prostate epithelium, potentially explaining the poor responsiveness of PCa to immunotherapy and highlighting the complex interplay between IGF signaling and immune evasion.">

        <tr id="Macrophages hold tremendous promise as effectors of cancer immunotherapy, but the best strategies to provoke these cells to attack tumors remain unknown. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting two distinct macrophage immune checkpoints: CD47 and CD24. We found that antibodies targeting these antigens could elicit maximal levels of phagocytosis when combined together in vitro. However, to our surprise, via unbiased genome-wide CRISPR screens, we found that CD24 primarily acts as a target of opsonization rather than an immune checkpoint. In a series of in vitro and in vivo genetic validation studies, we found that CD24 was neither necessary nor sufficient to protect cancer cells from macrophage phagocytosis in most mouse and human tumor models. Instead, anti-CD24 antibodies exhibit robust Fc-dependent activity, and as a consequence, they cause significant on-target hematologic toxicity in mice. To overcome these challenges and leverage our findings for therapeutic purposes, we engineered a collection of 77 novel bispecific antibodies that bind to a tumor antigen with one arm and engage macrophages with the second arm. We discovered multiple novel bispecifics that maximally activate macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity and reduce binding to healthy blood cells, including bispecifics targeting macrophage immune checkpoint molecules in combination with EGFR, TROP2, and CD71. Overall, our findings indicate that CD47 predominates over CD24 as a macrophage immune checkpoint in cancer, and that the novel bispecifics we created may be optimal immunotherapies to direct myeloid cells to eradicate solid tumors.">

Patients with IBD receive therapy to correct these imbalances and achieve remission. However, most patients relapse, suggesting that pathological mechanisms persist during remission. Here, we show that excess epithelial cell death is an underlying feature of IBD that arises in patients in remission and on advanced therapy. Mechanistically, nascent inflammation reprograms epithelial cells into a macrophage-like state that promotes RIPK1-independent necroptotic signaling, then triggers iNOS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis of absorptive epithelial cells and PUMA-mediated intestinal stem cell death.

        <tr id="Immune exclusion inhibits anti-tumor immunity and response to immunotherapy, but its mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that Trophoblast Cell-Surface Antigen 2 (TROP2), a key target of emerging anti-cancer Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), controls barrier-mediated immune exclusion in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) through Claudin 7 association and tight junction regulation. TROP2 expression is inversely correlated with T cell infiltration and strongly associated with outcomes in TNBC. Loss-of-function and reconstitution experiments demonstrate TROP2 is sufficient to drive tumor progression in vivo in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner, while its loss deregulates expression and localization of multiple tight junction proteins, enabling T cell infiltration. Employing a humanized TROP2 syngeneic TNBC model, we show that TROP2 targeting via hRS7, the antibody component of Sacituzumab govitecan (SG), enhances the anti-PD1 response associated with improved T cell accessibility and effector function. Correspondingly, TROP2 expression is highly associated with lack of response to anti-PD1 therapy in human breast cancer. Thus, TROP2 controls an immune exclusion program that can be targeted to enhance immunotherapy response. Synopsis This study defines a new mechanism of barrier-mediated immune exclusion in cancer controlled by TROP2-dependent tight junctions. This mechanism drives tumor progression but can be targeted via TROP2-directed antibody drug conjugates to activate anti-tumor immunity and enhance immunotherapy response.">

In Crohn’s disease (CD) patients, the intestinal mucosa is inflamed, epithelium permeability is increased, and IECs present compositional and functional defects. The role of T lymphocytes interactions with IECs in the physiopathology of CD remains in question. Here, we use a three-dimensional human autologous coculture model between purified intestinal organoids derived from primary tissues of CD and non-inflammatory control patients, and mucosal T lymphocytes extracted from the same location. We show that while in homeostatic context T cells support the proliferation and differentiation balance of organoids, mucosal T lymphocytes from CD patients present a high cytotoxicity against IECs. Importantly, this cytotoxicity is a persistent defect overtime in culture. Organoids also show defective intestinal stem cells (ISCs) proliferation and morphological changes. Single cell RNA sequencing after coculture highlights a general response of T cells to the epithelial microenvironment, and more particularly, an increase activation of a pro-inflammatory CD8+ T cells effector population in CD patients compared to controls.

        <tr id="Age is a critical factor influencing the host immune response to infection and disease pathogenesis. In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2+ γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.">

        <tr id="The persistence of adoptively transferred T cells is vital for anti-tumor efficacy. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can persist indefinitely when delivered to patients with B cell cancers and can confer long-term remission. For patients with solid tumors, however, sustaining CAR T cell activity remains a major challenge. This has been attributed in part to the immune microenvironment within solid tumors, though the contribution of specific immune subsets to resistance to CAR T cells is not clear. Here we resolve how the immunology of irradiated tumors dramatically enhances persistence and efficacy of CAR T cells targeted to advanced lung metastases in a syngeneic mouse model. Remarkably, CAR T cell persistence depended critically on dendritic cells (DC) that underwent trogocytic “antigen-dressing” of tumor target antigens and stimulated CAR T cells through the chimeric receptor. Furthermore, tumor irradiation increased antigen-dressing onto DCs. In the absence of functional DCs, CAR T cell activity in irradiated tumor was short-lived and tumors relapsed.

        <tr id="Reducing calorie intake without malnutrition limits tumor progression but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that dietary restriction (DR) suppresses tumor growth by enhancing CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. DR reshapes CD8+ T cell differentiation within the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting the development of effector T cell subsets while limiting the accumulation of exhausted T (Tex) cells, and synergizes with anti-PD1 immunotherapy to restrict tumor growth. Mechanistically, DR enhances CD8+ T cell metabolic fitness through increased ketone body oxidation (ketolysis), which boosts mitochondrial membrane potential and fuels tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-dependent pathways essential for T cell function. T cells deficient for ketolysis exhibit reduced mitochondrial function, increased exhaustion, and fail to control tumor growth under DR conditions. Our findings reveal a critical role for the immune system in mediating the anti-tumor effects of DR, highlighting nutritional modulation of CD8+ T cell fate in the TME as a critical determinant of anti-tumor immunity.">

How cells are assembled at PVNs and the activation signals imparted within remain unclear. Here, we integrate dynamic time-resolved in vivo imaging with a novel spatially-resolved platform for microanatomical interrogation of transcriptome, immune phenotype and inflammatory mediators in skin PVNs. We uncover a complex positive-feedback loop within CXCL10+ PVNs that regulates myeloid and Th1 cell positioning for exchange of critical signals for Th1 activation. Th1 cells spend ∼24h in the PVN, receiving initial peripheral activation signals, before redeploying to the inflamed dermal parenchyma. Niche-enriched, CCR2-dependent myeloid cells were critical for Th1 IFNγ-production. In turn, PVN instructional signals enabled Th1s to orchestrate PVN assembly by CXCR2-dependent intra-tissue myeloid cell aggregation. The results reveal a critical tissue organizing role for Th1s, gained rapidly on tissue entry, that could be exploited to boost regional immunity.

        <tr id="Keloids, characterized by excessive scar tissue resulting from abnormal wound healing, are primarily driven by hyperproliferative fibroblasts and overproduction of extracellular matrix. Although human natural killer (NK) cells are known for their role in inhibiting uncontrolled cell growth through cytokines like IFN-γ and TNF-α, they also produce amphiregulin (AREG), which paradoxically promotes cell proliferation and survival. The involvement of NK cells in keloid pathogenesis, however, remains largely unexplored. This study uncovers remarkable functional changes in NK cells within both lesional skin and the blood of keloid patients. In the skin, NK cell-produced IFN-γ plays a pivotal role in limiting keloid progression by inducing fibroblast apoptosis and curbing excessive extracellular matrix production, while NK cell-derived AREG actively opposes these protective effects. Notably, TGF-β-driven fibroblasts in keloid lesions further dampen NK cell IFN-γ production, revealing a complex and dynamic cellular interplay. In the bloodstream of keloid patients, a distinct NK cell subset emerges, marked by elevated interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and diminished IFN-γ production, which correlates with increased plasma IFN-β levels. This elevated IFN-β serves as a key initiating factor, driving NK cell exhaustion through impaired mitochondrial function and metabolic disruption. These findings highlight a critical mechanism underlying the functional abnormalities of keloid-associated NK cells and emphasize the influence of both local and systemic factors in shaping NK cell responses in keloid pathogenesis. Graphical abstract Highlights In the skin, NK cell-derived IFN-γ is crucial for suppressing keloid fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix production. AREG from NK cells counteracts the inhibitory effects of IFN-γ on keloid progression. In the blood, elevated IFN-β in keloid patients drives the emergence of ISG+NK cells with reduced IFN-γ production. IFN-β induces mitochondrial dysfunction and functional exhaustion in NK cells.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains profoundly resistant to conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapeutic interventions. Innovative therapeutic modalities, particularly microbe-derived immunotherapies, have demonstrated durable anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical PDAC models. This study elucidates that administration of the FDA-approved Haemophilus influenzae type b (H Flu - Hiberix) vaccine attenuates tumor progression and enhances survival outcomes in murine PDAC. H Flu treatment significantly augmented CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, concurrently inducing a cytotoxic T cell phenotype, evidenced by upregulation of CD69, granzyme B, and perforin. Additionally, H Flu therapy promoted the accumulation of CD44+ CD62L-memory T cells within tumors of pre-immunized mice. Mechanistic investigations revealed that depletion of CD4+ T cells or NK cells, but not CD8+ T cells, negated the anti-tumor efficacy of H Flu, suggesting that CD4+ T cells and NK cells are critical mediators of H Flu-induced anti-tumor immunity. To further elucidate the mechanistic basis of H Flu’s anti-tumor activity, we assessed the individual constituents of the H Flu vaccine: tetanus toxoid (TT) and polyrobosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP). Notably, TT administration achieved superior tumor growth suppression, characterized by enhanced CD4+ T cell cytotoxicity and increased NK cell infiltration, relative to PRP or PBS-treated controls. Furthermore, TT induced apoptosis in PDAC cells and reduced their proliferation, potentially by targeting tumor-associated sialic acids. This disruption might interfere with the interaction between sialic acids and siglec receptors, thereby impairing mechanisms of immune evasion.TT-mediated modulation of sialic acid expression in cancer cells underscores its potential to augment immunotherapeutic efficacy in PDAC. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel anti-cancer mechanism for TT, leveraging both immunostimulatory and sialic acid-targeting pathways to suppress PDAC progression. Graphical Abstract">

Methods PBMC derived from 10 HCC patients and two healthy donors were used for expansion in small bioreactors equipped with a permeable membrane for 2 weeks. During expansion, surface marker composition, cytokine and chemokine production were observed. Enriched T-cell subsets from three patients with chronic HBV infection were analysed in detail. We extracted the enriched complement of one chronically infected patient to elucidate the therapeutic potential. Results We successfully expanded the effector T-cell subsets for all investigated samples and consistently enriched the cell amount over time. Subsequently, we showed that the expanded patient-derived T-cells showed functionality against autologous liver cancer-derived cells by inducing receptor and protein-mediated cell death. Conclusion We showed the consistent ex-vivo expansion of T-cell subsets of initial patient-derived PBMCs.

        <tr id="To initiate T cell-mediated immunity, dendritic cells (DCs) present antigens to specific T cells through the establishment of an immune synapse (IS). While the molecular mechanisms behind the formation of the IS on the T cell side are well understood, how IS components are organized at the DC membrane remain ill-defined. Galectins, a family of β-galactoside binding proteins, modulate immune cell function via the establishment of specific glycan-dependent or independent interactions. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms that underlie galectin function are poorly described and very little is known regarding their contribution to DC-mediated T cell activation. Here, we demonstrate that intracellular galectin-9 (gal9) in DCs is required for T cell activation. Murine and human DCs lacking gal9 showed impaired induction of CD4+, but not CD8+, T cell proliferation, suggesting a conserved function for gal9 in modulating DC–T cell interactions. Live-cell imaging revealed that galectin-9-depleted DCs fail to establish stable ISs with T cells, resulting in reduced T cell activation and proliferation. Unbiased co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified HLA-II as a gal9 binding partner in DCs, and we observed a marked reduction of HLA-II recruitment to the immune synapse in DCs lacking gal9. Conditional gal9 knockout in DCs led to enhanced tumor growth in vivo, compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts, underscoring a role for gal9 in T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, this study provides the first detailed account of gal9-mediated HLA-II organization at the synaptic site of DCs, revealing a novel mechanism by which galectins orchestrate immune receptor positioning from within the cytoplasm to enhance CD4+ T cell activation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) are a promising new class of therapeutics for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. A frequently observed, yet incompletely understood effect of this treatment is the transient reduction of circulating T cell counts, also known as T cell margination (TCM). After administration of the GPRC5D-targeting TCB forimtamig (RG6234), TCM occurred in patients and correlated with cytokine release and soluble B cell maturation antigen decrease. We demonstrate that TCM is accurately represented in the humanized NSG mouse model and occurs at a lower threshold of target expression than systemic cytokine release. Application of whole-mouse tissue clearing and 3D imaging revealed that T cells accumulate in the bone marrow after treatment. We hypothesize that low amounts of targets are sufficient to rapidly redirect T cells upon TCB engagement. Therefore, we propose TCM as a beneficial, highly sensitive and early effect of forimtamig that leads T cells to likely sites of bone marrow tumor lesions.">

        <tr id="Thrombin promotes the proliferation and function of CD8+ T cells. To test if thrombin prevents exhaustion and sustains antiviral T cell activity during chronic viral infection, we depleted the thrombin-precursor prothrombin to 10% of normal levels in mice prior to infection with the clone 13 strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Unexpectedly, prothrombin insufficiency resulted in 100% mortality after infection that was prevented by depletion of CD8+ T cells, suggesting that reduced availability of prothrombin enhances virus-induced immunopathology. Yet, the number, function, and apparent exhaustion of virus-specific T cells were measurably unaffected by prothrombin depletion. Histological analysis of the lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, and brain did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or increased tissue damage in low prothrombin mice that could explain mortality. Viral loads were also similar in infected mice regardless of prothrombin levels. Instead, infection of prothrombin-depleted mice resulted in a severe, T cell-dependent anemia associated with increased hemolysis. Thus, thrombin plays an unexpected protective role in preventing hemolytic anemia during virus infection, with potential implications for patients who are using direct thrombin inhibitors as an anticoagulant therapy.">

        <tr id="The incomplete understanding of epididymal mucosal immunity is a significant contributing factor to the classification of many male infertility cases as idiopathic. Conditions that disrupt the immune balance in the male reproductive tract, such as vasectomy and infections, can expose sperm to the immune system, leading to increased production of anti-sperm antibodies (ASAs) and subsequent reproductive challenges. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) regulate inflammation and maintain sperm tolerance. In a murine model, we demonstrated that disrupting sperm immunotolerance induces chronic autoimmune responses characterized by antibody production targeting sperm and reproductive tissue autoantigens and unique tissue-specific immune cell signatures in the epididymis and testis. Such inflammatory features impair sperm function, contribute to epididymal damage, and drive sustained male subfertility. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were formed within the epididymis after Treg depletion, defined by clusters of heterogenous B and T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. These ectopic structures perpetuate inflammation and lower the activation threshold for future immune threats. Similar isotypes of autoantibodies were detected in the seminal plasma of infertile patients, suggesting shared mechanistic pathways between mice and humans. Overall, we provide an in-depth understanding of the diverse B- and T-cell dynamics and TLS formation during epididymitis to develop precision-targeted therapies for infertility and chronic inflammation. Additionally, this immunological characterization of the epididymal microenvironment has the potential to identify novel targets for the development of male contraceptives.

        <tr id="Lymph nodes (LNs) are secondary lymphoid organs where lymphocytes interact with antigen presenting cells to initiate adaptive immune responses within microenvironments established by resident stromal cells. LNs are also the major site of growth of follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), B cell neoplasms that alter the stromal architecture of LNs in highly stereotypic ways. To characterize FL and CLL cells within the LN microenvironment, we developed a pipeline for single-cell RNA sequencing of all resident LN cells. We observed that proliferation of FL and CLL cells within specialized niches commences with transient upregulation of MYC, subsequent downregulation of which may act to limit the growth potential of these indolent neoplasms. Proliferating FL cells within neoplastic follicles co-localized with follicular dendritic cells, whereas proliferating CLL cells were spatially associated with a distinct set of fibroblasts expressing CCL19 that localized to proliferation centers. We used informatic analyses and microscopy to identify and validate interacting sets of ligand-receptor pairs between proliferating neoplastic B cells, immune cells and stromal fibroblasts, including interactions involving CD74-MIF, TNFRSF13C (BAFF receptor), immunomodulatory factors such as CD55 and Galectin-9 (Gal9), and adhesion molecules. Our analyses highlight common features of these two microenvironment-dependent neoplasms and provide a roadmap for identifying vulnerabilities and new therapeutic strategies. Key points Nodal FL and CLL cells have similar proliferative programs and predicted ligand-receptor interactions with immune and stromal cells. Proliferation of FL and CLL cells occurs in distinct lymph node niches defined by different types of fibroblasts.">

 Type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are critical for initiating and sustaining tumor-reactive CD8 T cells; lack of functional cDC1s is a key driver for failed tumor immunosurveillance and immunotherapy. However, what factors cause the cDC1 insufficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain poorly understood. Commensal microbiota has emerged as a key regulator of TME and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. Nonetheless, most studies have focused on the intestinal microbiome; it remains underexplored whether and how the local microbiota within tumors influences the anti-cancer immunity. Using the autochthonous Kras LSL-G12D/+ ; p53 flox/flox (KP) mouse model of lung cancer, we found an increased local bacterial burden and altered bacterial composition associated with lung tumors. Importantly, this local microbiota suppresses the anti-tumor CD8 T cell response both at baseline and in response to ICB therapies. Specifically, single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed that the microbiota shapes the functional subsets of tumor-reactive CD8 T cells. Bacterial depletion promotes the accumulation of stem-like Tpex cells (precursor of exhausted T cells) in the TME, which serve as a reservoir of effector CD8 T cells and mediate an effective response upon ICB treatment. To distinguish the function of the local microbiota within TME from the distal gut microbiota, we developed a new method of aerosolized antibiotic treatment, which selectively ablates the intra-tumoral lung microbiota while preserving the intact gut microbiota. Using this approach, we demonstrated that removal of the intra-tumoral lung microbiota markedly improves the tumor-reactive T cell response and sensitizing “cold” lung tumors to ICB therapies. Mechanistically, we identified cDC1s as a central player in microbiota-mediated suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Local microbiota diminishes cDC1 quality and quantity in the lung TME, resulting in impaired T cell priming and Tpex maintenance. At the molecular level, our data revealed that bacterial products derived from the local microbiota induce type I interferon expression in tumor-associated myeloid cells and enhance GM-CSF production from cancer cells: chronic type I interferon and GM-CSF signaling acts cooperatively to reduce the functional cDC1 population. Combining in vitro cDC1 assays, competitive bone marrow chimera experiments and cDC1-specific knockout models, we establish the causal relationships between the local microbiota, IFN-I and GM-CSF signaling in cDC1s, and the tumor response to ICB. Altogether, our study uncovered a dominant role of tumor-associated microbiota in inhibiting cDC1s and suppressing anti-tumor immunity through type I IFN and GM-CSF dependent pathways in lung cancer. Our findings not only identify the intra-tumoral microbiota as a critical therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment, but also provide new insights into the tissue-specific, context-dependent regulatory mechanisms of cDC1s in the TME.

        <tr id="Due to the vital importance of the lungs, lung-related diseases and their control are very important. Severe inflammatory responses mediated by immune cells were among the leading causes of lung tissue pathology and damage during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, uncontrolled immune cell responses can lead to lung tissue damage in other infectious and non-infectious diseases. It is essential to control immune responses in a way that leads to homeostasis. Immunosuppressive drugs only suppress inflammatory responses and do not affect the homeostasis of reactions. The therapeutic application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in addition to restoring immune homeostasis, can promote the regeneration of lung tissue through the production of growth factors and differentiation into lung-related cells. However, the communication between MSCs and immune cells after treatment of pulmonary diseases is essential, and investigating this can help develop a clinical perspective. Different studies in the clinical phase showed that MSCs can reverse fibrosis, increase regeneration, promote airway remodeling, and reduce damage to lung tissue. The proliferation and differentiation potential of MSCs is one of the mechanisms of their therapeutic effects. Furthermore, they can secrete exosomes that affect the function of lung cells and immune cells and change their function. Another important mechanism is that MSCs reduce harmful inflammatory responses through communication with innate and adaptive immune cells, which leads to a shift of the immune system toward regulatory and hemostatic responses.">

Pharmacologic reprogramming with the SMAC mimetic LCL161 in combination with T cell-derived cytokines can induce macrophages to phagocytose live cancer cells in mouse models. Here we extend these findings to encompass a wide range of monovalent and bivalent SMAC mimetic compounds, demonstrating that live cell phagocytosis is a class effect of these agents. We demonstrate robust phagocytosis of live pancreatic and breast cancer cells by primary human macrophages across a range of healthy donors. Unlike mouse macrophages where combination of SMAC mimetics with lymphotoxin enhanced phagocytosis, human macrophages were more efficiently polarized to phagocytose live cells by the combination of SMAC mimetics and IFNψ. We profiled phagocytic macrophages by transcriptional and proteomic methodologies, uncovering a positive feedback loop of autocrine TNFα production.">

        <tr id="Pathogens have developed multiple strategies to modulate host immune defense mechanisms. Understanding how this is achieved has potential to inform novel therapeutics for diseases caused by immune dysfunction. Parasitic helminths are masters of immune evasion, via release of secreted products, resulting in chronic infection. Helminths secrete small regulatory microRNA (miRNAs), which can interact with host cells. Here we show that a single parasite miRNA (miR-5352), conserved across gastrointestinal (GI) nematodes, suppresses IL-13-induced GI epithelial cell differentiation and cytokine responses, and promotes stem cell maintenance. Mechanistically, this is achieved through targeted repression of critical host factors, including Klf-4 and the IL-22 receptor, together with modulation of Wnt and Notch signalling pathways. Nematode miR-5352 shows seed sequence conservation with mammalian miR-92a family members, indicating that through convergent evolution, GI nematodes exploit a host miRNA regulatory network to suppress host innate responses, promote tissue regeneration and establish a favourable environment for chronic infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have significantly revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. However, the persistent challenge of low patient response rates necessitates novel approaches to overcome immune tolerance. Targeting immunostimulatory signaling may have a better chance of success for its ability to enhance effector T cell (Teff) function and expansion for antitumor immunity. Among various immunostimulatory pathways, the evidence underscores the potential of activating OX40-OX40L signaling to enhance CD8+ T cell generation and maintenance while suppressing regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we introduce a potent agonistic anti-OX40 antibody, SHR-1806, designed to target OX40 receptors on activated T cells and amplify antitumor immune responses. SHR-1806 demonstrates a high affinity and specificity for human OX40 protein, eliciting FcγR-mediated agonistic effects, T cell activation, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activities in vitro. In human OX40 knock-in mice bearing MC38 tumor, SHR-1806 shows a trend toward a higher potency than the reference anti-OX40 antibody produced in-house, GPX4, an analog of pogalizumab, the most advanced drug candidate developed by Roche. Furthermore, SHR-1806 displays promising anti-tumor activity alone or in combination with toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist or PD-L1 inhibitor in mouse models. Evaluation of SHR-1806 in rhesus monkeys indicates a favorable safety profile and typical pharmacokinetic characteristics. Thus, SHR-1806 emerges as a robust OX40 agonist with promising therapeutic potential.">

        <tr id="The intricate immunological functions of human skin involve the interplay between multiple different cell types as well as dynamic trafficking of leukocytes in and out the tissue, both of which are extremely challenging to replicate in vitro. To enable in vitro investigation of human skin immunology, we developed a microfluidic human skin equivalent (HSE) that supports the delivery of circulating immune cells via a vascular microchannel embedded within the dermis of a full-thickness construct. We demonstrated that stimulation of keratinocyte inflammation with lipopolysaccharide and nigericin promoted rapid monocyte recruitment out of the vascular channel and into the epidermal layer within 24 hours, followed by a second wave of monocyte migration into the dermis over a period of six days. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the tissue-resident and recruited cell populations revealed dynamic and cell-specific patterns of gene expression that were characteristic of acute activation and resolution of an inflammatory immune response. Moreover, comparison of the gene signatures of the monocyte-derived cells to in vivo populations provided molecular level validation of the model and indicated a differentiation trajectory of the monocytes through to mature dermal macrophages. To extend the microfluidic platform to additional applications, we also modelled age-associated immune dysfunction by the inclusion of senescent fibroblasts, which promoted increased monocyte recruitment into the HSE, replicating previous in vivo human studies. Thus, the microfluidic HSE presented here replicates key aspects of dynamic inflammatory immune responses within the skin and represents a tractable experimental tool for interrogating mechanisms of human skin immunology.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells, referred to as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, particularly in combating viral infections and malignancies. CD8 T cells, derived from bone marrow progenitors and matured in the thymus, play an essential role in immune defense through their cytotoxic activity. These cells are distinguished by their ability to recognize and eliminate cells that present specific antigens via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Upon activation by antigen recognition, they proliferate and differentiate into effector cells capable of eliminating infected or abnormal cells.CD8+ T cells develop in the thymus and express the CD8 co-receptor, which interacts specifically with MHC class I molecules. When a naïve CD8+ T cell encounters an antigen-presenting cell (APC) displaying an antigen bound to MHC class I, it undergoes activation, clonal expansion, and differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells. The primary function of these cells is to eliminate infected or malignant cells by inducing apoptosis through the release of cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes or by engaging death receptors on target cells. Over the past few decades, CD8+ T cells have garnered significant attention for their potential in immunotherapy, particularly in cancer treatment. This review highlights the multifaceted roles of CD8+ T cells in immunotherapy, their mechanisms of action, and the challenges associated with harnessing their full potential.

        <tr id="Background: Solid tumors vary by the immunogenic potential of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the likelihood of response to immunotherapy. The emerging literature has identified key immune cell populations that significantly impact immune activation or suppression within the TME. This study investigated candidate T-cell populations and their differential infiltration within different tumor types as estimated from mRNA co-expression levels of the corresponding cellular markers. Methods: We analyzed the mRNA co-expression levels of cellular biomarkers that define stem-like tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), tissue-resident memory T-cells (TRM), early dysfunctional T-cells, late dysfunctional T-cells, activated-potentially anti-tumor (APA) T-cells and Butyrophilin 3A (BTN3A) isoforms, utilizing clinical and transcriptomic data from 1892 patients diagnosed with melanoma, bladder, ovarian, or pancreatic carcinomas. Real-world data were collected under the Total Cancer Care Protocol and the Avatar® project (NCT03977402) across 18 cancer centers. Furthermore, we compared the survival outcomes following immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) based on immune cell gene expression. Results: In melanoma and bladder cancer, the estimated infiltration of APA T-cells differed significantly (p = 4.67 × 10−12 and p = 5.80 × 10−12, respectively) compared to ovarian and pancreatic cancers. Ovarian cancer had lower TRM T-cell infiltration than melanoma, bladder, and pancreatic (p = 2.23 × 10−8, 3.86 × 10−28, and 7.85 × 10−9, respectively). Similar trends were noted with stem-like, early, and late dysfunctional T-cells. Melanoma and ovarian expressed BTN3A isoforms more than other malignancies. Higher densities of stem-like TILs; TRM, early and late dysfunctional T-cells; APA T-cells; and BTN3A isoforms were associated with increased survival in melanoma (p = 0.0075, 0.00059, 0.013, 0.005, 0.0016, and 0.041, respectively). The TRM gene signature was a moderate predictor of survival in the melanoma cohort (AUROC = 0.65), with similar findings in testing independent public datasets of ICI-treated patients with melanoma (AUROC 0.61–0.64). Conclusions: Key cellular elements related to immune activation are more heavily infiltrated within ICI-responsive versus non-responsive malignancies, supporting a central role in anti-tumor immunity. In melanoma patients treated with ICIs, higher densities of stem-like TILs, TRM T-cells, early dysfunctional T-cells, late dysfunctional T-cells, APA T-cells, and BTN3A isoforms were associated with improved survival.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Rich cytotoxic T-cell infiltration in cancerous tissues is associated with better clinical prognosis. A major obstacle to tumor T cell infiltration can be the scarcity of adhesion molecules expressed by the growing tumor neo-vasculature that limits the binding and extravasation of effector lymphocytes. In the present study, we aimed at reversing this endothelial cell anergy in vitro by using bispecific antibodies that redirect T cells to endothelial cell growth factor receptors and mediate T cell activation via CD3 and costimulation via CD28 in direct contact with endothelial cells. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of T cells and endothelial cells resulted in a profound upregulation of adhesion molecules due to the secretion of proinflammatory T cell cytokines. T-cell adhesion to previously quiescent endothelial cells, as well as their capacity to migrate through an endothelial cell monolayer and subsequently kill breast cancer cell spheroids, was greatly augmented.">

        <tr id="Introduction Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a predominant subset of innate-like T cells in humans, characterized by diverse gene expression profiles and functional capabilities. However, the factors influencing the transcriptomes and effector functions of MAIT cells, particularly at mucosal barriers, remain largely unclear. Methods In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and functional assays to investigate the transcriptomic and functional characteristics of intestinal MAIT cells in mouse models during aging. We also extended scRNA-seq analysis to human intestinal MAIT cells to compare their gene expression patterns with those observed in aged mice. Results Our findings demonstrated that the transcriptomes and functional capabilities of intestinal MAIT cells shifted from MAIT17 to MAIT1 profiles with aging in mouse models, with notable changes in the production of cytotoxic molecules. Further scRNA-seq analysis of human intestinal MAIT cells revealed a segregation into MAIT1 and MAIT17 subsets, displaying gene expression patterns that mirrored those seen in aged mouse models. The transcription factor RORγt was expressed in both MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, acting to repress IFNγ production while promoting IL17 expression. Moreover, reduced expression of RORC and Il17A was correlated with poorer survival outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. Discussion These results suggest that aging induces a functional shift between MAIT1 and MAIT17 cells, which may be influenced by transcriptional regulators like RORγt. The observed alterations in MAIT cell activity could potentially impact disease prognosis, particularly in colorectal cancer. This study provides new insights into the dynamics of MAIT cell responses at mucosal barriers, highlighting possible therapeutic targets for modulating MAIT cell functions in aging and disease.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Oligodendrocytes (OL) and their myelin-forming processes are targeted and lost during the disease course of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), targeted by infiltrating leukocytes and their effector cytokines. Myelin repair is considered to be dependent on recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The basis of failure of re-myelination during the disease course of MS remains to be defined. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of pro-inflammatory molecules tumor necrosis factor ⍰ (TNF⍰) and interferon gamma (IFNγ) on the differentiation of human OPCs. Methods We generated human OPCs from induced pluripotent stem cells with a reporter gene under the OL-specific transcription factor SOX10. We treated the cells in vitro with TNF⍰ or IFNγ and evaluated effects in terms of cell viability, expression of OL-lineage markers, and co- expression of astrocyte markers. To relate our findings to the molecular properties of OPCs as found in the MS brain we re-analyzed publicly available single nuclear RNAseq datasets. Results Our analysis indicated that both TNF⍰ and IFNγ decreased the proportion of cells differentiating into the OL-lineage; consistent with previous reports. We now observe the TNF⍰ effect is linked to aberrant OPC differentiation. A subset of O4+, reporter-positive cells co- expressed the astrocytic marker Aquaporin-4 (AQP4). On the transcriptomic level, the cells acquire an astrocyte-like signature alongside a conserved reactive phenotype. Analysis of single- nuclear RNAseq datasets from human MS brain revealed a subset of OPCs expressing an astrocytic signature. Discussion In the context of MS, these results imply that OPCs are present but inhibited from differentiating along the OL-lineage, with a subset acquiring a reactive and stem-cell like phenotype, reducing their capacity to contribute towards repair. These findings help define a potential basis for the impaired myelin repair in MS and provide a prospective route for regenerative treatment.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are specialized lymphocytes that help protect against viruses and cancer. However, in the context of bacterial infections, NK cells can be harmful, rather than protective. Such immune pathogenesis by NK cells has been linked to the over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In this context, IFN-γ-deficient mice display increased survival rates in response to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which causes life-threatening, invasive systemic infections with high mortality rates in humans. However, little is known about how NK cells respond to S. aureus in humans. In this study, we found that the peripheral blood of patients with bloodstream S. aureus infection was enriched for NKG2A+ NK cells with greater cytokine producing capacity, compared to those hospitalized with Escherichia coli bloodstream infections. As a possible mechanistic cause, superantigens from S. aureus promoted the expansion of CD57− NKG2A+ NK cells which produced IFN-γ through an IL-12-independent mechanism and exhibited reduced levels of CD16 compared to unstimulated NK cells. These data suggest that S. aureus bloodstream infection in humans promotes a phenotypic shift towards NKG2A+ NK cells with greater IFN-γ producing capacity, providing a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis. AUTHOR SUMMARY Natural Killer (NK) cells are specialized immune cells that provide crucial defence against viruses but can also respond to bacterial infections, especially in humans. During bloodstream infection by Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in humans, NK cells may actually be harmful, rather than protective, to the host. However, very little is known about the NK cell response to invasive Staphylococcus aureus infections in humans. Here, we show that human patients with bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus, but not Escherichia coli, infections have an increased frequency of NK cells with increased pro-inflammatory capacity. Furthermore, we show that toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which help the bacteria evade the protective effects of T cells the immune system (“superantigens”), promoted the expansion of these pro-inflammatory NK cells, providing a possible mechanistic cause for their increased presence in patients with bloodstream Staphylococcus aureus infections. Collectively, these results suggest that Staphylococcus aureus infection triggers phenotypic and functional changes in NK cells that provide a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells, as critical components of the innate immune system, have emerged as promising candidates in cancer therapy due to their ability to recognize and destroy tumor cells without prior sensitization. Their mechanisms of action, including perforin-granzyme release and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), position them as versatile agents in cancer immunotherapy. Recent advancements, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cells and cytokine-based stimulation, have demonstrated enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects compared to conventional immunotherapies. However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a significant obstacle, imposing challenges like immune checkpoint activation, cytokine suppression, and metabolic constraints that impair NK cell activity. This paper explores the therapeutic potential of NK cells, the challenges of immune resistance in the TME, and emerging strategies to enhance NK cell efficacy. Addressing these challenges is crucial for optimizing NK cell-based treatments and achieving durable responses in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="CD206 is a common marker of a putative immunosuppressive "M2" state in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). We made a novel conditional CD206 (Mrc1) knock-in mouse to specifically visualize and/or deplete CD206+ TAMs. Early depletion of CD206+ macrophages and monocytes (Mono/Macs) led to the indirect loss of conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1), CD8 T cells, and NK cells in tumors. CD206+ TAMs robustly expressed CXCL9, contrasting with stress-responsive Spp1-expressing TAMs and immature monocytes, which became prominent with early depletion. CD206+ TAMs differentially attracted activated CD8 T cells, and the NK and CD8 T cells in CD206-depleted tumors were deficient in Cxcr3 and cDC1-supportive Xcl1 and Flt3l expressions. Disrupting this key antitumor axis decreased tumor control by antigen-specific T cells in mice. In human cancers, a CD206Replete, but not a CD206Depleted Mono/Mac gene signature correlated robustly with CD8 T cell, cDC1, and NK signatures and was associated with better survival. These findings negate the unqualified classification of CD206+ "M2-like" macrophages as immunosuppressive.">

        <tr id="Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurs in one of five patients. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the virulence factor TcdB reduce disease recurrence, suggesting that an inadequate anti-TcdB response to CDI leads to recurrence. In patients with CDI, we discovered that IL-33 measured at diagnosis predicts future recurrence, leading us to test the role of IL-33 signaling in the induction of humoral immunity during CDI. Using a mouse recurrence model, IL-33 was demonstrated to be integral for anti-TcdB antibody production. IL-33 acted via ST2+ ILC2 cells, facilitating germinal center T follicular helper (GC-Tfh) cell generation of antibodies. IL-33 protection from reinfection was antibody-dependent, as μMT KO mice and mice treated with anti-CD20 mAb were not protected. These findings demonstrate the critical role of IL-33 in generating humoral immunity to prevent recurrent CDI. Graphical Abstract: IL-33 restoration induces toxin-B-specific antibody production via the ILC2-TFH axis. In the left panel, IL-33 remediation increases ILC2s, subsequently inducing TFH directly or indirectly. TFH cell induction is pivotal for the production of antibodies. IL-33 also downregulates type 1 and type 3 immunity, favoring type 2 immunity to enhance host survival and reduce morbidity. The middle panel illustrates antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, resulting in decreased IL-33 levels and reduced antibody production. The right panel demonstrates the protective effect in reinfection, attributed to toxin-specific antibodie generated by IL-33 remediation.">

Mounting evidence indicates that T cell senescence constitutes the primary mechanism underlying T cell dysfunction in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and represents one of the potential causes of immunotherapy failure. AML usually progresses rapidly and is highly susceptible to drug resistance, thereby resulting in recurrence and patient mortality. Hence, disrupting the immune interface within the bone marrow microenvironment of AML has emerged as a critical objective for synergistically enhancing tumor immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the general characteristics, distinctive phenotypes, and regulatory signaling networks of senescent T cells and highlight their potential clinical significance in the bone marrow microenvironment of AML.

        <tr id="Peripherally-derived regulatory T cells (pTregs) have a prominent role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. In cases of phosphoinositide-3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) inactivation, such as in patients receiving PI3Kδ inhibitor idelalisib as a cancer treatment, breakdown of intestinal immune tolerance occurs frequently in the form of diarrhoea and colon inflammation. In a mouse model of systemic PI3Kδ inactivation, both enhancement of anti-tumor immunity and colitis have been described, as a result of Treg impairment. However, in view of the critical role for Tregs in the prevention of systemic autoimmunity, the basis for such tissue-restricted breach of immune tolerance upon loss of PI3Kδ function is not yet understood. We report here that mice lacking PI3Kδ activity do not suffer a general defect in Treg immunosuppression, but specifically fail to develop Helios- pTregs in the colon. We demonstrate reduced extrathymic Treg induction, in vitro and in vivo, from naïve CD4+ T cells with inactive PI3Kδ, along with dysregulation of a tissue-resident phenotype. These results suggest a non-redundant role for PI3Kδ-dependent pTreg differentiation in maintaining tolerance to commensal microbial antigens in the gut.">

To achieve this, keratinocytes were treated with IFN-γ and 5MIX, and their impact on the expression of key antigen-presentation molecules, HLA-DRα and CD74, was assessed. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that IFN-γ alone altered the expression of 254 genes, highlighting its central role in modulating immune responses, including the recruitment of immune cells and regulation of inflammation. Temporal experiments further demonstrated that IFN-γ and 5MIX enhanced early endocytic activity and lysosomal degradation pathways, both essential for effective antigen presentation and T-cell activation. To extend these findings to a clinical context, a co-culture model using keratinocytes derived from psoriatic patients was established. This model revealed increased cytokine production following antigen stimulation, indicating robust and consistent CD4+ and naïve T-cell responses. These results elucidate the complex dynamics of cytokine signaling and antigen presentation in keratinocytes, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies for immune-mediated skin disorders like Ps.">

Strategies targeting LSCs hold promise for enhancing outcomes, yet paired comparisons of functionally defined LSCs at diagnosis and relapse remain underexplored. We present transcriptome analyses of functionally defined LSC populations at diagnosis and relapse, revealing significant alterations in IL-1 signaling. Interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL1R1) and interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) were notably upregulated in leukemia stem and progenitor cells at both diagnosis and relapse. Knockdown of IL1R1 and IL1RAP reduced the clonogenicity and/or engraftment of primary human AML cells. In leukemic MLL-AF9 mice, Il1r1 knockout reduced LSC frequency and extended survival. To target IL-1 signaling at both diagnosis and relapse, we developed UR241-2, a novel interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and 4 (IRAK1/4) inhibitor. UR241-2 robustly suppressed IL-1/IRAK1/4 signaling, including NF-κB activation and phosphorylation of p65 and p38, following IL-1 stimulation. UR241-2 selectively inhibited LSC clonogenicity in primary human AML cells at both diagnosis and relapse, while sparing normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. It also reduced AML engraftment in leukemic mice. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of UR241-2 in targeting IL-1/IRAK1/4 signaling to eradicate LSCs and improve AML outcomes.">

 Background:
 Chronic heart failure (HF) is characterized by adverse remodeling and persistent inflammation, leading to impaired heart function and poor prognosis. While the acute immune response post-myocardial infarction (MI) is well-studied, the role of the immune system in chronic HF remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the response of T cells to HF.


 Methods and Results:
 In a cohort of 188 HF patients and healthy controls (HC), flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed an increase in T cell memory/effector cells (HF=65%, HC=53% activated T cells) and a reduction in naïve T cells in HF patients. Additionally, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) displayed a higher immune stimulatory profile (e.g., HLA-DR, ICAM-1, TREM-1). Immune secretome analysis supported the chronic inflammatory state with significantly elevated serum levels of sICAM-1, IL6, and TNFRI in HF patients.

 Phenotyping of peripheral blood T cells showed a decline in T central memory cells (TCM) and an increase in CD4+ Th17 and CD8+ T effector memory cells in HF patients compared to healthy controls. This decline in TCM cells and the increased expression of the homing marker CCR5 on T cell subsets were associated with poor prognosis in HF. T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing revealed reduced TCR diversity (p=0.03) and clonal expansion in circulating and cardiac T cells of HF patients. Epitope prediction modeling identified 22 unique human-derived epitopes specific to HF, suggesting potential autoreactivity.
 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45+ sorted cardiac and circulating cells confirmed clonal TCR expansion in the heart and blood of HF patients. Post-MI mouse models demonstrated an accumulation of pro-inflammatory Th17 T cells in the heart at days 14, 28, and 48, with later time points showing more pronounced pro-inflammatory profiles.

 Conclusion:
 Chronic HF is associated with persistent T cell activation and clonal expansion, potentially contributing to adverse remodeling and poor prognosis through autoimmune mechanisms. These findings provide insights for therapeutic cardio-immunological interventions targeting T cell responses in HF.

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can address an unmet clinical need for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its effect is often modest in the setting of high tumor burden. In this study, we postulated that strategies to lower the AML apoptotic threshold will augment T cell killing of AML cells. BH3 mimetics, such as venetoclax, are a clinically approved class of compounds that predispose cells to intrinsic apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins. We explored the anti-leukemic efficacy of BH3 mimetics combined with WT1-specific CD8 + T cells on AML cell lines and primary samples from patients with a diverse array of disease characteristics to evaluate if lowering the cellular apoptotic threshold via inhibition of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins can increase leukemic cell sensitivity to T cell therapy. We found that the combination approach of BH3 mimetic and CD8 + T cells led to significantly increased killing of established AML lines as well as of adverse-risk primary AML leukemic blast cells. In contrast to the hypothesis that enhanced killing would be due to combined activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, we found that CTL-mediated killing of AML cells was accomplished primarily through activation of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This highly effective combinatorial activity due to convergence on the same apoptotic pathway was conserved across multiple AML cell lines and primary samples, suggesting that mitochondrial priming may represent a novel mechanism of optimizing adoptive cell therapy for AML patients.">

        <tr id="Tumor cell-intrinsic signaling pathways can drastically affect the tumor immune microenvironment, promoting tumor progression and resistance to immunotherapy by excluding immune-cell populations from the tumor. Several tumor cell-intrinsic pathways have been reported to modulate myeloid-cell and T-cell infiltration creating "cold" tumors. However, clinical evidence suggests that excluding cytotoxic T cells from the tumor core also mediates immune evasion. Here, we find that tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 signaling in non-small cell lung cancer induces the exclusion of cytotoxic T cells from the tumor core and promotes resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy. Mechanistically, tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 expression upregulates CCL2 in tumor cells, resulting in increased recruitment of regulatory T cells. CD8+ T-cell exclusion depended on regulatory T cell-mediated suppression of tumor vasculature. Depleting tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells via Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related protein (GITR) restored CD8+ T-cell infiltration and, when combined with checkpoint blockade therapy, reduced tumor growth. These results show that tumor cell-intrinsic SOX2 expression in lung cancer serves as a mechanism of immunotherapy resistance and provide evidence to support future studies investigating whether NSCLC patients with SOX2-dependent CD8+ T-cell exclusion would benefit from the depletion of GITR+ Tregs.">

        <tr id="Primary and secondary resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) reduces its efficacy. The mechanisms underlying immunotherapy resistance are highly complex. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), these mechanisms are primarily associated with the loss of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, genetic mutations, circular RNA axis and transcription factor regulation, antigen presentation disorders, and dysregulation of signaling pathways. Additionally, alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) play a pivotal role in driving immunotherapy resistance. Primary resistance is mainly attributed to TME alterations, including mutations and co-mutations, modulation of T cell infiltration, enrichment of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and pulmonary fibrosis. Acquired resistance mainly stems from changes in cellular infiltration patterns leading to “cold” or “hot” tumors, altered interferon (IFN) signaling pathway expression, involvement of extracellular vesicles (EVs), and oxidative stress responses, as well as post-treatment gene mutations and circadian rhythm disruption (CRD). This review presents an overview of various mechanisms underlying resistance to ICB, elucidates the alterations in the TME during primary, adaptive, and acquired resistance, and discusses existing strategies for overcoming ICB resistance.">

        <tr id="Abstract Malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma patients reside in the bone marrow and continuously interact with local immune cells. Progression and therapy response are influenced by this immune environment, highlighting the need for a detailed understanding of endogenous immune responses to malignant plasma cells. Here we used the 5TGM1 murine transfer model of multiple myeloma to dissect early immune responses to myeloma cells. We modeled stable and progressive disease by transferring 5TGM1 murine myeloma cells into C57Bl/6 mice and KaLwRij mice, respectively. We used flow cytometry and single‐cell and bulk transcriptomic analyses to characterize differential immune responses in stable and progressive disease. Transfer of 5TGM1 cells in C57Bl/6 mice led to stable disease with low tumor burden in a subset of animals. Stable disease was associated with sustained activation and expansion of NK cells, ILC1, and CD8+ T cells, a response that was lost upon disease progression. Single‐cell RNA‐sequencing of immune cells and bulk RNA sequencing of immune and mesenchymal stromal cells implicated the activation of interferon responses as a central immune pathway during stable disease. Experimentally, neutralization of IFNγ significantly increased myeloma development and progression in C57Bl/6 mice, testifying to the importance of this pathway in early disease control. In conclusion, we provide a framework for studying immune responses to multiple myeloma progression in immunocompetent and genetically modifiable mice and highlight the importance of bone marrow immunity in tumor control.">

        <tr id="Ferroptosis is a novel form of cell death characterized by unlimited accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxides. It is often accompanied by disease, and the relationship between ferroptosis of immune cells and immune regulation has been attracting increasing attention. Initially, it was found in cancer research that the inhibition of regulatory T cell (Treg) ferroptosis and the promotion of CD8+ T cell ferroptosis jointly promoted the formation of an immune-tolerant environment in tumors. T-cell ferroptosis has subsequently been found to have immunoregulatory effects in other diseases. As an autoimmune disease characterized by immune imbalance, T-cell ferroptosis has attracted attention for its potential in regulating immune balance in lupus nephritis. This article reviews the metabolic processes within different T-cell subsets in lupus nephritis (LN), including T follicular helper (TFH) cells, T helper (Th)17 cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and Treg cells, and reveals that these cellular metabolisms not only facilitate the formation of a T-cell immune imbalance but are also closely associated with the occurrence of ferroptosis. Consequently, we hypothesize that targeting the metabolic pathways of ferroptosis could become a novel research direction for effectively treating the immune imbalance in lupus nephritis by altering T-cell differentiation and the incidence of ferroptosis.">

        <tr id="During chronic infection or tumorigenesis, persistent antigen stimulation contributes to the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. Nevertheless, exhausted CD8+ T (TEX) cells still preserve certain effector function, and maintaining a reservoir of exhausted cells is of vital importance for virus elimination and tumor eradiation. Despite considerable work interrogating the rejuvenation of TEX cells, mechanisms underpinning the clonal deletion of TEX cells remain largely unexplored over the past decade. In this study, we employed mouse models of LCMV infection to demonstrate that excessive accumulation of lipid peroxidation rendered virus-specific TEX cells to ferroptosis, which may correlate with enhanced mitochondria-derived oxidative stress and compromised activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). In addition, either incomplete or complete ablation of GPX4 resulted in exacerbated ferroptosis and aggravated shrunken population of virus-specific TEX cells. On the other hand, inhibiting ferroptosis via administration of a ferroptosis inhibitor or overexpression of GPX4 greatly rectified the cell loss of virus-specific TEX cells. Collectively, we disclosed ferroptosis as a crucial player in the clonal deletion of virus-specific TEX cells and stressed the intervention of ferroptosis as a promising approach to optimize the longevity of virus-specific TEX cells.">

Here we reveal a novel interaction between eosinophils and monocytes in the bone marrow, indirectly controlled by the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2. We demonstrate that ACKR2 maintains eosinophil levels within the bone marrow by scavenging CCL11. In the absence of ACKR2, elevated CCL11 leads to increased egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. As a result, eosinophil and monocyte interactions are reduced within the bone marrow niche, leading to changes in monocyte gene expression. Monocytes from ACKR2-/- mice are recruited to the tissues but are fundamentally altered in their ability to differentiate into macrophages, in the lung, peritoneal cavity and cavity wall. Bacterial elimination is impaired in ACKR2-/- mice during peritoneal infection. ACKR2 is therefore a key regulator of eosinophil-driven monocyte education in the bone marrow, required for full monocyte differentiation and macrophage function within the tissues.">

        <tr id="Background Although MDSCs are widely recognized for their immunoinhibitory effects in pathological conditions, their function during HIV infection particularly within the mechanisms underlying incomplete immune recovery remains elusive. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 30 healthy controls and 62 HIV-1-infected subjects [31 immunological non-responders (INRs) and 31 immunological responders (IRs)] were selected. The proportion of MDSCs was determined in each category of participants. Using flow cytometry and real-time PCR, immune regulatory molecules (including PD-L1, ARG1, iNOS, IL-10, TGF-β, and IDO) that are relevant for MDSCs activity were quantified. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the blockade of PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways on MDSCs and their effects on CD4+ T-cells using in vitro functional experiments. Results PMN-MDSCs are more abundant and are negatively correlated to CD4 counts in HIV-infected individuals. In addition, PMN-MDSCs suppress CD4+ T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ production in INRs. Furthermore, correlations were found between PD-L1 expression on PMN-MDSCs and PD-1+ CD4+ T-cells. TGF-β expression on PMN-MDSCs was likewise enhanced in INRs. Importantly, inhibiting both PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways had a synergistic impact on restoring CD4+ T-cell activity in vitro. Conclusions PMN-MDSCs expansion inhibits CD4+ T-cell responses. We suggest that targeting PD-L1 and TGF-β pathways together may significantly improve immune recovery in INRs.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells play an integral role in immunosurveillance against myeloid malignancies, with their mature phenotype and abundance linked to prolonged treatment-free remission in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, NK cell function is suppressed during the disease, and the orchestrators of this impairment are not fully understood. Using a chimeric BCR::ABL1+ CML mouse model, we characterized the impact of the leukemic microenvironment on NK cell function. We showed that NK cells have reduced counts, immature phenotype, poor cytotoxicity, and altered expression of activating and inhibitory receptors in CML mice, which revert to a steady state upon BCR::ABL1 inhibition. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an inflammatory cytokine response in CML-exposed NK cells, highlighted by the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa)-induced gene signature, upregulation of TNFa receptor TNFR2, and enrichment of SOCS family genes such as Cish, the critical NK cell checkpoint. Ex vivo exposure of healthy NK cells to leukemic soluble factors compromised target-specific NK cell degranulation, which was partially rescued by targeting Cish or TNFa. In alignment with these findings, NK cells from healthy donors displayed suppressed cytotoxicity when exposed to plasma from untreated CML patients, with a partial restoration upon Cish or TNFa inhibition. Furthermore, NK cells from newly diagnosed CML patients pre-destined for blast crisis showed an enrichment of the TNFa-induced pro-inflammatory gene signature identified in CML mice. These results suggest that targeting inflammatory signaling could enhance NK cell-based immunotherapies for CML.">

        <tr id="The potent immunostimulatory effects of toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) agonism in combination with PD-1 blockade have resulted in various preclinical investigations, yet the mechanism of action in humans remains unknown. To decipher the combinatory mode of action of TLR8 agonism and PD-1 blockade, we employed a unique, open-label, phase 1b pre-operative window of opportunity clinical trial (NCT03906526) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Matched pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from the same lesion were obtained. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and custom multiplex staining to leverage the unique advantage of same-lesion longitudinal sampling. Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased CLEC9A+ dendritic cell and CLEC7A/SYK expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8+ T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13+CD8+ T-cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients. This study provides key insights into the mode of action of TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade immune targeting in HNSCC patients.">

Activation of DCs stands at the forefront as they work as coordinators of the immune system, spotting and presenting microbe fragments to T cells, thereby commencing Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI). This review aims to trace the origin of DCs and find out what makes them stand out among other antigen-presenting cells. The research takes us into the DC mechanisms of activation that affect T-cell proliferation, especially in cancer pathologies. Participants are also outlined the possible effects of DC study related to the oncological treatments’ development. Briefly, discrimination based on the complex participation of DCs and T cells should pave the way for more potential interventions for improving immunotherapy and other diseases. In summary, dendritic cells are central players in orchestrating immune responses, including those against cancer cells. Understanding their biology and interactions with cancer cells is crucial for developing effective immunotherapies for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is characterized by a concomitant early pro-inflammatory response by immune cells to an infection, and an opposing anti-inflammatory response that results in protracted immunosuppression. The primary pathological event in sepsis is widespread programmed cell death, or cellular self-sacrifice, of innate and adaptive immune cells, leading to profound immunological suppression. This severe immune dysfunction hampers effective primary pathogen clearance, thereby increasing the risk of secondary opportunistic infections, latent viral reactivation, multiple organ dysfunction, and elevated mortality. The types of cell death include apoptosis (type I programmed cell death), autophagy (type II programmed cell death), NETosis (a program for formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)) and other programmed cell deaths like pyroptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, each contributing to immunosuppression in distinct ways during the later phases of sepsis. Extensive apoptosis of lymphocytes, such as CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and B cells, is strongly associated with immunosuppression. Apoptosis of dendritic cells further compromises T and B cell survival and can induce T cell anergy or promote regulatory Treg cell proliferation. Moreover, delayed apoptosis and impaired neutrophil function contribute to nosocomial infections and immune dysfunction in sepsis. Interestingly, aberrant NETosis and the subsequent depletion of mature neutrophils also trigger immunosuppression, and neutrophil pyroptosis can positively regulate NETosis. The interaction between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) plays a key role in T cell modulation and neutrophil apoptosis in sepsis. The dendritic cell growth factor, Fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLTEL), increases DC numbers, enhances CD 28 expression, attenuates PD-L1, and improves survival in sepsis. Recently, immunoadjuvant therapies have attracted attention for their potential to restore host physiological immunity and homeostasis in patients with sepsis. This review focuses on several potential immunotherapeutic agents designed to bolster suppressed innate and adaptive immune responses in the management of sepsis.">

 Effector B cell responses in solid malignancies are associated with favorable response to immunotherapy. B cells can amplify anti-tumor immune responses via antibody production, antigen presentation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release; yet B cells in cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice often fail to support these functions. We have evaluated the contribution of either systemic inflammatory cues or antigenic quality to B cell differentiation and function in cancer. First, we identify dysregulated transcriptional programs activated in pancreatic cancer-associated B cells that promote differentiation of naïve into immunosuppressive B cells and inhibit differentiation of anti-tumor plasma cells. Second, we find that systemic exposure to STING agonists potentiates expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory human and mouse IL35+ B lymphocytes. Finally, using a system where a B cell neoantigen is either soluble or tethered to the surface of cancer cells, we demonstrate that membrane-tethered antigen is sufficient to elicit activation of anti-tumor immunity and reduce tumor growth in a NK cell-dependent manner. Thus, inflammation and quality of antigen impact basic mechanisms governing B cell differentiation and the resulting immune response to solid malignancy with implications for vaccine engineering.

        <tr id="Dysregulated metabolism in tumor tissues, and para-tumor tissues alike, can lead to immunosuppression, which may underlie cancer development. However, metabolic intervention as a therapeutic strategy has been of no avail. In this study, we explored the anti-cancer therapeutic effect of aldometanib that specifically targets lysosome-associated aldolase to mimic glucose starvation and thereby activates the lysosomal AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of metabolic homeostasis. We show that aldometanib inhibits the growth of HCC in an AMPK-dependent manner, allowing hepatoma-bearing mice to survive to mature ages, although aldometanib does not possess cytotoxicity towards HCC or normal cells. Intriguingly, aldometanib exerts anti-cancer effects only in immune-competent host mice, but not in immune-defective mice. We have further found that the HCC tissues in aldometanib-treated mice are massively infiltrated with CD8+ T cells, which is not seen in mice with liver-specific knockout of AMPKα. Our findings thus suggest that the metabolic regulator AMPK rebalances the tumor microenvironment to allow the cytotoxic immune cells inside the body to eliminate cancer cells and effectively contain the tumor tissues. The finding that metabolic intervention can make cancer a life-long manageable disease, may potentially usher in a new era of cancer therapy.">

This study aimed to explore the immune profiles between moderate and severe COVID-19 patients experiencing a cytokine storm and their association with mortality. This study highlights the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and the TIGIT/CD226/CD155/CD112 pathways in COVID-19 patients.We performed a study using flow cytometry to compare the phenotypic and functional characteristics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with moderate or severe disease and healthy individuals. Soluble immune checkpoint molecule and ligand levels were measured by Luminex.Severe patients show reduced CD8+ T cell frequency, hyperactivation of CD8+ T, NK and NKT cells with concurrent upregulation of immune checkpoint ligands in monocytes. TIGIT expression by CD8+ T and NK cells and PD-1 by NKT cells suggest a spectrum of immune dysfunction, encompassing both hyperactivation and features of exhaustion. This dual phenomenon likely contributes to the impaired viral clearance and the exacerbation of inflammation characteristic of severe disease. Additionally, the study suggests that increased activation and cytotoxicity of NK cells may be associated with fatal outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection.These findings shed light on the intricate immune response regulation in COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of immune checkpoint pathways and activation signatures in disease severity. A novel aspect of this study is that it includes only COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storms, allowing for a focused analysis of immune dysregulation during this critical phase of the disease.">

        <tr id="How cancer cells escape immune surveillance and resist immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains to be fully elucidated. By screening candidate genes frequently gained in cancer, we identified expression of ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1 (UBA1) as being the most negatively correlated with signatures related to effector CD8+ T-cells. High UBA1 expression was strongly predictive of treatment resistance and poor survival in ICB cohorts. Functional studies revealed that UBA1 mediated immune escape to promote tumor growth. Immune profiling further showed that Uba1 overexpression or depletion markedly decreased or increased functional intratumoral CD8+ T-cells, respectively. Importantly, a selective UBA1 inhibitor, TAK-243, significantly synergized with ICB in multiple syngeneic models. Mechanistically, depletion or inactivation of the UBA1-STUB1 axis stabilized a key interferon pathway component (JAK1), enhanced IFN-signaling, and elevated key immune modulators, including CXCL9, CXCL10, and MHC class I. Our study warrants clinical evaluation of the combination of UBA1 inhibitors and ICB.">

        <tr id="Cellular mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET), also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), is a crucial receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in various solid tumors, including lung, breast, and liver cancers. The concomitant expression of c-MET and PD-L1 in tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, highlights their prognostic significance and connection to therapeutic resistance. Cancer-associated fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), activating c-MET signaling in tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). This activation leads to metabolic reprogramming and increased activity of enzymes like glutaminase (GLS), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and arginase 1 (ARG1), depleting essential amino acids in the tumor microenvironment that are vital for effector immune cell function. This review highlights the interplay between tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that create an immunosuppressive environment while providing targets for c-MET-focused immunotherapy. It emphasizes the clinical implications of c-MET inhibition on the behavior of immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, and NK cells. It explores the potential of c-MET antagonism combined with immunotherapeutic strategies to enhance cancer treatment paradigms. This review also discusses the innovative cancer immunotherapies targeting c-MET, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies, monoclonal antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates, while encouraging the development of a comprehensive strategy that simultaneously tackles immune evasion and enhances anti-tumor efficacy further to improve the clinical prognoses for patients with c-MET-positive malignancies. Despite the challenges and variability in efficacy across different cancer subtypes, continued research into the molecular mechanisms and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies will be crucial.">

Across both mouse and human systems, we identified multiple unappreciated targets of opsonization as well as putative immune checkpoints. We used this information to engineer a compendium of 156 bispecific antibodies, and we identified dozens of bispecifics that dramatically stimulate macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity of lymphoma cells. Among these, a bispecific comprising a SIRPα decoy domain and a CD38-targeting arm (WTa2d1xCD38) exhibited maximal efficacy while minimizing the risk of hematologic toxicity. This bispecific stimulated robust anti-tumor responses in multiple xenograft models of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Our approach can be directly applied to other cancers to rapidly discover bispecific antibodies that leverage anti-tumor responses by macrophages or other innate immune cells.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Immune checkpoints are essential for regulating excessive autoimmune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis. However, in the tumor microenvironment, these checkpoints can lead to cytotoxic T cell exhaustion, allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and promote tumor progression. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in cancer cells is associated with poor prognoses, reduced survival rates, and lower responses to therapies. Consequently, downregulating PD-L1 expression has become a key strategy in developing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Caryophylli cortex (CC), derived from the bark of the clove tree Syzygium aromaticum, possesses antioxidant and cytotoxic properties against cancer cells, yet its potential as an ICI remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we aimed to investigate whether CC extract modulates PD-L1 expression in cancer cells and activates T cell immunity through a co-culture system of cancer cells and T cells, as well as in hPD-L1/MC-38 tumor-bearing animal models. Results: Our findings indicate that CC extract significantly downregulated both constitutive and inducible PD-L1 expression at non-toxic concentrations for cancer cells while simultaneously enhancing cancer cell mortality and T cell activity in the co-culture system. Furthermore, the administration of CC extract to hPD-L1/MC-38 tumor-bearing mice resulted in a greater than 70% reduction in tumor growth and increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Principal component analysis identified bergenin, chlorogenic acid, and ellagic acid as active ICIs. Conclusions: These findings suggest that CC extract exerts a potent antitumor effect as an immune checkpoint blocker by inhibiting PD-L1 expression in cancer cells and disrupting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction.">

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive and highly metastatic breast cancer subtype with limited effective treatment options. Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting checkpoint molecules have been widely used and have shown therapeutic efficacy in treating multiple malignancies in the last decade. In TNBC, ICI targeting PD-1, alone or in combination with chemotherapy has been approved for the treatment of patients with both early and advanced stage of the disease. Although, there has been significant clinical benefit achieved from anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy, treatment efficacy is often limited to a subgroup of patients. The limited response to ICIs has been attributed to the increased infiltration of immunosuppressive cells (including MDSCs, neutrophils and tumor-associated macrophages), more importantly, the upregulation of alternative immune checkpoint receptors/ligands that may further suppress cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, it has been suggested that targeting other immune checkpoint molecules may be more effective in bolstering anti-tumor immune response. V- domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) is one of the immune checkpoint molecules attracting increasing attention in the context of anti-tumor immunity due to its broad expression across various cancer types and increased expression upon development of immune checkpoint resistance. However, the role of VISTA in regulating the anti-tumor immune response and its therapeutic potential in TNBC remains unclear. In our study, we observed that VISTA is expressed in TNBC patients, predominantly in neutrophils and macrophages. In the Py230 murine breast cancer model, VISTA expression increased upon paclitaxel (PTX), anti-PD-L1 and paclitaxel combined with anti-PD-L1 treatment compared to the control group, suggesting its potential role as a resistance mechanism in sustaining or further inhibiting T cells. In the Py230 model, VISTA blockade increased the infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells, as evidenced by the higher number of CD8+ T cells, increased CD69+CD8+ T cells, and Granzyme B production, indicating that VISTA blockade improved CD8+ T cells mediated anti-tumor immunity. To functionally test the role of VISTA, we stimulated CD8+ T cells and co-cultured them with naïve macrophages or tumor educated macrophages in the presence or absence of VISTA blocking antibody. Tumor educated macrophages showed increased immunosuppressive activity which was abrogated with VISTA blockade. Moreover, we found that the immunosuppressive effect of macrophages on T cell activation needs direct cell-cell interaction between VISTA on macrophages and T cells. In conclusion, this study shows the mechanism of action of VISTA in the regulation of T cells mediated anti-tumor immune response and provides the rationale for targeting VISTA in TNBC.

        <tr id="In B-cell malignancies, the overexpression of MYC is associated with poor prognosis, but its mechanism underlying resistance to immunochemotherapy remains less clear. In further investigations of this issue, we show here that the pharmacological inhibition of MYC in various lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell lines, as well as patient-derived primary tumor cells, enhances their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity induced by conventional antibodies targeting CD20 (rituximab) and CD38 (daratumumab), as well as T cell-mediated cytotoxicity induced by the CD19-targeting bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab. This was associated with upregulation of the target antigen only for rituximab, suggesting additional escape mechanisms. To investigate these mechanisms, we targeted the MYC gene in OCI-LY18 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated MYC targeting not only upregulated CD20 but also triggered broader apoptotic pathways, upregulating pro-apoptotic PUMA and downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2, XIAP, survivin and MCL-1, thereby rendering tumor cells more prone to apoptosis, a key tumor-lysis mechanism employed by T-cells and NK-cells. Moreover, MYC downregulation boosted T-cell activation and cytokine release in response to blinatumomab, revealing a MYC-mediated T-cell suppression mechanism. In conclusion, MYC overexpressing tumor cells mitigated the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies through several non-overlapping mechanisms. Given the challenges associated with direct MYC inhibition due to toxicity, successful modulation of MYC-mediated immune evasion mechanisms may improve the outcome of immunotherapeutic approaches in B-cell malignancies.">

        <tr id="Oncolytic viruses have emerged as a highly promising modality for cancer treatment due to their ability to replicate specifically within tumors, carry therapeutic genes, and modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through various mechanisms. Additionally, they show potential synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. A study report indicates that from 2000 to 2020, 49.5% of oncolytic viruses were administered intratumorally and 35% intravenously during clinical trials. However, both administration methods face significant challenges, particularly with intravenous delivery, which encounters issues such as non-specific tissue uptake, neutralizing antibody responses, and antiviral effects mediated by various immune cells. Despite extensive research into the antiviral roles of CD8+ T cells and NK cells in oncolytic virus therapy, neutrophils—constituting approximately 50% to 70% of human peripheral blood leukocytes—have received relatively little attention. Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte subset in peripheral circulation, known for their phagocytic activity. Beyond their traditional roles in bacterial and fungal infections, emerging literature suggests that neutrophils also play a critical role in the body’s antiviral responses. Given the gaps in understanding the role of neutrophils in oncolytic virus therapy, this article reviews current literature on this topic. It aims to provide a theoretical foundation for developing oncolytic virus-based cancer therapies and enhancing their anti-tumor efficacy in future clinical treatments.">

        <tr id="Abstract The transcription factors STAT3, STAT5A, and STAT5B steer hematopoiesis and immunity, but their enhanced expression and activation promote acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKCL). Current therapeutic strategies focus on blocking upstream tyrosine kinases to inhibit STAT3/5, but these kinase blockers are not selective against STAT3/5 activation and frequent resistance causes relapse, emphasizing the need for targeted drugs. We evaluated the efficacy of JPX‐0700 and JPX‐0750 as dual STAT3/5 binding inhibitors promoting protein degradation. JPX‐0700/−0750 decreased the mRNA and protein levels of STAT3/5 targets involved in cancer survival, metabolism, and cell cycle progression, exhibiting nanomolar to low micromolar efficacy. They induced cell death and growth arrest in both AML/NKCL cell lines and primary AML patient blasts. We found that both AML/NKCL cells hijack STAT3/5 signaling through either upstream activating mutations in kinases, activating mutations in STAT3, mutational loss of negative STAT regulators, or genetic gains in anti‐apoptotic, pro‐proliferative, or epigenetic‐modifying STAT3/5 targets. This emphasizes a vicious cycle for proliferation and survival through STAT3/5. Both JPX‐0700/−0750 treatment reduced leukemic cell growth in human AML or NKCL xenograft mouse models significantly, being well tolerated by mice. Synergistic cell death was induced upon combinatorial use with approved chemotherapeutics in AML/NKCL cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Single antigen (Ag)‐targeted immunotherapies for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are highly effective; however, up to 50% of patients relapse after these treatments. Most of these relapses lack target Ag expression, suggesting targeting multiple Ags would be advantageous. Materials & Methods The multi‐Ag immune responses to ALL induced by transducing cell lines with xenoAgs green fluorescent protein and firefly luciferase was elucidated using flow cytometry, ELISA, and ELISpot assays. Results In our model, leukemia responsiveness correlates with in vivo CD4+ T cell activation and DC maturation, supporting a role for DC licensing. In contrast, tolerance is characterized by in vivo increased expression of negative immune checkpoints (IC) which may suppress rather than license DC. In vitro assays confirm the ability of CD4+ T cells from leukemia‐responsive mice to promote robust maturation of naïve bone marrow DC in the presence of non‐immunogenic leukemia antigens. Conclusion Together these findings support a CD4+ T cell‐mediated mechanism of DC licensing to promote multi‐Ag immune responses that may augment current targeted immunotherapies and avoid relapses in treated children with ALL.">

        <tr id="Cytokines, which are important to the tumor microenvironment (TME), play critical roles in tumor development, metastasis, and immune responses. Interleukin-17(IL-17) has emerged as a key biomarker in many malignancies; however, its precise involvement in gastric cancer is less fully understood. Elevated levels of IL-17 have been observed in stomach diseases such as Helicobacter pylori infection and autoimmune gastritis, indicating that a sustained Th17 response may precede the development of gastric cancer. While IL-17 is related to inflammatory processes that may lead to cancer, its specific influence on gastric cancer development and therapy needs to be completely understood. Specifically, the release of IL-17A by diverse immune cells has been associated with both tumor development and inhibition in gastric cancer. It may impact tumor development through mechanisms such as boosting cell proliferation, inducing angiogenesis, and enabling immune cell recruitment or, conversely, suppressing tumor growth via the activation of anti-tumor immune responses. The dual role of IL-17 in cancer, along with its various effects depending on the TME and immune cell composition, highlights the complexity of its activity. Current research reveals that although IL-17 might serve as a target for immunotherapy, its therapeutic potential is hindered by its various activities. Some studies have shown that anti-IL-17 drugs may be helpful, especially when paired with immune checkpoint inhibitors, whereas others point to concerns about the validity of IL-17 in gastric cancer therapy. The lack of clinical trials and the heterogeneity of human tumors underscore the necessity for individualized treatment approaches. Further studies are needed to identify the specific mechanisms of IL-17 in gastric cancer and to design targeted therapeutics appropriately.">

        <tr id="Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is highly prevalent and heterogeneous among adult acute leukemias. Current chemotherapeutic approaches for AML often face the challenge of drug resistance, and AML immune cells play an important role in the regulation of AML drug resistance. Thus, it is of key significance to explore the regulatory mechanisms of immune cells in AML to alleviate chemotherapy resistance in AML. Methods Based on AML single-cell transcriptomic data, this study revealed the differences in the expression of immune cell subpopulations and marker genes in AML patients in the complete remission group (CR) compared to AML patients in the non-complete remission group (non-CR) after chemotherapy. Functional enrichment by clusterprofiler revealed the regulatory functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AML. AUCell enrichment scores were used to assess the immunoregulatory functions of immune cells. Pseudotime analysis was used to construct immune cell differentiation trajectories. CellChat was used for cellular communication analysis to elucidate the interactions between immune cells. Survival analysis with the R package “survival” revealed the role of immune cell marker genes on AML prognosis. Finally, the wound healing and trans-well assay were performed. Results Single-cell clustering analysis revealed that NK/T cells and macrophage cells subpopulations were significantly higher in non-CR AML patients than in CR AML. AUCell enrichment analysis revealed that FCAR+ and FCGR3A+ macrophages were significantly more active in the non-CR group and correlated with processes regulating cellular energy metabolism and immune cell activity. Differentially expressed NK cell marker genes between CR and non-CR groups mainly included HBA1, S100A8, and S100A9, which were associated with cancer drug resistance regulation, these marker genes of (FCAR, FCGR3A, PREX1, S100A8 and S100A9) were upregulated in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (HAP1) and silencing of S100A8 affected migration and invasion of HAP1 cells. In particular, the differentiation pathways of macrophages and NK cells in non-CR differed from those of patients in the CR group. Cellular communication analyses showed that ligand-receptor pairs between NK cells and macrophage cells mainly included HLA-E-KLRK1, HLA-E-KLRC1, HLA-E-CD94:NKG2A, CLEC2B-KLRB1. In addition, LGALS9-CD45, CCL3L1- CCR1, CCL3-CCR1 between these two immune cells mainly regulate secreted signaling to mediate AML progression. Marker genes in NK/T cells and macrophage cells were significantly associated with AML prognosis. Conclusion This study reveals the potential role of NK cells and macrophages in AML chemoresistance through the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. This provides new ideas and insights into the key mechanisms of immune cells in AML treatment.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using retrovirally transduced T cells represents a promising strategy for enhancing antitumor responses. When used with TriVax, a peptide vaccination strategy, this approach synergistically expands antigen-specific cell populations. STAT5 plays a vital role as a transcription factor in regulating T cell proliferation and their differentiation into effector and memory T cells. We aimed to explore the combination therapy using CD8 T cells engineered to express constitutively active STAT5 (CA-STAT5) with vaccines. CD8 T cells were transduced with a retrovirus (RV) encoding the mouse gp100 T cell receptor (TCR). In certain treatment groups, cells were also co-transduced with RV encoding CA-STAT5. We assessed transduction efficiency and functional activity through flow cytometry and various functional assays. B16F10 tumor-bearing mice were treated with ACT using RV-transduced CD8 T cells and subsequently vaccinated with TriVax. We demonstrate that TriVax selectively enhanced the expansion of ACT cell populations bearing gp100-specific TCRs. T cells engineered to express CA-STAT5 showed not only increased expansion and polyfunctionality but also reduced PD-1 expression, leading to decreased cellular exhaustion. In a B16F10 melanoma mouse model, our approach yielded a potent antitumor effect, with CA-STAT5 further amplifying this response. We found that CA-STAT5 improved antitumor activities, in part, by attenuating the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway. These findings indicate that TCR-transduced CD8 T cells can undergo antigen-dependent expansion when exposed to TriVax. Additionally, the expression of CA-STAT5 enhances T cell proliferation and persistence, partly by promoting resistance to PD-1/PD-L1-mediated inhibition in antitumor T cells.">

        <tr id="Malaria remains a significant global public health problem. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, a subset of CD4+ T cells, have the capacity to regulate B cells, plasma cells, and antibody production, among other functions. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) possess strong immunosuppressive abilities and can negatively regulate various immune responses. However, the role of MDSCs in inhibiting Tfh-cell responses during Plasmodium infection remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the regulatory effect of MDSCs on Tfh cell-mediated immune responses upon Plasmodium infection. We found that the numbers of MDSCs increased upon Plasmodium infection. Further mechanism study revealed that MDSC-derived Arg-1 and PD-L1 prevented Tfh cell proliferation and activation. Conversely, the addition of nor-NOHA or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies enhanced the proliferation and activation of Tfh cells, indicating that the inhibitory effect of MDSCs on Tfh cells was dependent on Arg-1 and PD-1/PD-L1. In vivo depletion of MDSCs enhanced Tfh-cell responses and antibody production, as well as relieved symptoms of infected mice and improved their survival rates. These findings provide insights into the immunosuppressive role of MDSCs in inhibiting Tfh cell immune responses and further impairing humoral immunity.

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized immune cells that play a crucial role in presenting antigens and activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes to combat tumors. The immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) can bind to its ligand programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. This interaction suppresses T-cell activation and promotes immune tolerance. Radiation therapy can increase the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, which can lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of the treatment, and detailed studies are needed to understand the mechanisms. As many patients develop resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy-either through lack of response or cancer recurrence-there is a critical need to maximize synergistic effects by selecting combination treatments that offer improved therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects. In the present study, immature DCs (iDCs) were introduced directly into irradiated tumor sites (referred as IR/iDCs), and immune checkpoint blockades (ICBs) were administered intraperitoneally. We confirmed the antitumor effect of combining IR/iDCs and ICBs by examining tumor growth and mouse survival. The proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes increased in the IR/iDCs-treated groups. Combining IR/iDCs with an anti-PD-L1 antibody led to a significant reduction in distant tumor growth and improved mouse survival rates compared with IR/iDCs alone or IR/iDCs + anti-PD-1 antibody. These findings suggest that integrating radiotherapy, DC-based immunotherapy, and ICB, specifically targeting PD-L1, may be an effective cancer treatment strategy.">

        <tr id="During persistent antigen stimulation, exhausted CD8+ T cells are continuously replenished by self-renewing stem-like T cells. However, how CD8+ T cells adapt to chronic stimulation remains unclear. Here, we show that persistent antigen stimulation primes chromatin for regulation by the redox-sensing KEAP1-NRF2 pathway. Loss of KEAP1 in T cells impaired control of chronic viral infection. T cell-intrinsic KEAP1 suppressed NRF2 to promote expansion and persistence of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, drive a stem-like T cell response, down-regulate immune checkpoint molecules, and limit T cell receptor (TCR) hyperactivation and apoptosis. NRF2 epigenetically derepressed BACH2 targets and opposed a stem-like program driven by BACH2. In exhausted T cells induced by tonic GD2 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) signaling, the effects of KEAP1 deficiency were rescued by inhibiting proximal TCR signaling. Enhancing mitochondrial oxidation improved the expansion and survival of KEAP1-deficient CD8+ GD2 CAR T cells and up-regulated markers associated with stem-like cells. Thus, the KEAP1-NRF2 axis regulates stem-like CD8+ T cells and long-term T cell immunity during chronic antigen exposure.">

        <tr id="Long-term memory in immune cells is a pivotal aspect of the adaptive immune response, enabling the host to mount rapid and effective defenses against previously encountered pathogens. This review explores the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of immune memory, focusing on memory T cells, memory B cells, and long-lived plasma cells. Following primary infections or vaccinations, a subset of activated lymphocytes transitions into memory cells, which persist long after pathogen clearance. Factors influencing memory cell longevity, such as antigen persistence, cytokine signaling, and homeostatic proliferation, are discussed. Moreover, the review addresses the challenges posed by chronic infections and the potential for immune exhaustion, which can impair memory function. Additionally, the clinical implications of understanding immune memory are highlighted, particularly in vaccine development, cancer immunotherapy, and the management of autoimmune diseases. By synthesizing current knowledge on long-term memory in immune cells, this review aims to provide insights into future research directions and therapeutic strategies to enhance immune responses and improve public health outcomes.

        <tr id="Recently, immune function assessment has gained prominence in clinical settings. Immune functional assays (IFAs), involving in vitro stimulation, offer a relevant approach to complement traditional immunomonitoring methods which, while widely used, do not fully capture functional immune capabilities. Despite growing interest in IFAs, their added value remains unclear. To address this gap, our study aimed to determine if insights from IFAs could be replicated with unstimulated immunoprofiling. Using the same analytical pipeline, we compared transcriptomic profiles (Nanostring) between stimulated (TruCulture) and unstimulated (PaxGene) samples from i) patients with an overstimulated immune system 3-4 days post-sepsis onset, and ii) patients undergoing immune reconstitution 6-months post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In sepsis, post-stimulation transcriptomic profiles revealed immune clusters linked to disease severity and outcomes, surpassing traditional markers like mHLA-DR, while baseline analyses failed to generate clinically relevant stratification. Similarly, allo-HSCT patients' post-stimulation data revealed immune heterogeneity and treatment-related alterations not detected using baseline transcriptomic or cellular profiles alone. Our findings emphasize the value of IFAs in uncovering functional immune alterations that unstimulated assessments may miss, which could offer deeper insights into immune dysfunction. This study supports IFAs as complementary tools to current clinical practices, enhancing patient management with a functional view of immune system dynamics.">

        <tr id="Hematopoietic malignancies emerge through the gradual acquisition of genetic mutations within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Mutations that occur early in disease progression impart a selective growth advantage to HSPCs, which allows them to expand and contribute to a substantial percentage of mature blood cells. This increased expansion is termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and is a preleukemic phase associated with an increased risk of developing leukemia. Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) protein is a transcriptional regulator of proliferation/differentiation of neuronal, muscle, hematopoietic and other cells, and is frequently overexpressed in cancer. Id1 is expressed at low levels in normal HSCs and is induced by growth factors and other mediators of inflammatory stress and promotes HSPC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Since chronic inflammation is associated with the progression of hematopoietic malignancies, reducing Id1 expression during CH may be therapeutic. Mutations in TET2 are frequently observed in patients with CH, and Tet2−/−mice develop CH that progress to hematopoietic malignancies. Id1 is upregulated in murine Tet2−/− HSPCs and in AML, CMML and MDS patient samples with TET2 mutations. Genetic ablation of Id1 in Tet2−/− HSPCs reduces HSPC expansion/self-renewal/CH, extramedullary hematopoiesis, myeloid skewing, genetic instability and delays the onset of disease. Mechanistically, p16 expression, senescence and apoptosis were increased and proliferation decreased in Tet2−/−; Id1−/− HSPCs. Thus, ID1 may represent a potential therapeutic target to reduce CH, hematopoietic hyperplasia, and delay the onset of disease. One Sentence Summary Genetic ablation of Id1 in Tet2−/− mice rescues clonal hematopoiesis by increasing CDKI expression, apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation, and reducing cell growth.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells capable of directly killing target cells while modulating immune effector responses. Despite their multifunctional capacities, a limited understanding of their plasticity and heterogeneity has impeded progress in developing effective NK cell-based cancer therapies. In this study, we investigated NK cell tissue heterogeneity in relation to their phenotype and effector functions against lung tumors. Methods Using hanging drop tumor spheroid and subcutaneously established LL/2 (LLC1) lung tumor models, we examined NK cell receptor diversity and its correlation with tissue-specific cytotoxicity through multiparametric flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, and cytotoxicity assays. Results We identified distinct patterns of cell surface receptors expression on tissue-specific NK cells that are crucial for antitumor activity. Linear regression mathematical analyses further revealed significant positive correlations between activation-associated cell surface receptors and cytotoxic capacity in NK cells from tissues such as the liver and bone marrow. Conclusion These findings underscore the differential effector capacities of NK cells from distinct tissues, even prior to exposure to LL/2 tumor cells. This highlights the significance of tissue-specific NK cell heterogeneity and its impact on their antitumor cytotoxicity. Recognizing these distinct tissue-specific receptor expression patterns will be instrumental in developing more efficacious NK cell-based cancer treatments.">

        <tr id="Background. Antibody responses to MF59-adjuvanted (MF59Flu) and high-dose (HDFlu) influenza vaccines have been well-characterized in older adults, yet corresponding cellular response data remain limited. Methods. Blood samples were collected from 106 MF59Flu recipients and 112 HDFlu recipients before vaccination (Day 0), and on Days 1, 8, and 28 post-vaccination. Antibody responses were assessed on Days 0, 8, and 28 using a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. Eight pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IFN-2a, IFN-{gamma}, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, were quantified from PBMCs collected on Days 0 and 1 following stimulation with live influenza A/H3N2 virus using a multiplex assay. Associations between cytokine/chemokine levels and HAI titers were examined, along with the effect of sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and cytomegalovirus infection status. Results. Vaccine type (MF59Flu or HDFlu), sex, BMI and cytomegalovirus infection did not significantly impact cytokine and chemokine levels. However, age was positively correlated with IL-8 level on Day 1 (r = 0.24, p = 0.0003) as well as the change in IL-8 levels from Day 1 to Day 0 (r = 0.16, p = 0.021). Notably, the change in IL-8 levels was negatively associated with peak antibody responses at Day 28 (r = -0.15, p = 0.026). Conclusion. Our findings underscore IL-8 as a potential link between aging and impaired antibody responses to influenza vaccination in older adults, suggesting that IL-8 inhibition could be a promising molecular intervention to improve immunogenicity and efficacy of influenza vaccines in this high-risk population.">

        <tr id="Cellular immunotherapy represents a pivotal treatment modality in clinical practice. Regulatory B cells (Bregs), a key subset of B lymphocytes, hold promise in the management of autoimmune diseases, cancer and transplantation immunity. The expansion of Bregs for cell therapy is a promising strategy to alleviate inflammation and promote immune tolerance. Achieving immune tolerance relies on balance between regulatory and effector cells. One primary objective of cellular therapy is to shift this balance towards Bregs, fostering a more tolerant immune microenvironment. The adoptive transfer of Bregs not only increases their quantity but also modulates the number and function of other immune cells. Maximizing in vitro expansion of Bregs and enhancing their regulatory functions are key focuses in transplant immunology. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the in vitro expansion of IL-10-secreting B cells (B10) remain inadequately understood. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the signaling pathways involved in B10 activation and expansion, as well as to highlight the techniques for in vitro amplification and development of adoptive B10 therapy in transplantation, which aims to advance the field of cellular therapy targeting Bregs.">

        <tr id="Considering the general view that unconventional immune effectors play a major role in antitumor immunity, we recently postulated that the distinct new innate CD8 T-cell pool (co-expressing the transcription factor Eomesodermin and innate markers such as KIR/NKG2A) may counteract tumor cells, and thereby be potential target for cancer therapy. Here, to test this assumption, we used successfully targeted anti-leukemic therapy discontinuation (TFR) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Numerical and functional status of innate CD8 T-cells, iNKT cells and γδ T-cells, in comparison with NK cells, was compared longitudinally between non-relapsed patients (i.e., with > 12 months TFR) and relapsed patients (i.e., who experienced molecular recurrence during the first 12 months after TKI cessation) in a prospective pilot cohort (n=32), starting from treatment discontinuation (D0). Perforin, a key cytotoxic immune player, was expressed in a significantly higher proportion of both innate CD8 T-cell and NK-cell subsets in non-relapsed patients, compared with relapsed patients at D0. In parallel, we assessed the expression of PD-1, an exhaustion marker used as target in cancer therapy. For all T-cell subsets, surface-expression level of PD-1 decreased in non-relapsed patients compared with relapsed patients at D0. This was particularly the case when considering iNKT cells for which surface-expression level of PD-1 even decreased relative to healthy control subjects. Lastly, we found a negative correlation between the proportion of innate CD8 T-cells expressing PD-1 and those expressing perforin in non-relapsed patients at D0. The fact that this was not the case in conventional CD8 T-cells is compatible with a reprogrammed effector profile preferentially targeting innate CD8 T-cells in non-relapsed patients. All in all, our results highlight NK cells and innate CD8 T-cells harboring cytotoxic content, as well as global downregulation of PD-1-expression on effector T-cells, as potential predictive functional signatures for successful TFR in CML. Considering innate CD8 T-cells, further investigations are needed to determine whether their possible contributory role in cancer surveillance in CML could be extended to other cancers, and also whether their targeting by immune cheek-point inhibitors could enhance their anti-tumoral functions.">

        <tr id="Regulatory immune cells regulate immune responses through various mechanisms, affecting the occurrence, development, and therapeutic effects of tumors. In this article, we reviewed the important roles of regulatory immune cells, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), regulatory B cells (Bregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory dendritic cells (DCregs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The immunomodulatory effects of natural products, such as polysaccharides, polyphenols, glycosides, alkaloids, terpenoids, quinones, and other compounds, which affect the functions of regulatory immune cells through molecular signaling pathways, thereby enhancing the potential of the antitumor immune response, are discussed. These findings provide new ideas and possibilities for the application of natural products in tumor treatment, which can help enhance the effectiveness of tumor treatment and improve patient prognosis.">

        <tr id="Cell-intrinsic mechanisms of immunogenicity in ovarian cancer (OC) are not well understood. Damaging mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, such as SMARCA4 (BRG1), are associated with improved response to immune checkpoint blockade; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. We found that SMARCA4 loss in OC models resulted in increased cancer cell–intrinsic immunogenicity, characterized by up-regulation of long-terminal RNA repeats, increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes, and up-regulation of antigen presentation machinery. Notably, this response was dependent on STING, MAVS, and IRF3 signaling but was independent of the type I interferon receptor. Mouse ovarian and melanoma tumors with SMARCA4 loss demonstrated increased infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. These results were recapitulated in BRG1 inhibitor–treated SMARCA4-proficient tumor models, suggesting that modulation of chromatin remodeling through targeting SMARCA4 may serve as a strategy to overcome cancer immune evasion.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Objective To elucidate the role of phosphatidylcholine‐specific phospholipase C (PC‐PLC) in the antituberculosis (anti‐TB) immune response mediated by dendritic cells (DCs). Methods In vivo, C57BL/6J mice infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv. Before infection, the mice were pretreated with the PC‐PLC inhibitor D609. Bacillary loads in lung and spleen tissues were quantified through colony‐forming unit (CFU) assays. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to assess inflammatory infiltration and tissue damage. Levels of inflammatory mediators in peripheral venous blood were quantified using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Flow cytometry was employed to determine the proportions of conventional DCs (cDCs) and their subsets, cDC1 and cDC2, within lung, spleen, and lymph node tissues. In vitro, mouse bone marrow‐derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) pretreated with D609. The expression levels of chemokines and pro‐inflammatory cytokines were assessed via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and ELISA. BMDCs were loaded with H37Rv expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP‐H37Rv) or DQ‐OVA, and flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the impact of D609 on antigen phagocytosis and processing. Furthermore, flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the effect of D609 pretreatment on the expression levels of costimulatory molecules on BMDCs. The capacity of D609‐treated BMDCs to activate and proliferate T cells, as well as to induce interferon‐gamma (IFN‐γ) secretion, was assessed through a DC‐T cell coculture system. Results In vivo analysis revealed that mice pretreated with D609 exhibited a marked increase in tissue bacterial load, enhanced inflammatory infiltration, and a reduction in pro‐inflammatory mediator expression in peripheral venous blood. There was a notable decrease in the number of cDCs in lung and lymph node tissues, with a pronounced reduction in cDC1 in the lungs and cDC2 in the lymph nodes. In vitro studies demonstrated that D609 pretreated BMDCs displayed a significant decline in inflammatory mediator production, antigen phagocytosis, and antigen processing capabilities, potentially due to altered expression of costimulatory molecules. Coculture experiments indicated that D609 pretreated BMDCs showed a substantial reduction in their ability to stimulate T cell activation, proliferation, and IFN‐γ secretion. Conclusion Our findings suggest that PC‐PLC plays a critical role in the functionality of DCs, including the production of chemokines and pro‐inflammatory cytokines, migration to lymph nodes, and antigen presentation to T cells, which collectively contribute to T cell activation and effective clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms of PC‐PLC in DCs may uncover novel therapeutic targets for the development of advanced anti‐TB treatments.">

        <tr id="Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most common type of ovarian cancer with a low rate of response to immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Here, we report that nucleus accumbens-associated protein 1 (NAC1), a putative driver of EOC, has a critical role in immune evasion. We showed in murine ovarian cancer models that depleting or inhibiting tumoral NAC1 reduced the recruitment and immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), led to significant increases of cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, and promoted antitumor immunity and suppressed tumor progression. We further showed that tumoral NAC1 directly enhanced the transcription of CXCL16, by binding to CXCR6, thereby promoting MDSC recruitment to the tumor. Moreover, lipid C20:1T produced by NAC1-expressing tumor cells fueled oxidative metabolism of MDSCs and promoted their immune-suppressive function. We also showed that NIC3, a small molecule inhibitor of NAC1, was able to sensitize mice-bearing NAC1-expressing ovarian tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study reveals a critical role for NAC1 in controlling tumor infiltration of MDSCs and in modulating the efficacy of ICB therapy. Thus, targeting of NAC1 may be exploited to sensitize ovarian cancer to immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Malignant glioma, the most lethal form of brain cancer, presents with an immunosuppressive microenvironment that obstructs tumor cell clearance and hampers immunotherapeutic interventions. Despite advancements in characterizing cellular and extracellular profiles in cancer, the immunosuppressive mechanisms specific to glioma remain poorly understood. We conducted single-cell RNA sequencing of glioma samples, which revealed a select subset of human and mouse glioma cells that express CD83, a marker associated with mature antigen-presenting cells. To investigate the impact of tumor cell CD83 expression on glioma outcomes, we used an immunocompetent mouse model of glioma, bioinformatic analyses of human samples, and in vitro assays. Our findings revealed that CD83+ tumor cells contribute to tumor growth suppression and are associated with enhanced cytotoxic T-cell profiles and activated CD8+ T cells. Increased proinflammatory cytokines were identified in CD83-overexpressing tumor conditions, which were also correlated with long-term CD8+ antitumor responses. Importantly, tumor-derived CD83 could mediate communication with T cells, altering the immune microenvironment to potentially enhance immune-related tumor clearance. Collectively, our data suggest that tumor cell expression of CD83 supports the endogenous antitumor T-cell constituency in malignant glioma. Future research endeavors may aim to further investigate whether CD83 expression can enhance immunotherapeutic approaches and improve patient outcomes. Significance: Immunosuppression in malignant glioma remains a barrier to therapeutic development. CD83 overexpression in human and mouse glioma increases survival. CD83+ tumor cells promote signatures related to cytotoxic T cells, enhanced activation of CD8+ T cells, and increased proinflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that tumor-expressed CD83 could mediate tumor–immune communications.">

        <tr id="Numerous viruses that propagate through the respiratory tract may be initially engulfed by macrophages (Mφs) within the alveoli, where they complete their first replication cycle and subsequently infect the adjacent epithelial cells. This process can lead to significant pathological damage to tissues and organs, leading to various diseases. As essential components in host antiviral immune systems, Mφs can be polarized into pro-inflammatory M1 Mφs or anti-inflammatory M2 Mφs, a process involving multiple signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms that yield diverse phenotypic and functional features in response to various stimuli. In general, when infected by a virus, M1 macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines to play an antiviral role, while M2 macrophages play an anti-inflammatory role to promote the replication of the virus. However, recent studies have shown that some viruses may exhibit the opposite trend. Viruses have evolved various strategies to disrupt Mφ polarization for efficient replication and transmission. Notably, various factors, such as mechanical softness, the altered pH value of the endolysosomal system, and the homeostasis between M1/M2 Mφs populations, contribute to crucial events in the viral replication cycle. Here, we summarize the regulation of Mφ polarization, virus-induced alterations in Mφ polarization, and the antiviral mechanisms associated with these changes. Collectively, this review provides insights into recent advances regarding Mφ polarization in host antiviral immune responses, which will contribute to the development of precise prevention strategies as well as management approaches to disease incidence and transmission.">

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% of breast cancer (BC) cases worldwide, yet due to its aggressive phenotype and lack of targeted therapies it has the worst prognosis amongst BC subtypes. Up to 40% of TNBC patients will relapse after treatment and develop distant metastasis. Metastasis is the complex process by which disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) leave the primary tumor and grow at distal sites. Since most metastases occur within 3 years of diagnosis, the rapid onset and lack of effective treatments in metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) means less than 20% of patients survive after 4 years. Even though it is the most “immune-activated” BC subtype, and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown clinical benefits in early TNBC, there is a clear need for novel immunotherapeutic approaches for patients with mTNBC. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that function as the body’s first line defense against metastatic cancer cells. NK cells eliminate DTCs in the blood or at distal sites via NK cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and this process is known to be impaired in successful metastasis. We hypothesized that other cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) can inhibit NKCC at the earliest stages of metastatic outgrowth. We have used Cherry-niche, an in vivo labelling tool, to characterize how TME cells change in early and established lung micro-metastases by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry. Our initial analyses showed that monocytes are highly enriched, not only in the entire metastatic lung, but specifically in the established niche surrounding DTCs. Although we detected a slight increase in total NK cells, there was a shift in maturation status with fewer mature NK cells (CD27-CD11b+) and more immature NK cells (CD27+/-CD11b-) in the metastatic lung. Furthermore, NK cells were largely absent from the metastatic niche and those that were present displayed a dysfunctional phenotype. CellChat and NicheNet analyses of our scRNA-seq data predicted that several receptor-ligand interactions, including the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), can mediate the crosstalk between NK cells and monocytes. Next, we developed an in vitro 3D co-culture system to study the effect of blood-derived monocytes on human NKCC against mTNBC cells. We found that monocytes can suppress NKCC against MDA-MB-231 cells and decrease the viability of mature NK cells. Furthermore, recombinant MIF was able to directly inhibit NKCC, whilst a selective MIF antagonist was able to rescue monocyte-induced impairment of NKCC. These data implicate MIF as a critical monocyte-derived factor in the suppression of NK cell function against mTNBC cells. Future work will aim to identify the exact mechanism by which MIF inhibits NKCC, whilst also evaluate the effect of monocyte depletion and MIF inhibition on metastatic outgrowth and NK cell activation/maturation in vivo. This study will reveal novel inter-cellular dynamics occurring in the metastatic lung, as well as immunotherapeutic targets that may restore NKCC in mTNBC.

        <tr id="Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2s) have recently been shown to exert key regulatory functions in innate and adaptive immune response networks that drive the establishment and progression of type 2 immunity and its associated pathologies. Although mainly tissue resident, ILC2s and their crosstalk within tissue microenvironments influences both local and systemic metabolism. In turn, the metabolic status shapes the diverse ILC2 phenotypes and effector functions. Hence, deciphering the metabolic networks of ILC2s is essential in understanding ILC2’s roles in health as well as pathophysiologies. Here we detail a framework of experimental approaches to study key immunometabolic states of primary murine ILC2s and link them to phenotypes and functionality. Utilizing flow cytometry, Single Cell ENergetIc metabolism by ProfilIng Translation inhibition (SCENITH) as well as the Seahorse platform we provide a framework that allows in-depth analysis of cellular bioenergetic states to determine the immunometabolic wiring of ILC2. Linking immunometabolic states and networks to ILC2 phenotypes and effector functions will allow in-depth studies that assess the potential of novel pharmaceutics to alter ILC2 functionality in experimental and clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD38 are a therapeutic mainstay in multiple myeloma (MM). While they have contributed to improved outcomes, most patients still experience disease relapse, and little is known about tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to these drugs. Antigen escape has been implicated as a mechanism of tumor cell evasion in immunotherapy. Yet, it is unknown whether MM cells can develop permanent resistance to anti-CD38 antibodies by acquiring genomic events leading to biallelic disruption of the CD38 gene locus. Here, by using whole genome and whole exome sequencing data from 701 newly diagnosed patients, 67 patients at relapse with naivety to anti-CD38 antibodies, and 50 patients collected at relapse following anti-CD38 antibodies. We report a loss of CD38 in 20% (10/50) of patients post-CD38 therapy, three of which exhibited a loss of both copies. Two of these cases showed convergent evolution where distinct subclones independently acquired similar advantageous variants. Functional studies on missense mutations involved in biallelic CD38 events revealed that two variants, L153H and C275Y, decreased binding affinity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of the commercial antibodies Daratumumab and Isatuximab. However, a third mutation, R140G, conferred selective resistance to Daratumumab, while retaining sensitivity to Isatuximab. Clinically, patients with MM are often rechallenged with CD38 antibodies following disease progression and these data support a role for next generation sequencing to guide treatment selection.">

        <tr id="Transmembrane integrin-associated protein CD47 functions as a potent innate immunity checkpoint and is upregulated by many types of malignant cells, including melanoma during tumor progression. Binding of CD47 to its target receptor, SIRPα, on myeloid cell lineages leads to the initiation of the downstream signaling cascades that inhibit innate immunity anti-tumor responses. Molecular mechanisms underlying upregulation of CD47 during melanoma progression remain largely unknown. In this report, we performed ATAC-Sequencing on patient-derived melanoma cells, as well as, the analysis of ATAC-Seq datasets covering clinical melanoma samples to demonstrate a significant increase in chromatin accessibility for the CD47 promoter region in comparison to normal cells and tissues. Additionally, profiling of multiple CD47 transcript isoforms established that upregulation of CD47 in malignant cells occurs at the mRNA level. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) approaches along with the analysis of ChIP-Seq cancer datasets, we identified the transcription factor NRF-1 which binds at multiple sites within the proximal CD47 promoter region. In combination with serial deletions of CD47 promoter, we defined the minimal DNA region required for its activation, as well as, specific DNA locations within that region, which are preferentially occupied by NRF-1 in tumor cells.">

        <tr id="The limited infiltration of CD8+ T cells in tumors hampers the effectiveness of T cell-based immunotherapy, yet the mechanisms that limit tumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells remain unclear. Through bulk RNA sequencing of human tumors, we identified a strong correlation between WNT7A expression and reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration. Further investigation demonstrated that inhibiting WNT7A substantially enhanced MHC-I expression on tumor cells. Mechanistically, WNT7A inhibition inactivated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and thus resulted in reduced physical interaction between β-catenin and p65 in the cytoplasm, which increased the nuclear translocation of p65 and activated the NF-κB pathway, ultimately promoting the transcription of genes encoding MHC-I molecules. We found that our lead compound, 1365-0109, disrupted the protein-protein interaction between WNT7A and its receptor FZD5, resulting in the upregulation of MHC-I expression. In murine tumor models, both genetic and pharmaceutical suppression of WNT7A led to increased MHC-I levels on tumor cells, and consequently enhanced the infiltration and functionality of CD8+ T cells, which bolstered antitumor immunity and improved the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapy. These findings have elucidated the intrinsic mechanisms of WNT7A-induced immune suppression, suggesting that therapeutic interventions targeting WNT7A hold promise for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract The elderly and those with chronic diseases have a 2 to 10-fold increased risk of hospitalization and mortality following infection as compared with healthy adults. A significant contributor to disease severity is the aging of the immune system, including an expansion of exhausted T cells. These cells simultaneously promote excessive levels of inflammation and display impaired T cell activation and function. How exhausted T cells from aged individuals respond to infection and whether acute restoration of T cell activation further exacerbates the inflammatory environment or generates functional T cells is unclear. Previously, we used a mouse model of normal microbial experience (NME), where old specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice show 100% mortality following exposure to multiple microbes ordinarily found in pet store mice. In the present study, we show that when exposed to NME, old SPF mice have increased expression of multiple inflammatory pathways and exhibit elevated frequencies of a heterogenous exhausted CD8+ T cell pool that expresses differing combinations of the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), TOX, and CXCR5. Pre-treatment or intervention with an anti-PD1 monoclonal blocking antibody during the exposure of old SPF mice to NME significantly improves both antibody production and survival, without altering the acute inflammatory response. Anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade-mediated survival is dependent on CD8+, but not CD4+ T cells. Correspondingly, CD8+ PD1+ T cells from old mice given anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody have increased granzyme B production. These data reveal a new approach for reducing vulnerability to infections in the elderly by targeting CD8+ T cell exhaustion through PD1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background: The innate immune response aims to prevent pathogens from entering the organism and/or to facilitate pathogen clearance. Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, mast cells (MCs), natural killer cells and neutrophils, bear pattern recognition receptors and are thus able to recognize common molecular patterns, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), the later occurring in the context of neuroinflammation. An inflammatory component in the pathology of otherwise “primary cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative” disease has recently been recognized and targeted as a means of therapeutic intervention. Activated MCs are multifunctional effector cells generated from hematopoietic stem cells that, together with dendritic cells, represent first-line immune defense mechanisms against pathogens and/or tissue destruction. Methods: This review aims to summarize evidence of MC implication in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. Results: In view of recent evidence that the gut–brain axis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and the characterization of the neuroinflammatory component in the pathology of these diseases, this review also focuses on MCs as potential mediators in the gut–brain axis bi-directional communication and the possible role of Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen known to alter the gut–brain axis homeostasis towards local and systemic pro-inflammatory responses. Conclusion: As MCs and Helicobacter pylori infection may offer targets of intervention with potential therapeutic implications for neurodegenerative disease, more clinical and translational evidence is needed to elucidate this field.">

Here, we evaluate how these cells influence T-cell trafficking to tumors. We generated cytotoxic ieILC1-like cells from natural killer (NK) cells in vitro. Using an in vivo tumor model, we show that intratumoral ieILC1-like NK cells induce greater T cell trafficking into the tumor. Co-culture of ieILC1-like NK cells with the tumor cells resulted in elevated CXCL10 in the supernatant. Flow cytometry demonstrated that ieILC1-like NK cells produce robust amounts of IFNy, a known CXCL10 inducer, while CXCL10 was produced by tumor cells. These results indicate ieILC1-like NK cells induce tumor production of CXCL10, a proinflammatory chemokine that promotes T cell infiltration into the TME. The role of ieILC1-like NK cells in modulating clinical responses to immune checkpoint blockade warrants investigation.">

        <tr id="The tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TME) induced by incomplete radiofrequency ablation (iRFA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a critical driver of tumor progression and metastasis. Herein, we proposed a therapeutic strategy aimed at remodeling the post-iRFA TME by targeting exosome biogenesis, secretion, and PD-L1 expression, thereby rejuvenating cytotoxic T lymphocyte function to mitigate the progression and metastasis of HCC. Leveraging the versatile properties of polydopamine nanomodulators, we have engineered a tailored delivery platform for GW4869 and amlodipine (AM), enabling precise and tumor-specific release of these therapeutic agents. Initially, GW4869, a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor, synergized with AM, an intracellular calcium modulator, to suppress exosome biogenesis and secretion. Subsequently, AM triggered the autophagic degradation of PD-L1. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this synergistic approach significantly enhanced the robust activation and proliferation of various functional T-cell subsets following iRFA, particularly CD8+T cells, IFN-γ+ CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and innate lymphoid cells. Concurrently, it effectively reduced the infiltration of immunosuppressive cell types, including regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. This favorable remodeling of the TME substantially inhibited the progression and metastasis of HCC post-iRFA. Collectively, our study presented a promising paradigm for enhancing HCC treatment efficacy by integrating radiofrequency ablation with advanced immune modulation strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Accumulating evidence suggests that phenotype switching of cancer cells is essential for therapeutic resistance. However, the immunological characteristics of drug-induced phenotype-switching melanoma cells (PSMCs) are unknown. We investigated PSMC elimination by host immunity using hyperdifferentiated melanoma model cells derived from murine B16F10 melanoma cells. Exposure of B16F10 cells to staurosporine induced a hyperdifferentiated phenotype associated with transient drug tolerance. Staurosporine-induced hyperdifferentiated B16F10 (sB16F10) cells expressed calreticulin on their surface and were phagocytosed efficiently. Furthermore, the inoculation of mice with sB16F10 cells induced immune responses against tumor-derived antigens. Despite the immunogenicity of sB16F10 cells, they activated the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint system and strongly resisted T cell-mediated tumor destruction. However, in vivo treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors successfully eliminated the tumor. Thus, hyperdifferentiated melanoma cells have conflicting immunological properties – enhanced immunogenicity and immune evasion. Inhibiting the ability of PSMCs to evade T cell-mediated elimination might lead to complete melanoma eradication.">

        <tr id="Introduction The current study focuses on understanding the functional role of different subsets of endoneurial macrophages in autoimmune polyneuropathies (AP) and traumatic peripheral nerve injury (TPNI), which holds potential for clinical application. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the diverse origins of macrophages within peripheral nerves. However, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding how endoneurial macrophages from different origins affect disease progression in AP versus TPNI. Methods Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze macrophage phenotypes, including polarization states, cytokine production, and myelin phagocytosis in animal models of AP and TPNI. This study focuses on two distinct origins of macrophages, namely CD11b+F4/80hi tissue-resident (TRM) and CD11b+F4/80int blood-derived macrophages (BDM). The study utilized two animal models: the first was the spontaneous autoimmune peripheral polyneuropathy (SAPP) model in B7.2-null non-obese diabetic (NOD-B7.2-/-) mice, which serves as a model for inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; the second model involved wild type C57BL/6 mice subjected to sciatic nerve crush injury, modeling TPNI. Behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological analyses were performed to assess peripheral nerve injury. Results The study found that pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production by macrophages were more pronounced in the peripheral nerves of SAPP mice compared to those with TPNI, with the majority of these macrophages being TRM. In contrast, endoneurial macrophages in mice with TPNI were mainly BDM, exhibiting a less defined macrophage polarization and cytokine profile than TRM in AP mice. Interestingly, myelin phagocytosis was primarily driven by BDM in both SAPP and TPNI mice. Discussion This study offers novel insights into origin-dependent macrophage functions in AP and TPNI. Furthermore, these findings may help the future development of novel therapies targeting macrophage subsets of specific origin in AP and TPNI.">

        <tr id="Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) serves as an intracellular nucleic acid sensor that predominantly detects double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) within the cells. This detection initiates the assembly of inflammasome and activates the inflammasome signaling cascade, resulting in the production of inflammatory mediators and the cleavage of Gasdermins. Consequently, these processes culminate in inflammatory responses and pyroptotic cell death. AIM2 plays a pivotal role in modulating inflammation and tumorigenesis, functioning through both inflammasome-dependent and independent mechanisms. Its influence on the host immune response is dual-faceted, exhibiting both promotive and inhibitory effects in the contexts of inflammation and tumors. These effects are predominantly contingent upon the specific cell type expressing AIM2 and the nature of the host’s disease. This article seeks to review the latest advancements in understanding the cell-specific functions of AIM2 in inflammation and tumorigenesis, with the objective of offering insights for further research on AIM2 and informing the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for clinical application.">

        <tr id="Sulforaphane (SFN) has notable health benefits but faces challenges due to poor solubility and delivery. This study explores SFN glycoconjugates’ effects on LPS-induced inflammation in human dendritic cells (DCs), aiming to enhance therapeutic potential against inflammatory diseases. Monovalent SFN-glycoconjugates with mannose (SFNMan) and fucose (SFNFuc) were developed and tested for their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties in DCs from healthy donors under chronic LPS exposure. Our results revealed that carbohydrate-functionalized SFN improves solubility and effectiveness in suppressing inflammation by targeting the p65 NF-κB pathway, without affecting MAPK signaling. SFN-glycoconjugates induce a tolerogenic immune response, characterized by increased IL-10 production and enhanced regulatory T- and B-cell proliferation. Notably, these effects surpass those of p65 NF-κB inhibition alone, highlighting a distinct and potent regulatory mechanism independent of MAPK pathways. These findings demonstrate the promise of SFN-glycoconjugates as innovative therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases, offering enhanced anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects through improved delivery and targeted molecular pathways.">

        <tr id="Mast cell (MCs) activation is the driving force of immune responses in several inflammatory diseases, including asthma and allergies. MCs are immune cells found throughout the body and are equipped with numerous surface receptors that allow them to respond to external signals from parasites and bacteria as well as to intrinsic signals such as cytokines. Upon activation, MCs release various mediators and proteases that contribute to inflammation. This study aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate MC response to interleukin-33 and their target genes using a model of human cord blood-derived mast cells (hCBMCs). hCBMCs were induced with 10 and 20 ng of recombinant human interleukin-33 (rhIL-33) for 6 and 24 h, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from these cells and miRNA profiling was performed using high-throughput microarrays. Differential expression of miRNAs and target analysis were performed using Transcriptome Analysis Console and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The most significant miRNAs in each condition were miR-6836-5p (fold change = 1.76, p = 3E-03), miR-6883-5p (fold change = -2.13, p = 7E-05), miR-1229-5p (fold change = 2.46, p = 8E-04), and miR-3613-5p (fold change = 66.7, p = 1E-06). Target analysis revealed that these miRNAs regulate mast cell responsiveness and degranulation by modulating the expression of surface receptors, adaptors, and signaling molecules in response to rhIL-33 stimulation. This study is the first miRNA profiling and target analysis of hCBMCs that will further enhance our understanding of the role of miRNAs in the immune response in a timely manner and their relevance for the development of a new therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a heterogenous population of myeloid cells that dictate the inflammatory tone of the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we unveiled a mechanism by which scavenger receptor CD36 suppresses TAM inflammatory states. CD36 was upregulated in TAMs and associated with immunosuppressive features, and myeloid-specific deletion of CD36 significantly reduced tumor growth. Moreover, CD36-deficient TAMs acquired inflammatory signatures including elevated type-I interferon (IFN-I) production, mirroring the inverse correlation between CD36 and IFN-I response observed in cancer patients. IFN-I, especially IFNβ, produced by CD36-deficient TAMs directly induced tumor cell quiescence and delayed tumor growth. Mechanistically, CD36 acted as a natural suppressor of IFN-I signaling in macrophages through p38 activation downstream of oxidized lipid signaling. These findings establish CD36 as a critical regulator of TAM function and the tumor inflammatory microenvironment, providing additional rationale for pharmacological inhibition of CD36 to rejuvenate anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in colorectal cancer (CRC), correlating with immunosuppression and disease progression. Activation of the stimulator of interferon gene (STING) signaling pathway in TAMs offers a promising approach for CRC therapy. However, current STING agonists face challenges related to tumor specificity and administration routes. Method: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analysis and multicolor immunofluorescence experiments of human CRC samples analysed triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) expression in the tumor microenvironment of CRC patients. We designed and synthesized a STING agonist prodrug GB2 to reprogram TAMs by targeting TREM2 in tumors. Preliminary evaluation of the anti-tumor capacity of prodrug GB2 in the mouse CRC model intravenously. RNA-seq analysis of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) after GB2 treatment reveals novel pharmacological mechanisms for the prodrug GB2. Results: Over-expressed TREM2 in TAMs correlates with CRC progression. Via targeting TREM2 expressed in TAMs, GB2 induces comprehensive tumor regression by administrating intravenously in mouse colon cancer models, as well as in a STINGlow mouse melanoma model, with no systemic toxicity. Upon treatment with GB2, TAMs exhibit an M1 phenotype with pro-inflammatory function and demonstrate enhanced phagocytosis capacity. The molecular mechanisms involve (1) GB2 upregulating the Glycolysis-ROS-HIF-1α axis, thereby promoting glucose metabolism and inflammatory cytokine expression; (2) GB2 inducing endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact (MERC), leading to mitochondrial fission, ultimately facilitating Ca2+-mediated phagocytosis. Besides, GB2-treated macrophages reverse immunosuppression, facilitating CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and effector function. Combining GB2 with αPD-1 therapy reveals a synergistic effect on tumor inhibition, leading to prolonged mouse survival. Conclusion: By targeting TREM2 and activating the STING signaling pathway in TAMs, prodrug GB2 exhibits excellent anti-tumor efficacy and immune-activating capacity in the mouse colon cancer model.">

        <tr id="Inducing ferroptosis in tumor cells is emerging as a strategy for treating malignancies that are refractory to traditional treatment modalities. However, the consequences of ferroptosis of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) need to be better understood in order to realize the potential of this approach. In this study, we discovered that neutrophils in chemoresistant breast cancer are highly sensitive to ferroptosis. Reduction of the acyltransferase MBOAT1 in chemoresistance-associated neutrophils induced phospholipid reprogramming, switching the preference from monounsaturated fatty acids to polyunsaturated fatty acids, which increased their susceptibility to ferroptosis. Ferroptotic neutrophils secreted PGE2, IDO and oxidized lipids that suppressed the proliferation and cytotoxicity of antitumor CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, neutrophil ferroptosis was closely related to a distinct subset of IL-1beta+CXCL3+CD4+ (Fer-CD4) T lymphocytes, which were enriched in chemoresistant tumors. Fer-CD4 T cells orchestrated neutrophil ferroptosis by modulating MBOAT1 expression via IL-1beta/IL-1R1/NF-kappaB signaling. Moreover, Fer-CD4 T cells secreted CXCL3, IL-8 and S100A9 to replenish the neutrophil pool in the TME. Ferroptotic neutrophils in turn fostered Fer-CD4 T cell differentiation. In spontaneous tumorigenesis mouse models, targeting IL-1beta+ CD4+ T cells or IL-1R1+ neutrophils broke the crosstalk, restraining neutrophil ferroptosis, enhancing antitumor immunity, and overcoming chemoresistance. Overall, these findings uncover the role of neutrophil ferroptosis in shaping the immune landscape and propose appealing targets for restoring immunosurveillance and chemosensitivity in breast cancer.">

        <tr id="CD155, also known as the poliovirus receptor (PVR), is a crucial molecule in the development and progression of cancer, as its overexpression favors immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate its overexpression. Proinflammatory factors produced by various cellular components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been associated with CD155 expression. We analyzed the effect of interleukin (IL)-6 on CD155 expression in lung adenocarcinoma. We found a positive relationship between mRNA and protein levels. This correlation was also observed in bioinformatics analysis and in biopsies and serum from patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Interestingly, lung adenocarcinoma cell lines expressing suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) did not show increased CD155 levels upon IL-6 stimulation, and SOCS1 silencing reverted this effect. IL-6 and SOCS1 are critical regulators of CD155 expression in lung adenocarcinoma. Further basic and clinical studies are needed to define the role of these molecules during tumor development and to improve their clinical impact as biomarkers and targets for predicting the efficacy of immunotherapies. This study deepens the understanding of the intricate regulation of the immune checkpoints mediated by soluble factors and allows us to devise new ways to combine conventional treatments with the most innovative anticancer options.">

 Despite promising results with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, brain metastases (BrM) remain a deadly complication for cancer patients. Understanding the highly specialized brain metastatic tumor microenvironment (BrTME) is crucial for identifying determinants of response, however, progress has been hindered by limited access to patient samples and scarcity of relevant preclinical models. Here, we developed two mouse melanoma BrM models by intracardiac injection of cells derived from our previously established M4-B2905 melanoma mouse cell line. We characterized their mutational landscape and performed single-cell phenotypic and transcriptomic analysis, demonstrating that these models recapitulate the cellular and molecular features of human melanoma BrMs. Comparative and interactome analysis of our models revealed key factors contributing to ICB response and resistance. We found that the responsive model (BR1) was characterized by tumor cells that polarize microglia toward reactive states via inflammatory programs and response to IFN signaling. These microglia express high levels of antigen presentation and immunostimulatory molecules, triggering T cell recruitment and activation and promoting ICB therapy response. In contrast, in the resistant model (BR3), the tumor cells express neurological molecular signatures and ligands that sustain microglia homeostasis. This results in poor T cell infiltration predominantly composed of naïve cells, evading immune reaction and promoting ICB resistance. While we showed that systemic ICB therapy induced BrTME changes in both models, differences between responder and resistant models were maintained, emphasizing the importance of tumor cell-intrinsic programs in dictating the BrTME. We validated the translational relevance of our findings and demonstrated that BR1 signatures positively correlate with T cell infiltration and are associated with improved patient outcomes, whereas BR3 signatures negatively correlate with T cells and are found in patients with worse prognosis. Here we address an important challenge in the field by providing clinically relevant BrM models that recapitulate both the cellular and molecular features of human disease and the variability of ICB response seen in patients. We further reveal mechanistic insights into BrM ICB response and identify potential therapeutic targets to modulate the BrTME.

        <tr id="Abstract The treatment landscape for lymphoma and multiple myeloma, which disproportionally affect older adults, has been transformed by the advent of T cell-mediated immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibition, T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, during the last decade. These treatment modalities re-enable the patient’s own immune system to combat malignant cells and offer the potential for sustained remissions and cure for various diseases. Age profoundly affects the physiological function of the immune system. The process of biological aging is largely driven by inflammatory signaling, which is reciprocally fueled by aging-related alterations of physiology and metabolism. In the T cell compartment, aging contributes to T cell senescence and exhaustion, increased abundance of terminally differentiated cells, a corresponding attrition in naïve T cell numbers, and a decrease in the breadth of the receptor repertoire. Furthermore, inflammatory signaling drives aging-related pathologies and contributes to frailty in older individuals. Thus, there is growing evidence of biological aging modulating the efficacy and toxicity of T cell-mediated immunotherapies. Here, we review the available evidence from biological and clinical studies focusing on the relationship between T cell-mediated treatment of hematologic malignancies and age. We discuss biological features potentially impacting clinical outcomes in various scenarios, and potential strategies to improve the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies, and CAR-T cell therapy in older patients.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), recognized for their self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capabilities, have garnered considerable wide attention since their discovery in bone marrow. Recent studies have underscored the potential of MSCs in immune regulation, particularly in the context of autoimmune diseases, which arise from immune system imbalances and necessitate long-term treatment. Traditional immunosuppressive drugs, while effective, can lead to drug tolerance and adverse effects, including a heightened risk of infections and malignancies. Consequently, adjuvant therapy incorporating MSCs has emerged as a promising new treatment strategy, leveraging their immunomodulatory properties. This paper reviews the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs and their application in autoimmune diseases, highlighting their potential to regulate immune responses and reduce inflammation. The immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs are primarily mediated through direct cell contact and paracrine activity with immune cells. This review lays the groundwork for the broader clinical application of MSCs in the future and underscores their significant scientific value and application prospects. Further research is expected to enhance the efficacy and safety of MSCs-based treatments for autoimmune diseases.">

The results showed that this subpopulation can provide energy for tumor proliferation by promoting ribosomal autophagy, and at the same time express cell adhesion molecules, cytokines and related proteins to interact with monocytes and macrophages, hindering the function of NK cells and promoting tumor progression. This provides new ideas for in-depth analysis of the immunological role of NK cells in pan-cancer tumors.">

 Liver cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the major form of primary liver cancer, with a growing incidence rate estimated to surge by 50% in the coming twenty years. Although some success has been achieved with immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors, many HCC patients do not respond well to the treatments. Therefore, it is critical to better understand immune mechanisms regulating HCC to identify new biomarkers and develop novel immunotherapies for HCC patients. HCC is driven by chronic liver diseases and is frequently associated with chronic inflammation in the liver. Cytokines are small mediators of inflammation that play an essential role in inflammatory diseases and tumorigenesis. IL27 is a member of the IL6/IL12 superfamily with context-dependent roles in various inflammatory disorders and cancer. IL27 receptor (R) is expressed by most immune cells and several non-immune cells and plays pivotal roles in the regulation of immune responses. Recent work from our lab shows that IL27R signaling suppresses anti-cancer immune response in HCC, acting via the control of innate cytotoxic cells, and Il27ra -/- mice develop significantly less HCC. However, how IL27R signaling regulates T cell subsets in HCC in vivo remains elusive. Here, using diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced mouse model of HCC we found a reduction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in tumor-bearing Il27ra-/-mice along with lowered HCC burden. ScRNA sequencing of CD45+ cells isolated from HCC tumors indicated a less proliferative phenotype of Tregs and more cytotoxic and less exhausted CD8 T cells in mice with Il27ra deficiency. Pathway analysis suggested that IL27R-deficient Tregs were more quiescent, as characterized by the downregulation of various metabolic pathways. Our newly generated Foxp3 cre Il27ra flox mice show a significant reduction of DEN-driven HCC accompanied by an increase of tumor-infiltrating activated CD8 T cells compared to IL27R sufficient controls. Treg-specific deletion of IL27R caused the upregulation of TCF1 in Tregs which has been recently demonstrated to control Treg immune-suppressive functions in colorectal cancer. Meanwhile, tumor-infiltrating effector CD8 T cells were increased in Foxp3 cre+ Il27ra flox mice relative to their Foxp3 cre- Il27ra flox littermate controls. Interestingly, CD8 T cell specific deletion of IL27R did not impact HCC growth in CD8 cre Il27ra flox mice. Overall, our data suggest that IL27R signaling suppresses anti-HCC immunity by enhancing the pro-tumorigenic Tregs and suppressing anti-tumor effector CD8 T cell functions.

        <tr id="Vγ9Vδ2T cells have the unique ability to recognize a broad range of malignant transformed cells. The tumor targeting event involving BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 dimers on the tumor cell surface is critical, leading to full activation of the TCR. Although the molecular mechanisms governing TCR engagement and T cell activation are well-characterized, the role of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in cancer immune surveillance remains to be fully elucidated, particularly the mechanisms that enable these cells to discriminate between healthy and malignant cells at an early stage of malignant transformation. We employed two independent, genetically engineered step-wise mutagenesis models of human colorectal and breast cancer that mimic the transformation steps leading to tumor formation. We demonstrate that various single oncogenic mutations introduced into healthy organoids or cells, are sufficient to upregulate surface expressed BTN2A1 and enable Vγ9Vδ2 TCR binding to tumor cells. However, full activation of T cells through a Vγ9Vδ2TCR required additional subsequent phosphorylation of juxtamembrane (JTM) amino acids of BTN3A1, leading to the activating heterodimerization of BTN2A1 and 3A1. Using a protein interactome mapping pipeline, we identified PHLDB2, SYNJ2 and CARMIL1 as key players in controlling these delicate dual surface dynamics of BTN2A1 and 3A1 during early transformation. This mode of action allowed Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells to control tumors in vitro and in vivo, emphasizing the crucial role of these molecules from early mutagenesis, to advanced cancer stages, and highlighting the therapeutic potential of a Vγ9Vδ2TCR.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a distinct type of stress-induced regulated cell death that can lead to adaptive immune responses and the establishment of immunological memory. ICD exhibits both similarities and differences when compared to apoptosis and other non-apoptotic forms of regulated cell death (RCD). The interplay between ICD-mediated immunosurveillance against cancer and the ability of cancer cells to evade ICD influences the host-tumor immunological interaction. Consequently, the restoration of ICD and the development of effective strategies to induce ICD have emerged as crucial considerations in the treatment of cancer within the context of immunotherapy. To enhance comprehension of ICD in the setting of cancer, this paper examines the interconnected responsive pathways associated with ICD, the corresponding biomarkers indicative of ICD, and the mechanisms through which tumors subvert ICD. Additionally, this review explores strategies for reinstating ICD and the therapeutic potential of harnessing ICD in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The dynamic interplay between tumor cells and γδT cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly influences disease progression and immunotherapy outcome. Here, we delved into the modulation of γδT-cell activation by tumor cell ligands CD112 and CD155, which interact with the activating receptor DNAM-1 on γδT cells. Spatial and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), as well as spatial metabolome analysis, from neuroblastoma (NB) revealed that the expression levels and localization of CD112 and CD155 varied across and within tumors, correlating with differentiation status, metabolic pathways, and ultimately disease prognosis and patient survival. Both in vivo tumor xenograft experiments and in vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated that a high CD112/CD155 expression ratio in tumors enhanced γδT-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, while a low-ratio fostered tumor resistance. Mechanistically, CD112 sustained DNAM-1-mediated γδT-cell activation, whereas CD155 downregulated DNAM-1 expression via TRIM21-mediated ubiquitin proteasomal degradation. By interacting with tumor cells differentially expressing CD112 and CD155, intratumoral γδT cells exhibited varying degrees of activation and DNAM-1 expression, representing three major functional subsets. This study underscores the complexity of tumor-immune crosstalk, offering insights into how tumor heterogeneity shapes the immune landscape.">

        <tr id="Repeated antigen exposure leads to T-cell exhaustion, a transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct cellular state marked by loss of effector functions (e.g., cytotoxicity, cytokine production/release), up-regulation of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1), and reduced proliferative capacity. Molecular pathways underlying T-cell exhaustion have been defined for CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but which factors drive exhaustion in CD4+ T cells, that are also required for an effective immune response against a tumor or infection, remains unclear. Here, we utilize quantitative proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic analyses to characterize the molecular basis of the dysfunctional cell state induced by chronic stimulation of CD4+ memory T cells. We identified a dynamic response encompassing both known and novel up-regulated cell surface receptors, as well as dozens of unexpected transcriptional regulators. Integrated causal network analysis of our combined data predicts the histone acetyltransferase p300 as a driver of aspects of this phenotype following chronic stimulation, which we confirmed via targeted small molecule inhibition. While our integrative analysis also revealed large-scale metabolic reprogramming, our independent investigation confirmed a global remodeling away from glycolysis to a dysfunctional fatty acid oxidation-based metabolism coincident with oxidative stress. Overall, these data provide both insights into the mechanistic basis of CD4+ T-cell exhaustion and serve as a valuable resource for future interventional studies aimed at modulating T-cell dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Given the limited comprehensive data on the bone marrow (BM) immune environment in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we analyzed the distribution and phenotype of T cell subsets, including γδ T cells, and their immune checkpoint (IC) ligands on blasts. We performed multiparametric flow cytometry with BM samples taken from 89 AML patients at the time of diagnosis, remission, and relapse/refractory status after chemotherapy and 13 healthy controls (HCs) to identify immune-related risk factors. Compared to the HCs, the T cells of the AML patients exhibited exhausted features including higher TIGIT levels and similar levels of PD-1 and TIM-3. The γδ T cells were exhausted by the upregulation of TIGIT and/or TIM-3 and downregulation of NKG2D and NKp30, with different patterns in the Vδ1 and Vδ2 subtypes. A successful chemotherapeutic response partially restored the exhausted phenotypes of the T cell subsets. The simultaneous analysis of IC receptors on the T cell subsets and their ligands on blasts showed the prognostic value of a specific IC receptor–ligand pair and the feasibility of risk stratification based on their diverse patterns. Our findings clarified the BM T cell landscape in AML, unveiling the prognostic value of γδ T cells in both diagnosis and remission predictions.">

        <tr id="Macrophage phagocytosis has been implicated in regulating anti-tumour immunity. Trained innate immunity (TII), induced via modulation of mature myeloid cells or their bone marrow progenitors, mediates sustained increased responsiveness to secondary challenges. Despite the advances in the study of TII-mediated anti-tumour activity, the impact of TII on the orchestration of phagocytosis in the tumour setting requires further elucidation. Here, we investigated whether macrophage phagocytosis of tumour cells can be modulated through induction of TII. To this end, mice were pre-treated with β-glucan, a fungal-derived agonist of TII, and bone marrow was isolated for macrophage differentiation. Macrophages were then co-cultured with tumour cells that were either apoptotic or opsonised with an antibody recognising a tumour antigen, to mimic efferocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), respectively. While TII did not have any impact in the modulation of ADCP, efferocytosis was decreased in trained macrophages. Along the same line, gene expression analysis demonstrated that mRNA levels of molecules promoting efferocytosis were downregulated in trained macrophages. Trained macrophages exerted decreased levels of active caspase-1 and produced decreased levels of interleukin-1β upon efferocytosis of tumour cells. Our findings reveal a hitherto unknown role of TII in the regulation of anti-tumour immunity and may set the stage for designing new cancer immunotherapeutic approaches targeting macrophage efferocytosis.">

        <tr id="Melanoma is a highly malignant skin tumor characterized by high metastasis and poor prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of melanoma stem cells (MSCs)—a subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs)—in driving tumor growth, metastasis, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence. Similar to CSCs in other cancers, MSCs possess unique characteristics, including specific surface markers, dysregulated signaling pathways, and the ability to thrive within complex tumor microenvironment (TME). This review explored the current landscape of MSC research, discussing the identification of MSC-specific surface markers, the role of key signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog (Hh), and how interactions within the TME, including hypoxia and immune cells, contribute to MSC-mediated drug resistance and metastatic behavior. Furthermore, we also investigated the latest therapeutic strategies targeting MSCs, such as small-molecule inhibitors, immune-based approaches, and novel vaccine developments, with an emphasis on their potential to overcome melanoma progression and improve clinical outcomes. This review aims to provide valuable insights into the complex roles of MSCs in melanoma biology and offers perspectives for future research and therapeutic advances against this challenging disease.">

        <tr id="Tissue repair and regeneration are essential processes that restore tissue structure and function after injury. The immune system plays a critical role in orchestrating these processes, regulating inflammation, clearing debris, and promoting tissue regeneration through complex interactions with tissue-specific stem cells and resident immune cells. Key immune players, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells, coordinate the early inflammatory phase, while macrophages, particularly M2-polarized macrophages, facilitate tissue repair by secreting growth factors like **VEGF** and **TGF-β**. The balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is crucial for proper healing; dysregulated immune activity can lead to chronic wounds, fibrosis, or autoimmune-related tissue damage. In conditions like chronic wounds or liver fibrosis, prolonged inflammation hinders the repair process, emphasizing the need for controlled immune responses. Therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating immune activity, including the use of stem cells, immune-modulatory drugs, and biomaterials, hold promise in enhancing tissue repair and regeneration. This review highlights the key roles of immune cells in tissue repair, the impact of immune dysregulation on healing, and the therapeutic potential of targeting immune pathways to improve regenerative outcomes. Understanding the immune mechanisms behind tissue repair opens new avenues for treating chronic diseases and promoting tissue regeneration in clinical settings.

        <tr id="
 Background: Immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB), with or without chemotherapy, is the standard of care for recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, only a minority of patients get clinical benefit from it. The combined expression of PD-L1 in a tumor section is currently the only biomarker approved for response prediction. Yet, its invasive nature and suboptimal predictive performance underscores the need for new, non- invasive surrogates of immune activity in patients undergoing ICB. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry key molecules critical for cell-cell communication and have the potential to be used as a non-invasive, real-time biomarker of systemic immune activity, essential for success in ICB- based therapy. Methods: We used a multichannel, microfluidic device that employs an immune- affinity approach, ‘herringbone chip’ (EVHB-Chip), to retrospectively isolate EVs from twelve HNSCC patients before and after the first cycle of ICB. One mL of plasma was used per patient per time point. For each patient, two devices were serially used, with each sample continuously following through each chip in a non-destructive manner—the first device aimed to isolate B cell EVs (antibodies against CD19 and CD20). The second device was optimized to capture T cell EVs (against CD274/PD-L1). Digital-droplet PCR was performed after EVs were isolated to detect the RNA transcripts in the EV cargo. Serial sampling was performed for six out of the twelve patients. Response assessment was conducted via RECIST1.1 criteria or clinical evaluation. Results: Most of our cohort was male 7/12 (57%) and had oral cavity 4/12 (33%) or oropharynx 4/12 (33%) tumors. Additionally, 11/12 (91%) patients received ICB monotherapy. Most of the cohort had a PD-L1 ≤ 1 (7/12; 58%), 7/12 patients experienced disease progression (PD), 4/12 experienced stable disease (SD), and one patient had a partial response (PR). Most of the RNA signal in pre-ICB samples was obtained from CD20 (12/12; 100%), followed by CD45 (10/12; 83%), CD19 (9/12; 75%), and CD274/PD-L1 (5/12; 41%). No difference was found in the RNA signal pre-ICB between responders and non-responders (p=0.1). For the patients with serial sampling available, the signal from CD274/PD-L1 increased after one infusion of ICB in 4/6 patients and remained negative in one. A trend towards a high amount of T cell-derived EVs was observed for the entire cohort (p=0.07; p=0.08) when comparing the amount of RNA via our EV marker (GAPDH, ACTB) between T and B cell devices. Patients with higher than 11.4/mL copies of CD19 (median value for the cohort) in the pre-ICB plasma sample tended to have a higher overall survival (HR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.06-1.13; p-value: 0.05) and progression-free survival (HR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.07-1.16; p-value: 0.06). Conclusion: The EVHB-Chip allowed for the detection and profiling of T and B cell-derived EVs in pre-ICB plasma samples of HNSCC patients undergoing ICB in this pilot cohort. Higher CD19 signal pre-ICB could potentially impact response and survival outcomes in ICB-based therapies.

 Glioblastoma (GBM) is often fatal within a year despite treatment, with immune checkpoint blockade therapies benefiting only about 10% of patients. Non-responsive GBMs exhibit an immunosuppressive profile and higher levels of tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMs). Addressing this immunosuppressive microenvironment is a major challenge in GBM immunotherapy. Our recent studies have identified a positive correlation between Proline-Rich Tyrosine Kinase 2 (Pyk2) activation in GBM tumor cells and the cytokine expression profile of TAMs. This identified Pyk2 as a potential prognostic marker for the immune state in GBM tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that Pyk2 and MEK/Erk signaling in GBM cells regulate the release of chemokines and cytokines through extracellular vesicles (EVs) by modulating the actin cytoskeleton, thereby impacting TAM activation. The study aimed to investigate the role of Pyk2/MEK/Erk signaling in EV release in GBM cells, potentially revealing new therapeutic targets. Two humans primary GBM cell lines, with and without Pyk2 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (Pyk2KO), were used. Flow cytometric analysis of EVs, enriched from cell-conditioned medium, identified a shift towards larger in diameter EVs populations in Pyk2 KO cells, compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Analysis using Integrin as a plasma membrane marker showed that 84.70% of Integrin+ and 15.30% of Integrin- EVs were derived from WT cells, whereas Pyk2KO cells produced 89.07% Integrin+ and 10.93% Integrin- EVs. Treatment of WT cells with the Erk/MEK inhibitor Avutometinib (1µM) altered the EV population’s ratio to 79.11% Integrin+ and 20.89% Integrin-. Similarly, Avutometinib treatment of Pyk2KO cells resulted in 78.83% Integrin+ and 21.17% Integrin- EVs, similar to the ratio observed in Avutometinib-treated WT cells. Western blot and PCR analysis of EVs content revealed a significant reduction in CCL2, CCL5, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) in EVs from Pyk2KO GBM cells, compared to WT. In vivo studies using GL261/C57Bl/6 mouse glioma implantation model and flow cytometric analysis of TAMs from tumors generated with WT and Pyk2KO GL261 cells demonstrated increased infiltration of TNF+/IFNg+ CD8+ lymphocytes and Ly6C+/CD206- myeloid cells, alongside a reduction in CD45+/CD11b+/CD33+/MHCII- myeloid-derived suppressor cells. PCR analysis of TAM isolated from Pyk2KO tumors revealed lower gene expression of TNF, CCL5, CCL2, VEGFa, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) compared to WT tumors. The study highlights that Pyk2/MEK/Erk signaling regulates the immune microenvironment in GBM by influencing EV release, which impacts TAM cell activation. Pyk2 primarily regulates the release of Integrin- EVs, while MEK/Erk predominantly regulates EVs shed from the plasma membrane. The findings underscore the interplay between Pyk2 and MEK/Erk signaling in regulating EV biogenesis and composition.

        <tr id="T cell immune tolerance is established in part through the activity of the Auto-immune Regulator (AIRE) transcription factor in the medullary Thymic Epithelial Cells (mTEC) of the thymus. AIRE induces expression of SELF peripheral tissue-specific antigens for presentation to naïve T cells to promote activation/deletion of potentially autoreactive T cells. We show, for the first time to our knowledge, that tumors mimic the role of AIRE in mTEC to evade immune rejection. Thus, by expressing a broad range of SELF epitopes against which minimal functional T cell reactivities exist because of thymic deletion, AIRE acts as a master controller of SELFNESS, effectively cloaking the tumor from T cell attack. Moreover, we describe a completely novel immunotherapy in which engineered changes in AIRE expression in tumor cells alters their profile of SELFNESS, exposing both AIRE-modified, and parental unmodified, tumor cells to T cell attack. Consistent with our studies, patient RNAseq shows expression of AIRE predicts response to immune therapies with a strong correlation between AIRE expression and markers of TCR signaling. Therefore, by re-setting the immunological SELFNESS of cancer cells, this novel AIRE-mediated immunotherapy 1). converts a highly tolerized T cell compartment into a heteroclitic tumor-reactive T cell population; 2) confers de novo sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade upon non-immunogenic tumors; 3). completely removes the need to identify potentially immunogenic tumor-associated antigens as targets for generation of de novo CD8+ and helper CD4+ T cell responses; and 4) leads to potent T cell-mediated rejection of aggressive, immunologically cold, non-immunogenic tumors.">

B cells can both directly and indirectly antagonize tumor growth via antibody production, antigen presentation, and cytokine secretion, potentially through the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures. However, certain B cell states have demonstrated the ability to promote tumor growth via immunoregulatory mechanisms such as the production of immunosuppressive cytokines and the expression of immune checkpoints, both of which dampen T cell–dependent antitumor responses. Here, we discuss the dichotomy of B cell function in solid tumors, underscoring both the pro- and antitumor roles that B cells play in the TME.

        <tr id="Identifying definitive biomarkers that predict clinical response and resistance to immunotherapy remains a critical challenge. One emerging factor is extracellular acidosis in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which significantly impairs immune cell function and contributes to immunotherapy failure. However, acidic conditions in the TME disrupt the interaction between cancer and immune cells, driving tumor-infiltrating T cells and NK cells into an inactivated, anergic state. Simultaneously, acidosis promotes the recruitment and activation of immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Notably, tumor acidity enhances exosome release from Tregs, further amplifying immunosuppression. Tumor acidity thus acts as a “protective shield,” neutralizing anti-tumor immune responses and transforming immune cells into pro-tumor allies. Therefore, targeting lactate metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy to overcome this barrier, with approaches including buffer agents to neutralize acidic pH and inhibitors to block lactate production or transport, thereby restoring immune cell efficacy in the TME. Recent discoveries have identified genes involved in extracellular pH (pHe) regulation, presenting new therapeutic targets. Moreover, ongoing research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving extracellular acidification and to develop treatments that modulate pH levels to enhance immunotherapy outcomes. Additionally, future clinical studies are crucial to validate the safety and efficacy of pHe-targeted therapies in cancer patients. Thus, this review explores the regulation of pHe in the TME and its potential role in improving cancer immunotherapy.">

Here, we studied three patients from two families with functional hyposplenism, absence of tonsils, and complete lymph node aplasia, leading to recurrent bacterial and viral infections. We identified biallelic loss-of-function mutations in LTBR, encoding the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR), primarily expressed on stromal cells. Patients with LTβR deficiency had hypogammaglobulinemia, diminished memory B cells, regulatory and follicular T helper cells, and dysregulated expression of several tumor necrosis factor family members. B cell differentiation in an ex vivo coculture system was intact, implying that the observed B cell defects were not intrinsic in nature and instead resulted from LTβR-dependent stromal cell interaction signaling critical for SLO formation. Collectively, we define a human inborn error of immunity caused primarily by a stromal defect affecting the development and function of SLOs.">

        <tr id="The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in modulating anticancer immunity, significantly impacting the effectiveness of various cancer therapies, including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Its impact on the development of cancer is complex; certain bacteria, like Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis, can stimulate the growth of tumors by causing immunological evasion and inflammation, while advantageous strains, like Faecalibaculum rodentium, have the ability to suppress tumors by modifying immune responses. Cytokine activity and immune system regulation are intimately related. Cytokines including TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-10 promote tumor development by inhibiting efficient immune surveillance. The gut microbiome exhibits a delicate balance between pro- and anti-tumorigenic factors, as evidenced by the enhancement of anti-tumor immunity by cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-γ. Improved immunotherapy responses are linked to a diverse microbiota, which is correlated with higher tumor infiltration and cytotoxic T-cell activation. Because microbial metabolites, especially short-chain fatty acids, affect cytokine expression and immune cell activation inside the tumor microenvironment, this link highlights the need to maintain microbial balance for optimal treatment effects. Additionally, through stimulating T-cell activation, bacteria like Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidum increase cytokine production and improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). An option for overcoming ICI resistance is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), since research suggests that it improves melanoma outcomes by increasing CD8+ T-cell activation. This complex interaction provides an opportunity for novel cancer therapies by highlighting the possibility of microbiome modification as a therapeutic approach in personalized oncology approaches.">

 Increased extracellular DNA (exDNA) levels in the blood are a hallmark of metastatic cancer, arising from tumor lysis, apoptosis, necrosis, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by tumor-expanded neutrophils. NETs, web-like chromatin structures extruded by neutrophils to trap pathogens, are highly immunogenic due to their DNA and histone content and their persistent interaction with dendritic cells. Tumor cells can also release extracellular traps. In myeloid leukemia, blasts release nuclear content via traps to activate coagulation or sustain myeloproliferation. Extracellular traps have been found in NPM1 mutant AML patients, with mutant NPM co-localizing with histones along exDNA traps. Forcing trap extrusion in NPM mutant leukemia cells has been used to create dendritic cell-based vaccines that break tolerance against NPMc antigens. This suggests that NETs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) may promote tolerance, with breaking tolerance requiring consistent NET formation and dendritic cell interaction. NETs are also seen in solid tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where they aid in cancer cell migration, invasion, and awakening of circulating tumor cells. However, the capacity of tumor cells to directly extrude DNA traps is not fully understood. To investigate this, various human and murine breast cancer cell lines were seeded on poly-D-lysine coated slides, stained with DAPI and Sytoxgreen, and observed via confocal microscopy. Tumor cells extruded DNA traps within 4 hours without stimuli. Notably, trap extrusion correlated with cell line aggressiveness and was abolished by DNase, indicating dsDNA composition. The absence of traps in 24-hour cultures suggests DNA extrusion may help rare tumor cells survive and proliferate. In line, DNase treatment reduced tumor proliferation and increased apoptosis. To assess the significance of DNA traps in vivo, BALB/c mice were injected with the highly metastatic 4T1 clone 5 breast cancer model, with or without DNase treatment, and monitored starting 5 days post-injection and weekly until day 28. Histological analysis at the injection site 5 days post-injection showed that DNase treatment reduced both local trap formation and tumor cell proliferation, as indicated by BrdU incorporation. Moreover, immunohistochemistry revealed that in DNase-treated mice, initial tumor growth was followed by complete tumor regression, accompanied by local and systemic CD8 T cell activation. Correspondingly, although a few metastases were detectable at day 14 in DNase-treated mice, no metastases were observed by day 28. Although it remains unclear whether tumor-derived or immune cell-derived traps are most relevant in our model, the results demonstrate that their presence in the TME promotes tolerance despite the inherent immune adjuvant properties of the traps. This suggests that DNase treatment could be particularly effective in combating early tumor development or relapse when used as part of a combination therapy designed to sustain anti-tumor immune responses.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cell tumor infiltration is associated with good prognosis in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). NK cells recognize and kill targets by a process called natural cytotoxicity. We hypothesized that promoting an antigen-specific synapse with co-activation may enhance NK cell function in mCRPC. We describe a Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE) construct that engages with the activating receptor CD16 on NK cells, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on mCRPC cells, and has an interleukin (IL)-15 moiety that is essential for NK cell survival, proliferation, and priming. We show that the PSMA TriKE specifically binds to PSMA-expressing cells and significantly enhances expansion, degranulation and cytokine production of NK cells derived from healthy donors or prostate cancer patients. Bystander killing of PSMA-negative was also achieved with PSMA TriKE treatment when co-cultured with PSMA-positive cells, suggesting potential PSMA TriKE benefit in controlling tumor antigen escape. When tested under physiologic conditions recapitulating the mCRPC tumor microenvironment (TME), NK cells treated with PSMA TriKE and prolonged exposure to hypoxia or MDSCs maintained their potent function while IL-15 treated NK cells showed greatly impaired cytotoxicity. Finally, in vivo testing of PSMA TriKE showed improved tumor control and survival of mice as compared to IL-15 and untreated control groups. In conclusion, PSMA TriKE demonstrates potential as a new therapy for advanced prostate cancer by providing additional signals to NK cells to maximize their anti-tumor potential in prostate cancer, especially in the setting of a hostile TME.">

        <tr id="Polyfunctional T cells programmed to perform activities such as degranulation of lytic enzymes and simultaneous production of multiple cytokines are associated with more effective control of viral infections. Immune responses to recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector delivery systems can critically influence therapeutic efficacy and safety of gene therapy. However, knowledge of polyfunctional T cells in anti-AAV immune responses is scarce. To bridge this knowledge gap, we have investigated the polyfunctionality of primary human CD4 T cells from healthy donors after in-vitro exposure to rAAV2 or rAAV9 vectors. By performing proliferation assays of co-cultured T cells and rAAV pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells from healthy donors we demonstrate T cell reactivity of 43% and 50% to rAAV2 and rAAV9 vectors, respectively. We validated this frequency in a second screen using another set of healthy donors measuring CD25 and CD71 T cell activation. Single T cell secretome analysis of reactive donors uncovered a Th1 pro-inflammatory, cytolytic and chemoattractive cytokine release profile after stimulation with rAAV2 or rAAV9 vectors. 12.4% and 9.6% of the stimulated T cells displayed a polyfunctional cytokine response, respectively, including elevated polyfunctional inflammatory indices. These responses were characterized by cytokine clusters such as Granzyme B, MIP1-α and TNF-α released in combination by single T cells. Overall, our results provide insights into adaptive immunity with rAAV vector serotypes which will be important in advancing gene therapy safety, vector selection, immunogenicity assessment and better patient selection for AAV gene therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background T cell-based immunotherapies including immune checkpoint blockade and chimeric antigen receptor T cells can induce durable responses in patients with cancer. However, clinical efficacy is limited due to the ability of cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. While T cells have been the primary focus of immunotherapy, recent research has highlighted the importance of natural killer (NK) cells in directly recognizing and eliminating tumor cells and playing a key role in the set-up of an effective adaptive immune response. The remarkable potential of NK cells for cancer immunotherapy is demonstrated by their ability to broadly identify stressed cells, irrespective of the presence of neoantigens, and their ability to fight tumors that have lost their major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) expression due to acquired resistance mechanisms. However, like T cells, NK cells can become dysfunctional within the tumor microenvironment. Strategies to enhance and reinvigorate NK cell activity hold potential for bolstering cancer immunotherapy. Methods In this study, we conducted a high-throughput screen to identify molecules that could enhance primary human NK cell function. After compound validation, we investigated the effect of the top performing compounds on dysfunctional NK cells that were generated by a newly developed in vitro platform. Functional activity of NK cells was investigated using compounds alone and in combination with checkpoint inhibitor blockade. The findings were validated on patient-derived intratumoral dysfunctional NK cells from different cancer types. Results The screening approach led to the identification of a Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl-b) inhibitor enhancing the activity of primary human NK cells. Furthermore, the Cbl-b inhibitor was able to reinvigorate the activity of in vitro generated and patient-derived dysfunctional NK cells. Finally, Cbl-b inhibition combined with T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) blockade further increased the cytotoxic potential and reinvigoration of both in vitro generated and patient-derived intratumoral dysfunctional NK cells. Conclusions These findings underscore the relevance of Cbl-b inhibition in overcoming NK cell dysfunctionality with the potential to complement existing immunotherapies and improve outcomes for patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="Radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is a progressive pathology deleteriously impacting cancer survivorship. CXCL12 is an immune-stromal signal implicated in fibrosis and innate response. We hypothesised that modulation of CXCL12 would phenotypically mitigate RIF. CXCL12 expression was characterised in a rodent model of RIF and its expression modulated by the intravascular delivery of lentiviral vectors encoding small hairpin RNA to silence (LVShCXCL12) or overexpress (LVOeCXCL12) CXCL12. Multi-modal fibrotic outcomes were quantified, flow cytometry and Y-chromosome lineage-tracking studies performed to examine cellular recruitment and activation post-radiotherapy (post-RT). Whole-tissue RNA-seq was used to examine matrisomal response. MATBIII tumours were engrafted within tissues with differing levels of CXCL12 expression and tumoral response to RT evaluated. CXCL12 was upregulated in irradiated fibroblasts demonstrating DNA-damage post-RT and led to the recruitment of CD68+ macrophages. Silencing Cxcl12 with LVShCXCL12 demonstrated reduced RIF phenotype as a result of decreased macrophage recruitment. Transcriptomic profiling identified osteopontin (SPP1) as being highly differentially expressed in LVShCXCL12-treated tissues. Tumours growing in tissues devoid of CXCL12 expression responded better following RT due to reductions in peri-tumoural fibrosis as a result of decreased CXCL12 and OPN expression at the tumour/normal tissue interface. This was also associated with greater CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumours with less fibrosis. Antibody-mediated OPN blockade slowed tumour growth by increased intra-tumoral CD8+ T cell activation. The CXCL12/OPN axis is an important node of immune/matrisomal cross-talk in the development of fibrosis. Therapeutic manipulation of this axis may offer greater anti-tumour efficacy whilst also reducing adverse effects.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) has become a dominant regimen in modern cancer therapy, however immune resistance induced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with immune suppressive and evasion properties limits responses. Therefore, the rational design of immune modulators that can control the immune suppressive properties of TAMs and polarize them, as well as dendritic cells (DCs), toward a more proinflammatory phenotype is a principal objective in cancer immunotherapy. Methods Here, using a protein engineering approach to enhance cytokine residence in the tumor microenvironment, we examined combined stimulation of the myeloid compartment via tumor stroma-binding granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to enhance responses in both DCs and T cells via stroma-binding interleukin-12 (IL-12). We evaluated tumor responses at the levels of outcome, cellular responses, and cytokine responses in both the tumors and the tumor-draining lymph nodes. We further investigated the potentiation of DC response to IL-12 by GM-CSF stimulation ex vivo. Results Engineered GM-CSF restored an antitumorigenic tumor myeloid microenvironment otherwise suppressed by TAMs, while engineered IL-12 provided effector signals to T cells, thereby boosting both tumor-resident antitumor macrophage and CD8+ T cell populations. Furthermore, engineered GM-CSF potentiated DC response to IL-12, upregulating DC expression of IL-12 receptor and enhancing their expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines on IL-12 exposure. This resulted in remarkable synergistic efficacy in multiple solid tumor models treated with the dual cytokine combination. The combination therapy also improved the efficacy of CPI in a CPI-resistant genetically-engineered melanoma model and exhibited synergistic antitumor efficacy in a pulmonary metastasis model. Conclusion Our strategy provides a rational design for combination immunotherapy targeting both myeloid and lymphoid compartments through complementary mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Numerous human cancers have exhibited the ability to elude immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This type of resistance can be mediated by immune-suppressive macrophages that limit antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we elucidate a strategy to shift macrophages into a proinflammatory state that down-regulates V domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) via inhibiting AhR and IRAK1. We used a high-throughput microfluidic platform combined with a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify regulators of VISTA levels. Functional characterization showed that the knockdown of these hits diminished VISTA surface levels on macrophages and sustained an antitumor phenotype. Furthermore, targeting of both AhR and IRAK1 in mouse models overcame resistance to ICB treatment. Tumor immunophenotyping indicated that infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ cells, natural killer cells, and antitumor macrophages was substantially increased in treated mice. Collectively, AhR and IRAK1 are implicated as regulators of VISTA that coordinate a multifaceted barrier to antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute significantly to the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment which is a main barrier for immunotherapies of solid cancers. Reducing Treg numbers enhances anti-tumor immune responses but current depletion strategies also impair effector T cells (Teffs), potentially leading to reduced anti-tumor immunity and/or autoimmune diseases. CD137 has been identified as the most differentially expressed gene between peripheral Tregs and intratumoral Tregs in virtually all solid cancers. Further, CD137 is expressed by malignant cells of certain cancers, making it a potential target for tumor immunotherapy. Here, we report the development of a fully human anti-human CD137 antibody of the IgG1 isotype, clone P1A1, that induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in CD137+ Tregs and cancer cells. P1A1 cross-reacts with murine CD137 which allowed testing murine chimeric P1A1 in syngeneic murine tumor models where P1A1 significantly reduced the number of CD137+ Tregs and inhibited tumor growth in a murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a melanoma lung metastasis model. P1A1 can also be internalized thus enabling it as a carrier for drugs to target CD137+ Tregs and cancer cells. These anti-cancer properties suggest a translation of P1A1 to human immunotherapy.">

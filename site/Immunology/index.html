        <tr id="Immunotherapy has revolutionized treatment for a wide variety of cancers yet its use has been relatively limited in childhood malignancies. With the introduction of bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE®) and chimeric antigen T-cell receptor technologies, previously refractory patients have attained remission, including molecularly negative states of disease, thus providing the possibility of long-term cure. Blinatumomab is a widely available CD3-CD19 BiTE that has dramatically changed the landscape of therapy for some children with precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphomas. Challenges remain with using BiTE in a broader population although the appeal of now-confirmed reduced toxicity and deeper molecular remissions suggests that this approach will be an essential part of future treatment of childhood B-ALL. Herein, we review some of the pertinent literature covering clinical trials with blinatumomab and address future approaches and combination trials including BiTE.">

        <tr id="Objective Antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play an essential role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis, however, their tolerogenic potential remains unclear. Herein, the tolerogenic profiles of DCs are characterized in treatment-naïve RA patients to determine their role to inflammatory arthritis management. Methods Thirty-six treatment-naïve RA patients were enrolled, of which 62% were non-responders to methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy based on disease activity score (DAS) after 6-months of therapy. DC and monocyte subset frequencies, activation (CD40, CD86, CD209 expression), and tolerogenic profile (intracellular indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase [IDO1] and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 [CTLA-4] expression) were examined in the baseline peripheral blood by multicolor flow-cytometry. Soluble CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) levels in plasma were measured. Results DC subsets were decreased in RA compared to healthy controls (HC), and the frequency of conventional DCs (cDC) inversely correlated with inflammatory markers and improvement in disease activity. CD141+ cDC1s were the major IDO1-expressing cells. IDO1+cDC1s were reduced in RA patients compared to HC. The baseline frequency of IDO1+cDC1s inversely correlated with improvement in disease activity. CTLA-4 expression in CD1c+ cDC2s and monocytes was lower in RA patients compared to HC. Moreover, MTX-responders had a significantly lower frequency of IDO1+cDC1 cells and higher level of sCTLA-4 in the plasma compared to MTX non-responders. There was a strong predictive association of low IDO1+cDC1 cells, low sCTLA-4 and non-response to MTX. Conclusions Our findings reveal altered DC and monocytes immunophenotypes that are associated with RA pathology and treatment response. The frequencies of tolerogenic IDO1+cDC1s and the low level of sCTLA-4 are strongly associated with MTX non-responsiveness and therapeutic outcome. These results suggest that investigation of the association IDO1+cDC1 and sCTLA-4 with response to treatment may be more generalizable to other autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Kirsten Rat Sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) is one of the most frequent oncogenes. However, there are limited treatment options due to its intracellular expression. To address this, we developed a novel bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody targeting HLA-A2/KRAS G12V complex and CD3 (HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE). We examined its specific binding to tumor cells and T cells, as well as its anti-tumor effects in vivo. HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE was expressed in Escherichia coli and its binding affinities to CD3 and HLA-A2/KRAS G12V were measured by flow cytometry, along with T-cell activation. In a xenograft pancreatic tumor model, the HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE's anti-tumor effects were assessed through tumor growth, survival time, and safety. Our results demonstrated specific binding of HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE to tumor cells with an HLA-A2/KRAS G12V mutation and T cells. The HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE also activated T-cells in the presence of tumor cells in vitro. HLA-G12V/CD3 BiTE in vivo testing showed delayed tumor growth without severe toxicity to major organs and prolonged mouse survival. This study highlights the potential of constructing BiTEs recognizing an HLA-peptide complex and providing a novel therapy for cancer treatment targeting the intracellular tumor antigen.">

Autoreactive memory B cells contribute to chronic and progressive courses in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The efficacy of belimumab (BEL), the first approved biologic treatment for SLE and lupus nephritis (LN), is generally attributed to depletion of activated naïve B cells and inhibition of B cell activation. BEL's effect on memory B cells (MBCs) is currently unexplained. We performed an in-depth cellular and transcriptomic analysis of BEL's impact on the blood MBC compartment in patients with SLE.


METHODS
A retrospective meta-analysis was conducted, pooling flow cytometry data from four randomized trials involving 1245 patients with SLE treated with intravenous BEL or placebo. Then, extensive MBC phenotyping was performed using high-sensitivity flow cytometry in patients with mild/moderate SLE and severe SLE/LN treated with subcutaneous BEL. Finally, transcriptomic characterization of surging MBCs was performed by single-cell RNA sequencing.


RESULTS
In BEL-treated patients, a significant increase in circulating MBCs, in a broad range of MBC subsets, was established at week 2, gradually returning to baseline by week 52. The increase was most prominent in patients with higher SLE disease activity, serologically active patients, and patients aged ≤18 years. MBCs had a non-proliferating phenotype with a prominent decrease in activation status and downregulation of numerous migration genes.


CONCLUSION
Upon BEL initiation, an increase of MBCs was firmly established. In the small cohort investigated, circulating MBCs were de-activated, non-proliferative, and demonstrated characteristics of disrupted lymphocyte trafficking, expanding on our understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of B cell-activating factor inhibition by BEL.

To report safety and efficacy of CD19-targeting CAR T cells in a child with refractory juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We describe the case of a 12-year-old Caucasian boy with severe, chronically active JDM, refractory to multiple immunosuppressive treatment lines, including B-cell depletion with rituximab. The patient received a single infusion of fresh, autologous, second-generation anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product (lentiviral vector) manufactured on the Prodigy device (1x106 CAR T cells/kg), after lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide (1000 mg/m2 over 2 days) and fludarabine (90 mg/m2 over 3 days). Immunosuppressive and glucocorticoid treatment were withdrawn before leukapheresis and CAR T-cell infusion.


RESULTS
Before anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, the patient had persistent severe skin and muscular disease activity. CAR T cells expanded significantly (peak at day 7, 32.69 cells/μL). Complete B-cell depletion was documented on day 5 in blood and at week 2 in bone marrow. The patient presented fever as part of mild cytokine release syndrome (G1), transient anemia (G2) and neutropenia (G4). Neither infection nor neurotoxicity were observed. Laboratory tests, MRI imaging, Physician's Global Assessment of disease activity (PGA), Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) and Cutaneous Assessment Tool for myositis (CAT) were performed at baseline and follow-up to assess treatment response, showing remarkable progressive improvement that persists over time, even after B-cell recovery.


CONCLUSIONS
This JDM patient with severe chronic disease, refractory to multiple treatments, achieved sustained B-cell depletion and ongoing immunosuppressive drug-free clinical and radiological improvement eight months after a single infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells.">

        <tr id="e19527 Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy caused by the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant plasma cells. Bispecific T Cell engagers (BiTEs) are a novel class of drugs currently assessed in the setting of relapsed/refractory MM. BiTEs are designed to target specific antigenic epitopes on the surface of plasma cells and CD3 on T cells. The plasma cell targets include B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), G protein coupled receptor, class C, group 5, member D (GPRC5D) and Fc receptor homolog 5 (FcRH5). Methods: We conducted a comprehensive review of the available literature including abstracts and full publications using PubMed/Scopus through Dec 31, 2023. We found 23 studies which include BCMA agents: teclistamab (Tec), elranatamab, linvoseltamab, pavurutamab, and alnuctamab; and non-BCMA targets including: GPRC5D, talquetamab (Tal) and FcRH5, cevostamab, as well as combination therapies including a BiTE, specifically Tec+Tal and Tal+daratumumab (Tal+D). A pooled analysis based on the Welch's test was then performed on all BiTEs to compare the safety profile of each agent. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was also applied to cluster 23 BiTEs based on their AEs. Results: We found a cohort of 1899 patients with MM across 23 studies. 1094 individuals underwent treatment involving BCMAs. 677 were subjected to non-BCMA anti-agents. 65 participants received Tec + Tal and 63 patients received Tal+D. The median follow-up duration for both BCMA BiTE and non-BCMA BiTE groups extended to 9 and 14 months. When analyzing hematological AEs of any grade, neutropenia and anemia affected 44% of patients and lymphopenia 40%. Respiratory infections manifested in 44%. CRS (Cytokine Release Syndrome) was reported in 64%. Dysgeusia was reported in only non-BCMA at 53%. Grade 3+ AEs were as follows: neutropenia at 40%, infections at 18%, CRS at 2%, anemia at 28%, and lymphopenia at 45%. Upon conducting a comprehensive pooled analysis, subtle disparities emerged between BCMA and non-BCMA BiTEs. More instances of CRS and CRS with Tocilizumab occurred with BCMA BiTEs vs non-BCMA BiTes, P < 0.024. Friedman's findings emphasized substantial distinctions between BCMA and non-BCMA agents for both overall and severe G3+ AEs (p < 0.0001). t-SNE was applied to examine the clustering patterns among agents across all grades and grades 3+ AEs. The findings revealed that agents with all grades and grades 3+ showed similar clustering patterns except for one agent. Conclusions: The use of BiTEs in MM has demonstrated remarkable efficacy; however, these have been linked to a unique AE profile. Our results showed that non-BCMA were associated with less hematotoxicity (combined G3+ AEs and hypogammaglobulinemia), whereas BCMA BiTEs were associated with less CRS rates. This is important information for treatment selection and mitigation strategy development aiming to optimize patient outcomes.">

B cell depletion therapy with rituximab is effective in most patients with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) but requires repeated cycles to prevent disease flares. We here aimed to assess B cells after rituximab to predict relapse of IgG4-RD and guide retreatment.


METHODS
Patients with active IgG4-RD included in this retrospective study fulfilled the ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria. Total CD19+ B cells, plasmablasts, naïve and memory B cells were measured on peripheral blood by flow-cytometry at baseline and six months after rituximab. All patients were treated with two 1 g infusions of rituximab 15 days apart and monitored for 48 months. Disease response was assessed using the IgG4-RD Responder Index.


RESULTS
Thirty-three patients were included. Six months after rituximab, disease response was observed in all patients. Complete depletion of CD19+ B cells, plasmablasts, naïve and memory B cell depletion was achieved in 30%, 55%, 39%, and 42% of cases, respectively. Twenty-three relapses (70%) were observed at a median time of 24 months after rituximab. Relapse rate was significantly higher in patients who failed to achieve complete depletion of CD19+ cells (60% vs 17%, p= 0.02), naïve B cells (54% vs 15%, p= 0.01), or memory B cells (50% vs 16%, p= 0.03) six months after rituximab. The median relapse free survival time was shorter in patients who failed to achieve complete depletion of CD19+ cells (19 vs 38 months, p= 0.02), naïve B cells (16 vs 38 months, p= 0.01), or memory B cells (19 vs 38 months, p= 0.03) six months after rituximab.


CONCLUSIONS
The degree of B cell depletion six months after rituximab may predict disease flare and may instruct on the pacing of B cell depletion therapy in IgG4-RD.">

        <tr id="7040 Background: CN201 is a novel CD19-targeting T-cell-engager IgG4 bispecific antibody, designed to reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) while retaining potent T-cell mediated cytotoxicities. A silenced Fc fragment was used to prevent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity while prolonging half-life of the molecule. Here, we report results of the phase I study of CN201 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma (R/R B-NHL) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06189391). Methods: The i3+3 dose-escalation design was used in adult patients with CD19+ R/R B-NHL to investigate safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and preliminary anti-tumor activity. Patients with R/R DLBCL who failed≧2 prior lines of therapy, or R/R indolent NHL(iNHL) who had at least 1 prior systemic therapy were eligible for enrollment. Patients received CAR-T therapy can be enrolled after 90 days washout periord provided that CD19 was still positive on tumor cells. Response were evaluated according to the Lugano 2014 criteria. Single-agent CN201 was administered intravenously once per week. Intial dose escalation was conducted in the patients at fixed ascending doses; later, a step-up dosing regimen was adopted, including a priming dose on cycle 1 Day 1 followed by an intermediate dose on Day 8 and the target dose administered on Day 15 and thereafter. Results: As of December 29, 2023, 58 adult patients received CN201, including 19 patients with fixed doses from 2.5μg to 600μg, 39 patients with step-up doses from 1.2mg to 40mg of the target doses. Maximum tolerated dose has not been reached. The most common treatment-related adverse effects (AEs) (≥20%) of any grade were white blood cell decreased (32%), neutropenia (30%), lymphopenia (29%), anemia (29%), pyrexia (25%) and platelet decreased (23%). The most common AEs (≥10%) of grade 3 or higher were lymphopenia (24%) and neutropenia (14%). CRS occurred in 4 (7%) patients, mainly occurred following the first dose. All of those CRS were low-grade, no ≥Grade 3. No immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was observed. In patients with fixed doses up to 600 μg and target dose up to 2.5mg, stable diseases (SD) were observed. The best overall responses dramatically improved in patients received full doses ≥ 5mg, ranging from 5 mg to 40 mg investigated so far. Among 22 evaluable patients with full doses ≥ 5mg, the objective response rate (ORR) was 77% and the complete remission (CR) rate was 22%. Among 11 patients with indolent B-NHL, the ORR was 91%, CR rate was 45.5%, including one patient had failed previous CAR-T therapy. The responses at higher doses are still under evaluation, and additional data will be reported. Conclusions: CN201 has a well tolerable safety profile and promising anti-tumor activity in patients with R/R B-NHL. Clinical trial information: NCT06189391 .">

        <tr id="B cells have a pivotal function in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In autoimmune disease, B cells orchestrate antigen presentation, cytokine production and autoantibody production, the latter via their differentiation into antibody-secreting plasmablasts and plasma cells. This article addresses the current therapeutic strategies to deplete B cells in order to ameliorate or potentially even cure autoimmune disease. It addresses the main target antigens in the B-cell lineage that are used for therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, it summarises the current evidence for successful treatment of autoimmune disease with monoclonal antibodies targeting B cells and the limitations and challenges of these approaches. Finally, the concept of deep B-cell depletion and immunological reset by chimeric antigen receptor T cells is discussed, as well as the lessons from this approach for better understanding the role of B cells in autoimmune disease.">

        <tr id="6505 Background: Patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) still need more and better treatment options. CN201 is a novel CD19-targeting T-cell-engaging IgG4 bispecific antibody. This phase I study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CN201 in B-ALL (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05579132). The data from the dose escalation and expansion of the ongoing study is presented. Methods: The study is enrolling patients with B-ALL who are refractory to primary induction therapy or to salvage therapy, or relapse. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive after two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were eligible. Single-agent CN201 was administered intravenously once per week with a step-up dose approach during cycle 1, a priming dose on Day 1 followed by an intermediate dose on Day 8 and the target dose administered on Day 15 and thereafter. The patients will receive 2 cycles of CN201 for induction. Responders will continue to receive a further 3 cycles for consolidation, and up to an additional 7 cycles for maintenance treatment or until PD or unacceptable toxicity. Results: As of January 31, 2024, 42 adult patients received CN201 with full dose from 600 μg to 40mg. 37 patients were evaluable for efficacy (Table1). Maximum tolerated dose has not reached. The most common adverse events (≥20%) of grade 3 or higher were leukopenia (47.6%), lymphopenia (42.9%), neutropenia (38%), thrombopenia (33.3%) , anaemia (26.2%). 6 patients (14.3%) had infections of grade 3 or higher. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 13 (30.9%) patients, mainly occurred following the first dose, most were low-grade, except for one patient with grade 3. No immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was observed. Overall, 11 (30%) of 37 patients had complete remission (CR), 1 (2.7%) patient had complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi), 75% of responders had MRD negativity. The CR rate significantly increased with dose descalation, reached 50% (4 of 8 patients) with 10mg target dose, two of those occurred within the first two weeks following CN201 treatment. Among those responders, 100% were MRD negative. The CR rate in patients with higher dose levels are under investigation. Conclusions: Preliminary data show CN201 has a well tolerable safety profile and promising activity in adult patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. Clinical trial information: NCT05579132 .

        <tr id="The potential of the immune system to eradicate leukemic cells has been consistently demonstrated by the Graft vs. Leukemia effect occurring after allo-HSCT and in the context of donor leukocyte infusions. Various immunotherapeutic approaches, ranging from the use of antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates, bispecific T-cell engagers, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, and therapeutic infusions of NK cells, are thus currently being tested with promising, yet conflicting, results. This review will concentrate on various types of immunotherapies in preclinical and clinical development, from the point of view of a clinical hematologist. The most promising therapies for clinical translation are the use of bispecific T-cell engagers and CAR-T cells aimed at lineage-restricted antigens, where overall responses (ORR) ranging from 20 to 40% can be achieved in a small series of heavily pretreated patients affected by refractory or relapsing leukemia. Toxicity consists mainly in the occurrence of cytokine-release syndrome, which is mostly manageable with step-up dosing, the early use of cytokine-blocking agents and corticosteroids, and myelosuppression. Various cytokine-enhanced natural killer products are also being tested, mainly as allogeneic off-the-shelf therapies, with a good tolerability profile and promising results (ORR: 20–37.5% in small trials). The in vivo activation of T lymphocytes and NK cells via the inhibition of their immune checkpoints also yielded interesting, yet limited, results (ORR: 33–59%) but with an increased risk of severe Graft vs. Host disease in transplanted patients. Therefore, there are still several hurdles to overcome before the widespread clinical use of these novel compounds.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Novel T-cell immunotherapies such as bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are emerging as promising therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer. BiTEs are engineered bispecific antibodies containing two distinct binding domains that allow for concurrent binding to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) as well as immune effector cells, thus promoting an immune response against cancer cells. Prostate cancer is rich in tumor associated antigens such as, but not limited to, PSMA, PSCA, hK2, and STEAP1 and there is strong biologic rationale for employment of T-cell redirecting BiTEs within the prostate cancer disease space. Early generation BiTE constructs employed in clinical study have demonstrated meaningful antitumor activity, but challenges related to drug delivery, immunogenicity, and treatment-associated adverse effects limited their success. The ongoing development of novel BiTE constructs continues to address these barriers and to yield promising results in terms of efficacy and safety. This review will highlight some of most recent developments of BiTE therapies for patients with advanced prostate cancer and the evolving data surrounding BiTE constructs undergoing clinical evaluation.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a type of autoimmune disease that results in immune disorder and excessive inflammatory response due to a reduction of self-tolerance. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells can effectively alleviate clinical symptoms and hyper-inflammation in RA, but their mechanism of action is not well-defined. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of iNKT cell therapy for RA. 
We established a DBA/1 mouse model for RA and treated it with specific iNKT cells. A cytometric bead array was used to measure the amounts of cytokines in the serum. Flow cytometry was then employed to identify different subsets of helper T cells (Th), the frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDC), the expression of CD80, CD86, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and PD-L2 on cDC surfaces, and associated pathway proteins. 
iNKT cell treatment reduced Th1/Th2 and Th17/ regulatory T (Treg) cell ratios while increasing interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10. It enhanced the generation of immature cDCs, and it upregulated the level of PD-L2 by stimulating the Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Meanwhile, it activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway and inhibited the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. 
According to our findings, iNKT cell treatment increased the expression of phosphates STAT3 in lymph node cDC, causing them to upregulate PD-L2 molecules. While activating the ERK1/2 pathway and inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, tolerogenic cDC was produced, restoring immune homeostasis and correcting excessive inflammation. These results deliver new insights into the treatment of RA by iNKT cells.">

B-cell depletion time after rituximab (RTX) treatment is prolonged in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) compared with other autoimmune diseases. We investigated central and peripheral B-cell development to identify the causes for the defect in B-cell reconstitution after RTX therapy.


METHODS
We recruited 91 patients with AAV and performed deep phenotyping of the peripheral and bone marrow B-cell compartment by spectral flow and mass cytometry. B-cell development was studied by in vitro modelling and the role of BAFF receptor by quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and in vitro assays.


RESULTS
Treatment-naïve patients with AAV showed low transitional B-cell numbers, suggesting impaired B-lymphopoiesis. We analysed bone marrow of treatment-naïve and RTX-treated patients with AAV and found reduced B-lymphoid precursors. In vitro modelling of B-lymphopoiesis from AAV haematopoietic stem cells showed intact, but slower and reduced immature B-cell development. In a subgroup of patients, after RTX treatment, the presence of transitional B cells did not translate in replenishment of naïve B cells, suggesting an impairment in peripheral B-cell maturation. We found low BAFF-receptor expression on B cells of RTX-treated patients with AAV, resulting in reduced survival in response to BAFF in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
Prolonged depletion of B cells in patients with AAV after RTX therapy indicates a B-cell defect that is unmasked by RTX treatment. Our data indicate that impaired bone marrow B-lymphopoiesis results in a delayed recovery of peripheral B cells that may be further aggravated by a survival defect of B cells. Our findings contribute to the understanding of AAV pathogenesis and may have clinical implications regarding RTX retreatment schedules and immunomonitoring after RTX therapy.">

        <tr id="This article endeavors to navigate the clinical journey of bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), from elucidating common toxicities and management strategies to examining novel agents and broadening access in community health care. These drugs, commonly through T-cell activation, result in shared adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Variations in target antigens and designs, however, might introduce unique toxicities for different BsAbs, warranting specific management approaches. Recent US Food and Drug Administration approvals of BsAbs targeting CD3+ T cells linked to CD20 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and to B-cell maturation antigen or GPRC5D for multiple myeloma have transformed the treatment landscape for hematologic malignancies. Emerging new agents promise further enhancement and safety, exploring novel antigen targets, innovative structures such as trispecific antibodies, and the engagement of diverse immune cells. Simultaneously, the expansion of BsAbs into community practices is underway, demanding a multifaceted strategy that encompasses educational initiatives, operational adaptations, and collaborative frameworks. This ensures comprehensive treatment access, allowing every patient, irrespective of geographical or socioeconomic status, to benefit from these advancements in cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="CAR-T cell (Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of various hematologic malignances. CD19 targeted CAR-T cell therapy is coming in a big way in rheumatic diseases. Recent case reports and case series have shown encouraging results in diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis and antisynthetase syndrome which have been refractory to multiple existing therapies. The dramatic response encompasses objective improvement across multiple clinical domains as well as seroconversion. Side effects of concern with CAR-T cell therapy are related to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). The reported side effects of this therapy for autoimmune diseases were of low grade and were managed without any fatality. Several modifications in CAR-T cell therapy have been proposed to maximize the safety and improving the efficacy. This therapy has got the potential to be a major breakthrough in management of rheumatic diseases, especially wherein existing therapies have been refractory.">

        <tr id="Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are artificially engineered antibodies that can bind simultaneously to the CD3 subunit within the T-cell receptor complex and an antigen on tumor cells, leading to T-cell activation and tumor cell killing. BsAbs against BCMA or GPRC5D have shown impressive clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), with some agents having already received regulatory approval after the third (by the European Medicines Agency, EMA) or fourth (by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA) line of therapy; the results of early-phase clinical trials targeting FcRH5 are also promising. Overall, BsAbs as monotherapy correlated with an ORR that exceeded 60%, with a high CR rate ranging between 25% and 50% and a median PFS of around 1 year among patients with a median of 4–6 prior lines of therapy. The main toxicities include cytokine release syndrome, cytopenias, hypogammaglobulinemia, and infections; on-target off-tumor adverse events involving the skin, mucosa, hair, and nails may also occur with anti-GPRC5D BsAbs. Active research to increase their efficacy and improve their tolerance is still in progress, including combination therapies and application in earlier treatment lines and the development of novel agents. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance is a challenge and could lead to more personalized approaches.">

        <tr id="TPS2687 Background: CF33-CD19 is a novel chimeric vaccinia virus that selectively replicates in tumor cells and can provoke anti-tumor immunity. CF33-CD19 expresses a truncated and non-signaling CD19 protein on the surface of infected tumor cells before virus-mediated tumor lysis, labeling them for CD19-targeted therapies. Preclinical studies with CF33-CD19 have shown that combination therapy with CD19 targeting chimeric antigen receptor T cells is more effective than either monotherapy in murine xenograft and syngeneic models [1]. Likewise, combination therapy with bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE)s that bind CD3-positive T cells and infected solid tumor cells that express de novo CD19, showed pronounced recruitment of T cells to the tumor microenvironment, resulting in tumor growth inhibition in mouse models. CD19xCD3 targeting BiTEs such as blinatumomab may offer an off-the-shelf alternative to adoptive cell therapies. This phase I study, called OASIS, dose escalates CF33-CD19 administered intravenously (IV) or intratumorally (IT) combined with blinatumomab in adults with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Methods: The OASIS study (NCT06063317) is enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy. Patients who have received prior treatment with a poxvirus based oncolytic virus or a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager are excluded. A safety run-in will evaluate the safety of CF33-CD19 monotherapy administered IT or IV before initiating the combination therapy regimen. Combination therapy will be administered in 28-day cycles with CF33-CD19 on days 1 and 15. Following viral transduction to promote de novo CD19 expression, blinatumomab is given on days 2-9 and 16-23 via a 7-day continuous infusion. Patients > 45 kg will receive 9 mcg of blinatumomab during the first week of cycle 1, then 28 mcg during the third week of cycle 1 and subsequent cycles. The study consists of two parts. Part 1 follows a 3+3 dose escalation scheme independently of each route of CF33-CD19 administration (IT and IV) with dose levels of CF33-CD19 ranging from 1.0x107 to 3.0x109 PFU. Part 2 is a cohort expansion in select indications at the optimal dose. The co-primary endpoints are safety and identification of the recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST. Enrollment began in October 2023. 1. Park et al.

        <tr id="Applying advanced molecular profiling together with highly specific targeted therapies offers the possibility to better dissect the mechanisms underlying immune mediated inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans. Here we apply a combination of single cell RNA sequencing and T/B cell repertoire analysis to perform an in-depth characterization of molecular changes in the immune-signature upon CD19 CAR T cell-mediated depletion of B cells in SLE patients. The resulting datasets do not only confirm a selective CAR T cell-mediated reset of the B cell response, but simultaneously reveal consequent changes in the transcriptional signature of monocyte and T cell subsets that respond with a profound reduction in type 1 interferon signaling. Our current data thus provide evidence for a causal relationship between the B cell response and the increased interferon signature observed in SLE and additionally demonstrate the usefulness of combining targeted therapies and novel analytic approaches to decipher molecular mechanisms of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in humans.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
The management of relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) has witnessed dramatic changes in the recent past. Despite the availability of multiple novel immunotherapies in R/R setting, there remains an unmet need for off-the-shelf therapies, particularly in patients with primary refractory, multiply relapsed disease or those experiencing cellular immunotherapy failure. To harness the power of the T-cell mediated immunity, a novel class of drugs called bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) have been developed. These BsAbs are currently under investigation both in frontline and R/R setting and hold the potential to revolutionize the management of LBCL.


AREAS COVERED
This review article summarizes the currently available BsAbs, their mode of action, efficacy, and safety data for untreated and R/R LBCL. In addition, the role of these BsAbs in combination with currently available chemoimmunotherapy regimens is also discussed.


EXPERT OPINION
Two bispecific antibodies have secured FDA approval for R/R LBCL, with expected approval of more BsAbs (including in earlier treatment lines). These drugs provide a highly efficacious and relatively safe treatment option for patients with highly pre-treated disease including relapse after cellular immunotherapies. In addition, these BsAbs provide a platform for chemotherapy-free regimen for older/frail patients.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignant plasma cell diseases, the incidence of which is increasing year by year. The application of immunomodulators drugs, proteasome inhibitors, anti-CD38 antibodies, CAR-T, and HSCT have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with MM, however new therapeutic tools need to be developed to improve the prognosis of patients with relapsed/refractory after conventional regimens treatment. Bispecific antibodies are a novel immunotherapeutic approach that generates immune synapses by binding to targets on malignant plasma cells and cytotoxic immune effector cells (T cells/natural killer cells), leading to T/NK cells activation and malignant plasma cell lysis. Several preclinical and phase I clinical studies have shown good efficacy, bringing new possibilities for patients with relapsed/refractory MM to improve their prognosis in the future in combination with the rest of the treatment options.

        <tr id="e14509 Background: B7-H3 (CD276) is a transmembrane protein highly expressed in solid tumors but with limited expression in normal tissues. Its presence is strongly associated with the inhibition of T-cell activity, cancer progression, and invasion. Furthermore, B7-H3 is strongly associated with poor prognosis and reduced patient survival. Given its crucial role in tumor biology, B7-H3 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for drug development. We utilized ExMab heterodimer platform and common light chain technology to develop EX105, a next-generation B7-H3×CD3 bispecific antibody. This innovative T-cell engager exhibits excellent anti-tumor activity in mouse models and good safety profile in NHP tox study. Methods: EX105 was generated using ExMab heterodimer platform and common light chain technology to form a heterodimeric IgG1 structure. Preclinical pharmacology studies, efficacy, and safety were evaluated. Anti-tumor activity study of EX105 includes in vitro T-cell cytotoxicity assays and in vivo PBMC reconstituted xenograft mice models. Preclinical safety evaluation of EX105 was performed through GLP single-dose and repeat-dose tox studies in non-human primates (NHPs). Results: Based on ELISA and FACS analyses, EX105 can bind to both human and cynomolgus monkey B7-H3 and CD3 antigens. Furthermore, SPR data suggest that EX105 exhibits a high affinity to B7-H3 and a much lower affinity to CD3. In consistent with that, EX105 only induced relatively low cytokine release. Nevertheless, EX105 showed a potent in vitro T cell cytotoxicity against B7-H3+ tumor cell lines. The in vivo anti-tumor activity of EX105 was further determined in several tumor xenograft models. Treatment with EX105 resulted in remarkable tumor regression in both “hot” tumor model and “cold” tumor model, indicating its effectiveness across a range of tumor types. Tox study in NHPs showed minimal adverse effects and no liver impairment after EX105 administration, even at high doses. The cytokine release data observed in this study suggests a good safety profile of EX105, with much lower cytokine release compared to other T cell engagers. Conclusions: These findings collectively indicate that EX105 has the potential to become a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various B7-H3 positive cancers. The first-in-human clinical trial for patients with advanced B7-H3 positive cancers is due to start.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) presents a significant global health burden, with disparities in incidence and outcomes reflecting challenges in recognition and treatment. Talquetamab, a bispecific CD3 T-cell engager targeting G-protein coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D), has emerged as a promising immunotherapy for relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM). In August 2023, talquetamab received accelerated approval from the US FDA for RRMM treatment, followed by conditional marketing authorization from the EMA. Clinical trials demonstrated talquetamab's efficacy, with overall response rates (ORR) of 69% and 76% in heavily pretreated RRMM patients. The phase I monumenTAL-1 trial showcased talquetamab's effectiveness, particularly in high-risk MM and extramedullary disease, with ORRs around 71-74%. Subsequent phase 2 results reaffirmed its efficacy, even in patients with prior T-cell redirection therapies. Combination therapy with daratumumab further enhanced talquetamab's efficacy, addressing concerns of T cell exhaustion. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed sustained responses and manageable adverse events with subcutaneous administration, facilitating convenient dosing regimens. However, talquetamab carries risks of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity, necessitating close monitoring and prompt management. Common adverse events included fever, CRS, musculoskeletal pain, and infections, although severe events were infrequent. Vigilant management strategies, including prophylactic measures and supportive care, mitigate these risks. In conclusion, talquetamab represents a significant advancement in RRMM treatment, offering a promising avenue for T-cell redirection therapy. Ongoing research aims to optimize treatment sequencing and combination strategies, fostering improved outcomes for MM patients. Continued investigation will refine the strategic integration of talquetamab and other immunotherapies, paving the way for enhanced treatment efficacy and patient care in RRMM.">

        <tr id="Pediatric autoimmune hepatitis has an incidence of 0.23/100.000 children in North America, with a bleak prognosis if left untreated. Steroids are the therapy of choice but are not always effective. B cell depletion is a safe and effective therapy that allows for a steroid‐sparing protocol, especially in patients who do not tolerate side effects.We retrospectively reviewed rituximab‐treated patients between 2017 and 2022. Demographics, previous treatments, reasons for B cell depletion, response, and adverse effects were noted.Six patients with a mean age of 10.2 years were included. All patients had comorbidities that rendered treatment with steroids unsuccessful or undesirable. Rituximab was started at a mean follow‐up of 8 months. After 6 months, the mean alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels decreased from 575 IU/L and 342 IU/L, respectively, to 28 IU/L (p = 0.02) and 36 IU/L (p = 0.008), respectively. Mean γGT decreased from 105 to 25 IU/L (p = 0.01). Immunoglobulin G levels were normalized in all patients (p = 0.01). No severe adverse events were observed. One patient had persistent hypogammaglobulinemia, and another had lymphopenia.B‐cell depletion is an effective and safe treatment for autoimmune liver diseases and should be included as an option, particularly for relapsing patients in whom steroids are undesirable or have shown nonadherence.">

Bi-specific T cell engagers (BiTEs) are a promising class of novel immunotherapies with demonstrated success in haematological malignancies and melanoma.

These trials have been hampered by high rates of treatment related adverse events, minimal or transient anti-tumour efficacy and generation of high titres of anti-drug antibodies. This paper aims to analyse the challenges faced by the different BiTE therapy constructs and the mCRPC tumour microenvironment that result in therapeutic resistance and identify possible strategies to overcome these issues.">

        <tr id="6534 Background: CD19-targeted therapies have shown remarkable efficacy in patients with B-cell malignancies. However, relapse with CD19 loss as a mechanism of tumor escape is common and represents a serious challenge. Patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior CD19-directed therapy have limited salvage options and a very poor prognosis. The B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) is functionally expressed in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), including in patients with CD19-negative relapse (Qin et al., Sci Transl Med. 2019). As a critical regulator of B-cell function and survival, BAFF-R may be less prone to downregulation by tumors as a mechanism of antigen escape. Methods: We are conducting two phase 1 clinical trials of BAFFR-CAR T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-ALL (NCT04690595) and NHL (NCT05370430). Primary endpoints are dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and all other toxicities. Secondary endpoints include response rate, minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate, PFS and OS. Response is evaluated using European LeukemiaNet criteria for B-ALL and Lugano 2014 for NHL. Results: As of Feb. 1st, 2024, 1 B-ALL and 3 NHL patients have completed treatment and post-treatment evaluations. Each received 50M BAFFR CAR T cells (starting dose level in both trials). The B-ALL patient had CD19/CD20/CD22-negative disease, and had received prior blinatumomab. NHL patients #1 and #2 both had CD19-expressing mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and had received prior CD19 CAR T cells. Patient #2 had also received a CD3/CD20 bispecific antibody. NHL patient #3 had CD19/CD20-negative T cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRBCL) and had not received prior CD19 CAR T cells. There were no DLTs, all patients had Gr. 1 cytokine release syndrome, and 2/3 NHL patients had Gr. 1 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Robust CAR T cell expansion was seen in all patients with a peak on days 12-14 post-infusion. The B-ALL and the 2 MCL patients reached MRD-negative complete response (CR) at 1 month post-treatment. The THRBCL patient had partial response (PR) at 1 month that converted to CR at 3 months. The B-ALL patient successfully transitioned to allogeneic HCT while in CR at 3 months post-infusion. Responses are ongoing in all NHL patients at 14, 10, and 8 months for patients #1, #2 and #3, respectively. Additional patients have been enrolled at the next dose level (200M CAR T cells). Results for these patients will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: With a 100% CR rate at 3 months in the first 4 patients and durable responses at dose level 1, BAFFR-CAR T cells are a promising therapeutic option for patients with r/r B-cell malignancies who are ineligible or failed prior CD19-targeted therapy, including with CD19 antigen loss.

        <tr id="Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive malignancy that has historically been associated with a very poor prognosis. Despite large co-operative international trials and incremental increases in intensity of therapy, there has been no significant improvement in outcome over the last 3 decades. Using representative cases, we highlight the key differences between KMT2A-rearranged and KMT2A-germline infant ALL, and how advances in molecular diagnostics are unpicking KMT2A-germline genetics and guiding treatment reduction. We focus on KM2TA-rearranged infant B-cell ALL where the last few years have seen the emergence of novel therapies which both are more effective and less toxic than conventional chemotherapy. Of these, there is promising early data on the efficacy and tolerability of the bi-specific T-cell engager monoclonal antibody, blinatumomab, as well as the use of autologous and allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. We discuss how we can improve risk stratification and incorporate these new agents to replace the most toxic elements of currently deployed intensive chemotherapy schedules with their associated unacceptable toxicity.">

        <tr id="Objectives Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) maintains peripheral immune tolerance by preventing T cell continuous activation. Aiming to understand the extent of PD-1 expression in inflammatory arthritis beyond its involvement with T cells, we assess its presence on various circulating single cells. Methods Mass cytometry analysis of patients with active seropositive/seronegative rheumatoid (RA; n=9/8) and psoriatic (PsA; n=9) arthritis versus healthy controls (HC; n=13), re-evaluating patients after 3 months of anti-rheumatic treatment. Results PD-1 was expressed in all leukocyte subpopulations, with the highest PD-1+ cell frequencies in eosinophils (59-73%) and T cells (50–60%), and the lowest in natural-killer cells (1–3%). PD-1+ cell frequencies and PD-1 median expression were comparable between patient subgroups and HC, in the majority of cell subsets. Exceptions included increases in certain T cell/B cell subsets of seropositive RA and specific monocyte subsets and dendritic cells of PsA; an expanded PD-1+CD4+CD45RA+CD27+CD28+ T subset, denoting exhausted T cells, was common across patient subgroups. Strikingly, significant inverse correlations between individual biomarkers of systemic inflammation (ESR and/or serum CRP) and PD-1+ cell frequencies and/or median expression were evident in several innate and adaptive immunity cell subsets of RA and PsA patients. Furthermore, all inverse correlations noted in individuals with active arthritis were no longer discernible in those who attained remission/low disease activity post-treatment. Conclusion PD-1 expression may be insufficient, relative to the magnitude of the concomitant systemic inflammatory response on distinct leukocyte subsets, varying between RA and PsA. Our results point to the potential therapeutic benefits of pharmacological PD-1 activation, to rebalance the autoimmune response and reduce inflammation.">

        <tr id="Objectives This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BCMA-CD19 compound chimeric antigen receptor T cells (cCAR) to dual reset the humoral and B cell immune system in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with lupus nephritis (LN). Methods This is a single-arm open-label multicentre phase 1 study of BCMA and CD19-directed cCAR in patients suffering from SLE/LN with autoantibodies produced by B cells and plasma/long-lived plasma cells. In this clinical trial, we sequentially assigned biopsy-confirmed (classes III–V) LN patients to receive 3×106 cCAR cells/kg postcessation of all SLE medications and conditioning. The primary endpoint of safety and toxicity was assessed. Complete immune reset was indicated by B cell receptor (BCR) deep sequencing and flow cytometry analysis. Patient 11 (P11) had insufficient lymphocyte counts and was underdosed as compassionate use. Results P1 and P2 achieved symptom and medication-free remission (MFR) from SLE and complete remission from lymphoma. P3–P13 (excluding P11) received an initial dose of 3×106 cCAR cells /kg and were negative for all autoantibodies, including those derived from long-lived plasma cells, 3 months post-cCAR and the complement returned to normal levels. These patients achieved symptom and MFR with post-cCAR follow-up to 46 months. Complete recovery of B cells was seen in 2–6 months post-cCAR. Mean SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 reduced from 10.6 (baseline) to 2.7 (3 months), and renal function significantly improved in 10 LN patients ≤90 days post-cCAR. cCAR T therapy was well tolerant with mild cytokine-release syndrome. Conclusions Data suggest that cCAR therapy was safe and effective in inducing MFR and depleting disease-causing autoantibodies in patients with SLE.">

        <tr id="TPS2672 Background: LAVA-1207 is a humanized bispecific antibody that binds with high affinity to the Vδ2 chain of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells and to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). It comprises a heterodimer of two fusion proteins, each consisting of a VHH linked to a human IgG1 Fc domain. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that, upon binding both targets, LAVA-1207 leads to potent Vγ9Vδ2-T cell degranulation and cytolytic activity against PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells. IL-2 is an immune modulator which has been shown to support expansion of activated Vγ9Vδ2-T cells. PD-1 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor that can dampen (Vγ9Vδ2-) T cell reactivity, suggesting that pembrolizumab could potentiate the effect of LAVA-1207. Methods: This trial is a phase 1/2a open label study with a 3+3 design in patients with refractory mCRPC to assess the safety of LAVA-1207 alone or with low dose IL-2 or with pembrolizumab, and to determine the recommended Phase 2a dose (RP2D). Secondary objectives include evaluation of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity. Exploratory endpoints include evaluation of the effect of study treatment on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). LAVA-1207 is administered IV every two weeks. Two parallel cohorts assessing LAVA-1207 with low dose subcutaneous IL-2 have been implemented: (1) single IL-2 administration and (2) three IL-2 administrations on consecutive days per cycle for up to four cycles. An additional dose escalation arm evaluates LAVA-1207 in combination with pembrolizumab, 400mg Q6W, IV. Patients with mCRPC that have failed at least one prior AR therapy and taxane-based chemotherapy (unless deemed medically unsuitable to receive a taxane) will be enrolled on the study. Patients should have progressive disease either by PSA or by RECIST 1.1 or appearance of 2 or more bone metastases. Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0-1. PSMA-PET is performed at baseline. Paired biopsies are requested to further assess LAVA-1207 activity. Dose escalation is ongoing. Expansion arm(s) will be included based on available data from part 1 of the study and may include one or more of LAVA-1207, LAVA-1207 with low dose IL-2, or LAVA-1207 in combination with pembrolizumab.

        <tr id="7030 Background: The therapeutic landscape for relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is evolving to include targeted T-cell based immunotherapies, including CD19-targeted CAR-T and CD3xCD20 T-cell engaging (TCE) bispecific antibodies. Yet, there remains an unmet medical need for patients who are refractory to, or ineligible for these treatments. Leveraging natural killer (NK) cells emerges as a promising strategy in hematological malignancies, as shown in a Phase 1 study with IPH6101/SAR’579 in R/R AML (Stein, ASCO 2023; Bajel, ASH 2023). Methods: We developed IPH6501, a tetraspecific antibody-based NK cell engager that simultaneously targets on NK cells the CD16a and NKp46 receptors, the IL-2 receptor with an engineered IL-2 variant (IL2v) and on B-NHL cells the CD20 antigen. This approach boosts NK cell activation and proliferation, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, and cytokine production. The IL-2 variant is designed with mutations that prevent binding to CD25 (IL-2Rα), limiting Treg activation and potential IL-2-related side effects. IPH6501 has been evaluated in mouse, non-human primate, and human-derived models, including cells from R/R B-NHL patients. Results: In vivo studies in non-human primates and tumor mouse models revealed that IPH6501, at well-tolerated doses, significantly boosted peripheral NK cell proliferation, drove their accumulation at tumor locations, and effectively eradicated CD20+ cells in blood and tissues. In human derived-models, IPH6501 significantly induced NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Notably, IPH6501 showed potent activity against a range of B-NHL cell lines, including those with low CD20 expression. In addition, IPH6501 upregulated the expression of activating receptors on NK cells, such as NKG2D, essential for the recognition and killing of malignant cells, thereby introducing another mode of action enabling the elimination of CD20-negative tumor cells. In a comparative analysis with a CD3xCD20 TCE, IPH6501 induced lower cytokine secretion, suggesting a potentially safer profile. Additionally, IPH6501 showed higher killing efficacy compared to the TCE in samples from healthy individuals as well as R/R B-NHL patients, underscoring its therapeutic potential. Conclusions: The preclinical demonstrations of IPH6501 activities across various in vivo models and its effectiveness in ex vivo assays using cells from R/R B-NHL patients provide compelling evidence of its therapeutic potential and tolerability. IPH6501 is emerging as a promising new candidate within the treatment landscape for R/R B-NHL and is currently being investigated in a global, first-in-human phase 1/2 study (NCT 06088654).">

        <tr id="The treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma has improved substantially in the last 5–10 years based on the development and use of several novel classes of drugs and drug combinations. These advances have led to improvements in progression-free and overall survival as well as quality of life. The general tendency has been to advance drugs/combinations that have performed well in advanced disease to the earlier line settings (frontline, first/early relapse). There are several triplet drug combinations that, when used as part of first or early relapse, can provide remission durations of 3 years or longer. More recently, impressive responses have been seen with the use of targeted immunotherapeutics (chimeric antigen receptor T-cells and bispecific antibodies) in heavily pretreated patients with MM. These treatments, however, have been associated with some new and occasionally severe toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and severe infections, including opportunistic infections and profound cytopenias. These potential toxicities bring into question whether these immune-targeting drugs should remain as late-line therapeutics or whether the high single-agent overall response rates mandate that these agents be used in earlier line settings. Herein, the authors provide a point and counterpoint about the future use of these agents.">

        <tr id="7549 Background: While CART and BiTE have led to unprecedented responses in RRMM, some patients (pts) do not respond or have short-lived responses. Currently no predictive markers exist to identify these pts. This study explored pretreatment T-cell fitness and efficacy/toxicity in RRMM using a novel single-cell secretome analysis. We hypothesized that pretreatment Polyfunctional Strength Index (PSI) may predict efficacy to BCMA-directed T-cell therapies. Methods: We included 14 RRMM pts treated with idecabtagene vicleucel or teclistamab at Yale Cancer Center with ≥6 mos post-treatment follow-up. Peripheral blood prior to treatment was frozen and then PBMC’s thawed for analysis. PSI, a metric for T-cell fitness combining polyfunctional T-cells % with the intensity of secreted cytokines, was obtained using the IsoPlexis’ Single-Cell Secretome Platform. The overall PSI was an average of CD4+ and CD8+ PSIs. Response was assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group criteria and response duration was defined as time from response to disease progression. Responder (R) was defined as ≥very good partial response for ≥6 mos. Non-responder (NR) was defined as stable or progressive disease ≤3 mos. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune-effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were graded using the American Society for Transplantation & Cellular Therapy system. Statistics were performed with Mann-Whitney U test using GraphPad PRISM v.9. Results: There were 7 pts in R group (2 BiTE & 5 CART) and 7 pts in NR group (3 BiTE & 4 CART). Median follow-up time was 13.5 mos(range, 7-27). Median age at treatment was 64 yrs in R and 63 yrs in NR. Extramedullary disease (EM) was present in 14.3%(n=1) in R and 71.4%(n=5) in NR. High-risk cytogenetics, defined as del17p, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), 1q gain/amplification and del1p, were seen in 42.9%(n=3) in R and 85.7%(n=6) in NR. Median prior lines of therapy was 6(range, 4-9) in R and 8(range, 4-10) in NR. CRS/ICANS occurred 85.7%(n=6) in R and 28.6%(n=2) in NR. Overall PSI was 184 in R and 91 in NR(p=0.1649). CD4+ PSI was 160 in R and 75 in NR(p=0.1649). CD8+ PSI was 207 in R and 108 in NR(p=0.1981). Overall PSI was 143 in CRS/ICANS and 130 in no CRS/ICANS(p=0.7546). Conclusions: Overall PSI, CD4+ PSI and CD8+ PSI were 1.9-2.1 times higher in R compared to NR and overall PSI was slightly higher in CRS/ICANS compared to no CRS/ICANS though the difference was not statistically significant. One limitation was a small sample size and thus testing PSI in a larger cohort might yield statistically significant results. The NR group had more high-risk cytogenetics and higher EM. One confounder could be that measuring peripheral T-cell fitness may not be sufficient to predict response in EM where spatial determinants of T-cell influx play a role.">

        <tr id="Autoimmunity is a pathological process associated with a violation of immunological tolerance to normal structural components of the body (autoantigens), associated with the predominance of active (adaptive) immunity and manifested by hyperproduction of autoantibodies. Systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs) are among the most common and severe nosological forms of this pathology associated with autoimmunity. Problems of pharmacotherapy of SARDs are the subject of intensive research. At the beginning of the 21st century, more than 20 biologic agents were developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis – monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and recombinant proteins that control inflammation associated with the overproduction of “pro-inflammatory” cytokines, the use of which has dramatically improved the results of pharmacotherapy. However, much less research has been devoted to studying the possibilities of pharmacotherapy aimed at selective suppression of the “autoimmune” component of the pathogenesis of SADRs associated with uncontrolled activation of B cells and restoration of immunological tolerance to autoantigens. In the spectrum of drugs whose mechanism of action is associated with the suppression of pathological activation of B cells, the leading place is occupied by rituximab (RTM). It is noteworthy that 20 years ago (2004), a group of researchers led by prof. J.C. Edwards first demonstrated the effectiveness of RTM in patients with RA, which was soon successfully repositioned to treat a wide range of SARDs. A major achievement in the pharmacotherapy of SARDs is associated with the use of CAR (сhimeric antigen receptor) T cell therapy, developed for the treatment of refractory hematological tumors. The main component of CART-cells is a genetically engineered T-cell receptor that recognizes the target antigen without the participation of the major histocompatibility complex. Although limited, extremely impressive data regarding high remission rates have been obtained by adapting CD19 CART-cell therapy to treat patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other SARDs refractory to standard immunosuppressive medications. The article discusses the results of the use of CART-cell therapy in SLE and other SARDs and prospects for further research.">

        <tr id="The conventional clinical therapies for autoimmune diseases (ADs) lack specificity, necessitating long-term medication that can lead to serious side effects. In contrast, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for ADs, characterized by fewer side effects and longer-lasting therapeutic effects, represents a new direction for the specific treatment of ADs. T cells modified with CAR genes possess the ability to not only secrete perforin, granzymes, and other molecules that target autoreactive immune cells but also to lead effector and regulatory T cells into autoimmune environments, thereby exerting transport, proliferation, and immune regulatory functions. Chimeric autoantibody receptor T cells can recognize and kill autoreactive cells expressing target autoantibodies through their specific antigens. In this article, we comprehensively expound on the application of CAR-T cell therapy in different ADs and summarize the current research progress in this regard. This review aims to enhance the application of CAR-T therapy in AD treatment and facilitate further studies aimed at addressing the existing gaps in CAR-T therapy for ADs.">

        <tr id="Introduction and Objectives: In healthy individuals, activation and expansion of CD8 regulatory T cells (CD8 Treg) leads to selective killing of pathogenic CD4 T cells without broad immunosuppression. In patients with autoimmunity, CD8 Treg appear dysfunctional, allowing pathogenic CD4 T cell expansion and downstream inflammatory events, causing damage to healthy tissues. MTX-101 is a bispecific CD8 Treg modulator targeting CD8 and KIR2DL(1/2/3), co-expressed on CD8 Treg. MTX-101 targets CD8 Treg to restore their function and reduce inflammation without unwanted immune cell activation or global immune suppression. By targeting a root cause of CD4-driven autoimmune diseases, our data suggest that MTX-101 is a promising CD8 Treg-specific therapeutic to restore immune balance for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).
 Methods: We evaluated MTX-101 binding, mechanism of action, and specificity in vitro using human PBMCs and in vivo using a human CD4 T cell-driven GVHD model. Pharmacology and early tolerability were evaluated in humanized CD34+-engrafted NSG(IL-15Tg) mice.
 Results: MTX-101 increased the activation and functions of CD8 Treg without activating other immune cells or affecting global immune responses in vitro, and improved outcomes in the acute GVHD model. In Balb/c and humanized mice, MTX-101 pharmacokinetics were consistent with antibody-like molecules. In humanized mice, MTX-101 bound CD8 Treg in peripheral blood and terminal tissues, with no resulting activation of immune cells. No induction of proinflammatory serum cytokines were observed following MTX-101 dosing at concentrations up to 50 mg/kg.
 Conclusion: MTX-101 restores CD8 Treg functions and may provide durable resistance to autoimmune disease progression.

        <tr id="Antibody-based immune checkpoint blockade therapy has revolutionized the field of cancer immunotherapy, yet its efficacy remains limited in immunologically cold tumors. Combining checkpoint inhibitors with costimulatory agonists improves tumoricidal activity of T cells but also can lead to off-target hepatotoxicity. Although bispecific antibodies confer tumor selectivity to alleviate undesirable adverse effects, toxicity concerns persist with increased dosing. In this issue of Cancer Research, Yuwen and colleagues introduce ATG-101, a tetravalent PD-L1×4-1BB bispecific antibody with high programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) affinity and low 4-1BB affinity, aiming to mitigate hepatotoxicity. ATG-101 demonstrates PD-L1-dependent 4-1BB activation, leading to selective T-cell activation within the tumor microenvironment. ATG-101 exhibits potent antitumor activity, even in large, immunologically cold, and monotherapy-resistant tumor models. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals significant shifts of immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment from protumor to antitumor phenotypes following ATG-101 treatment. In cynomolgus monkeys, no serious cytokine storm and hepatotoxicity are observed after ATG-101 treatment, indicating a broad therapeutic window for ATG-101 in cancer treatment. This study highlights the potential of tetravalent bispecific antibodies in cancer immunotherapy, with implications for various antibody-based treatment modalities across different fields.

        <tr id="2550 Background: Antigen-specific cancer immunotherapies, based on engineered T cells bearing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or the systemic administration of bispecific T cell-engagers (TCEs), have a significant impact on relapsed/refractory (R/R) B cell malignancies. However, a significant percentage of patients relapse following CAR-T or TCE therapy, with antigen loss accounting for up to one third of relapses/progressions. To avoid antigen loss after administration of single-targeted CAR-T cells and to minimize tumor escape, strategies targeting two antigens simultaneously have been developed and validated in both preclinical models and clinical trials. Nevertheless, despite lowering the risk of antigen loss, these strategies still have some limitations, mainly related to design and manufacturing challenges. Methods: In this context, we have generated the first dual-target strategy for hematological malignancies based on T cells bearing an anti-CD22 CAR and secreting an anti-CD19 T-cell engager antibody (CAR-STAb-T cells) and conducted a comprehensive preclinical study comparing its therapeutic potential with a previously validated anti-CD19/CD22 tandem CAR therapy (TanCAR-T) for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Results: We have demonstrated in both short- and long-term assays, using contact and non-contact co-culture systems, that CAR-STAb-T cells efficiently redirect bystander T cells, resulting in enhanced cytotoxic activity compared to that exhibited by TanCAR-T cells at very low E:T ratios. In addition, CAR-STAb-T cells induce more potent and faster cytotoxic responses than TanCAR-T cells in both short- and long-term co-culture assays when reproducing antigen-downmodulated conditions in vitro. In vivo assays conducted in NSG mice transplanted with a B-ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX), followed by intravenous injection of CAR-STAb-T or TanCAR-T cells under a T cell-limiting experimental setting, also showed that CAR-STAb-T cells maintained a tighter control of tumor progression than TanCAR-T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Conclusions: In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the combination of a cell surface CAR and a soluble TCE recognizing different antigens may be advantageous over the use of conventional multi-targeted strategies based on cell surface-anchored receptors. Furthermore, we have proven that a small number of transduced CAR-STAb-T cells is sufficient to redirect non-transduced bystander T cells specifically and efficiently in the presence of leukemia cells, providing a significant advantage over current dual-targeted CAR-T cell therapies. CAR-STAb-T cells could therefore become an alternative to CAR-T therapies for the treatment of R/R B cell malignancies, especially in lymphodepleted patients with low T cell counts.">

        <tr id="6515 Background: Patients with relapsed/refractory T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (r/r T-ALL/LBL) are clinically manifested by rapid disease progression, poor prognosis and lack of therapeutic options. There is an urgent need to develop other effective modalities. Apart from its expression in normal T and NK cells and no expression in other tissue cells, CD7 is highly expressed in T-ALL/LBL cells. Therefore, CD7 is considered a potential target for the development of CAR-T therapy for T-ALL/LBL. The challenge, however, is to avoid fratricide caused by the expression of CD7 in T cells. We developed a CAR-T cell injection based on CD7 nano antibodies, named PA3-17 injection, by blocking the expression of CD7 molecule on the surface of T cells through anti-CD7 protein expression blocker (PEBL) and evaluate the safety, efficacy and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of PA3-17 Injection in patients with r/r T-ALL/LBL in a phase I clinical study. Methods: The clinical study (NCT05170568) adopted a "3+3" dose escalation schema and proceed cohort expansion. T-ALL/LBL patients who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were deployed by entering three dose groups (DL: 0.5×106, 2×106, 4×106 CAR-T/kg) to evaluate the initial safety, efficacy and dose-limited toxicities (DLTs). All patients were treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy pre-treatment before CAR-T cell infusion. The primary endpoints were DLTs and maximum tolerable dose (MTD). Results: As of Nov 28th, 2023, a total of 12 patients were enrolled (3 patients in dose 1, 2, 3 group, 3 patients in RP2D group), all of whom received a single infusion of PA3-17 injection and completed a 28- day DLTs assessment. The median age of enrolled patients was 33.5 years (range 20-64), and 25.0% (3/12) of patients had previously received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No DLTs occurred. The RP2D was 2×106 CAR-T/kg. The safety analysis showed that 83.3% (10/12) of patients developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS), of which 25% (3/12) had grade 3, and no grade 4 CRS occurred, 16.7% (2/12) of patients experienced 1-2 grade of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and no grade 3 or higher ICANS occurred. The efficacy data showed that the best ORR was 83.3% (10/12) and the CR rate was 75% (9/12). The median follow-up time was 213.5 days. Five patients (Pt 1/5/6/7/9) maintained CR for more than 6 months. One patient (Pt6) had a tumor mass with a diameter greater than 7cm at baseline prior CAR-T infusion but achieved CR 28 days after infusion, then she underwent transplantation at sixth month but died at eighth month because of heart problems, which is unrelated with PA3-17 infusion. Conclusions: PA3-17 injection has shown a good safety profile and encouraging efficacy in r/r T-ALL/LBL patients. RP2D has been determined and the key Phase II clinical study is about to begin.

        <tr id="2536 Background: While being efficient in hematological malignancies, bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), like CAR T cells, are not yet established in solid tumors. Moreover, all T cell-mobilizing strategies cause side effects that endanger patients and may limit applicable doses and thus efficacy. We report on the clinical development of CC-1, a PSMAxCD3 bsAb in an IgG-based format that induces fully target cell-restricted T cell activity against prostate cancer (1). Targeting PSMA, which is expressed on both the malignant cells and the neovasculature, improves accessibility of the tumor site for immune effector cells as critical prerequisite for therapeutic success in solid tumors. Methods: A FIH trial evaluating CC-1 included patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC) (NCT04104607) and consisted of two parts: Dose escalation (n=10-66) using a novel intra-individual dose escalation design to rapidly reach the target dose of 826µg to determine safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (2), and Dose expansion, which exposed patients to CC-1 at MTD and explored efficacy to define RP2D (n=14). Currently, subcutaneous (SC) application as different application mode is being evaluated. Based on very favorable safety and preliminary efficacy data, another phase I trial was initiated where CC-1 is evaluated as first line treatment in patients with hormone sensitive biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PC (NCT05646550), where tumor burden is low and accordingly lower side effects and long-lasting efficacy are expected. Results: Recruitment in the FIH trial in mCRPC has been completed. 28 patients completed treatment with the most frequently observed (86%) toxicity being cytokine release syndrome (CRS, max. 2°). Other adverse events (all ≤2°) included hematologic events (93%) as well as elevated liver enzymes (61%), hypertension (18%) and xerostomia (7%). A rapid and profound decline of PSA levels with up to 62% reduction compared to baseline was documented in all but one of the heavily pretreated patients that received the target dose. Twelve patients received multiple treatment cycles. Recruitment of patients to receive SC application of CC-1 is currently ongoing. In the phase I trial in BCR of PC, the first four dose cohorts have so far been completed. CC-1 application was well tolerated in all patients. In all but one of so far treated patients, mild CRS (transiently elevated temperature) that ceased within 24h upon dosing with antipyretics was observed. No other CC-1 related toxicities were observed and recruitment is ongoing. Conclusions: CC-1 is a promising compound with a favourable toxicity profile and promising clinical activity. Details on study designs and updated data from the clinical trials will be presented at the meeting. 1. Zekri et al, EMBO Mol Med, 2020. 2. Labrenz et al, Pharm Stat, 2022.

        <tr id="Blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) are both active in relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and improve outcomes compared with conventional chemotherapy in this setting. Several prospective clinical trials have explored the use of these agents in adults with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL, with promising outcomes observed in younger and older adults and in both Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive and Ph-negative ALL. These novel regimens result in high rates of deep measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity and may improve survival compared with chemotherapy-only approaches, allowing for less reliance on intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This review discusses novel approaches to integrating INO and/or blinatumomab into frontline ALL regimens, including the potential role of chemotherapy-free regimens in some subgroups. The role of MRD monitoring is also discussed, including how this can inform decisions for consolidative allogeneic HSCT or investigational approaches with CD19 CAR T-cells.">

        <tr id="The treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has reached overall survival rates exceeding 90%. The present and future challenges are to cure the remainder of patients still dying from disease, and to reduce morbidity and mortality in those who can be cured with standard-of-care chemotherapy by replacing toxic chemotherapy elements while retaining cure rates. With the novel therapeutic options introduced in the last years, including immunotherapies and targeted antibodies, the treatment of ALL is undergoing major changes. For B-cell precursor ALL, blinatumomab, an anti-CD19 bispecific antibody, has established its role in the consolidation treatment for both high- and standard-risk first relapse of ALL, in the presence of bone marrow involvement, and may also have an impact on the outcome of high-risk subsets such as infant ALL and Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 drug conjugated antibody, has demonstrated high efficacy in inducing complete remission in relapsed ALL, even in the presence of high tumor burden, but randomized phase III trials are still ongoing. For T-ALL the role of CD38-directed treatment, such as daratumumab, is gaining interest, but randomized data are needed to assess its specific benefit. These antibodies are currently being tested in patients with newly diagnosed ALL and may lead to major changes in the present paradigm of treatment of pediatric ALL. Unlike the past, lessons may be learned from innovations in adult ALL, in which more drastic changes are piloted that may need to be translated to pediatrics.">

Rituximab was the first one approved. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells are currently approved as second-line treatment in patients with DLBCL refractory to first-line chemo-immunotherapy. Polatuzumab, a CD79b-targeting ADC, is approved as first-line treatment in high-risk patients in combination with chemo-immunotherapy. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are a novel category of drugs that are also changing the treatment paradigm of patients with DLBCL. They are engineered to bind to two different targets at the same time. To date, two BsAbs (glofitamab and epcoritamab) are approved as monotherapy in third-line treatment in DLBCL. Combination strategies with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and ADCs are currently under investigation with encouraging results in first-line or subsequent lines of treatment. In the following review, we focus on the structure of BsAbs, the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, and the mechanisms of resistance to BsAbs.">

        <tr id="In the last decade, there has been a surge in developing immunotherapies to enhance the immune system's ability to eliminate tumor cells. Bispecific antibodies known as T cell engagers (TCEs) present an attractive strategy in this pursuit. TCEs aim to guide cytotoxic T cells toward tumor cells, thereby inducing a strong activation and subsequent tumor cell lysis. In this study, we investigated the activity of different TCEs on both conventional alpha-beta (αβ) T cells and unconventional gamma delta (γδ) T cells. TCEs were built using camelid single-domain antibodies (VHHs) targeting the tumor-associated antigen CEACAM5 (CEA), together with T cell receptor chains or a CD3 domain. We show that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells display stronger in vitro antitumor activity than αβ T cells when stimulated with a CD3xCEA TCE. Furthermore, restricting the activation of fresh human peripheral T cells to Vγ9Vδ2 T cells limited the production of protumor factors and proinflammatory cytokines, commonly associated with toxicity in patients. Taken together, our findings provide further insights that γδ T cell-specific TCEs hold promise as specific, effective, and potentially safe molecules to improve antitumor immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="7546 Background: Elranatamab is a BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody with an accelerated approval in the US and EU for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Elranatamab binds to CD3 on T cells and BCMA on MM tumor cells; this dual binding results in T cell activation, cytokine release, and tumor cell killing. Engagement of the BCMA surface receptor by its ligands, APRIL and BAFF, mediates plasma cell proliferation and survival. Elevated BCMA, as well as BAFF and APRIL are present in MM patients, yet in vitro functional assays have shown physiologically relevant soluble APRIL or BAFF concentrations did not significantly impact elranatamab activity. Moreover, emerging clinical data from relapsed patients has identified novel, yet relatively rare BCMA protein mutations that may impact BCMA ligand or targeted modality binding. Here we characterized the BCMA binding affinity, evaluated the impact on BCMA binding to BAFF and APRIL interactions, and identified the BCMA binding epitope. We also generated a model from crystal structure data to map reported BCMA mutations identified in patients. Methods: Elranatamab binding affinity to recombinant human BCMA and characterization of BAFF and APRIL interactions with elranatamab-bound BCMA were calculated via SPR at 37˚C with a classical sandwich format. The elranatamab BCMA binding epitope was identified by a co-crystal structure with a parental anti-BCMA Fab that has identical CDR sequences to elranatamab. Alpha-fold modeling was used to map identified BCMA mutations on the antibody/BCMA interface. Results: Elranatamab binds to BCMA with higher affinity (~38 pM) compared to reported binding affinities of BAFF (μM range) and APRIL (nM range) ligands. The identified elranatamab epitope largely overlaps with known ligand epitopes, supporting that elranatamab higher affinity BCMA binding blocks ligand binding. Alpha fold modeling of four recently reported rare BCMA mutations shows that they lie along the binding interface. Conclusions: Due to its high affinity for BCMA, elranatamab potency is unlikely to be impacted by elevated levels of soluble BAFF or APRIL in RRMM patients. Future studies are needed to characterize the impact of emerging MM patient BCMA mutations on the binding and function of anti-BCMA targeting modalities, particularly given the small extracellular domain of BCMA available for therapeutic targeting and the highly overlapping binding epitopes reported for approved BCMA agents.">

In contrast to directly acting traditional antiviral drugs, such as ganciclovir, we aim to emulate a physiological infection control using T cells. For this, we constructed several bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) constructs targeting different viral glycoproteins of the murine cytomegalovirus and evaluated them in vitro for their efficacy. To isolate the target specific effect without viral immune evasion, we established stable reporter cell lines expressing the viral target glycoprotein B, and the glycoprotein complexes gN-gM and gH-gL, as well as nano-luciferase (nLuc). First, we evaluated binding capacities using flow cytometry and established killing assays, measuring nLuc-release upon cell lysis. All BiTE constructs proved to be functional mediators for T-cell recruitment and will allow a proof of concept for this treatment option. This might pave the way for strikingly safer immunosuppression in vulnerable patient groups.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a breakthrough cancer therapy over the past decade. Remarkable outcomes in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and multiple myeloma have been reported in both pivotal trials and real-word studies. Traditionally, the use of a patient’s own (autologous) T cells to manufacture CAR products has been the standard practice. Nevertheless, this approach has some drawbacks, including manufacturing delays, dependence on the functional fitness of the patient’s T cells, which can be compromised by both the disease and prior therapies, and contamination of the product with blasts. A promising alternative is offered by the development of allogeneic CAR-cell products. This approach has the potential to yield more efficient drug products and enables the use of effector cells with negligible alloreactive potential and a significant CAR-independent antitumor activity through their innate receptors (i.e., natural killer cells, γδ T cells and cytokine induced killer cells). In addition, recent advances in genome editing tools offer the potential to overcome the primary challenges associated with allogeneic CAR T-cell products, namely graft-versus-host disease and host allo-rejection, generating universal, off-the-shelf products. In this review, we summarize the current pre-clinical and clinical approaches based on allogeneic CAR T cells, as well as on alternative effector cells, which represent exciting opportunities for multivalent approaches and optimized antitumor activity.">

        <tr id="e19008 Background: Bispecific antibodies (BsAb) have emerged as a new treatment modality for relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas (R/R NHL). They exert their effect by binding to CD3 on T-cells and CD19 or CD20 on lymphoma cells, activating the T-cell to exert cytotoxic effects against the tumor and normal B-cells. Treatment related adverse events (TRAE) include infections, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurotoxicity (ICANS). This meta-analysis was conducted to assess prevalence of TRAEs from prospective clinical trials that evaluated BsAb in R/R NHL. Methods: A systematic review was conducted through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane to identify BsAb clinical trials in NHL through October 2023. Eligible studies included phase I-III trials evaluating BsAb in any type of NHL, either as monotherapy or combination therapy irrespective of prior lines of treatment. Primary outcomes of interest include infection, neutropenia, CRS, and ICANS. All studies were weighted equally. Pooled prevalence estimates of TRAE were calculated using common and random effects models. Heterogeneity tests were performed using Cochran’s Q test. Subgroup analysis examined infection rates in monotherapy versus combination therapy cohorts. Results: After screening 1039 studies, 36 clinical trials with 2162 patients were included. The lymphoma subtypes were diffuse-large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. The BsAbs included mosunetuzumab (13 studies), epcoritamab (10 studies), blinatumomab (5 studies), glofitamab (5 studies), odronextamab (2 studies), and AFM11 (1 study). The median age of patients was 66 years, and patients had received a median of two prior lines of therapy. Median follow-up duration was 9.1 months. The prevalence of all-grade infections was 35% (95% CI: 0.33-0.38; I2 = 79%). For grade ≥3 infections, the prevalence was 16% (95% CI: 0.14-0.18, (I2 = 77%). There were higher rates of all-grade infections in the combination therapy cohort (41%, 95% CI: 0.36-0.47) compared with the monotherapy cohort (33%, 95% CI: 0.30-0.36). All-grade and grade ≥3 neutropenia occurred in 31% (95% CI: 0.29-0.34; I2 = 80%) and 22% (95% CI: 0.20-0.24, I2 = 61%) of patients. CRS was observed in 45% of patients (95% CI: 0.43-0.48, I2 = 85%). Grade ≥3 CRS occurred in only 2% of patients (95% CI: 0.02-0.03, I2 = 0%, p = 0.99). ICANS occurred in 12% (95% CI: 0.10-0.14, I2 = 90%) while grade ≥3 ICANS was rare, at 3% (95% CI: 0.02-0.03, I2 = 0%, p = 0.99). Conclusions: BsAb is associated with nontrivial rates of infections and neutropenia. The rates of high grade CRS and ICANS are low. The heterogeneity of the findings could be attributed by an underreporting of TRAE and small sample sizes from various studies. These results highlight the need for vigilant practices to diagnose and treat infections early and consideration for antibacterial prophylaxis in this immunocompromised population.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) are novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and both have recently gained approval by the U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).


SUMMARY
These therapies offer unprecedented responses in RRMM but present new challenges including cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), non-ICANS neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections, and hypogammaglobulinemia.


KEY MESSAGES
In the evolving CAR-T landscape, a primary objective is to develop innovative strategies for managing associated toxicities. Through meticulous exploration of underlying mechanisms and tailored interventions, we aim to enhance safety and enable broader outpatient utilization. Refinement of protocols, biomarker identification, and robust monitoring are imperative for sustained efficacy. This comprehensive approach guarantees the continuous advancement and optimization of CAR-T therapy.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Interleukin-6 receptor antibodies (IL-6R Abs), including satralizumab, are increasingly used to prevent relapse for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). However, the detailed mechanism of action of this treatment on the lymphocyte phenotype remains unclear. This study focused on B cells in patients with NMOSD, hypothesizing that IL-6R Ab enables B cells to acquire regulatory functions by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated in vitro to induce the expansion of B-cell subsets, double-negative B cells (DNs; CD19+ IgD−, CD27−) and plasmablasts (PBs; CD19+, CD27hi, CD38hi). Whole B cells, DNs, or PBs were isolated after culture with IL-6R Ab, and IL-10 expression was quantified using quantitative PCR and a cytometric bead array. RNA sequencing was performed to identify the marker of regulatory PBs induced by IL-6R Ab. Results DNs and PBs were observed to expand in patients with NMSOD during the acute attacks. In the in vitro model, IL-6R Ab increased IL-10 expression in B cells. Notably, IL-10 expression increased in PBs but not in DNs. Using RNA sequencing, CD200 was identified as a marker of regulatory PBs among the differentially expressed upregulated genes. CD200+ PBs produced more IL-10 than CD200− PBs. Furthermore, patients with NMOSD who received satralizumab had a higher proportion of CD200+ PBs than patients during the acute attacks. Discussion Treatment with IL-6 signaling blockade elicited a regulatory phenotype in B cells and PBs. CD200+ PBs may be a marker of treatment responsiveness in the context of NMOSD pathophysiology.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic, inflammatory liver disease of unknown aetiology which requires lifelong immunosuppression. Most therapeutic and outcome studies of AIH have been conducted predominantly in Caucasian (European Ancestry, EA) cohorts, with the exclusion of African American (AA) patients due to inadequate sample size. It is known that AA patients have a severe phenotype of autoimmune diseases and demonstrate a poor response to conventional medical therapy. Understanding cellular and molecular pathways which determine AIH severity and progression in AA patients is likely to lead to the discovery of novel, personalised and better tolerated therapies. The aim of the study is to determine the distinct effector B cell phenotypes which contribute to disease severity and progression of AIH in AA children as compared to their EA cohorts. PBMCs were isolated from blood samples collected from patients visiting Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) and were grouped into AA, (n = 12), EA, (n = 11) and controls (n = 12) and were processed for flow cytometry. Markers of B cell development, maturation and activation were assessed namely CD19, CD21, IgD, CD27, CD38, CD11c, CD24, CD138. AA children with AIH demonstrated an expansion of CD19 + ve, Activated Naïve (aN), (CD19+ IgD-/CD27- Double Negative (DN2) ([CD19+/IgD-/CD27++CD38++) cells. Plasmablasts were significantly higher along with Signalling Lymphocytic activation molecule F7 (SLAMF7). Unswitched memory [CD19+] IgD+CD27+ (USM) B cells were significantly contracted in AA patients with AIH. B cell phenotyping reveals a distinct profile in AA AIH patients with a major skewing towards the expansion of effector pathways which have been previously characterised in severe SLE in AA patients. These results suggest that the quantification and therapeutic target of B cell pathway could contribute substantially to the clinical approach to AIH especially in the AA population.">

        <tr id="7066 Background: Despite advanced treatments, including chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR-T), a significant proportion of patients succumb to relapsed and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL). In vitro experiments suggest synergism between BTK inhibitor (BTKi) and T-cell engager, we initiated a multicenter trial of poseltinib and glofitamab in combination with lenalidomide in R/R DLBCL. Methods: This is a phase II, open label, single arm study aiming to enroll 76 participants with adult R/R DLBCL patients (NCT05335018). Patients refractory to frontline therapy or those who failed more than two lines of therapies were enrolled. Previous anti-CD19 CAR-T was allowed, while previous CD20 T-cell engager was not permitted. Participants received glofitamab (In cycle 1, dose is increased weekly from 2.5mg to 10mg, and after cycle 2, 30mg is administered on Day 1), lenalidomide (20mg daily from Day 1-14), and poseltinib (40mg twice daily from Day 1-21) (GPL) every 3 weeks for a total of 12 cycles(induction). Maintenance with poseltinib and lenalidomide for 17 cycles were given to patients after induction period. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR), with secondary endpoints including duration of response (DoR), complete response rate (CRR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and incidence of treatment related adverse events. Results: No safety signals were observed in the safety cohort (n=6, 3+3 design). As of November 2023, 37 patients (median age 71) have been treated with GPL, with a median follow up duration of 3.6 months. In prior lines of therapy, 13 patients (35.1%) received treatment more than 2, and 26 patients (70.3%) were with Ann Arbor stage III/IV and 7 patients (18.9%) were refractory to frontline treatment. Previously, 3 patients (8.1%) received CAR-T. Out of 28 evaluable patients, ORR was 89.3%, with CRR of 42.9%. Six-month OS and PFS rate were 81% and 55%. DoR at 6 months was 66%. Neutropenia (45.9%) was the most common grade(gr) 3-4. Three patients (8.1%) died of gr5. There was 1 case (2.7%) of gr3 atrial fibrillation and gr1 bleeding. No incidence of gr3 or above liver/renal toxicity were observed. Overall, 3 patients (8.1%) discontinued GPL treatment due to toxicity, and cytokine release syndrome was observed in 7 patients (18.9%) and only 2 patients (5.4%) were gr3-4. Conclusions: Interim analysis indicates that the GPL regimen is an effective and safe regimen for R/R DLBCL patients. High response rates observed support further investigation of GPL for potential synergism between T-cell engagers and BTKi. This multicenter study is actively recruiting patients and is set to complete enrollment within this year. Clinical trial information: NCT05335018 . [Table: see text]">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative treatment for various hematological malignancies. Still, its remarkable efficacy is accompanied by unique adverse events that must be carefully managed. This comprehensive literature review evaluates the safety profile of CAR T-cell therapy, focusing on cytopenia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and other potential complications. Cytopenia, characterized by reduced blood cell counts, affects a significant proportion of patients, with rates of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia reaching up to 60%, 70%, and 80%, respectively. Risk factors include high tumor burden, prior chemotherapy, and bone marrow involvement. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurs in 13% to 77% of patients and is linked to the cytokine storm induced by CAR T cells, target antigen expression, and preexisting immune dysregulation. Other notable adverse events discussed are cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and infections. Understanding the mechanisms, risk factors, and management strategies for these adverse events is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and unlocking the full potential of this revolutionary therapy. The review highlights the need for continued research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and evidence-based approaches to enhance the safety and efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy.">

        <tr id="7567 Background: BCMA targeting bispecific Antibody (bsAb) therapy has shown unprecedented response and survival rates in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The clinical activity of bsAb therapy has been shown to depend on T-cell function, yet clinical parameters, such as absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) have not been found to be associated with response to bsAbs. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether distinct T cell subsets, such as CD4 and CD8 counts as well as their proportion within the ALC are associated with outcome of BCMA targeting bsAb therapy. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on 79 patients who had been treated with at least one full dose of a BCMA targeting bsAb. T cell subsets, including ALC, total CD3, CD4 and CD8, were measured from peripheral blood within 7 days prior to bsAb therapy initiation. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS version 9.4 using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Median age of the patient cohort was 72 (31-84) years with 40/79 (51%) being male and 15/79 (19%) being African American. Median lines of therapy was 5 (2-12) with 78/79 (99%) patients being triple class refractory and 50/79 (63%) being penta-drug refractory. 59/79 (75%) of patients had at least one prior stem cell transplant (SCT) with 35/79 (44%) having had at least two SCTs. 26/79 (33%) patients had prior exposure to BCMA targeting therapy, with 18/79 (23%) and 8/79 (10%) previously having received belantamab mafodotin or BCMA targeting Car-T cell therapy respectively. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 38/79 (48%) of patients with the majority (92%) being grade 1 with the remainder being grade 2. Median ALC was 1.02 (0.25-5) x103/mL, median CD4 count was 0.27 (0.04-1.13) x103/mL while median CD8 count was 0.5 (0.07-2.97) x103/mL. Overall response (OR) rate of the whole cohort was 82% (69/79) with best responders (³very good partial response) comprising 51% (40/79). While total ALC, CD4 and CD8 counts did not appear to impact response to BCMA targeting bsAb therapy, the ratio of CD4 to ALC proved to be significantly associated with OR (univariate p=0.04) and best response (univariate p= 0.004, multivariate p=0.01) . The CD8 to ALC ratio had no significant impact in this patient population. The only other factor to show a significant association with response was the number of prior lines of therapy with higher numbers being associated with worse response (p=0.046). Conclusions: Our study suggests that an increased proportion of CD4 cells within the ALC is significantly associated with better response to BCMA targeting bsAb. While future studies are needed to elaborate on CD4 function in bsAB therapy, our findings imply that therapeutic strategies to increase the CD4 proportion could lead to improved bsAb therapy effectiveness.">

Autologous stem cell transplantation, as well as proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and monoclonal antibodies, has substantially improved the prognosis of patients with MM. Novel therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, bispecific T-cell engagers, antibody-drug conjugates, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and nuclear export inhibitors, have provided more options. However, MM remains incurable. T cells are the principal weapons of antitumor immunity, but T cells display a broad spectrum of dysfunctional states during MM. The promising clinical results of T-cell-directed immunotherapies emphasize the significance of enhancing T-cell function in antimyeloma treatment. This review summarizes the potential effects of these antimyeloma agents on T-cell function and discusses possible optimized strategies for MM management by boosting T-cell immunity.">

 Monoclonal antibodies are among the most effective treatments for patients with blood cancers, and they primarily function by marking cells for destruction by the innate immune system. Macrophages are critical innate effectors of antibody therapies for lymphoma, but their anti-tumor capacity is limited by the CD47/SIRPa interaction. CD47 acts a “don’t eat me” signal that is highly expressed on the surface of many lymphomas, and it prevents phagocytosis by binding to the inhibitory receptor SIRPa expressed on macrophages. In multiple clinical trials, CD47-blocking therapies have demonstrated encouraging signs of efficacy for B-cell lymphomas, particularly when used in combination with rituximab, an opsonizing anti-CD20 antibody. However, the best antibodies and combination strategies to activate macrophages remains unknown. Here, we sought to define the repertoire of cell surface antigens that can be targeted to stimulate macrophage-mediated destruction of B-cell lymphomas. To achieve this goal, we developed a high-throughput functional screening platform to measure the ability of primary macrophages to attack B-cell lymphoma cells. We successfully applied this system to screen monoclonal antibody libraries targeting hundreds of distinct cell surface antigens across both mouse and human systems. We conducted screens using each antibody as a single agent, in combination with anti-CD20, or in combination with anti-CD47. From these efforts, we identified CD24, CD38, CXCR4, CD71, and multiple other novel and unique antigens that could be targeted alone or in combination to exert maximal macrophage-mediated destruction of B-cell lymphoma. Of note, some of the identified targets are predominantly expressed by the lymphoma cells, whereas others are expressed by the macrophages and act as unappreciated immune checkpoints. In validation studies, we defined a multitude of new antibody combinations that robustly stimulate macrophages to attack and eliminate lymphoma cells. Since some anti-CD47-antibodies have been limited by on-target hematologic toxicity, we also used the identified targets to engineer a collection of novel bispecific antibodies that induce macrophage phagocytosis without causing hematologic toxicity. We generated 156 bispecific antibodies, produced them recombinantly, and demonstrated they can maximize macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity of human B-cell lymphoma cells while minimizing binding to healthy blood cells. In mouse xenograft models, these bispecific antibodies exhibited significant single-agent activity in a model of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Thus, our study has led to the development of a multitude of novel therapeutic candidates and combination strategies that can be developed further to maximize anti-tumor function and benefit patients with lymphoma. Furthermore, our approach can be rapidly applied to other hematologic malignancies to create innovative bispecific agents that maximize anti-tumor responses by macrophages or other innate immune cells.

        <tr id="Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) is one of several childhood-onset autoimmune disorders characterized by a type I interferon response and autoantibodies. Treatment options are limited due to incomplete understanding of how the disease emerges from dysregulated cell states across the immune system. We therefore investigated the blood of JDM patients at different stages of disease activity using single-cell transcriptomics paired with surface protein expression. By immunophenotyping peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we observed skewing of the B cell compartment towards an immature naive state as a hallmark of JDM at diagnosis. Furthermore, we find that these changes in B cells are paralleled by T cell signatures suggestive of Th2-mediated inflammation that persist despite disease quiescence. We applied network analysis to reveal that hyperactivation of the type I interferon response in all immune populations is coordinated with previously masked cell states including dysfunctional protein processing in CD4+ T cells and regulation of cell death programming in NK, CD8+ T cells and gdT cells. Together, these findings unveil the coordinated immune dysregulation underpinning JDM and provide insight into strategies for restoring balance in immune function.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells and Bispecific Antibodies (BsAb) are the leading platforms for redirecting the immune system against cells expressing the specific antigen, revolutionizing the treatment of hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). In MM, drug-resistant relapses are the main therapy-limiting factor and the leading cause of why the disease is still considered incurable. T-cell-engaging therapies hold promise in improving the treatment of MM. However, the effectiveness of these treatments may be hindered by T-cell fitness. T-cell exhaustion is a condition of a gradual decline in effector function, reduced cytokine secretion, and increased expression of inhibitory receptors due to chronic antigen stimulation. Areas covered This review examines findings about T-cell exhaustion in MM in the context of T-cell redirecting BsAbs and CAR-T treatment. Expert opinion The fitness of T-cells has become an important factor in the development of T-cell redirecting therapies. The way T-cell exhaustion relates to these therapies could affect the further development of CAR and BsAbs technologies, as well as the strategies used for clinical use. Therefore, this review aims to explore the current understanding of T-cell exhaustion in MM and its relationship to these therapies.">

        <tr id="Background Advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a prevalent kidney cancer for which long-term survival rates are abysmal, though immunotherapies are showing potential. Not yet clinically vetted are bispecific T cell engagers (BTEs) that activate T cell-mediated cancer killing through intercellular synapsing. Multiple BTE formats exist, however, with limited cross-characterizations to help optimize new drug design. Here, we developed BTEs to treat ccRCC by targeting carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) while characterizing the persistent BTE (PBTE) format and comparing it to a new format, the persistent multivalent T cell engager (PMTE). These antibody therapies against ccRCC are developed as both recombinant and synthetic DNA (synDNA) medicines. Methods Antibody formatting effects on binding kinetics were assessed by flow cytometry and intercellular synaptic strength assays while potency was tested using T-cell activation and cytotoxicity assays. Mouse models were used to study antibody plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics, as well as antitumor efficacy as both recombinant and synDNA medicines. Specifically, three models using ccRCC cell line xenografts and human donor T cells in immunodeficient mice were used to support this study. Results Compared with a first-generation BTE, we show that the PBTE reduced avidity, intercellular synaptic strength, cytotoxic potency by as much as 33-fold, and ultimately efficacy against ccRCC tumors in vivo. However, compared with the PBTE, we demonstrate that the PMTE improved cell avidity, restored intercellular synapses, augmented cytotoxic potency by 40-fold, improved tumor distribution pharmacokinetics by 2-fold, and recovered synDNA efficacy in mouse tumor models by 20-fold. All the while, the PMTE displayed a desirable half-life of 4 days in mice compared with the conventional BTE’s 2 hours. Conclusions With impressive efficacy, the CA9-targeted PMTE is a promising new therapy for advanced ccRCC, which can be effectively delivered through synDNA. The highly potent PMTE format itself is a promising new tool for future applications in the multispecific antibody space.">

We analyzed outcomes for 72 RRMM patients treated with teclistamab, a CD3 x BCMA bispecific antibody (BsAb), 42% (30/72) of whom had prior BCMA-directed therapy exposure. Malignant plasma cell BCMA expression was present in all BCMA therapy-naïve patients. Prior therapy-mediated loss of plasma cell BCMA expression before teclistamab treatment, measured by immunohistochemistry, was observed in 3 patients, none of whom responded to teclistamab, and one of whom also did not respond to ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Whole exome sequencing of tumor DNA from one patient revealed biallelic loss of TNFRSF17 following treatment with belantamab mafodotin. Low-to-undetectable peripheral blood soluble BCMA levels correlated with the absence of BCMA expression by bone marrow plasma cells. Thus, although rare, loss of BCMA expression following TNFRSF17 gene deletions can occur following any BCMA-directed therapy and prevents response to subsequent anti-BCMA-directed treatments, underscoring the importance of verifying the presence of a target antigen.">

        <tr id="Immune responses to primary COVID-19 vaccination were investigated in 58 patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) as part of the PETReA trial of frontline therapy (EudraCT 2016-004010-10). COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1) were administered before, during or after cytoreductive treatment comprising rituximab (depletes B cells) and either bendamustine (depletes CD4+ T cells) or cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. Blood samples obtained after vaccine doses 1 and 2 (V1, V2) were analysed for antibodies and T cells reactive to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the Abbott Architect and interferon-gamma ELISpot assays respectively. Compared to 149 healthy controls, patients with FL exhibited lower antibody but preserved T-cell responses. Within the FL cohort, multivariable analysis identified low pre-treatment serum IgA levels and V2 administration during induction or maintenance treatment as independent determinants of lower antibody and higher T-cell responses, and bendamustine and high/intermediate FLIPI-2 score as additional determinants of a lower antibody response. Several clinical scenarios were identified where dichotomous immune responses were estimated with >95% confidence based on combinations of predictive variables. In conclusion, the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in FL patients is influenced by multiple disease- and treatment-related factors, among which B-cell depletion showed differential effects on antibody and T-cell responses.">

        <tr id="6518 Background: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown promising efficacy in B-cell malignancies (Majzner RG, et al. Nat Med. 2019 Sep;25(9):1341-1355). However, its feasibility in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not fully established. CD33 CAR T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory (r/r) AML have reported limited or no significant anti-leukemic effects (Tambaro FP, et al. Leukemia. 2021 Nov;35(11):3282-3286; Wang QS, et al. Mol Ther. 2015 Jan;23(1):184-91). CD123 CAR T-cell therapy has weak proliferation and low CR rates (Wermke M, et al. Blood. 2021 Jun 3;137(22):3145-3148; Cummins, Katherine D. et al. Blood. 2017; 130: 1359), while CLL1 CAR T-cell therapy has induced anti-leukemic responses in a small subset of patients without sustained expansion (Pei K, et al. Cancer Med. 2023 Apr;12(8):9655-9661; Jin X, et al. J Hematol Oncol. 2022 Jul 7;15(1):88). Here, we present early safety and efficacy of functionally enhanced CD33 CAR T cells in AML. Methods: We improved the performance of CD33 CAR T cells by adding a potentiating molecule linked to human CD33 scFv by P2A. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04835519). The trial used the “3+3” approach, starting with an initial dose of 5×105 (±20%)/kg. The primary endpoint was safety with efficacy secondary. Results: Four relapsed patients, including three who underwent stem cell transplantation, were enrolled and received initial dose of CAR T cells between April 13, and July 28, 2021. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee approved the preliminary report. Three patients (75%) experienced grade 1−2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), while one (25%) had grade 4 CRS. One developed grade 2 CRS after the second infusion. One patient had dose-limiting toxicity. Two patients (50%) had grade 1 neurotoxicity, and two (50%) developed grade 1–2 graft-versus-host disease. All patients experienced grade 2–4 neutropenia, monocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. One patient developed sepsis. Two patients achieved CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) and were MRD-negative at day 30, while two had no response. Of these, one patient received a second infusion and achieved MRD+ CRi. Two patients have remained disease free for over two years. One patient remained disease free for one year before CD33+ relapse. The two patients with CRi had peak CAR T cell counts of 192 and 23.5 cells/μl, while the two without CRi had lower peak counts of 2.12 and 10.3 cells/μl. One patient peaked at 1.73 cells/μl after the second infusion. The two patients with CRi also had a higher proportion of CAR T cells among the lymphocytes (46.8% and 53.0%). As expected, peripheral blood CD33+ cells decreased. Conclusions: We report the safety and efficacy of functionally enhanced CD33 CAR T cells. While some patients had CRi, there was also depletion of CD33-positive normal cells. Thus, further research is needed to address the issue of normal cell depletion.

        <tr id="Despite advancements, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unconquered by current therapies. Evidence of immune evasion during AML progression, such as HLA loss and T-cell exhaustion, suggests that antileukemic immune responses contribute to disease control and could be harnessed by immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss a spectrum of AML immunotherapy targets, encompassing cancer cell-intrinsic and surface antigens as well as targeting in the leukemic milieu, and how they can be tailored for personalized approaches. These targets are overviewed across major immunotherapy modalities applied to AML: immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, therapeutic vaccines, bispecific/trispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T and CAR-NK cells. Significance: Immune therapies in AML treatment show evolving promise. Ongoing research aims to customize approaches for varied patient profiles and clinical scenarios. This review covers immune surveillance mechanisms, therapy options like checkpoint inhibitors, antibodies, CAR-T/NK cells, and vaccines, as well as resistance mechanisms and microenvironment considerations.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for eradicating human cancers. Their therapeutic success and durability of clinical responses hinges, in large part, on their functional capacity, including the ability of these engineered cells to simultaneously expand and persist after infusion into patients. CD19 CAR T-cell polyfunctionality, assessing the simultaneous functions of cytokine production, proliferation, and cytotoxicity has been reported to correlate with clinical outcomes. Assay optimization is potentially limited by the heterogeneous nature of CAR T-cell infusion products and target specificity. We optimized a single-cell platform for polyfunctionality using CAR T cell products manufactured from healthy donors, engineered against a novel target, BAFF-R, and validated the protocol using CD19 CAR T cells. We observed distinct qualitative differences between BAFF-R and CD19 CAR T cells relative to the proportions of stimulatory vs. effector cytokines, based on target antigen density, and generally, CD19 CAR T cells exhibited lower indices of polyfunctionality. Finally, we applied our assay to the autologous BAFF-R CAR T-cell product generated from the first NHL patient treated on an ongoing clinical trial who had progressed after prior CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. We observed robust indicators of polyfunctionality, which correlated with successful CAR T cell expansion after infusion and achievement of durable complete remission ongoing after 18 months. The precise identification of factors determining the role of BAFF-R CAR T-cell fitness on toxicity and clinical outcome will require the application of this robust assay in the analysis of additional treated patients.">

        <tr id="Patients with autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for severe infection due to their underlying disease and immunosuppressive treatments. In this real-world observational study of 463 autoimmune subjects, we examined risk factors for poor B and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We show a high frequency of inadequate anti-spike IgG responses to vaccination and boosting in the autoimmune population but minimal suppression of T cell responses. Low IgG responses in B cell-depleted multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects were associated with higher CD8 T cell responses. By contrast, subjects taking mycophenolate mofetil exhibited concordant suppression of B and T cell responses. Treatments with highest risk for low IgG anti-spike response included B cell depletion within the last year, fingolimod, and combination treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and belimumab. Our data show that the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine, is the most effective vaccine in the autoimmune population. There was minimal induction of either disease flares or autoantibodies by vaccination and no significant effect of pre-existing anti-type I interferon antibodies on either vaccine response or breakthrough infections. The low frequency of breakthrough infections and lack of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths suggest that T cell immunity contributes to protection in autoimmune disease.">

        <tr id="7058 Background: Follicular and marginal zone B cell lymphoma (FL; MZL) demonstrate an indolent course with heterogeneous outcomes anda potential for spontaneous remissions indicating immune system intervention. Therapeutic immunization is therefore an attractive approach but new antigens that evoke a strong immune response are needed. EO2463 expands pre-existing memory CD8+ T cells recognizing non-self protein sequences from gut bacteria which cross-react with B cell antigens and can kill HLA-A2 restricted cells (T2) loaded with target peptides. EO2463 includes 4 HLA-A2 synthetically produced epitopes which exhibit molecular mimicry with the B cell markers CD20, CD22, CD37, and CD268 (BAFF-receptor), as well as a the CD4 helper-epitope UCP2 derived from hTERT. EO2463 is being used to drive anti-tumor activity against B cell malignancies. Methods: Patients (pts) with FL and MZL, stage 1-3A, and HLA-A2, are eligible. In the safety lead-in pts with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease were given EO2463 SC q2 weeks (w) x 4, then q4w, for a max of 12 months; at w7 lenalidomide (20 mg/day for 21/28 days up to 12 cycles) is added (EL), and if no complete remission (CR) at w19, rituximab (375 mg/m2 IV, q1w x 4, then q4w x 4) is also added (ER2). Doses evaluated: 150 μg and 300μg/peptide. Results: 3 pts received 150 μg/peptide and 6 pts 300 μg/peptide (EO2463 1 pat, EL 2 pts, ER2 6 pts): 2 MZL, 7 FL pts with median 2 lines (range 1-4) of prior systemic therapy. No related grade ≥3 adverse events were seen with EO2463 monotherapy. Most common related events were grade 1 to 2 local administration site reactions in 5/9 pts. Adverse events during combination treatment were as expected for R2. PET-CT on w6 after EO2463 monotherapy suggested clinical activity in 4/9 pts (1 PR, 1 pt size reduction 15%, 1 pt 20% reduced tracer uptake, 1 pt 5/6 target lesions reduced metabolic activity). Overall objective responses (OR) were seen in 6/9 pts (67%; 1st OR on EO2463 1 pat, EL 4 pts, ER2 1 pat), with CR in 5/9 (56%) pts; median time to response was 18w (range 8-43w), response ongoing in 5 pts, range 24-76w. Expansion of specific CD8+ T cells against mimic peptides and targeted B cell antigens were detected in all responding pts, incl. 2 pts with no measurable B cells at baseline (prior anti-CD20). Expansion of specific T cells was detected at w5 in 5/6 pts and was maintained as long as currently tested (up to w94, 43w after last EO2463 dose). No decline in expansions were seen after start rituximab. Conclusions: EO2463 (300 μg/peptide) monotherapy, EL, and ER2 are well tolerated, with encouraging clinical activity with EO2463 monotherapy and with subsequent CR in 5/9 pts on combo. Rapid and durable expansion of specific CD8+ T cells was seen in all responding pts, consistent with the preclinical hypothesis. Additional cohorts investigate EO2463 alone or in combination in newly diagnosed or R/R pts. Results will be reported at the meeting. Clinical trial information: NCT04669171 .">

        <tr id="Bispecific T-cell engagers (bsTCEs) have emerged as a promising class of cancer immunotherapy. BsTCEs enable physical connections between T cells and tumor cells to enhance T-cell activity against cancer. Despite several marketing approvals, the development of bsTCEs remains challenging, especially at early clinical translational stages. The intricate design of bsTCEs makes their pharmacologic effects and safety profiles highly dependent on patient's immunological and tumor conditions. Such context-dependent pharmacology introduces considerable uncertainty into translational efforts. In this study, we developed a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) model, through context unification, that can facilitate the translation of bsTCEs preclinical data into clinical activity. Through characterizing the formation dynamics of immunological synapse (IS) induced by bsTCEs, this model unifies a broad range of contexts related to target affinity, tumor characteristics, and immunological conditions. After rigorous calibration using both experimental and clinical data, the model enables consistent translation of drug potency observed under diverse experimental conditions into predictable exposure-response relationships in patients. Moreover, the model can help identify optimal target-binding affinities and minimum efficacious concentrations across different clinical contexts. This QSP approach holds significant promise for the future development of bsTCEs.">

Owing to the rapidly progressing field of CAR-T cell therapy and the lack of generally accepted treatment guidelines, we hypothesized significant differences between European centers in prevention, diagnosis and management of short- and long-term complications. To capture the current CAR-T cell management among EBMT centers and to determine the medical need and specific areas for future clinical research the EBMT Transplant Complications Working Party performed a survey among 227 EBMT CAR-T cell centers. We received complete servey answers from 106 centers (47%) addressing questions in the areas of product selection, CAR-T cell logistics, management of cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome as well as management in later phases including prolonged cytopenias. We identified common patterns in complication management, but also significant variety in clinical management of the centers in important aspects. Our results demonstrate a high medical need for treatment harmonization and future clinical research in the following areas: treatment of steroid-refractory and very severe CRS/neurotoxicity, treatment of cytopenia, early discharge and outpatient management, as well as immunoglobulin substitution.">

T-cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have demonstrated limited success in CLL, which is attributed to CLL-mediated T-cell dysfunction and skewing toward immunosuppressive phenotypes. Herein, we illustrate the feasibility of polarizing CD4+ T cells from the Eμ-TCL1 murine model, the most representative model for human CLL, into Th17 phenotype, employing a protocol of T-cell activation through the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) alongside a polarizing cytokine mixture. We demonstrate augmented memory properties of in vitro-polarized IL-17-producing T cells, and preliminary in vivo persistence in leukemia-bearing mice. Our findings gain translational relevance through successful viral transduction of Eμ-TCL1 CD4+ T cells with a CD19-targeted CAR construct during in vitro Th17 polarization. Th17 CAR T cells exhibited remarkable persistence upon encountering antigen-expressing target cells. This study represents the first demonstration of the potential of in vitro-differentiated Th17 cells to enhance ACT efficacy in CLL.">

        <tr id="e14589 Background: MAGEA1, identified as a cancer/testis antigen, is highly expression in various solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, but absent in normal tissues except male germ cells and placenta, both of which lacking HLA class molecules. This selective expression of HLA-MAGEA1 epitope makes it a promising target for cancer therapy. However, its intracellular localization poses a challenge for conventional antibodies designed to target surface-expressed antigens. TCR-based T-cell engagers, such as Tebentafusp, overcome this hurdle by targeting intracellular protein-derived peptides presented on cancer cell surfaces via HLA, enabling precise cytotoxic T cell attacks. Notably, Tebentafusp has shown significant clinical benefits by improving survival rates in metastatic uveal melanoma, underscoring the efficacy of TCR-based T-cell engagers in treating MAGEA1-positive tumors. Methods: We have developed an advanced structural format, CR62, consisting of a anti-CD3 single chain fragment, a soluble modified TCR, and an Fc region. Additionally, the use of CorreGene's SMART-TCR system has facilitated the acquisition of TCRs with high affinities in the pico-molar range. By leveraging CR62 and a high-affinity TCR, we have conceptualized the TCR-based T-cell engager, CRPA1A2. Comprehensive preclinical assessments have been conducted to evaluate CRPA1A2's safety and efficacy. Results: CRPA1A2 is designed to specifically target the HLA-A*02:01-restricted MAGEA1 epitope, effectively inhibiting tumor growth. CRPA1A2 is characterized by its exceptional soluble expression in CHO cells, minimal homodimer miss-assembly and simplifying purification. It is strategically engineered with a high-affinity TCR and a low-affinity anti-CD3 scFv to optimize the efficacy and safety. In vitro studies, CRPA1A2 showed strong ability to eliminate tumor cells and induce IFN-γ release, effective even at low MAGEA1 epitope densities, with a therapeutic window that spans over three orders of magnitude, suggesting a 1000-fold greater activity against antigen-positive cancer cells compared to antigen-negative cells. In vivo, using a tumor-bearing mouse model, CRPA1A2 has been shown to recruit T cells into subcutaneous solid tumors, expand CD8+ T cell populations, and significantly reduce tumor mass. Notably, CRPA1A2 has an extended half-life of 120 hours and demonstrates preferential accumulation in tumor tissues, thereby enhancing its therapeutic potential. Moreover, the safety assessments for CRPA1A2 highlight its exceptional specificity, with in vitro studies showing no evidence of off-target toxicity, on-target off-tumor toxicity, or alloreactivity and favorable tolerance in mice during in vivo studies. Conclusions: CRPA1A2 has emerged as a superior TCR-based T-cell engager with exceptional antitumor efficacy and promising safety profile.">

        <tr id="TPS7100 Background: Despite the promising efficacy of CAR-T for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphomas (LBCL), more than 60% of patients will relapse, the majority of which occur in the first 6 months. Approximately 30% of patients with LBCL treated with CAR-T achieve a partial response (PR) on day 30 (D30) PET-CT assessment. Of patients in a D30 PR, 70% will eventually progress, yet the standard of care remains close observation. Early consolidative treatment strategies utilizing therapies with a different mechanism of action may improve outcomes, but there are currently no reliable biomarkers. Epcoritamab (Epco), a bispecific antibody directed against CD20 and CD3, has been approved by the FDA for LBCL patients who relapse after at least 2 lines of therapy. In the phase 2 study, Epco was associated with an overall response rate (ORR) of 63% and a complete response (CR) rate of 39%, including similar responses in a subset of patients who were relapsed 100 days post CAR-T. This study is a trial-in-progress that will evaluate the efficacy of epco compared to observation for patients with LBCLs achieving a PR on D30 post CAR-T PET-CT assessment. Methods: This is an investigator-initiated, randomized, phase II, multicenter, open-label study (NCT06238648) evaluating epco monotherapy for a fixed duration of 12 cycles compared to observation for LBCL patients with D30 PR after standard of care CAR-T. A maximum of 120 patients will be randomized 1:1 to epco or observation across 10 academic centers. Stratification factors include line of CAR-T (second vs third line) and costimulatory domain (CD28 vs 4-1BB). Key inclusion criteria include PET evidence of a D30 PR. non-bulky disease ( <7.5cm), ANC of >1000, hemoglobin >7 g/dL if asymptomatic or >8 if symptomatic, platelet count >50,000. G-CSF, pRBCs and platelet transfusions are allowed. Key exclusion criteria include prior anti CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody therapy, ongoing or uncontrolled CRS or ICANS, and active or symptomatic CNS disease. Epco is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0.16mg on day 1, 0.8mg on day 8, prior to full dose of 48mg on day 15. Epco is administered weekly in 28 day cycles (C) for C1-3, on day 1 and 15 of C4-9 and on day 1 of C10-12. PET-CT response is assessed by the 2014 Lugano criteria after 2 cycles, and then every 3 months during active treatment. The primary objective is efficacy, measured as conversion from D30 PR to CR. The secondary endpoints include frequency and severity of treatment emergent adverse events, ORR, duration of response, duration of complete response, progression free survival, event free survival, and overall survival. Peripheral blood samples will be collected pre-treatment and during treatment to assess for biomarkers of response and resistance. The study was activated in January 2024 and recruitment is ongoing.

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by a systemic dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune systems, leading to an attack on healthy tissues of the body. During the development of SLE, pathogenic features, such as the formation of autoantibodies to self-nuclear antigens, caused tissue damage including necrosis and fibrosis, with an increased expression of type Ⅰ interferon (IFN) regulated genes. Treatment of lupus with immunosuppressants and glucocorticoids, which are used as the standard therapy, is not effective enough and causes side effects. As an alternative, more effective immunotherapies have been developed, including monoclonal and bispecific antibodies that target B cells, T cells, co-stimulatory molecules, cytokines or their receptors, and signaling molecules. Encouraging results have been observed in clinical trials with some of these therapies. Furthermore, a chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as the most effective, safe, and promising treatment option for SLE, as demonstrated by successful pilot studies. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis may play a significant role in the severity of SLE, and the use of methods to normalize the gut microbiota, particularly fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), opens up new opportunities for effective treatment of SLE.">

        <tr id="Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a plasma cell disorder distinguished from multiple myeloma (MM) by the degree of organ involvement due to tissue deposition of misfolded proteins. Treatments for AL amyloidosis have largely been borrowed from those developed for patients with MM. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has historically been associated with the best outcomes. The recent incorporation of daratumumab into up front therapy represents a significant advance and has changed the treatment paradigm, calling into question the role of ASCT. The development of very active novel immune and cellular therapies, specifically B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed therapies, has similarly been transformative for patients with MM and is now being studied in patients with AL amyloidosis. These include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, bispecific antibodies, and antibody drug conjugates. Although limited, preliminary data in patients with relapsed and refractory AL amyloidosis are showing promising results, and it is expected that the treatment landscape for AL amyloidosis will continue to evolve. Particular attention to safety, potential for organ recovery, and quality of life will be important when evaluating new treatments and/or treatment paradigms.">

        <tr id="Multiple chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell and bispecific antibody (bsAb) therapies have been approved, demonstrating impressive clinical efficacy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). Currently, these treatment share overlapping approval indications in the relapsed/refractory space, highlighting the importance of optimal selection and sequencing to maximize clinical efficacy. For patients previously unexposed to T-cell-directed therapies, several factors should be weighed when both options are available. These factors include access and logistical challenges associated with CAR T-cell therapy, disease-specific factors such as tempo of disease relapse, in addition to patient-specific factors such as frailty, and distinct toxicity profiles across these agents. Sequential therapy, whether it involves CAR T-cell therapy followed by bsAb or vice versa, has demonstrated clinical efficacy. When sequencing these agents, it is crucial to consider various factors that contribute to treatment resistance with careful selection of treatments for subsequent therapy in order to achieve favorable long-term patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Objective Resolvin D1 (RvD1) is one of the specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, which control inflammation resolution and regulate immune responses. Previous research showed that RvD1 could block the progression of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the detailed mechanism remains to be fully understood. Method Plasma RvD1 levels, and proportions of T follicular helper cells (Tfh cells) were measured in SLE patients and healthy controls. Plasma RvD1 levels and proportions of Tfh cells were quantitated in an MRL/lpr mouse model of lupus treated with RvD1. Naïve CD4+ T cells were purified from MRL/lpr mice to study the effect of RvD1 on Tfh cell differentiation in vitro. Results In patients, there were significant negative correlations between plasma RvD1 levels and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, as well as between plasma RvD1 and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels, and numbers of peripheral Tfh cells and plasma cells. In MRL/lpr mice, the expected amelioration of disease phenotype and inflammatory response with RvD1 treatment correlated with decreased percentages of Tfh cells and plasma cells. In addition, the differentiation and proliferation of Tfh cells were markedly suppressed by RvD1 in vitro. Conclusion RvD1 may control SLE progression through the suppression of Tfh cell differentiation and subsequent inhibition of B-cell responses.">

        <tr id="Bispecific and multispecific agents have become increasingly utilized in cancer treatment and immunotherapy, yet their complex design parameters present a challenge in developing successful therapeutics. Bispecifics that crosslink receptors on two opposing cells can provide specific activation of a receptor only when these cells are in close spatial proximity, such as an immune cell and cancer cell in a tumor. These agents, including T cell activating bispecifics, can avoid off-tumor toxicity through activation only in the tumor microenvironment by utilizing a tumor target to cluster T-cell receptors for a selective costimulatory signal. Here, we investigate a panel of PD-1/CD137 targeted Humabody VH domains to determine the key factors for T cell activation, such as affinity, valency, expression level, domain orientation, and epitope location. Target expression is a dominant factor determining both specificity and potency of T cell activation. Given an intrinsic expression level, the affinity can be tuned to modulate the level of activation and IC50 and achieve specificity between low and high expression levels. Changing the epitope location and linker length showed minor improvements to activation at low expression levels, but increasing the valency for the target decreased activation at all expression levels. By combining non-overlapping epitopes for the target, we achieved higher receptor activation at low expression levels. A kinetic model was able to capture these trends, offering support for the mechanistic interpretation. This work provides a framework to quantify factors for T cell activation by cell-crosslinking bispecific agents and guiding principles for the design of new agents.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy for the treatment of neurological autoimmune diseases is promising, but CAR T cell kinetics and immune alterations after treatment are poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell multi-omics sequencing of paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) treated with anti–B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T cells. Proliferating cytotoxic-like CD8+ CAR T cell clones were identified as the main effectors in autoimmunity. Anti-BCMA CAR T cells with enhanced features of chemotaxis efficiently crossed the blood-CSF barrier, eliminated plasmablasts and plasma cells in the CSF, and suppressed neuroinflammation. The CD44-expressing early memory phenotype in infusion products was potentially associated with CAR T cell persistence in autoimmunity. Moreover, CAR T cells from patients with NMOSD displayed distinctive features of suppressed cytotoxicity compared with those from hematological malignancies. Thus, we provide mechanistic insights into CAR T cell function in patients with neurological autoimmune disease. CAR T cells display distinctive profiles and actions in patients with CNS autoimmunity. Editor’s summary Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a promising avenue for the treatment of autoimmunity, but how these cells work in vivo is poorly understood. Qin et al. performed a single-cell multi-omics analysis of longitudinal blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from five patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) undergoing treatment with anti–B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T cells. They characterized CAR T cell expansion and function and found that peak expansion occurred within 10 days. Moreover, persistent CSF-infiltrating CAR T clones were CXCR3+ and exhibited an enhanced chemotactic transcriptional program. Last, Qin et al. observed that CAR T cells taken from treated patients with NMOSD were less cytotoxic than CAR T cells taken from treated patients with myeloma and patients with B cell lymphoma. These findings may help optimize future immunotherapies for autoimmune disorders. —Seth Thomas Scanlon">

        <tr id="Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) constitute the backbone of modern acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis regimens but have limited efficacy in the prevention and treatment of chronic GVHD (cGVHD). We investigated the effect of CNIs on immune tolerance after stem cell transplantation with discovery-based single-cell gene expression and T cell receptor (TCR) assays of clonal immunity in tandem with traditional protein-based approaches and preclinical modeling. While cyclosporin and tacrolimus suppressed the clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells during GVHD, alloreactive CD4+ T cell clusters were preferentially expanded. Moreover, CNIs mediated reversible dose-dependent suppression of T cell activation and all stages of donor T cell exhaustion. Critically, CNIs promoted the expansion of both polyclonal and TCR-specific alloreactive central memory CD4+ T cells (TCM) with high self-renewal capacity that mediated cGVHD following drug withdrawal. In contrast to posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy), CSA was ineffective in eliminating IL-17A–secreting alloreactive T cell clones that play an important role in the pathogenesis of cGVHD. Collectively, we have shown that, although CNIs attenuate aGVHD, they paradoxically rescue alloantigen-specific TCM, especially within the CD4+ compartment in lymphoid and GVHD target tissues, thus predisposing patients to cGVHD. These data provide further evidence to caution against CNI-based immune suppression without concurrent approaches that eliminate alloreactive T cell clones.">

The extra-axial group showed an isolated increase in G-MDSC (р<0.05), whereas coxitis was associated with an increase in both G-MDSC and M-MDSC (р<0.05). Low activity was associated with an isolated M-MDSC increase (р=0.045). Patients had reduced expression of majority of the studied suppressor molecules in MDSCs. Axial manifestation was characterized by a decreased expression of PDL1 and IDO in G-MDSCs and E-MDSCs (р<0.05), as well as Arg-1 in E-MDSCs and M-MDSCs (р<0.05). Patients with extra-axial manifestations (including coxitis) exhibited the most significant reduction in the expression of all three inhibitory molecules in M-MDSCs. High activity was associated with a decrease in PDL1+ G-MDSCs and E-MDSCs (р<0.05), as well as Arg-1and IDO-expressing M-MDSCs (р<0.05). In low disease activity, most of the analyzed parameters did not differ significantly from donor values, with the exception of a reduced Arg-1+ M-MDSC frequency (р=0.04). BT reduced G-MDSC counts in 75% of patients to levels comparable to those of healthy donors.Conclusion. Despite the reduced suppressor potential of MDSCs, patients undergoing first-line therapy with high activity demonstrated increased G-MDSC counts, while low activity axSpA was characterized by an isolated increase in M-MDSCs. The BT administration blocked G-MDSC accumulation.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by persistent activation of immune cells and overproduction of autoantibodies. The accumulation of senescent T and B cells has been observed in SLE and other immune-mediated diseases. However, the exact mechanistic pathways contributing to this process in SLE remain incompletely understood. In this study, we found that in SLE patients: (1) the frequency of CD4+CD57+ senescent T cells was significantly elevated and positively correlated with disease activity; (2) the expression levels of B-lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family and interferon-induced genes (ISGs) were significantly upregulated; and (3) in vitro, the cytokine IL-15 stimulation increased the frequency of senescent CD4+ T cells and upregulated the expression of BCL-2 family and ISGs. Further, treatment with ABT-263 (a senolytic BCL-2 inhibitor) in MRL/lpr mice resulted in decreased: (1) frequency of CD4+CD44hiCD62L-PD-1+CD153+ senescent CD4+ T cells; (2) frequency of CD19+CD11c+T-bet+ age-related B cells; (3) level of serum antinuclear antibody; (4) proteinuria; (5) frequency of Tfh cells; and (6) renal histopathological abnormalities. Collectively, these results indicated a dominant role for CD4+CD57+ senescent CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of SLE and senolytic BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-263 may be the potential treatment in ameliorating lupus phenotypes.">

        <tr id="5096 Background: High-risk prostate cancer (HR-PCa) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. Previous studies reported that a high density of immunosuppressive B cells in HR-PCa resection specimens was found to correlate with biochemical failure. In this context, a single arm prospective study assessing neoadjuvant rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody used to deplete B cells, was previously conducted on patients with HR-PCa eligible for radical prostatectomy (“PROTUX”). Here, we performed deep TCR sequencing to elucidate the impact of B cell depletion on T cells in prostate cancer patients. Methods: A single arm study enrolled patients with HR-PCa to receive neoadjuvant rituximab prior to radical prostatectomy (NCT: 01804712). Patients were treated with rituximab 375 mg/m2 once weekly for 4 treatments followed by prostatectomy within 14 days of the final treatment of rituximab. A matched cohort of patients with HR-PCa who underwent prostatectomy without any prior therapy were used as controls. Specimens from 14 patients were retrieved and genomic DNA was isolated using a QIAamp DNA FFPE Advanced UNG kit. TCR sequencing was performed with Adaptive Biotechnologies using the Ultradeep TCRB v4b assay. Data were then analyzed using the Adaptive immunoSEQ Analyzer. Groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analysis and graphing were done in Prism 10 and R. Results: We observed that patients treated with rituximab had higher TCRb productive clonality (0.080 vs 0.026, p = 0.03). Strikingly, the calculated number of T cells present in prostatectomy samples was significantly greater in patients receiving rituximab compared to controls (1.18 cells/ng DNA input vs 0.10 cells/ng, p = 0.002). Maximum productive frequency and the cumulative frequency of the top 10 clones were not significantly different between the two cohorts. However, we found that the T cells from patients who received rituximab had longer TCRb CDR3 regions (proportion CDR3 ≥16 amino acids of 0.232 vs 0.197, p = 0.007), suggesting a less antigen-experienced phenotype. Conclusions: Using specimens from a clinical trial assessing the use of neoadjuvant rituximab in HR-PCa, we found that B cell depletion can significantly affect T cell infiltration, clonality, and phenotype. Given the increasing appreciation for crosstalk between T cells and B cells in mediating anti-tumor immune responses, these findings suggest a context dependent role of B-cells in patients with HR-PCa.

        <tr id="Antibody-mediated depletion studies have demonstrated that CD8+ T cells are required for effective immune control of SIV. However, this approach is confounded by several factors, including reactive CD4+ T cell proliferation, and further provides no specificity information. We circumvented these limitations by selectively depleting CD8+ T cells specific for the Gag epitope CTPYDINQM (CM9) via the administration of immunotoxin-conjugated tetrameric complexes of CM9/Mamu-A*01. Immunotoxin administration effectively depleted circulating but not tissuelocalized CM9-specific CD8+ T cells, akin to the bulk depletion pattern observed with antibodies directed against CD8. However, we found no evidence to indicate that circulating CM9-specific CD8+ T cells suppressed viral replication in Mamu-A*01+ rhesus macaques during acute or chronic progressive infection with a pathogenic strain of SIV. This observation extended to macaques with established infection during and after continuous antiretroviral therapy. In contrast, natural controller macaques experienced dramatic increases in plasma viremia after immunotoxin administration, highlighting the importance of CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity against CM9. Collectively, these data showed that CM9-specific CD8+ T cells were necessary but not sufficient for robust immune control of SIV in a nonhuman primate model and, more generally, validated an approach that could inform the design of next-generation vaccines against HIV-1.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
CAR-T cell therapy, emerging as an efficient treatment option for patients with secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, is frequently complicated with immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).


CASE PRESENTATION
We report a case of a 64-year-old woman with transformed follicular lymphoma, developing high-grade ICANS with eosinophilic pleocytosis following third-line therapy with CAR-T cells (tisagenlecleucel). During bridging therapy, she declined neurologically and was diagnosed with secondary CNS lymphoma. She received methotrexate-cytarabine-thiotepa-rituximab regimen with clinical and radiological improvement. Post-CAR-T cell infusion she developed cytokine release syndrome grade II and ICANS grade III. Given the lack of response to steroids, anakinra was initiated with complete ICANS resolution. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, performed only on day +10 due to thrombocytopenia, revealed eosinophils, while infections were excluded.


CONCLUSION
This report emphasizes the importance of CSF analysis in individuals with CAR-T-related neurotoxicity for elucidating the role of specific immune cells in such complications.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptors are synthetically produced receptors engineered to engage with target cells with high specificity. These cells are created by inserting an artificial T-cell receptor into an immunoglobulin’s antigen-binding region, allowing the cells to combine and target specific antigens. The use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has been a remarkable achievement in the field of immunotherapy, particularly in the treatment of ophthalmic tumors like retinoblastoma and uveal melanoma. However, there are some documented side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immunological effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Additionally, ocular side effects such as blurred vision, vision impairment, and intraocular infections are also concerning and require further evaluation. This review highlights the advances made in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapy, including its structure and manufacture, as well as relevant clinical discoveries and associated adverse effects. By identifying the gaps in current research, this analysis provides insights into potential strategies and solutions for addressing some of the most severe side effects.">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy caused by the clonal expansion of immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or extramedullary sites. Common manifestations of MM include anemia, renal dysfunction, infection, bone pain, hypercalcemia, and fatigue. Despite numerous recent advancements in the MM treatment paradigm, current therapies demonstrate limited long-term effectiveness and eventual disease relapse remains exceedingly common. Myeloma cells often develop drug resistance through clonal evolution and alterations of cellular signaling pathways. Therefore, continued research of new targets in MM is crucial to circumvent cumulative drug resistance, overcome treatment-limiting toxicities, and improve outcomes in this incurable disease. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the landscape of novel treatments and emerging therapies for MM grouped by molecular target. Molecular targets outlined include BCMA, GPRC5D, FcRH5, CD38, SLAMF7, BCL-2, kinesin spindle protein, protein disulfide isomerase 1, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, Sec61 translocon, and cyclin-dependent kinase 6. Immunomodulatory drugs, NK cell therapy, and proteolysis-targeting chimera are described as well.">

        <tr id="e19013 Background: Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are emerging as a promising new immunotherapy modality in patients with lymphoma. Mosunetuzumab is a CD20xCD3 T-cell engaging bispecific monoclonal antibody that redirects T cells to eliminate malignant B cells, was first to receive approval for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. Here, we report the safety and efficacy of Mosunetuzumab as a first line therapy in combination or monotherapy regimen in non-hodgkin lymphoma. Methods: A literature search was performed on PubMed with keywords for “Mosunetuzumab” AND “lymphoma”. The search was performed from the inception of data till 1/1/2024. A total of 237 articles were screened and three non-randomized clinical trials (nRCTs, N=124) were included. PRISMA guidelines were followed while conducting this systematic review. Results: In 3 clinical trials, 54 patients were treated with mosunetuzumab monotherapy, 40 with mosunetuzumab + cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), and 30 with subcutaneous mosunetuzumab. 94 patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and 30 patients had follicular lymphoma. ORR, CR, and PR were reported in 56%, 43%, and 13% patients, respectively, treated with mosunetuzumab monotherapy in DLBCL. ORR, CR, and PR were reported in 87.5%, 85%, and 2.5% patients, respectively, treated with mosunetuzumab + CHOP in DLBCL. ORR, CR, and PR were reported in 96%, 83%, and 12.5% patients, respectively, treated with subcutaneous mosunetuzumab in follicular lymphoma. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infections, and fatigue were common adverse effects given in the table. Conclusions: Mosunetuzumab with CHOP showed higher efficacy results and was well tolerated by most of the patients and can be an option to achieve high response rates in DLBCL. Subcutaneous mosunetuzumab was active in follicular lymphoma with manageable toxicity in follicular lymphoma. However, long-term results are needed to determine the durability of responses and long-term safety and survival rates with these regimens. [Table: see text]">

        <tr id="TPS5112 Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies but application of CAR T cell therapy in solid malignancies remains a high priority. We previously demonstrated initial safety of a PSCA CAR T cells in patients with mCRPC following a reduced lymphodepletion regimen (LD) in a phase 1 trial (NCT03873805). There was preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity (Dorff 2023) but escalation was not pursued due to concerns of toxicity. Additional dose exploration is needed. Preclinical work suggests that radiation therapy directed to tumor sites modifies the tumor microenvironment providing rationale for combining metastasis directed radiation therapy (MDRT) with CAR T cell therapy. The phase 1b dose exploration study aims to test a multi-dose strategy and whether the addition of MDRT could further enhance response. Methods: This is a single-center, open-label, phase Ib trial for patients with PSCA+ mCRPC. Key inclusion criteria are a diagnosis of mCRPC with evaluable disease, at least one area of metastasis amenable for radiation (for the MDRT cohort), PSCA expression by immunohistochemistry on archival tissue, and prior progression on abiraterone or enzalutamide or both; prior taxane chemotherapy is allowed. The primary objective will be to assess the feasibility, safety, and activity of PSCA CAR T cell therapy. Primary endpoints will include evaluation of toxicity through DLT’s and activity through rate of PSA50 and objective responses. Secondary endpoints will include overall survival, progression-free survival (PCWG3 criteria), measurement of CAR T cell and cytokine kinetics, and T cell infiltration in pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies. Exploratory endpoints will include phenotypes and frequencies of immune cell subsets in peripheral blood pre- and post-therapy, gene expression of CTCs, CAR immunogenicity by the presence of anti CAR antibodies or T cell mediated immune responses, urine analysis, cfDNA whole exome sequencing, and phenotype tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. This study includes 2 treatment plans (TP). The participants on TP 1 will receive 50 million PSCA CAR T cells every 2 weeks for up to 6 doses after LD chemotherapy. Based on these results, the number of cycles of CAR T will be determined for TP2. Participants on TP 2 will receive PSCA CAR T therapy after MDRT and LD. The first 3 participants on each TP will be staggered, all further participants will be treated in cohorts of 3. Toxicities will be monitored based on a Wald sequential probability ratio test. Rates and associated 90% Clopper and Pearson binomial confidence limits will be estimated for DLTs within the DLT period, disease response based on PSA50/RECIST/PCWG3 criteria, PFS at 6 months, and OS at 1 year. The results will be used to identify the optimal strategy to move to phase 2. The study is currently open to enrollment. Clinical trial information: NCT05805371 .">

        <tr id="7023 Background: CNTY-101 is an allogeneic, iPSC-derived anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor NK (CAR-iNK) cell product with Allo-Evasion edits to avoid host rejection. Potential benefits of CNTY-101 include immediate availability for treatment, repeat dosing without the need for lymphodepletion, and the potential for improved safety over T-cell based therapies. The first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of CNTY-101, ELiPSE-1 (NCT05336409), evaluates safety, preliminary efficacy, PK, and translational biomarkers in patients with CD19-positive B-cell malignancies. Methods: Subjects with R/R aggressive and indolent B-cell NHL received lymphodepletion (LDC) followed by assignment to 100e6, 300e6 or 1e9 cells at either Day 1 (Schedule A) or Days 1, 8 and 15 (Schedule B). Eligible subjects (ie, achieved SD or better at Day 28 by PET/CT) can receive additional cycles, with or without one additional regimen of LDC. Subjects also receive daily subcutaneous injections of IL-2 for 8 days (A) or 4 days (B) following each infusion. Results: At time of abstract submission, 10 subjects have been treated (n=4 DL1A; n=3 DL2A; n=2 DL3A; n=1 DL2B). Three subjects (1 at DL1A, 2 at DL2A) received additional cycle(s) of CNTY-101. Three subjects have not yet been evaluated for full safety and efficacy within the DLT window. Seven subjects (n=5 DLBCL; n=1 FL; n=1 MZL) had data available as of the data cut (Nov 30, 2023). All had stage 4 disease, 6/7 were refractory to last line of therapy, with a median of 4 (2-5) prior lines of therapy including CAR T (3/7). No DLTs, GvHD or ICANs were observed. Two subjects had cytokine release syndrome (n=1 Gr 1, n=1 Gr 2), all responding promptly to treatment. ORR/CRR was 25%/25% for 100e6 cells (DL1A) and 67%/33% for 300e6 cells (DL2A). Dose escalation is ongoing. In subjects from all three dose levels, CNTY-101 rapidly traffics out of circulation after infusion and is observed via cell-free DNA on Day 3 and detected up to 28 days. CNTY-101 persistence was not adversely impacted when given without lymphodepletion in two subjects who received additional cycles of CNTY-101. Induction of functional humoral immunogenicity against CNTY-101 was not observed at any of the dose levels, regardless of single or multiple cycles of CNTY-101. Adaptive immune responses were observed in the tumor microenvironment on Day 8. Conclusions: CNTY-101 administered as a single dose in multiple cycles has demonstrated a manageable safety profile and preliminary evidence of efficacy. Allo-Evasion edits may allow for repeat dosing for multiple cycles without allorejection in the absence of lymphodepletion. Preliminary efficacy supports dosing at higher dose levels and with more dose-intense regimens. Updated safety, efficacy, PK, and CNTY-101's impact on tumor for DL3A and DL2B will be provided.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective first-line therapy for solid cancers. However, low response rate and acquired resistance over time has led to the need for additional therapeutic options. Here, we evaluated synergistic anti-tumor efficacy of EGFR x MET targeting bispecific antibody, amivantamab with PD-L1 immunotherapy, pembrolizumab in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tumor bearing humanized PDX models. We demonstrated that pembrolizumab or amivantamab alone was ineffective and that combination treatment induced a significant reduction of tumor growth in both models (p<0.0001 and p<0.01, respectively). It appeared that combination of amivantamab and pembrolizumab significantly enhanced infiltration of granzyme B-producing CD8 T cells was in the TME of HNSCC PDX (p<0.01), and enhanced neoantigen-associated central memory CD8 T cells in circulating immune cells. Analysis of single cell RNA transcriptomics suggested that the tumor cells dramatically upregulated EGFR and MET in response to PD-L1 immunotherapy, potentially creating a metabolic state fit for tumor persistence in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and rendered pembrolizumab ineffective. We demonstrated that EGFRHIGHMETHIGH subcluster displayed an increased expression of genes implicated in production of lactate (SLC16A3 and LDHA) compared to the EGFRLOWMETLOW cluster. Accumulation of lactate in the TME has been associated with immunosuppression by hindering the infiltration of tumor killing CD8 T and NK cells. This study proved that amivantamab reduced glycolytic markers in the EGFRHIGHMETHIGH subcluster including SLC16A3 and LDHA and highlighted remodeling of the TME by combination treatment, providing rationale for additional therapy of amivantamab with PD-1 immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Treatment with autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has emerged as a highly effective approach in neuroimmunological disorders such as myasthenia gravis. We report a case of successful anti-CD19 CAR T cell use in treatment-refractory stiff-person syndrome (SPS). To investigate clinical and immunological effects of anti-CD19 CAR T cell use in treatment-refractory SPS, a 69-y-old female with a 9-y history of treatment-refractory SPS with deteriorating episodes of stiffness received an infusion of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cells (KYV-101) and was monitored clinically and immunologically for more than 6 mo. CAR T cell infusion resulted in reduced leg stiffness, drastic improvement in gait, walking speed increase over 100%, and daily walking distance improvement from less than 50 m to over 6 km within 3 mo. GABAergic medication (benzodiazepines) was reduced by 40%. KYV-101 CAR T cells were well tolerated with only low-grade cytokine release syndrome. This report of successful use of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in treatment-refractory SPS supports continued exploration of this approach in SPS and other B cell–related autoimmune disorders.">

        <tr id="B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator (BTLA) is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed by most immune cells, playing a role in negatively regulating immune responses. Studies in MRL/lpr lupus mice deficient for BTLA, indicate that BTLA has a protective role in lupus. We have previously shown an altered BTLA expression by regulatory T cells and an impaired capacity of BTLA to inhibit CD4+ T cell activation in lupus patients. In this study, we thoroughly analyzed BTLA expression and function in the NZB/W lupus-mouse model. We found that diseased NZB/W mice exhibit a BTLA expression and function pattern similar to that observed in lupus patients, emphasizing the importance of this mouse model in evaluating the therapeutic potential of targeting BTLA. Administration of a monoclonal anti-BTLA antibody (clone 6F7, which displays agonist properties ex vivo) into pre-diseased NZB/W mice resulted in a delayed onset of proteinuria, limited kidney damages and an increased survival rate compared to isotype-treated mice. This beneficial effect was associated with a decrease in circulating B cell frequency and required continuous exposure to the antibody. Regarding its mode of action, we demonstrated that the 6F7 antibody is not a depleting antibody and does not block HVEM binding to BTLA, but instead induces BTLA down modulation, leading to a selective reduction of follicular B cell numbers, and exhibits in vivo agonist activity. Overall, our data confirm the involvement of BTLA in lupus pathogenesis and provide the first evidence that BTLA is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of lupus.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy produces high response rates in refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but long-term data are minimal to date. Here, we present long-term follow-up of a pilot trial testing a CD20-targeting 3rd generation CAR in patients with relapsed B-cell lymphomas following cyclophosphamide-only lymphodepletion. Two of the 3 patients in the trial, with mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, had remissions lasting more than 7 years, though they ultimately relapsed. The absence of B cell aplasia in both patients suggested a lack of functional CAR T cell persistence, leading to the hypothesis that endogenous immune responses were responsible for these long remissions. Correlative immunologic analyses supported this hypothesis, with evidence of new humoral and cellular anti-tumor immune responses proximal to clinical response time points. Collectively, our results suggest that CAR T cell therapy may facilitate epitope spreading and endogenous immune response formation in lymphomas.">

        <tr id="Background: Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) has revolutionized the treatment landscape for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, yet its effects on pre-existing autoimmune disorders remain elusive. Methods: Here, we present four cases of patients with concurrent autoimmune conditions—Crohn’s disease, vitiligo, type I diabetes, and minimal change disease—undergoing BV therapy for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The patients were treated with A-AVD instead of ABVD due to advanced-stage disease with high IPI scores. Results: Our findings reveal the surprising and complex interplay between BV exposure and autoimmune manifestations, highlighting the need for multidisciplinary collaboration in patient management. Notably, the exacerbation of autoimmune symptoms was observed in the first three cases where T-cell-mediated autoimmunity predominated. Additionally, BV exposure precipitated autoimmune thrombocytopenia in the vitiligo patient, underscoring the profound disruptions in immune regulation. Conversely, in the minimal change disease case, a disease characterized by a blend of B- and T-cell-mediated immunity, the outcome was favorable. Conclusions: This paper underscores the critical importance of vigilance toward autoimmune flare-ups induced by BV in patients with concurrent autoimmune conditions, offering insights for tailored patient care.">

        <tr id="Biomarkers for cytopenias following CAR T-cell treatment in relapsed/refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM) are not completely defined. We prospectively analysed 275 sequential peripheral blood (PB) samples from 58 RRMM patients treated with BCMA-targeted CAR T cells, and then divided them into three groups: (i) baseline (before leukapheresis), (ii) ≤day+30, and (iii) >day+30 after CAR T-cell therapy. We evaluated laboratory data and performed flow cytometry to determine the (CAR) T-cell subsets. Baseline hyperferritinaemia was a risk factor for long-lasting grade ≥3 anaemia (r = 0.47, p < 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (r = 0.44, p = 0.002) after CAR T-cell therapy. Low baseline haemoglobin (Hb) and PLT were associated with long-lasting grade ≥3 anaemia (r = -0.56, p < 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (r = -0.44, p = 0.002) respectively. We observed dynamics of CAR-negative T-cell subsets following CAR T-cell infusion. In the late phase after CAR T-cell therapy (>day+30), CD4Tn frequency correlated with anaemia (r = 0.41, p = 0.0014) and lymphocytopenia was related to frequencies of CD8+ T cells (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) and CD8Teff (r = 0.64, p < 0.001). CD4Tcm frequency was correlated with leucocytopenia (r = -0.49, p < 0.001). In summary, preexisting cytopenias and hyperferritinaemia indicated long duration of grade ≥3 post-CAR T-cell cytopenias. Prolonged cytopenia may be related to immune remodelling with a shift in the CAR-negative T-cell subsets following CAR T-cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) can simultaneously target two epitopes of different antigenic targets, bringing possibilities for diversity in antibody drug design and are promising tools for the treatment of cancers and other diseases. T-cell engaging bsAb is an important application of the bispecific antibody, which could promote T cell-mediated tumor cell killing by targeting tumor-associated antigen (TAA) and CD3 at the same time. Methods This study comprised antibodies purification, Elisa assay for antigen binding, cytotoxicity assays, T cell activation by flow cytometry in vitro and xenogenic tumor model in vivo. Results We present a novel bsAb platform named PHE-Ig technique to promote cognate heavy chain (HC)-light chain (LC) pairing by replacing the CH1/CL regions of different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the natural A and B chains of PHE1 fragment of Integrin β2 based on the knob-in-hole (KIH) technology. We had also verified that PHE-Ig technology can be effectively used as a platform to synthesize different desired bsAbs for T-cell immunotherapy. Especially, BCMA×CD3 PHE-Ig bsAbs exhibited robust anti-multiple myeloma (MM) activity in vitro and in vivo. Discussion Moreover, PHE1 domain was further shortened with D14G and R41S mutations, named PHE-S, and the PHE-S-based BCMA×CD3 bsAbs also showed anti BCMA+ tumor effect in vitro and in vivo, bringing more possibilities for the development and optimization of different bsAbs. To sum up, PHE1-based IgG-like antibody platform for bsAb construction provides a novel strategy for enhanced T-cell immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease in which multiple organs are damaged by the immune system. Although standard treatment options such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), glucocorticoids (GCs), and other immunosuppressive or immune-modulating agents can help to manage symptoms, they do not offer a cure. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of novel drugs and therapies. In recent decades, cell therapies have been used for the treatment of SLE with encouraging results. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, mesenchymal stem cells, regulatory T (Treg) cell, natural killer cells, and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells are advanced cell therapies which have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials in humans. In clinical application, each of these approaches has shown advantages and disadvantages. In addition, further studies are necessary to conclusively establish the safety and efficacy of these therapies. This review provides a summary of recent clinical trials investigating cell therapies for SLE treatment, along with a discussion on the potential of other cell-based therapies. The factors influencing the selection of common cell therapies for individual patients are also highlighted.">

        <tr id="Currently, therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor-T Cell (CAR-T) and immune checkpoint inhibitors like programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) blockers are showing promising results for numerous cancer patients. However, significant advancements are required before CAR-T therapies become readily available as off-the-shelf treatments, particularly for solid tumors and lymphomas. In this review, we have systematically analyzed the combination therapy involving engineered CAR-T cells and anti PD-1 agents. This approach aims at overcoming the limitations of current treatments and offers potential advantages such as enhanced tumor inhibition, alleviated T-cell exhaustion, heightened T-cell activation, and minimized toxicity. The integration of CAR-T therapy, which targets tumor-associated antigens, with PD-1 blockade augments T-cell function and mitigates immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment. To assess the impact of combination therapy on various tumors and lymphomas, we categorized them based on six major tumor-associated antigens: mesothelin, disialoganglioside GD-2, CD-19, CD-22, CD-133, and CD-30, which are present in different tumor types. We evaluated the efficacy, complete and partial responses, and progression-free survival in both pre-clinical and clinical models. Additionally, we discussed potential implications, including the feasibility of combination immunotherapies, emphasizing the importance of ongoing research to optimize treatment strategies and improve outcomes for cancer patients. Overall, we believe combining CAR-T therapy with PD-1 blockade holds promise for the next generation of cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="7531 Background: MM eventually becomes refractory to current treatments, and new therapeutic options with convenient dosing and improved safety are needed to enhance patient (pt) adherence, access, and outcomes. ABBV-383 is a distinctive next-generation BCMA x CD3 bispecific antibody composed of 2 high-affinity BCMA-binding domains, a low-affinity CD3-binding domain designed to reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risk, and a silenced Fc tail for an extended half-life allowing convenient dosing. ABBV-383 monotherapy has shown promising activity in the ongoing first-in-human phase 1 trial in RRMM (Vij et al. Blood 2023;142[suppl 1]:3378). Here, safety and efficacy results are reported that support the RP2D of 60mg Q4W as the optimal therapeutic ABBV-383 monotherapy dose. Methods: This phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation/expansion trial (NCT03933735) enrolled pts with RRMM who received ≥3 prior lines of therapy with exposure to PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 mAb. ABBV-383 regimens explored in the expansion phase included 60mg Q4W and 40 or 60mg Q3W. A modified dexamethasone premedication schedule and shortened CRS monitoring period were implemented in the 60mg Q4W cohort for cycle 1. IV ABBV-383 was administered as a flat dose with no step-up schedule. Treatment was continued until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives were to assess safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and determine the RP2D. Efficacy evaluation was a secondary objective. TEAEs were assessed per CTCAE v5.0 and tumor response per IMWG 2016 criteria. Results: As of May 2023, 220 pts received ABBV-383 (median age: 68 yr [35–92]; median prior therapy lines: 5 [3‒23]). Median FU was 4.1 mo (0.8–5.2) at 60mg Q4W (n=21), 12.2 mo (1.3–34.4) at 40mg Q3W (n=55), and 24.2 mo (0.6–33.4) at 60mg Q3W (n=61). At 60mg Q4W, with the modified premedication regimen, CRS was reported in 43% of pts (38% G1, 5% G2), and ICANS in 5% of pts (G2). In Q3W cohorts, CRS was reported in 71% (40mg; 45% G1, 25% G2) and 70% (60mg; 51% G1, 18% G2, 2% G3) of pts. The incidence of G3/4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia was 14/24/10% at 60mg Q4W, 31/31/16% at 40mg Q3W, and 34/13/13% at 60mg Q3W. G3/4 infections occurred in 10/24/34% of pts at 60mg Q4W, 40mg and 60mg Q3W, respectively. ORR and ≥VGPR were 65/50% at 60mg Q4W, 64/53% at 40mg Q3W, and 60/52% at 60mg Q3W. Corresponding exposure-response (ER) analyses and correlative analyses further supported RP2D determination (separate abstract submissions). Conclusions: The optimal therapeutic dose of 60mg Q4W ABBV-383 monotherapy was selected on the basis of safety, efficacy, and ER analyses. The extended interval of Q4W, with a shortened CRS monitoring period in cycle 1 and no step-up dosing, will improve convenience and reduce the treatment burden for pts. ABBV-383 at 60mg Q4W will be investigated in the registrational phase 3 trial (NCT06158841) in RRMM. Clinical trial information: NCT03933735 .">

        <tr id="Actin-binding proteins (ABPs) have been established as important mediators of immune homeostasis, but their effects on lymphocytes are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that LSP1, an ABP, is a master regulator for innate immune responses in B lymphocytes. Lsp1 deficiency in B cells upregulated the expression of myeloid genes, including CD11b, CD11c, and myeloperoxidase, and bestowed myeloid morphology. Strikingly, Lsp1-deficient B cells exhibited dual functions, namely, strong phagocytic activity and high antibody (Ab) production, like ‘chimera’. The PKCβ-CEBPβ pathway was found to be required for such functional chimerism. Moreover, Lsp1 deficiency induced the myeloid B cell phenotype and autoantibody production in B cells and consequently accelerated the progression of experimental lupus in mice. These changes were abrogated by retinoic acid, which upregulated LSP1 expression. In lupus patients, LSP1 expression in B cells was downregulated and inversely correlated with myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression. Overall, this study reveals a new role of the ABP LSP1 in B lymphocytes and emphasizes its critical involvement in promoting autoimmune responses, particularly by generating functionally chimeric B cells.">

        <tr id="The treatment of CLL has evolved from traditional chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) to an increasing number of targeted and biologic approaches. Randomized trials have demonstrated superiority of covalent bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (cBTKis) over CIT, and second-generation compounds such as acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib appear to have a more favorable efficacy/safety profile than ibrutinib. The noncovalent BTKi, pirtobrutinib, has shown impressive activity after failure of the cBTKis and is quite tolerable. The Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax plus a CD20, generally obinutuzumab, provides a high level of efficacy as initial treatment or after failure on a cBTKi, with many patients achieving a state of undetectable minimal residual disease. Promising novel approaches include BTK degraders, bispecific antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T)-cell therapy.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common type of B cell neoplasm, and can be cured by traditional chemoimmunotherapy in 60–70% of cases. Relapsed/refractory patients usually have a dismal prognosis and most of them finally succumb to lymphoma. In the last decade, several new innovative therapies have been approved against DLBCL, targeting both surface antigens and the intracellular pathways of neoplastic B cells. Compared to standard chemotherapy, new monoclonal antibodies and engineered T cells have shown an increased response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival, but, on the other side of the coin, patients have been experiencing new kinds of toxicities, previously unknown, that clinicians have been learning to manage. Here, we review new drugs that are already approved or under investigation for DLBCL and the corresponding molecular target on lymphoma cells. Abstract Since the introduction of rituximab in the late 1990s, significant progress has been made in advancing targeted therapies for B cell lymphomas, improving patients’ chance of being cured and clinicians’ therapeutic armamentarium. A better understanding of disease biology and pathogenic pathways, coupled with refinements in immunophenotypic and molecular diagnostics, have been instrumental in these achievements. While traditional chemotherapy remains fundamental in most cases, concerns surrounding chemorefractoriness and cumulative toxicities, particularly the depletion of the hemopoietic reserve, underscore the imperative for personalized treatment approaches. Integrating targeted agents, notably monoclonal antibodies, alongside chemotherapy has yielded heightened response rates and prolonged survival. A notable paradigm shift is underway with innovative-targeted therapies replacing cytotoxic drugs, challenging conventional salvage strategies like stem cell transplantation. This review examines the landscape of emerging targets for lymphoma cells and explores innovative therapies for diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). From Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cells to more potent monoclonal antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, and small molecules targeting intracellular pathways, each modality offers promising avenues for therapeutic advancement. This review aims to furnish insights into their potential implications for the future of DLBCL treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="TPS7093 Background: Approximately 30–40% of patients (pts) with high-risk, aggressive B-NHL are refractory to or relapse after first-line chemoimmunotherapy. Although autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies are available in the second line, access, eligibility, tolerability, and cost pose limitations for pts, and there remains a need for well-tolerated, effective off-the-shelf therapies in this setting. Odronextamab, a CD20×CD3 bispecific antibody, demonstrated encouraging clinical activity (complete response [CR] rate 31.5%; median duration of CR 17.9 months) and a generally manageable safety profile as monotherapy in pts with heavily pretreated R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the Phase 2 ELM-2 study (Ayyappan, et al. ASH 2023). This study will evaluate odronextamab versus SOC treatment in pts with DLBCL who have relapsed early (within 1 year) or were refractory to first-line therapy. Methods: OLYMPIA-4 (EudraCT 2022-502783-21-00) is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of odronextamab versus SOC in pts with previously treated aggressive B-NHL. Odronextamab will be administered intravenously in 21-day cycles, with step-up dosing during Cycle (C) 1 to mitigate the risk of cytokine release syndrome, at 160 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of C2–4, then as maintenance at 320 mg Q2W until one year from the start of treatment, progressive disease, or death. Treatment in the SOC arm consists of physician’s choice of salvage therapy with intent to proceed to ASCT. SOC regimens are: ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE); dexamethasone, cisplatin, and cytarabine (DHAP); or gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP), ± rituximab. Pts will receive up to three 21-day cycles of salvage therapy, followed by ASCT. Pts without an optimal response to salvage therapy or ASCT may cross over to receive one year of odronextamab treatment. Key inclusion criteria: ≥18 years of age; aggressive B-NHL that is primary refractory or relapsed within one year of first-line treatment initiation; intent to proceed to ASCT; measurable disease; ECOG performance status 0–1; and adequate organ and hematologic function. Pts with central nervous system lymphoma or active infection are excluded. The primary endpoint is event-free survival, as assessed by independent central review. Key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, best overall response, and change from baseline in physical function, as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30. Other secondary endpoints include CR rate, duration of response, overall survival, minimal residual disease, pharmacokinetics, and incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. The trial is currently recruiting and is expected to enroll ~216 pts at ~200 global sites. Clinical trial information: 2022-502783-21-00.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1) is a life-threatening, autosomal recessive syndrome caused by autoimmune regulator (AIRE) deficiency. In APS-1, self-reactive T cells escape thymic negative selection, infiltrate organs, and drive autoimmune injury. The effector mechanisms governing T-cell-mediated damage in APS-1 remain poorly understood.


METHODS
We examined whether APS-1 could be classified as a disease mediated by interferon-γ. We first assessed patients with APS-1 who were participating in a prospective natural history study and evaluated mRNA and protein expression in blood and tissues. We then examined the pathogenic role of interferon-γ using Aire-/-Ifng-/- mice and Aire-/- mice treated with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib. On the basis of our findings, we used ruxolitinib to treat five patients with APS-1 and assessed clinical, immunologic, histologic, transcriptional, and autoantibody responses.


RESULTS
Patients with APS-1 had enhanced interferon-γ responses in blood and in all examined autoimmunity-affected tissues. Aire-/- mice had selectively increased interferon-γ production by T cells and enhanced interferon-γ, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1), and CXCL9 signals in multiple organs. Ifng ablation or ruxolitinib-induced JAK-STAT blockade in Aire-/- mice normalized interferon-γ responses and averted T-cell infiltration and damage in organs. Ruxolitinib treatment of five patients with APS-1 led to decreased levels of T-cell-derived interferon-γ, normalized interferon-γ and CXCL9 levels, and remission of alopecia, oral candidiasis, nail dystrophy, gastritis, enteritis, arthritis, Sjögren's-like syndrome, urticaria, and thyroiditis. No serious adverse effects from ruxolitinib were identified in these patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings indicate that APS-1, which is caused by AIRE deficiency, is characterized by excessive, multiorgan interferon-γ-mediated responses. JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib in five patients showed promising results. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others.).">

        <tr id="Immune cell engagers are molecular agents, usually antibody-based constructs, engineered to recruit immune cells against cancer cells and kill them. They represent a versatile and powerful tool for cancer immunotherapy. Despite the multiplication of new engagers tested and accepted in the clinics, how molecular and cellular parameters influence their action is poorly understood. In particular, disentangling the respective role of host immune cells and engager biophysical characteristics is needed to improve their design and efficiency. Focusing here on harnessing antibody dependent Natural Killer cell cytotoxicity, we measure the efficiency of 6 original bispecific antibodies (bsAb), associating an anti-HER2 nanobody and an anti-CD16 nanobody. In vitro cytotoxicity data using primary human NK cells on different target cell lines exposing different antigen densities were collected, exhibiting a wide range of bsAb dose response. In order to rationalize our observations, we introduce a simple multiscale model, postulating that the density of bsAb bridging the two cells is the main parameter triggering the cytotoxic response. We introduce two new microscopic parameters: the surface cooperativity describing bsAb affinity at the bridging step and the threshold of bridge density determining the donor-dependent response. Both parameters permit to rank Abs and donors and to predict bsAb potency as a function of antibodies bulk affinities and receptor surface densities on cells. Our approach thus provides a general way to decouple donor response from immune engagers characteristics, rationalizing the landscape of molecule design.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction. Treatment with CM313, a novel anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, can result in targeted clearance of CD38-positive cells, including plasma cells.


METHODS
We conducted a phase 1-2, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CM313 in adult patients with ITP. CM313 was administered intravenously at a dose of 16 mg per kilogram of body weight every week for 8 weeks, followed by a 16-week follow-up period. The primary outcomes were adverse events and documentation of two or more consecutive platelet counts of at least 50×109 per liter within 8 weeks after the first dose of CM313. The status of peripheral-blood immune cells in patients and changes in the mononuclear phagocytic system in passive mouse models of ITP receiving anti-CD38 therapy were monitored.


RESULTS
Of the 22 patients included in the study, 21 (95%) had two consecutive platelet counts of at least 50×109 per liter during the treatment period, with a median cumulative response duration of 23 weeks (interquartile range, 17 to 24). The median time to the first platelet count of at least 50×109 per liter was 1 week (range, 1 to 3). The most common adverse events that occurred during the study were infusion-related reaction (in 32% of the patients) and upper respiratory tract infection (in 32%). After CD38-targeted therapy, the percentage of CD56dimCD16+ natural killer cells, the expression of CD32b on monocytes in peripheral blood, and the number of macrophages in the spleen of the passive mouse models of ITP all decreased.


CONCLUSIONS
In this study, anti-CD38 targeted therapy rapidly boosted platelet levels by inhibiting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity on platelets, maintained long-term efficacy by clearing plasma cells, and was associated with mainly low-grade toxic effects.

        <tr id="Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a muco-cutaneous autoimmune disease characterized and caused by autoantibodies targeting type VII collagen (COL7). The treatment of EBA is notoriously difficult, with a median time to remission of 9 months. In preclinical EBA models, we previously discovered that depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) enhances autoantibody-induced, neutrophil-mediated inflammation and blistering. Increased EBA severity in Treg-depleted mice was accompanied by an increased cutaneous expression of interferon gamma (IFN-γ). The functional relevance of IFN-γ in EBA pathogenesis had been unknown. Given that emapalumab, an anti-IFN-γ antibody, is approved for primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis patients, we sought to assess the therapeutic potential of IFN-γ inhibition in EBA. Specifically, we evaluated if IFN-γ inhibition has modulatory effects on skin inflammation in a pre-clinical EBA model, based on the transfer of COL7 antibodies into mice. Compared to isotype control antibody, anti-IFN-γ treatment significantly reduced clinical disease manifestation in experimental EBA. Clinical improvement was associated with a reduced dermal infiltrate, especially Ly6G+ neutrophils. On the molecular level, we noted few changes. Apart from reduced CXCL1 serum concentrations, which has been demonstrated to promote skin inflammation in EBA, the expression of cytokines was unaltered in the serum and skin following IFN-γ blockade. This validates IFN-γ as a potential therapeutic target in EBA, and possibly other diseases with a similar pathogenesis, such as bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid.">

The current Food and Drug Administration approved CAR T cell therapies idecabtagene vicleucel and ciltacabtagene autoleucel both target B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which is expressed on the surface of malignant plasma cells. Despite deep initial responses in most patients, relapse after anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy is common. Investigations of acquired resistance to anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy are underway. Meanwhile, other viable antigenic targets are being pursued, including G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member D (GPRC5D), signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 7 (SLAMF7), and CD38, among others. CAR T cells targeting these antigens, alone or in combination with anti-BCMA approaches, appear to be highly promising as they move from preclinical studies to early phase clinical trials. This review summarizes the current data with novel CAR T cell targets beyond BCMA that have the potential to enter the treatment landscape in the near future.">

        <tr id="Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease with a high fatality rate of up to 30% caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV). However, no specific vaccine or antiviral therapy has been approved for clinical use. To develop an effective treatment, we isolated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). SF5 and SF83 are two neutralizing mAbs that recognize two viral glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), respectively. We found that their epitopes are closely located, and we then engineered them as several bispecific antibodies (bsAbs). Neutralization and animal experiments indicated that bsAbs display more potent protective effects than the parental mAbs, and the cryoelectron microscopy structure of a bsAb3 Fab-Gn-Gc complex elucidated the mechanism of protection. In vivo virus passage in the presence of antibodies indicated that two bsAbs resulted in less selective pressure and could efficiently bind to all single parental mAb-escape mutants. Furthermore, epitope analysis of the protective mAbs against SFTSV and RVFV indicated that they are all located on the Gn subdomain I, where may be the hot spots in the phleboviruses. Collectively, these data provide potential therapeutic agents and molecular basis for the rational design of vaccines against SFTSV infection.">

        <tr id="2520 Background: MCLA-145, a human common light chain bispecific antibody targeting CD137 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, is designed to enhance both antigen-mediated T cell activation via CD137 costimulation, and blockade of inhibitory PD-L1. Interim data from the ongoing phase 1 study (NCT03922204) are presented. Methods: Patients (pts) with PD-L1 ≥1% advanced/metastatic solid tumors received MCLA-145 IV as monotherapy Q2W/Q3W in 21/28-d cycles respectively, or in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W in 21-d cycles. Pts enrolled in combination had cancers that either relapsed after PD-(L)1 therapies or were immunotherapy naïve. Primary objectives are safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of MCLA-145 alone or combined with pembrolizumab, and determination of the recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Secondary endpoints include efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity. Results: As of a December 4, 2023 data cutoff, 72 pts with 26 cancer types were treated; 25% of pts had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 3 pts were continuing combination therapy. Monotherapy: 53 pts (median age 60 y, 49% male) were treated across 8 dose levels (47 pts 0.4-75 mg Q2W, 6 pts 40 mg Q3W). Median number of cycles was 2 (range 1-39). 6 pts had DLTs in the 25-75 mg dose range (febrile neutropenia [2 pts], hemolytic anemia, myositis, ALT/AST increase, neutrophil/platelet decrease [1 pt each]). Most common adverse events (AEs; all grades/G3-4) were fatigue (51%/4%), decreased appetite (34%/2%), dyspnea (32%/0%), anemia (30%/9%), ALT/AST increase (25%/11%), and pyrexia (25%/0%). The incidence of any G3-4 AE was lower with 40 mg Q3W than across all Q2W dose levels (33% vs 66%). Combination: 19 pts (median age 61 y, 47% male) were treated with MCLA-145 10, 25 or 40 mg plus Q3W. Median number of cycles was 5 (range 1-16). No DLTs occurred. Most common AEs (all grades/G3-4) were fatigue (58%/11%), cough (42%/0%), constipation (32%/0%) and ALT/AST increase (21%/11%). The RDE was established at 40 mg Q3W for both monotherapy and combination. Preliminary antitumor activity was observed with monotherapy (52 evaluable pts): 5 partial responses (PRs) in glioblastoma (lasting >3 y), sarcoma, cervical, anal, and gastric cancer (treated for 2-11 mo); and combination (19 evaluable pts): 1 PR in Merkel cell carcinoma (treated 12+ mo), 1 complete response in PD-L1+ NSCLC (treated 6+ mo), both after prior immunotherapy. Disease control rate was 37% with monotherapy and 68% with combination. Exposure was dose-dependent with a terminal half-life of 69 h at 75 mg. Measure of peripheral blood Ki67+ CD8 T cells supports maximal PD activity at 40 mg. Conclusions: MCLA-145 given alone or in combination with pembrolizumab had a well-tolerated and manageable safety profile with encouraging clinical activity, including in pts who relapsed after PD-(L)1 therapies.

        <tr id="Background Treatment strategies for Crohn’s disease (CD) suppress diverse inflammatory pathways but many patients remain refractory to treatment. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) has emerged as a therapy for medically refractory CD. SCT was developed to rescue cancer patients from myelosuppressive chemotherapy but its use for CD and other immune diseases necessitates reimagining SCT as a cellular therapy that restores appropriately responsive immune cell populations from hematopoietic progenitors in the stem cell autograft (i.e. immune “reset”). Here we present a paradigm to understand SCT as a cellular therapy for immune diseases and reveal how SCT re-establishes cellular immunity utilizing high-dimensional cellular phenotyping and functional studies of the stem cell grafts. Methods Immunophenotyping using CyTOF, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing was performed on peripheral blood and intestinal tissue samples from refractory CD patients who underwent SCT. The stem cell graft from these patients was analyzed using flow cytometry and functionally interrogated using a murine model for engraftment. Results Our study revealed a remodeling of intestinal macrophages capable of supporting mucosal healing that was independently validated using multimodal studies of immune reconstitution events including CyTOF and scRNA-seq. Functional interrogation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) using a xenograft model demonstrated that HSCs shape the timing of immune reconstitution, the selected reconstitution of specific cell lineages and potentially the clinical efficacy of SCT. Conclusions These studies indicate that SCT serves as a myeloid-directed cellular therapy re-establishing homeostatic intestinal macrophages that support intestinal healing and suggest refractory CD evolves from impairment of restorative functions in myeloid cells. Furthermore, we report heterogeneity among HSCs from CD patients which may drive SCT outcomes and suggests an unrecognized impact of CD pathophysiology on HSC in the marrow niche.">

Approval was based on overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate and duration of response (DOR) in 97 adult patients in a single-arm, open-label, multicenter phase 2 trial (CARTITUDE-1 [NCT03548207]). Patients received a single infusion of ciltacabtagene autoleucel, preceded by lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

        <tr id="The efficacies of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells and bispecific monoclonal antibodies (BiAbs) for triple-class refractory (TCR) myeloma have not previously been compared, and clinical data on how to rescue patients after relapse from these immunotherapies are limited. A retrospective study of 73 TCR patients included in trials was conducted: 36 received CAR-T and 37 received BiAbs. CAR-T produced a higher overall response rate (ORR) than BiAbs (97.1% vs. 56.8%, P=0.002). After a median of follow-up of 18.7 months, no significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was observed between the CAR-T and BiAbs groups (16.6 vs. 10.8 months; P=0.090), whereas overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in the CAR-T than in the BiAbs group (49.2 vs. 22.6 months; P=0.021). BiAbs following CAR-T yielded a higher ORR and longer PFS2 than did non-redirecting T cell therapies after CAR-T (ORR: 87.5% vs. 50.0%, PFS2: 22.9 vs. 12.4 months). By contrast, BiAbs following BiAbs resulted in an ORR of 33% and PFS2 of 8.4 months, which was similar to that produced by the non-redirecting T cell therapies (ORR: 28.6%, PFS2: 8.1 months). Even though this is a pooled analysis of different trials with different products and the patient profile is different for CAR-T and BiAbs, both were effective therapies for TCR myeloma. However, in our experience, while the PFS was similar with the two approaches, CAR-T therapy resulted in better OS, mainly because of the efficacy of BiAbs as rescue therapy. Our results highlight the importance of treatment sequence in real-word experience.">

Five patients with relapsed or refractory CD37+ lymphoid malignancies were enrolled and infused with autologous CAR-37 T-cells. CAR-37 T-cells expanded in the peripheral blood of all patients and, at peak, comprised >94% of the total lymphocytes in 4/5 patients. Tumor responses were observed in 4/5 patients, with 3 complete responses, 1 mixed response, and 1 patient whose disease progressed rapidly and with relative loss of CD37 expression. Three patients experienced prolonged and severe pancytopenia, and in two of these patients, efforts to ablate CAR-37 T-cells (which were engineered to co-express truncated EGFR) with cetuximab, were unsuccessful. Hematopoiesis was restored in these two patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No other severe, non-hematopoietic toxicities occurred. We investigated the mechanisms of profound pancytopenia and did not observe activation of CAR-37 T-cells in response to hematopoietic stem cells in vitro or hematotoxicity in humanized models. Patients with pancytopenia had sustained high levels of IL-18, with low levels of IL-18 binding protein in their peripheral blood. IL-18 levels were significantly higher in CAR-37-treated patients relative to both cytopenic and non-cytopenic cohorts of CAR-19-treated cohorts of patients. In conclusion, CAR-37 T-cells exhibited anti-tumor activity, with significant CAR expansion and cytokine production. CAR-37 T-cells may be an effective therapy in hematologic malignancies as a bridge to hematopoietic stem cell transplant.">

Elotuzumab is administered via intravenous (IV) infusion at an established dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1, 8, 15, 22 every 28 days for cycles 1 and 2; followed by 20mg/kg on day 1 of each 28-day cycle. Belantamab mafodotin is administered via IV infusion with the starting dose of 1.9 mg/kg IV at every 4-week interval, with subsequent dose-reduction based on toxicity. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient demographics and safety and efficacy outcomes. Results: As of data cut-off (January 20, 2024) 12 subjects have been enrolled; and 10 subjects received treatment on study. Median age of patients was 66.5 years (range 59-79). The patient population was heavily pretreated with 5 prior median lines of therapy (range 2-8); 40% (4/10) of patients were refractory to prior BCMA-targeted therapy (2 post-BCMA bispecific antibody, 2 post-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy [CART]). Phase I part of the study has completed. Median duration of treatment was 4 months (range 2-19). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Four severe adverse events were observed possibly related to the study treatment in 3 patients, including grade 3 pulmonary infection (n=1) and lymphopenia (n=3). Ocular keratopathy developed in 40% of patients, all were grades 1-2 and resolved after discontinuation or dose-reduction of belantamab. Preliminary activity is noted with partial responses (PR) in 4/10 (40%) and stable disease (SD) in additional 3/10 (30%) of patients. Among the four patients who were refractory to prior BCMA therapy, 2 (50%) achieved PR, with duration of response (DOR) of 19 months and 9 months, respectively. Conclusions: This novel combination immune therapy with belantamab mafodotin and elotuzumab appears to have an encouraging safety profile and a promising preliminary efficacy in patients with heavily pretreated RRMM, including in those with prior failure of BCMA-targeted therapy.

        <tr id="Adoptive immunotherapy with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-specific T cells is an effective treatment for relapsed or refractory EBV-induced post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) with overall survival rates of up to 69%. EBV-specific T cells have been conventionally made by repeated stimulation with EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), which act as antigen-presenting cells. However, this process is expensive, takes many months, and has practical risks associated with live virus. We have developed a peptide-based, virus-free, serum-free closed system to manufacture a bank of virus-specific T cells (VST) for clinical use. We compared these with standard LCL-derived VST using comprehensive characterization and potency assays to determine differences that might influence clinical benefits. Multi-parameter flow cytometry revealed that peptide-derived VST had an expanded central memory population and less exhaustion marker expression than LCL-derived VST. A quantitative HLA-matched allogeneic cytotoxicity assay demonstrated similar specific killing of EBV-infected targets, though peptide-derived EBV T cells had a significantly higher expression of antiviral cytokines and degranulation markers after antigen recall. High-throughput T cell receptor-beta (TCRβ) sequencing demonstrated oligoclonal repertoires, with more matches to known EBV-binding complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences in peptide-derived EBV T cells. Peptide-derived products showed broader and enhanced specificities to EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) in both CD8 and CD4 compartments, which may improve the targeting of highly expressed latency antigens in PTLD. Importantly, peptide-based isolation and expansion allows rapid manufacture and significantly increased product yield over conventional LCL-based approaches.">

        <tr id="7024 Background: The EHA/EBMT immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT) grading system characterizes hematotoxicity after CAR T-cell therapy based on depth and duration of neutropenia (Rejeski et al, Blood, 2023). We evaluated pre- and post-infusion factors associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT and developed a predictive model in 602 patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing CAR T-cell therapy at Fred Hutch Cancer Center. Methods: Grading of early hematotoxicity (day-0-30 after CAR T-cell cell infusion) was automated using the heatwaveR package. Associations with 50 patient, disease-related, and laboratory factors, and grade 3-4 ICAHT were modeled using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Results: The most common disease types were aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n = 293; 49%), indolent NHL (n = 150; 25%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 94; 16%). The most common CAR T-cell products were the investigational CD19 CAR T-cell product JCAR014 (n = 197; 33%), axicabtagene ciloleucel (n = 129; 21%), and lisocabtagene maraleucel (n = 73; 12%). Incidences of early ICAHT grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 319 (53%), 96 (16%), 60 (10%), and 35 (6%) patients, respectively. Baseline patient factors associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT included ALL (reference: aggressive NHL, OR = 4.18, 95% CI, 2.41-7.26, p < 0.001) , Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (OR = 2.17, 95% CI, 1.07-4.20, p = 0.025), and lower age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.02-1.05, p < 0.001). Pre-lymphodepletion (LD) laboratory factors associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT in univariate analyses included lower ANC (OR = 6.67 per log10 cells/μL, 95% CI, 4.0-11.1, p < 0.001), LDH (OR = 8.70per log10U/L, 95% CI, 4.03-19.4, p < 0.001), CRP (OR = 3.18 per log10mg/L, 95% CI, 2.06-5.07, p < 0.001), and ferritin (OR = 6.07 per log10mg/L, 95% CI, 3.65-10.6, p < 0.001). Peak CRP (OR = 15.6, 95% CI, 7.27-36.4, p < 0.001), peak ferritin (OR = 7.41, 95% CI, 5.02-11.3, p < 0.001), peak CRS grade (OR = 2.01, 95% CI, 1.59-2.56, p < 0.001), and peak ICANS grade (OR = 1.51, 95% CI, 1.29-1.77, p < 0.001) after CAR T-cell infusion were also strongly associated with grade 3-4 ICAHT. A multivariable model using restricted cubic splines and including disease type, pre-LD ANC, pre-LD LDH, peak CRP, peak ferritin, and CRS grade demonstrated high discrimination to predict grade 3-4 ICAHT (C-index = 0.89). Internal validation using bootstrapping showed near-perfect calibration without overfitting. Sensitivity and specificity based on the Youden criteria was 74% and 90%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the CAR-HEMATOTOX score in predicting grade 3-4 ICAHT was 93% and 30%, respectively. Conclusions: We identified pre- and post-infusion predictors of grade 3-4 ICAHT and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model including disease-type, pre-LD ANC, pre-LD LDH, peak CRP, peak ferritin, and CRS grade. We plan to further evaluate our model in an external cohort.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells offer many advantages over autologous therapies, but their benefits are curtailed by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and elimination by recipient immune cells. Moreover, just as with autologous therapies, allogeneic CAR T cells are susceptible to activation-induced cell death (AICD) caused by chronic antigen exposure (CAE). Granzyme B (GzmB) and Fas/FasL-initiated, caspase-mediated apoptosis are key mechanisms of T-cell death caused by T/NK cell-mediated allorejection or CAE. We explored a protective strategy of engineering CAR T cells to overexpress variants of the GzmB-specific serine protease inhibitor, SerpinB9 (SB9), to improve allogeneic T-cell persistence and antitumor efficacy. We showed that the overexpression of an SB9 variant with broadened caspase specificity, SB9(CAS), not only significantly reduced rejection of allogeneic CAR T cells, but also increased their resistance to AICD and enabled them to thrive better under CAE, thus improving allogeneic T-cell persistence and antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, while SB9(CAS)-overexpression improved the efficacy of allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy by conferring protection to cell death, we did not observe any autonomous growth and the engineered CAR T cells were still susceptible to an inducible suicide switch. Hence, SB9(CAS)-overexpression is a promising strategy that can strengthen current development of cell therapies, broadening their applications to address unmet medical needs.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has ushered in substantial advancements in the management of various B-cell malignancies. However, its integration into chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treatment has been challenging, attributed largely to the development of very effective chemo-free alternatives. Additionally, CAR T-cell responses in CLL have not been as high as in other B-cell lymphomas or leukemias. However, a critical void exists in therapeutic options for patients with high-risk diseases who are resistant to the current CLL therapies, underscoring the urgency for adoptive immunotherapies in these patients. The diminished CAR T-cell efficacy within CLL can be traced to factors such as compromised T-cell fitness due to persistent antigenic stimulation inherent to CLL. Resistance mechanisms encompass tumor-related factors like antigen escape, CAR T-cell-intrinsic factors like T-cell exhaustion, and a suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). New strategies to combat CAR T-cell resistance include the concurrent administration of therapies that augment CAR T-cell endurance and function, as well as the engineering of novel CAR T-cells targeting different antigens. Moreover, the concept of “armored” CAR T-cells, armed with transgenic modulators to modify both CAR T-cell function and the tumor milieu, is gaining traction. Beyond this, the development of readily available, allogeneic CAR T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells presents a promising countermeasure to innate T-cell defects in CLL patients. In this review, we explore the role of CAR T-cell therapy in CLL, the intricate tapestry of resistance mechanisms, and the pioneering methods studied to overcome resistance.">

        <tr id="The activity of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with Richter's transformation (RT) to aggressive large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) is largely unknown. In a multicenter retrospective study, we report the safety and efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in patients with RT (n=30) compared to patients with aggressive B cell lymphoma (n=283) and patients with transformed indolent Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (iNHL) (n=141) between April 2016 and January 2023. Two-thirds of patients received prior therapy for CLL before RT and 89% of them received B-cell receptor and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. Toxicities of CAR T cell therapy in RT were similar to other lymphomas, with no fatalities related to cytokine release syndrome or immune effector-cell associated neurotoxicity synderome. The 100-day overall response rate and complete response rates in patients with RT were 57% and 47%, respectively. With a median follow up of 19 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 9.9 months in patients with RT compared to 18 months in de-novo LBCL and not reached in patients with transformed iNHL. The OS at 12 months was 45% in patients with RT compared with 62% and 75% in patients with de novo LBCL and transformed iNHL, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, worse OS was associated with RT histology, elevated LDH, and more prior lines of therapy. CAR T cell therapy can salvage a proportion of patients with CLL and RT exposed to prior targeted agents; however, efficacy in RT is inferior compared to de novo LBCL and transformed iNHL.">

        <tr id="Globally, the efforts to find the best cancer treatment are demanding and very intensive. Immunotherapy has gained an important role as a second or sometimes first line of treatment for various types of cancer. PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are an impending category of immunotherapy, and their mechanism, as well as their interaction with T cells, are well studied. However, our knowledge about any possible effect(s) of immunotherapy on B cells is limited. In this prospective study, we asked the question of any possible alterations of circulating B cells (numbers and subsets) occurring during immunotherapy in patients with cancer and of the potential correlation of such changes with the outcomes and with development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). We enrolled 20 cancer patients who received PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors and 8 healthy donors (HD). Patients underwent regular clinical assessment and imaging using the iRECIST criteria for 6 months following immunotherapy. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and during PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed, evaluating various circulating B cell subset phenotypes, including mature naïve B cells, memory B cells, regulatory B cells (Bregs), antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), and age-related B cells (ABCs). Statistical analysis was employed to compare the differences of B cells between different groups and among sequential data within the same group. Total circulating CD19+ B cell counts remained stable across both groups (responders (R), nonresponders (NR)) and timepoints. However, there was a significant rise in mature naïve B cells and decline in memory B cells at the initiation of the treatment in the R group compared to healthy donors and to the NR group. Such changes were correlated with a good response to immunotherapy. On the contrary, higher numbers of ABCs at baseline were seen in the NR group and were correlated with resistance to treatment. As far as immune-related adverse events are concerned, no significant changes were recorded among the different B cell subpopulations evaluated in both groups. Our study provides preliminary data suggesting that B cell subset changes during immunotherapy may correlate with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced clinical responses in patients with neoplasia. Further investigations to delineate the potential role(s) of B cells in patients undergoing immunotherapy are needed.">

        <tr id="e19005 Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor modified R Cell Immunotherapy (CAR-T) cell products have revolutionized the landscape of treatment of relapsed and refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies and multiple myeloma. Yet, these therapies emerged with their own challenges, Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are the most common and serious adverse events. The model of CAR-T cell therapy in the University of Oklahoma is unique as it is designated as an outpatient therapy. Little is known regarding risk factors for hospitalization after CAR-T therapy. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of all consecutive adult patients who had CAR-T therapy from 9/1/2019 through 9/30/2023 at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC). Inclusion criteria were adult patients with hematologic malignancies who received an FDA approved CAR-T therapy. Exclusion criteria included patients who were younger than 18 at the time of infusion, those who received cellular therapy for solid tumors and those who received investigational CAR-T cell products. Descriptive statistics were created for continuous and categorical variables. Chi-Square analysis and independent samples t-tests were used to measure association with hospital admission and treatment response. Logistic regression was used to explore associations for all covariates with each outcome. SAS 9.4 was used to perform all analysis. An alpha of 0.05 was used to determine significance. Results: A total of 118 patients received outpatient CAR-T/Cellular therapy at OUHSC during the study period with 78 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. The mean age at time of infusion was 58.6 (range=18-85) with most being male (n=46, 59.0%), White (n=63, 80.8%), and overweight/obese (n=50, 64.1%). The majority of patients received anti CD19 CAR-T (n=64, 82.1%) while 18.0% received anti BCMA products. CRS grade 0,1 occurred in 79.5% of patients (n=62) and 79.2% of patients were hospitalized within 30 days after CAR-T therapy (Median day of admission post CAR-T=5.5). Of patients who were hospitalized 26% had grades 2-4 CRS. Complete remission was achieved in 54.7% of patients. We compared the hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients across multiple characteristics, there was no association or predictors of hospitalization found. Albumin was the only predictor for CR. Conclusions: Our study provides data for safety and feasibility of outpatient CAR-T therapy despite potential risks for hospitalization. There are no clear predictors for hospitalizations after CAR-T therapy except for the development of CRS and ICAN. Higher baseline (pre-CAR-T) serum Albumin level was associated with higher odds of achieving CR.">

The study included 133 untreated JDM children with an NK cell count evaluation before treatment. NK cell subsets (CD56low/dim vs. CD 56bright) were examined in 9 untreated children. CD56 and perforin were evaluated in situ in six untreated JDM and three orthopedic, pediatric controls. 56% of treatment-naive JDM had reduced circulating NK cell counts, designated “low NK cell”. This low NK group had more active muscle disease compared to the normal NK cell group. The percentage of circulating CD56low/dim NK cells was significantly lower in the NK low group than in controls (0.55% vs. 4.6% p < 0.001). Examination of the untreated JDM diagnostic muscle biopsy documented an increased infiltration of CD56 and perforin-positive cells (p = 0.023, p = 0.038, respectively). Treatment-naive JDM with reduced circulating NK cell counts exhibited more muscle weakness and higher levels of serum muscle enzymes. Muscle biopsies from treatment-naive JDM displayed increased NK cell infiltration, with increased CD56 and perforin-positive cells.">

        <tr id="Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an antibody-mediated autoimmune disease with a prevalence of 150–250 cases per million individuals. Autoantibodies include long-lived antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), mainly of the IgG1 subclass, and IgG4, produced almost exclusively by short-lived plasmablasts, which are prevalent in muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) myasthenia gravis. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that MG patients receiving conventional medication today still do not possess satisfactory symptom control, indicating a substantial disease burden. Subsequently, based on the type of the autoantibody and the pathogenesis, we synthesized the published material to date and reached a conclusion regarding the literature related to personalized targeted therapy for MG. Novel agents for AChR MG have shown their efficacy in clinical research, such as complement inhibitors, FcRn receptor antagonists, and B-cell activating factor (BAFF) inhibitors. Rituximab, a representative drug of anti-CD20 therapy, has demonstrated benefits in treatment of MuSK MG patients. Due to the existence of low-affinity antibodies or unidentified antibodies that are inaccessible by existing methods, the treatment for seronegative MG remains complicated; thus, special testing and therapy considerations are necessary. It may be advantageous to initiate the application of novel biologicals at an early stage of the disease. Currently, therapies can also be combined and individualized according to different types of antibodies. With such a wide range of drugs, how to tailor treatment strategies to patients with various conditions and find the most suitable solution for each MG profile are our necessary and urgent aims.">

        <tr id="TPS7085 Background: Autologous (auto) CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy can induce long-term remissions for pts with R/R LBCL but approximately 60% will experience disease progression resulting in poor outcomes (Neelapu, 2023; Zurko, 2023). CRG-022 is a novel CAR T-cell product targeting CD22, a common B-cell antigen widely expressed in LBCL. Key features of CRG-022 include a fully human scFv derived from the m971 monoclonal antibody and 4-1BB/CD3z intracellular signaling domains (Singh, 2021). This CD22 CAR construct was developed at the National Cancer Institute and was investigated in phase (ph) 1 studies of pediatric/young adult pts with R/R CD22+ malignancies (Shah, 2020; NCT02315612) and at Stanford University in adults with R/R LBCL (Baird, 2021; NCT04088890) primarily in pts who received prior CD19-directed CAR-T therapy. The Stanford ph 1b study reported an overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rates of 66% and 52%, respectively in 29 pts treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 1x106 CAR+ T cells/kg (Frank, 2023). After a median follow-up of 27.3 months, the median overall survival had not been reached at the RP2D (Su, 2023). At the RP2D, no grade >3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune-effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), or immune effector cell associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome (IEC-HS) occurred; two pts (7%) developed grade 2 IEC-HS (Su, 2023; Srinagesh, 2023). Based on these notable results, this potentially pivotal ph 2 trial has been initiated. Methods: This Phase 2 study will evaluate the safety/efficacy of CRG-022 at 1x106 CAR+ T cells/kg in pts with R/R LBCL whose disease has progressed after CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. The primary endpoint is ORR according to Lugano response criteria (Cheson, 2014) by blinded independent review. Adverse events (AEs) are graded per CTCAE v5 except with CRS, ICANS, and IEC-HS graded per ASTCT guidelines. Pts with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL transformed from follicular or marginal zone lymphoma, follicular large B-cell lymphoma (FLBL)/FL Grade 3B, and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma are eligible. Other eligibility criteria include adequate hematologic and organ function, and no prior allogeneic stem cell transplant. Pts with prior treatment to both a CD19-directed auto CAR-T and a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody are also eligible within a separate cohort. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day for 3 days will be administered ahead of a single infusion of CRG-022. The study is designed to enroll approximately 123 pts. Study enrollment commenced in the US in August 2023, with 9 pt infused as of 08 JAN 2024. Clinical trial information: NCT05972720 .">

        <tr id="Multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance are plasma cell dyscrasias characterized by monoclonal proliferation of pathological plasma cells with uncontrolled production of immunoglobulins. Autoimmune pathologies are conditions in which T and B lymphocytes develop a tendency to activate towards self-antigens in the absence of exogenous triggers. The aim of our review is to show the possible correlations between the two pathological aspects. Molecular studies have shown how different cytokines that either cause inflammation or control the immune system play a part in the growth of immunotolerance conditions that make it easier for the development of neoplastic malignancies. Uncontrolled immune activation resulting in chronic inflammation is also known to be at the basis of the evolution toward neoplastic pathologies, as well as multiple myeloma. Another point is the impact that myeloma-specific therapies have on the course of concomitant autoimmune diseases. Indeed, cases have been observed of patients suffering from multiple myeloma treated with daratumumab and bortezomib who also benefited from their autoimmune condition or patients under treatment with immunomodulators in which there has been an arising or worsening of autoimmunity conditions. The role of bone marrow transplantation in the course of concomitant autoimmune diseases remains under analysis.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction While CAR T-cell therapy has led to remarkable responses in relapsed B-cell hematologic malignancies, only 50% of patients ultimately have a complete, sustained response. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance and relapse after CAR T-cell therapy is crucial to future development and improving outcomes. Areas covered We review reasons for both primary resistance and relapse after CAR T-cell therapies. Reasons for primary failure include CAR T-cell manufacturing problems, suboptimal fitness of autologous T-cells themselves, and intrinsic features of the underlying cancer and tumor microenvironment. Relapse after initial response to CAR T-cell therapy may be antigen-positive, due to CAR T-cell exhaustion or limited persistence, or antigen-negative, due to antigen-modulation on the target cells. Finally, we discuss ongoing efforts to overcome resistance to CAR T-cell therapy with enhanced CAR constructs, manufacturing methods, alternate cell types, combinatorial strategies, and optimization of both pre-infusion conditioning regimens and post-infusion consolidative strategies. Expert opinion There is a continued need for novel approaches to CAR T-cell therapy for both hematologic and solid malignancies to obtain sustained remissions. Opportunities for improvement include development of new targets, optimally combining existing CAR T-cell therapies, and defining the role for adjunctive immune modulators and stem cell transplant in enhancing long-term survival.">

        <tr id="Background: Chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a breakdown of immune tolerance; in ITP, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys platelets. This study aims to investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of FOXP3 in chronic ITP.
Methods: Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes from 20 patients with chronic ITP (CITP), 20 acute ITP (AITP) controls, and 20 healthy individuals.
CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with CITP using magnetic beads and then treated with phosphate-buffered saline solution or decitabine (a methylation inhibitor) for 48 h. The levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10, and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) in the plasma and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were assessed by Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). FOXP3 level was measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was adopted to detect the status of FOXP3 methylation.
Results: The number of Treg cells and the contents of IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β1 decreased in patients with CITP, compared to the AITP control group and normal group. FOXP3 expression was reduced and FOXP3 methylation increased in patients with CITP, compared to the AITP control group and normal group. Hypermethylation of FOXP3 promoter led to decrease in FOXP3 level in Treg cells. Inhibition of FOXP3 promoter hypermethylation promoted the secretion of IL-2, IL-10, and TGF-β1 in Treg cells.
Conclusion: The number of Treg cells in CITP patients decreased, and the hypermethylation of FOXP3 promoter led to reduction of its expression in Treg cells, thus affecting the immune functioning of Treg cells.

Although significant advances have been made in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), leading to unprecedented response and survival rates among patients, the majority eventually relapse, and a cure remains elusive. This situation is closely related to an incomplete understanding of the immune microenvironment, especially monocytes/macrophages in patients with treatment-naïve MM. The aim of this study was to provide insight into the immune microenvironment, especially monocytes/macrophages, in patients with treatment-naïve MM.


METHODS
This study used the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of both patients with MM and heathy donors to identify immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and monocytes/macrophages. Transcriptomic data and flow cytometry analysis of monocytes/macrophages were used to further examine the effect of monocytes/macrophages in treatment-naïve MM patients.


RESULTS
A significant difference was observed between the bone marrow (BM) immune cells of the healthy controls and treatment-naïve MM patients through scRNA-seq. It is noteworthy that, through an scRNA-seq data analysis, this study found that interferon (IFN)-induced NK/T cells, terminally differentiated effector memory (TEMRA) cells, T-helper cells characterized by expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG + Th cells), IFN-responding exhausted T cells, mannose receptor C-type 1 (MRC1) + DCs, IFN-responding DCs, MHCII + DCs, and immunosuppressive monocytes/macrophages are enriched in patients with treatment-naïve MM. Significantly, transcriptomic data of monocytes/macrophages demonstrated that "don't eat me"-related genes and IFN-induced genes increase in treatment-naïve MM patients. Furthermore, scRNA-seq, transcriptomic data, and flow cytometry also showed an increased proportion of CD16 + monocytes/macrophages and expression level of CD16. Cell-cell communication analysis indicated that monocytes/macrophages, especially the migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and interleukin 16 (IL-16) signaling pathway, are key players in treatment-naïve MM patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings provide a comprehensive and in-depth molecular characterization of BM immune cell census in MM patients, especially for monocytes/macrophages. Targeting macrophages may be a novel treatment strategy for patients with MM.">

        <tr id="e14694 Background: PM1022 is an anti-PD-L1 × TIGIT bispecific antibody that is engineered with a fully human IgG targeting TIGIT in an IgG1 wild type Fc backbone, fused to a VHH at the c-terminus targeting PD-L1. The potential MOA includes releasing T cell inhibition by blocking both the PD-L1/PD-1 and CD155/CD112/TIGIT pathways, as well as depleting Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment and engaging FcγRs to activate myeloid cells. PM1022 showed robust in vitro and in vivo efficacy in preclinical studies, and this is the first in human study. Methods: This phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ study consists of a standard 3+3 dose escalation and dose expansion part. PM1022 was administered intravenously as monotherapy on Day 1 of 21-day cycle. The primary objectives were to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in patients with advanced solid tumors. Results: As of January 28, 2024, a total of 15 patients in dose escalation part have received at least 1 dose of PM1022, with 3 patients in each of the 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1200 mg dose levels respectively. No DLT was observed up to 1200 mg. Of the 15 patients, TRAEs occurred in 8 patients (53.3%), ≥ Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 1 patient with platelet count decreased. No patients were discontinued from PM1022 due to TRAE. The most common TRAEs were rash (20%) and aspartate transaminase increased (20%). 14 patients completed at least one tumor evaluation. The median duration of PM1022 exposure was 6.1 weeks (range, 5.0-48.0 weeks). The ORR per RECIST 1.1 was 7.1% with a DCR of 35.7%. Preliminary antitumor activity has been observed in 1 patient with NSCLC (1200 mg, still on treatment) with previous PD-L1 TPS 100% who was enrolled after previous 3 lines therapy, including chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 treatment, and had a partial response in target lesion with 56.8% reduction. Another patient with esophageal cancer had been on PM1022 for total of 48 weeks until initiation of new anti-cancer therapy. Pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional with a terminal half-life of 7-13 days across the dose range of 100-1200 mg. Conclusions: PM1022 was safe and well-tolerated up to 1200 mg Q3W with preliminary anti-tumor activity. These findings could support further exploration of PM1022 in advanced solid tumors.

Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is characterized by autoantibodies targeting keratinocytes adhesion proteins desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and 3, and by the HLA-DRB1-0402 predisposition allele. Treatment using rituximab (RTX) combined with short-term corticosteroids (CS) allows disease control and long-lasting remission.


OBJECTIVE
The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of RTX on the circulating subpopulations of Dsg-3-specific T lymphocytes that specifically regulate B cell responses: follicular helper (Tfh) and follicular regulatory T (Tfr) lymphocytes.


METHODS
Using the HLA-DRB1-0402 tetramer loaded with the Dsg-3 immunodominant peptide, we analysed by flow cytometry the frequency, the polarisation and the activation status of blood Dsg-3-specific follicular T cell populations at baseline, Month 6 and long-term follow-up (Month 60-90) from PV patients.


RESULTS
At baseline, we observed a predominance of Tfh1* and Tfh17 subsets and an underrepresentation of the Tfh2 subset among autoreactive Dsg-3-specific Tfh cells as compared with non-autoreactive Tfh cells. RTX treatment induced a decrease of autoreactive Tfh cells with no effect on their polarisation during patients' follow-up. In parallel, we observed the emergence of a Dsg-3-specific Tfr subpopulation with a significant overexpression of the surface activation markers PD1, ICOS, and CD25 that was not observed at the surface of autoreactive Tfh and non-autoreactive Tfr cells of the same PV patients. In contrast, a very few Dsg-3 specific Tfr cells were observed in PV patients treated with CS alone.


CONCLUSION
Here we show that the emergence of circulating autoreactive Dsg-3-specific Tfr cells is associated with the long-term efficacy of RTX in PV patients.">

        <tr id="6552 Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (alloHSCT) offer a potential curative treatment for many hematological cancers, however, traditional alloHSCT is associated with high mortality from complications including infection, graft versus host disease (GvHD) and relapse. Orca-T is an investigational allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy that includes stem and immune cells, derived from allogeneic donors, that leverages highly purified, polyclonal donor regulatory T cells to control alloreactive immune responses. In this sub-group analysis, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who were treated with Orca-T. Methods: Data from 37 patients with the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in CR/CRi who received myeloablative conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa (BFT) followed by Orca-T by 6/30/22 as part of a multicenter phase 1b single-arm trial (NCT04013685) are reported here. Patients enrolled in the phase 1b trial who did not meet these criteria were not included in this analysis. Patients received BFT prior to Orca-T, followed by single-agent GvHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus, and had an 8/8 related or unrelated matched donor. Donors were matched via DNA-based high-resolution typing of HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1. Results: Orca-T was successfully manufactured at a centralized GMP facility, distributed, and infused at study sites throughout the U.S. Vein-to-vein time (i.e. time between end of donor apheresis to start of recipient’s Orca-T infusion) was < 72 hours for all patients, with the majority < 60 hours. Median age was 51 years, 49% were female and 16% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Twenty-three (62%) had matched related donors and 14 (38%) had matched unrelated donors. Baseline HCT-CI score was 3 and 4 in 27% and 8% of the patients, respectively. The majority had intermediate DRI scores (89%) and 41% were MRD positive at baseline. The median duration of follow-up was 14 months. Relapse-free survival at 12 months was 81.4% (95% CI: 62.9, 91.2). Non-relapse mortality and overall survival were 0% and 100% at 12 months, respectively. Conclusions: These encouraging results suggest that investigational Orca-T could represent a reduced toxicity alternative to conventional alloHSCT. This combination of Orca-T with myeloablative BFT led to > 80% RFS without treatment related mortality, and 100% overall survival in this AML patient population. These outcomes were accomplished with consistent and reliable cell manufacturing and distribution of Orca-T at a national scale. A multi-center randomized controlled phase 3 trial comparing Orca-T to SOC, utilizing BFT or TBI-based conditioning, will complete enrollment during the first half of 2024. (NCT05316701).

        <tr id="B cell initial activity is regulated through a balance of activation and suppression mediated by regulatory molecules expressed in B cells; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the function of the Fc receptor-like (Fcrl) family molecule Fcrl5, which is constitutively expressed on naïve B cells, in humoral immune responses. Our study demonstrated that B cell-specific overexpression of Fcrl5 enhanced antibody (Ab) production in both T cell-independent type 1 (TI1) and T cell-dependent (TD) responses. Additionally, it promoted effector B cell formation under competitive conditions in TD responses. Mechanistically, in vitro ligation of Fcrl5 by agonistic Abs reduced cell death and enhanced proliferation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated B cells. In the presence of anti-CD40 Abs and IL-5, the Fcrl5 ligation not only suppressed cell death but also enhanced differentiation into plasma cells. These findings reveal a novel role of Fcrl5 in promoting humoral immune responses by enhancing B cell viability and plasma cell differentiation.">

        <tr id="2521 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) relieve immunosuppression of tumor-reactive T cells and enhance antitumor immune response; however, not all patients benefit and some become refractory. EIK1001 is a Toll-like receptor (TLR)7/8 agonist that stimulates myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, activating immune and inflammatory responses. This dual activity provides another pathway, distinct from effects on checkpoint proteins, to enhance antitumor T-cell activity alone or in combination with ICIs. Methods: Study BDB001-101 was a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation/expansion study of EIK1001 as either monotherapy (mono Rx; previously reported) or combined with pembrolizumab (comb Rx). Enrollment criteria included participants (pts) ≥ age 18 with confirmed, RECIST-measurable advanced solid tumors. Primary study objectives included safety and tolerability, and secondary objectives included evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy by RECIST 1.1. During comb Rx dose escalation, pts received a range of doses of EIK1001 (QW IV) in combination with pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W). Results: Fifty-one pts (median age 67 [range 33 to 86]) with multiple, distinct histological tumor types and with a median of 3 prior Rx regimens were enrolled. Overall, a total of 42/51 (82.4%) comb Rx pts experienced a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). A total of 9/51 (17.7%) experienced a ≥ Grade 3 TRAE, including fatigue, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), hemiparesis, hypertension, joint range of motion reduced, muscular weakness, pancreatitis, rash (maculopapular), skin plaque, and stomatitis. Overall, 5/51 (9.8%) experienced manageable CRS, with only 1 discontinuation due to CRS. There were no deaths due to TRAEs. Of the efficacy-evaluable pts (n = 50), complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) was observed for 7/50 (14.0%), including 3 CR and 4 PR. Disease control (including CR, PR, or stable disease) was observed in 24/50 (48.0%). The median duration of response was 10 months (range = 4 to 32 months). Responses were observed in pts with prior anti-PD-1 exposure as well as in those with low or negative PD-L1 tumor expression. EIK1001 PK was linear and dose-proportional, and combination with pembrolizumab did not affect EIK1001 PK. Conclusions: Overall, EIK1001 was well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile and showed encouraging preliminary efficacy across several tumor types in combination with pembrolizumab. Responses were observed even in heavily pretreated patients not anticipated to respond to pembrolizumab monotherapy. Further development of EIK1001 is underway.

        <tr id="e19059 Background: Loncastuximab tesirine-lpy (Lonca) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising an anti-CD19 antibody conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer cytotoxin. Epcoritamab-bysp (Epco) is a CD20×CD3 T cell-engaging bispecific antibody (bsAb) that redirects T-cells to eliminate malignant B-cells. Epco and Lonca target different B-cell surface antigens and combining both is expected to have additive or synergistic efficacy. Previously, a novel QSP model for Lonca was developed (Utsey K et al. Clin Pharmacol Drug Dev. 2023;12:123-125) and validated with clinical data from patients with R/R DLBCL (Caimi P et al. Blood. 2022;140:9548-9550). A combination QSP model for Lonca with Epco in R/R DLBCL was described to predict potential anti-tumor synergies in proposed clinical trials. Methods: The model reduced previous Lonca model complexity while maintaining core functionality and was combined with a published QSP model for T-cell bsAbs (Hosseini I et al. Npj Syst Bio Appl. 2020;6(1):1-11) to predict tumor dynamics after Lonca and/or Epco treatment. Assumptions included: 1) Lonca or Epco induce healthy and malignant B-cell killing; 2) tumor comprises malignant B- & T-cells; 3) tumor volume is based on malignant B-cell count; 4) T-cells can enter or leave tumor as with other tissues; 5) CD19-/low CD20+ B-cells account for tumor heterogeneity from cells insensitive to Lonca treatment. Results: Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was predicted to plateau by Cycle (C) 2 with Epco monotherapy. By end of C3, however, predicted median normalized tumor volume reduction with co-dosing Lonca and Epco was approximately 1 log order greater than Epco alone. Maximum activity of Lonca and Epco therapy was not observed until C4 or later as depth of tumor regression increased with additional treatment cycles. Since patients with DLBCL may present with low T-cell counts (Hutchings et al. Lancet. 2021) the effect of T-cell count at baseline was evaluated. A 50% decrease at baseline from 2000-1000 T-cells/µL significantly reduced antitumor effect with Epco alone but made no difference with Lonca in combination. Conclusions: These results resemble predictions for Lonca in combination with other bsAbs (Lonca plus mosunetuzumab or glofitamab; abstract submitted to AACR 2024). By end of C3, Lonca plus Epco was predicted to promote substantially more TGI than Epco or Lonca alone. While increased doses of Lonca from 90-150 µg/kg in combination had limited additional therapeutic benefit, combination treatment beyond C3 was predicted to increase depth of tumor regression. Response from Lonca and Epco co-dosing was predicted to be less affected by suppressed T-cell counts at baseline compared to Epco alone; a feature that may enhance responsiveness when T-cell level is moderate.">

        <tr id="CD70 is an attractive target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of both solid and liquid malignancies. However, the functionality of CD70-specific CAR T cells is modest. We optimized a CD70-specific VHH-based CAR (nanoCAR). We evaluated the nanoCARs in clinically relevant models in vitro, using co-cultures of CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells with malignant rhabdoid tumor organoids, and in vivo, using a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Whereas the nanoCAR T cells were highly efficient in organoid co-cultures, they showed only modest efficacy in the PDX model. We determined that fratricide was not causing this loss in efficacy, rather CD70 interaction in cis with the nanoCAR induced exhaustion. Knocking out CD70 in nanoCAR T cells using CRISPR/Cas9, resulted in dramatically enhanced functionality in the DLBCL PDX model. Through single-cell transcriptomics, we obtained evidence that CD70 knock out (KO) CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells were protected from antigen-induced exhaustion. In addition, we demonstrated that WT CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells already exhibited signs of exhaustion shortly after production. Their gene signature strongly overlapped with gene signatures of exhausted CAR T cells. On the other hand, the gene signature of KO CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells overlapped with the gene signature of CAR T-cell infusion products that led to complete responses in chronic lymphatic leukemia patients. Our data show that CARs targeting endogenous T-cell antigens negatively affect CAR T-cell functionality by inducing an exhausted state, which can be overcome by knocking out the specific target.">

        <tr id="2546 Background: SUPLEXA therapeutic cells are the initial autologous and non-engineered candidate to emerge from the novel ENLIST cells training platform. Manufacturing is robust, reproducible and with an acceptable cost of goods. The method requires 35 days to produce multiple doses. Multiple mechanisms of SUPLEXA therapeutic cells have been delineated and all appear to complement that of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with SUPLEXA cells serving to enhance the number of primed anti-tumor host T cells while ICIs serve to increase the durability of primed T cells by blocking their premature down-regulation. Methods: A 35 patient Phase 1 single-agent study survey study is currently ongoing in Australia to test the safety and clinical activity of SUPLEXA cells in end-stage patients with various tumor types. No chemo preconditioning or concomitant cytokine treatment was employed. CYTOF analysis of longitudinal peripheral blood is used to monitor changes to the host immune system. Results: To date, SUPLEXA therapeutic cells have demonstrated safety and significant clinical benefit with an observed CR, PR, and many durable SD in approximately half the patients. Several solid tumor patients remain on study beyond 1 year and doing well. Longitudinal analysis of PBMCs from SUPLEXA cell treated cancer patients demonstrated durable changes in the composition of myeloid immune cell subsets in SUPLEXA treated patients, impacting the anti-tumor bias of the host immune system. Specifically, we identified a dramatic decrease in the number of peripheral myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), within 3 weeks of SUPLEXA treatment. In patients with CR and PR, we also identified stable increases in activated classical CD14+ blood monocytes. Conclusions: SUPLEXA therapeutic cells are a highly differentiated approach to cellular therapy. The first-in-human experience demonstrated a pristine safety profile and strong clinical benefit as a single-agent. The pharmacodynamic decrease of in the number of MDSCs, known to suppress the anti-tumor immune response and limit immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) efficacy, supports the further clinical testing to test the hypothesis that the multiple mechanisms of SUPLEXA cells will enhance the clinical activity of ICIs.

        <tr id="TPS2669 Background: Bispecific T-cell engagers represent a promising therapeutic approach for patients with solid tumors; however, these agents require an appropriate target antigen. B7-H6 is an encouraging target as it is expressed on multiple solid tumors but shows only limited expression on normal tissue (1). BI 765049 is a novel immunoglobulin G (IgG)-like T-cell engager designed to simultaneously bind B7-H6-expressing tumor cells and CD3 on T-cells resulting in the formation of a cytolytic synapse that triggers apoptosis of the tumor cells. Methods: NCT06091930 is a Phase I, non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion trial that aims to assess the safety and tolerability of BI 765049 alone or in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor ezabenlimab, in patients with advanced or unresectable gastric cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, or non-small cell lung cancer. Patients must have progressed on, or be ineligible for, standard therapies. Key inclusion criteria include confirmed B7-H6 expression (central pathology review) except in CRC; ≥1 evaluable target lesion outside of the central nervous system (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v1.1); and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1. Patients with prior B7-H6-targeted treatment are ineligible. The study is divided into four parts: dose escalation and expansion of BI 765049 monotherapy (Parts I and II, respectively), and in combination with ezabenlimab (Parts III and IV, respectively). BI 765049 dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. Treatment will continue until progressive disease or discontinuation for other reasons, or for up to 36 months. The primary endpoint for Parts I and III is the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities; and for Parts II and IV it is objective response (OR; determined by the investigator; RECIST v1.1). The secondary endpoints for Parts I and III are pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and OR (RECIST v1.1); and for Parts II and IV secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, duration of response, disease control, PK measurements, and OR (immunotherapy RECIST [iRECIST]). 1.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, despite being a potentially curative therapy in relapsed or refractory (RR) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), remains underutilized in older patients due to limited clinical data.

Patients aged ≥65 years with RR LBCL, treated with anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy at 7 US institutions were included in this multicenter, retrospective, observational study. In total, 226 patients were included. Median age at infusion was 71 years (range 65-89). Best objective and complete response rates were 86% and 62%, respectively. Median follow-up after infusion was 18.3 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.9 months, with 6- and 12-month PFS estimates of 54% and 44%, respectively. The nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate was 10.9% at day 180, primarily due to infections, and not impacted by the age groups. Grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity occurred in 7% and 26%, respectively. In univariate analysis, no significant difference in PFS was seen regardless of the age groups or CAR-T type, whereas ECOG PS ≥2, elevated LDH, bulky disease, advanced stage, extranodal involvement, the need for bridging therapy, and prior bendamustine exposure were associated with shorter PFS. These findings support the use of CAR-T in older patients, including those aged ≥80 years. The age at CAR-T therapy did not influence safety, survival, and NRM outcomes. Older patients should not be excluded from receiving CAR-T therapy solely based on their chronological age.">

        <tr id="e14535 Background: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most common complication of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) for hematologic malignancies. We hypothesized that patients undergoing CAR-T therapy who are on metformin will experience a lower incidence or severity of CRS than patients not on this medication. Methods: We evaluated all patients treated with CAR-T at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1/1/2018 and 1/31/2023, and abstracted relevant clinical and laboratory characteristics to determine the incidence and severity of CRS, PFS as well as OS in patients who were, or were not, on metformin before and during CAR-T therapy for Type 2 diabetes mellitus. We used the Chi-Square test, Mann-Whitney test and the Kaplan-Meier method to analyze data. Results: In the 5-year interval under consideration 237 patients received CAR-T, 168 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 69 for multiple myeloma (MM). 23 patients (15 NHL and 8 MM) were on metformin at the time of CAR-T. 15 patient developed CRS while on metformin and 175 patients not on metformin (p=0.05). Grade 3 or 4 CRS incidence was 4% in both groups (p=0.41). Of the 153 patients with NHL not on metformin, 121 developed any grade of CRS, while 10 of 15 patients on metformin developed CRS (p=0.268). 4 NHL patients developed CRS Grade ≥3 or higher, while 0 of 15 on metformin developed Grade ≥3 CRS (p=0.237). For the MM patients, the incidence of CRS was 49 patients not on metformin and 5 patients on metformin (p<0.001). 3 MM patients developed CRS Grade ≥3 or higher, while 0 of 8 on metformin developed Grade ≥3 CRS (p=0.346). 12 of 15 patients on metformin with NHL achieved CR compared to 92 of 153 patients not on metformin (p=0.1305). 3 of 8 patients with MM on metformin compared to 24 of 61 patients with MM not on metformin achieved CR or better post CAR-T (p=0.92). Tocilizumab was used in 40% of patients on metformin but in 66% of patients not on metformin (p=0.0016). In NHL patients, PFS from CAR-T infusion was not reached (range: 6.3 to NR) for patients on metformin versus 9.9 months (range: 6.3–19.5) in patients not on metformin (p = 0.3332). In the MM patients, progression-free survival (PFS) from CAR-T infusion was 8.4 months (95% CI: 7.9–not reached [NR]) for patients on metformin and 22.6 months (13.7–NR) for those not on metformin (p = 0.07). Median OS for NHL patients on metformin was not reached (9.766–NR) versus 32.6 months (18.6–NR) for patients not on metformin (p = 0.7022). Median OS was 17 months (95% CI: 8.3 to NR) for patients with MM on metformin vs NR (95% CI: 9.4 to NR) for patients not on metformin (p = 0.2559). Conclusions: In this retrospective study, the co-administration of metformin during CAR-T cell therapy for NHL and MM appears to be associated with a numerically reduced incidence of CRS. The effect appears to be particularly marked in patients with multiple myeloma. Metformin therapy did not seem to affect the response to CAR-T therapy in either NHL or MM.">

        <tr id="Individuals with Down syndrome (DS), the genetic condition caused by trisomy 21 (T21), display clear signs of immune dysregulation, including high rates of autoimmune disorders and severe complications from infections. Although it is well established that T21 causes increased interferon responses and JAK/STAT signaling, elevated autoantibodies, global immune remodeling, and hypercytokinemia, the interplay between these processes, the clinical manifestations of DS, and potential therapeutic interventions remain ill defined. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of immune dysregulation at the clinical, cellular, and molecular level in hundreds of individuals with DS. We demonstrate multi-organ autoimmunity of pediatric onset concurrent with unexpected autoantibody-phenotype associations. Importantly, constitutive immune remodeling and hypercytokinemia occur from an early age prior to autoimmune diagnoses or autoantibody production. We then report the interim analysis of a Phase II clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib through multiple clinical and molecular endpoints. Analysis of the first 10 participants to complete the 16-week study shows a good safety profile and no serious adverse events. Treatment reduced skin pathology in alopecia areata, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis, while decreasing interferon scores, cytokine scores, and levels of pathogenic autoantibodies without overt immune suppression. Additional research is needed to define the effects of JAK inhibition on the broader developmental and clinical hallmarks of DS. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04246372.">

        <tr id="Given the global surge in autoimmune diseases, it is critical to evaluate emerging therapeutic interventions. Despite numerous new targeted immunomodulatory therapies, comprehensive approaches to apply and evaluate the effects of these treatments longitudinally are lacking. Here, we leveraged advances in programmable-phage immunoprecipitation methodology to explore the modulation, or lack thereof, of autoantibody profiles, proteome-wide, in both health and disease. Using a custom set of over 730,000 human-derived peptides, we demonstrated that each individual, regardless of disease state, possesses a distinct and complex constellation of autoreactive antibodies. For each individual, the set of resulting autoreactivites constituted a unique immunological fingerprint, or “autoreactome,” that was remarkably stable over years. Using the autoreactome as a primary output, we evaluated the relative effectiveness of various immunomodulatory therapies in altering autoantibody repertoires. We found that therapies targeting B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) profoundly altered an individual’s autoreactome, while anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 therapies had minimal effects. These data both confirm that the autoreactome comprises autoantibodies secreted by plasma cells and strongly suggest that BCMA or other plasma cell–targeting therapies may be highly effective in treating currently refractory autoantibody-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="3139 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has proved efficacy in MSI colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC), but its use in MSS tumors remains a challenge. As the mechanisms of action of CTLA-4 and PD-1 are non-redundant, targeting both pathways may have additive or synergistic activity in comparison with single PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition in MSS and MSI CRC and EC tumors, while single cell characterization of persistent cells upon treatment would enable to describe cell populations and build a detailed single-cell map of the immune, tumor and stromal cell composition. A single dose of tremelimumab (Trem) 300mg, while maintaining a similar overall exposure, has 3- to 4-fold higher Cmax compared to 4 doses of Trem 1 mg/kg, which may have the potential for better anti-tumor activity while potentially avoiding cumulative toxicity. Here we present the results of patients (pts) with refractory ICI-naïve MSS EC and CRC treated with Dur plus Trem and the characterization of immune and persistent cells with longitudinal single-cell analyses. Methods: Pts with advanced MSS/pMMR CRC and EC that have progressed during or after standard therapy with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1, ECOG ≤1, were treated with Dur 1500mg plus Trem 300mg at Week 0, followed by Dur 1500 mg Q4W. Response rate was correlated with transcriptome and T cell repertoire dynamics measured at single-cell level from freshly processed biopsies at three different timepoints: baseline, upon treatment and at progression. Results: 24 samples for single-cell analysis were obtained (4 MSS CRC and 4 MSS EC). The response rate (RR) was 0%, while disease control rate was 12.5%. Despite the lack of response, we found a massive shift in the immune tumor microenvironments of all patients. Following treatment, immune cell composition shifted to increased frequency of effector-memory, proliferating CD8+ cells and CD4+ cells, surprisingly, with enriched T helper phenotypes. Both lineages showed strong signals of exhaustion. The integration of matched T cell receptor (TCR) data pointed to an infiltration of new clonotypes, rather than the expansion of pre-existing tumor-resident T cells, with distinct degrees of dysfunctional phenotypes between the clones. Intriguingly, expanded clonotypes could be detected and monitored in peripheral blood cells using ultra-deep TCR sequencing. Conclusions: Dual treatment with Dur and Trem does not result in an improved RR in patients with refractory MSS/pMMR CRC and EC, despite profound dynamics in the tumor infiltrating immune cells landscape. The infiltration of CD4+ T helper cells provides mechanistic insights of immune evasion, a potential avenue to treat MSS/pMMR tumors. Clinical trial information: 2021-004061-13 .">

        <tr id="Checkpoint blockade therapy (CBT) involving anti-PD1 antibodies represents the standard approach for cHL patients who do not respond to second-line therapy. Nonetheless, only 20% of relapsed/refractory (R/R) cHL patients treated with CBT achieve complete remission. In this study, we extensively examined the immune dynamics in eight R/R cHL patients treated with CBT, consisting of four complete responders (CR) and four experiencing disease progression (PD), by single cell analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Our unique approach encompassed longitudinal analysis with three time points, providing a comprehensive understanding of the evolving immune responses during anti-PD1 therapy. Through gene expression profiling, we identified a stable and distinctive KLRG1+/FOS+/JUN+/GZMA+/CD8+ T cell phenotype in patients achieving complete responses. This specific CD8+ T cell subset exhibited sustained activation, underscoring its potential pivotal role in mounting an effective immune response against cHL. Furthermore, T cell receptor (TCR) analysis revealed that in responder patients there is clonal expansion between TCR clonotypes specifically in the KLRG1+/FOS+/JUN+/GZMA+/CD8+ T cell subset. Our longitudinal study offers unique insights into the complex immune dynamics of multiply relapsed/highly pre-treated cHL patients undergoing anti-PD1 therapy.">

        <tr id="We present the preclinical pharmacology of BNT142, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)–formulated RNA (RNA-LNP) encoding a T cell–engaging bispecific antibody that monovalently binds the T cell marker CD3 and bivalently binds claudin 6 (CLDN6), an oncofetal antigen that is absent from normal adult tissue but expressed on various solid tumors. Upon BNT142 RNA-LNP delivery in cell culture, mice, and cynomolgus monkeys, RNA is translated, followed by self-assembly into and secretion of the functional bispecific antibody RiboMab02.1. In vitro, RiboMab02.1 mediated CLDN6 target cell–specific activation and proliferation of T cells, and potent target cell killing. In mice and cynomolgus monkeys, intravenously administered BNT142 RNA-LNP maintained therapeutic serum concentrations of the encoded antibody. Concentrations of RNA-encoded RiboMab02.1 were maintained longer in circulation in mice than concentrations of directly injected, sequence-identical protein. Weekly injections of mice with BNT142 RNA-LNP in the 0.1- to 1-μg dose range were sufficient to eliminate CLDN6-positive subcutaneous human xenograft tumors and increase survival over controls. Tumor regression was associated with an influx of T cells and depletion of CLDN6-positive cells. BNT142 induced only transient and low cytokine production in CLDN6-positive tumor-bearing mice humanized with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). No signs of adverse effects from BNT142 RNA-LNP administration were observed in mice or cynomolgus monkeys. On the basis of these and other findings, a phase 1/2 first-in-human clinical trial has been initiated to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of BNT142 RNA-LNP in patients with CLDN6-positive advanced solid tumors (NCT05262530). The anti-CLDN6 T cell engager RiboMab02.1 encoded by BNT142 RNA-LNP shows favorable preclinical pharmacology against CLDN6-positive solid tumors. Editor’s summary Bispecific T cell–engaging antibodies (BsAbs) have been approved to treat hematological malignancies; however, current forms are limited because of manufacturing and short serum half-lives. To improve these BsAbs, Stadler et al. have created BNT142, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)–formulated RNA encoding a BsAb against CD3 and the oncofetal antigen claudin 6 (CLDN6). The authors then showed inhibition of tumor growth in treated preclinical mouse models and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and no adverse effects in cynomolgus monkeys. This has led to initiation of a phase 1/2 first-in-human clinical trial, which will be used to assess safety and efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT05262530). —Dorothy Hallberg">

Here, the structural principles, iterative processes, and target selection of CAR-T cells for therapeutic applications are described in detail, as well as the challenges faced in the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. These challenges include insufficient infiltration of cells, off-target effects, cytokine release syndrome, and tumor lysis syndrome. In addition, directions in the iterative development of CAR-T cell therapy are discussed, including modifications of CAR-T cell structures, improvements in specificity using multi-targets and novel targets, the use of Boolean logic gates to minimize off-target effects and control toxicity, and the adoption of additional protection mechanisms to improve the durability of CAR-T cell treatment.

        <tr id="2602 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibition of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) in combination with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has demonstrated durable clinical benefit in patients with advanced solid tumors. However, dose density is limited due to toxicity. BA3071 is a conditionally active biologic (CAB) anti–CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands CD80 and CD86 [1]. CABs are activated within the acidic tumor microenvironment. Conditional and reversible binding of BA3071 may reduce on- and off-tumor immune-related adverse events (AEs) and autoimmunity, avoid tissue-mediated drug deposition, and improve pharmacokinetics. We evaluated the safety and antitumor activity of BA3071 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods: Patients naïve to anti–CTLA-4 therapy with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of single-agent BA3071 every 3 weeks (Q3W) at cycle 1, followed by combination BA3071 + nivolumab from cycle 2 onward. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response assessment was performed Q6W with RECIST v1.1. Results: Eighteen patients were treated with BA3071 (7–700 mg) and nivolumab (240 mg); 61% had received ≥3 lines of prior systemic therapy, and all patients had experienced failure of anti–PD-1 therapy. Four patients experienced grade 3 related treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; hypertension, increased lipase, atrial fibrillation, gastritis, and diabetic ketoacidosis); no grade 4 related TEAEs were observed. Two patients experienced grade 3 immune-related TEAEs (diarrhea [BA3071 350 mg] and diabetic ketoacidosis [BA3071 700 mg]). Among 16 efficacy-evaluable patients, 9 experienced stable disease, and 2 out of 5 patients receiving BA3071 in the 350-mg cohort achieved confirmed RECIST v1.1 responses (complete response in cervical carcinoma and partial response in gastroesophageal carcinoma). One patient with metastatic small cell lung cancer who received 7 mg BA3071 remained without progression for >1 year (69 weeks). Conclusions: Treatment with the novel, conditionally active anti–CTLA-4 agent BA3071, in combination with anti–PD-1 therapy (at doses higher than those currently approved for anti–CTLA-4/PD-1 therapy), yielded confirmed responses with a promising tolerability profile. Phase 1 dose escalation of BA3071 continues at 700 mg up to 1000 mg, and phase 2 monotherapy and combination therapy expansion cohorts are currently enrolling at a starting dose level of 350 mg. 1.

        <tr id="Cancer encompasses various elements occurring at the cellular and genetic levels, necessitating an immunotherapy capable of efficiently addressing both aspects. T cells can combat cancer cells by specifically recognizing antigens on them. This innate capability of T cells has been used to develop cellular immunotherapies, but most of them can only target antigens through major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). New gene-editing techniques such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-cas9) can precisely edit the DNA sequences. CRISPR-cas9 has made it possible to generate genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that can overcome the problems associated with old immunotherapies. In chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, the patient’s T cells are isolated and genetically modified to exhibit synthetic CAR(s). CAR-T cell treatment has shown remarkably positive clinical outcomes in cancers of various types. Nevertheless, there are various challenges that reduce CAR-T effectiveness in solid tumors. It is required to address these challenges in order to make CAR-T cell therapy a better and safer option. Combining CAR-T treatment with other immunotherapies that target multiple antigens has shown positive outcomes. Moreover, recently generated Boolean logic-gated advanced CARs along with artificial intelligence has expanded its potential to treat solid tumors in addition to blood cancers. This review aims to describe the structure, types, and various methods used to develop CAR-T cells. The clinical applications of CAR-T cells in hematological malignancies and solid tumours have been described in detail. In addition, this discussion has addressed the limitations associated with CAR-T cells, explored potential strategies to mitigate CAR-T-related toxicities, and delved into future perspectives.">

        <tr id="e19045 Background: CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy has been demonstrated to be a valuable treatment option for relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (r/r B-NHL). It has been shown that between 39% and 97% of clinical samples of B-NHL also express BCMA. To further improve safety and efficacy, we have developed GC012F, a CD19 and BCMA dual-targeting CAR-T, manufactured using the novel next-day FasT CAR-T process, for the treatment of r/r B-NHL. The data from an investigator-initiated trial of GC012F for r/r B-NHL were reported at ASCO 2023 (# 7562). Here, we present updated results of the trial, including more pts and a longer follow-up period. Methods: This is a single-arm, open label trial (ChiCTR2100047061). The patients (pts) were enrolled and treated with a single infusion of GC012F in escalating dosing cohorts after a standard lymphodepletion regimen. The primary objectives of this study were safety and tolerability; the secondary were pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were graded by ASBMT 2019, adverse effects were evaluated according to CTCAE 5.0. Efficacy assessment of GC012F was referred to the Lugano criteria. Results: As of data cut-off on January 30th, 2024, with a median of 410.5 days (range: 28 - 839) of follow-up, all pts received single GC012F infusions at dose levels ranging from 3.7×104 to 3×105 CAR-T/kg. The median age was 49.5 years (range: 18 - 67). Ten pts were Ann Arbor stage III/IV disease. All pts lymphoma samples expressed CD19, and 9 out of 11 expressed BCMA. Ptsreceived a median of 2 prior lines (range: 2 - 3) of therapy including rituximab and anthracyclines. Two ptsreceived the auto-HSCT previously. 91.7% (11/12) of the pts achieved ORR at month 3 post GC012F infusion; 66.7% (8/12) CR at month 6 and 60% (6/10) CR at month 12, respectively. To date, the longest duration of remission is 27.0 months. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. One pt had grade 3 CRS and recovered within 2 days. No ICANS were observed. Grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicities included lymphocytopenia (11/12), neutropenia (11/12) and leukopenia (10/12). All TEAEs were resolved after treatment with standard of care and supportive care. The median peak copy number of CAR-T cells in the peripheral blood was 70,083 copies/μg DNA (range: 6,876 - 185,039), and the median peak time was 14 days (range: 9 - 21). CAR-T cells were also detected in tumor biopsies from all six pts tested. In five pts at progressive disease, the primary or new lesions were CD19 positive, and no CAR-T cells were detected. Conclusions: This first-in-human trial of GC012F for the treatment of r/r DLBCL showed a manageable safety profile and promising clinical responses and a long-lasting duration of a remission. Overall, CD19-BCMA dual targeting CAR-T product GC012F is a promising therapy for r/r DLBCL pts and longer follow-up is ongoing. Clinical trial information: ChiCTR2100047061 .">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Modern immunotherapy approaches are revolutionizing the treatment scenario of relapsed/refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM) patients, providing an opportunity to reach deep level of responses and extend survival outcomes. Areas covered Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and T-cell redirecting treatments, including bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells therapy, have been recently introduced in the treatment of RRMM. Some agents have already received regulatory approval, while newer constructs, novel combinations, and applications in earlier lines of therapy are currently being explored. This review discusses the current landscape and possible development of ADCs, BsAbs and CAR-T cells immunotherapies. Expert Opinion ADCs, BsAbs, and CAR-T therapy have demonstrated substantial activity in heavily pretreated, triple-class exposed (TCE) MM patients, and T-cell redirecting treatments represent new standards of care after third (European Medicines Agency, EMA), or fourth (Food and Drug Administration, FDA), line of therapy. All these three immunotherapies carry advantages and disadvantages, with different accessibility and new toxicities that require appropriate management and guidelines. Multiple on-going programs include combinations therapies and applications in earlier lines of treatment, as well as the development of novel agents or construct to enhance potency, reduce toxicity and facilitate administration. Sequencing is a challenge, with few data available and mechanisms of resistance still to be unraveled.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with targeting CD30-expressing Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and immune checkpoint modulation induced by combination therapies of CTLA-4 and PD1.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, trial NCT01896999 enrolled patients with refractory or relapsed HL (R/R HL) after one or more lines of therapy, with adequate performance status and organ function. Using peripheral blood, we assessed soluble proteins, cell composition, T cell clonality, and tumor antigen-specific antibodies in 54 patients enrolled in the phase 1 component of the trial.


RESULTS
NCT01896999 reported high (>75%) overall objective response rates with brentuximab-vedotin (BV) in combination with ipilimumab (I) and/or nivolumab (N) in patients with R/R HL. We observed durable increase in soluble PD-1 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells as well as decreases in plasma CCL17, ANGPT2, MMP12, IL13, and CXCL13 in N-containing regimens (BV+N and BV+I+N) compared with BV+I (p<0.05). Non-responders and patients with short progression free-survival showed elevated CXCL9, CXCL13, CD5, CCL17, adenosine-deaminase, and MUC16 at baseline or after one treatment cycle and a higher prevalence of NY-ESO-1-specific autoantibodies (p<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest a circulating tumor-immune-derived signature of BV±I+N treatment resistance that may be useful for patient stratification in combination checkpoint therapy.">

        <tr id="Background The primary treatment for acute relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) is the intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone (IVMP). However, the mechanisms through which corticosteroid treatment impacts acute neuroinflammation in people with MS (pwMS) remain not fully understood. In particular, the changes induced by glucocorticoids (GCs) on cells of the innate immune system and the differences between patients with distinct immunotherapies have received little attention to date. Methods We conducted immunophenotyping using flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of pwMS who received IVMP treatment during a relapse. We compared the impact of an IVMP treatment on a broad variety of immune cell subsets within three groups: twelve patients who were treatment-naïve to disease modifying therapies (wDMT) to ten patients on platform therapies (PT) and eighteen patients on fingolimod therapy (FTY). Results We observed pronounced interindividual short- and intermediate-term effects of IVMP on distinct immune cells subsets. In addition to the well-documented decrease in T-helper cells (Th cells), we detected significant alterations after the first IVMP infusion within the innate immune response among neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil granulocytes, monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). When comparing patients wDMT to the PT and FTY cohorts, we found that IVMP had a similar impact on innate immune cells across all treatment groups. However, we did not observe a significant further decline in T lymphocyte counts during IVMP in patients with pre-existing lymphopenia under FTY treatment. Although T cell apoptosis is considered the main mechanism of action of GCs, patients with FTY still reported symptom improvement following IVMP treatment. Conclusion In addition to T cell suppression, our data suggests that further immunoregulatory mechanisms of GC, particularly on cells of the innate immune response, are of greater significance than previously understood. Due to the regulation of the adaptive immune cells by DMTs, the impact of GC on these cells varies depending on the underlying DMT. Additional studies involving larger cohorts and cerebrospinal fluid samples are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the immune response to GC in pwMS with different DMTs during relapse to define and explain differences in clinical response profiles.">

        <tr id="Objectives The tuning effects of JAK/TYK2 inhibitors on the imbalance between T follicular helper (Tfh) and T regulatory (Treg) cells, related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis, were investigated using human peripheral blood samples. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from untreated patients with SLE and healthy controls were analysed. Tfh1 cells were identified in nephritis tissue, and the effect of Tfh1 cells on B-cell differentiation was examined by coculturing naïve B cells with Tfh1 cells. Results Tfh1 cell numbers were increased in the peripheral blood of patients, and activated Treg cell counts were decreased relative to Tfh1 cell counts. This imbalance in the Tfh to Treg ratio was remarkably pronounced in cases of lupus nephritis, especially in types III and IV active nephritis. Immunohistochemistry revealed Tfh1 cell infiltration in lupus nephritis tissues. Co-culture of Tfh1 cells (isolated from healthy individuals) with naïve B cells elicited greater induction of T-bet+ B cells than controls. In JAK/TYK2-dependent STAT phosphorylation assays using memory CD4+ T cells, IL-12-induced STAT1/4 phosphorylation and Tfh1 cell differentiation were inhibited by both JAK and TYK2 inhibitors. However, phosphorylation of STAT5 by IL-2 and induction of Treg cell differentiation by IL-2+TGFβ were inhibited by JAK inhibitors but not by TYK2 inhibitors, suggesting that TYK2 does not mediate the IL-2 signalling pathway. Conclusions Tfh1 cells can induce T-bet+ B cell production and may contribute to SLE pathogenesis-associated processes. TYK2 inhibitor may fine-tune the immune imbalance by suppressing Tfh1 differentiation and maintaining Treg cell differentiation, thereby preserving IL-2 signalling, unlike other JAK inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is rapidly becoming a standard of care in the treatment of many cancer types. However, the subset of patients who respond to this type of therapy is limited. Another way to promote antitumoral immunity is the use of immunostimulatory molecules, such as cytokines or T cell co-stimulators. The systemic administration of immunotherapeutics leads to significant immune-related adverse events (irAEs), therefore, the localized antitumoral action is needed. One way to achieve this is intratumoral non-viral gene-immune therapy, which allows for prolonged and localized gene expression, and multiple drug administration. In this study, we combined the previously described non-viral gene delivery system, PEG-PEI-TAT copolymer, PPT, with murine OX40L-encoding plasmid DNA.The resulting OX40L/PPT nanoparticles were characterized via gel mobility assay, dynamic light scattering analysis and in vitro transfection efficiency evaluation. The antitumoral efficacy of intratumorally (i.t.) administered nanoparticles was estimated using subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted CT26 (colon cancer), B16F0 (melanoma) and 4T1 (breast cancer) tumor models. The dynamics of stromal immune cell populations was analyzed using flow cytometry. Weight loss and cachexia were used as irAE indicators. The effect of combination of i.t. OX40L/PPT with intraperitoneal PD-1 ICB was estimated in s.c. CT26 tumor model.The obtained OX40L/PPT nanoparticles had properties applicable for cell transfection and provided OX40L protein expression in vitro in all three investigated cancer models. We observed that OX40L/PPT treatment successfully inhibited tumor growth in B16F0 and CT26 tumor models and showed a tendency to inhibit 4T1 tumor growth. In B16F0 tumor model, OX40L/PPT treatment led to the increase in antitumoral effector NK and T killer cells and to the decrease in pro-tumoral myeloid cells populations within tumor stroma. No irAE signs were observed in all 3 tumor models, which indicates good treatment tolerability in mice. Combining OX40L/PPT with PD-1 ICB significantly improved treatment efficacy in the CT26 subcutaneous colon cancer model, providing protective immunity against CT26 colon cancer cells.Overall, the anti-tumor efficacy observed with OX40L non-viral gene therapy, whether administered alone or in combination with ICB, highlights its potential to revolutionize cancer gene therapy, thus paving the way for unprecedented advancements in the cancer therapy field.">

Clinical trials experience to date suggests that clinical response of BsAb is less impacted after CAR-T therapy. We examined the outcome of pts who received BsAb in standard-of-care (SOC) practice at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Methods: Retrospective analysis of MM patients who received FDA-approved BsAb at Mayo Clinic, Rochester between 12/2022- 1/2024. IMWG criteria was used for clinical response. Results: Sixty-two patients received BsAbs: 77% (48/62) received teclistamab, and 23% (14/62) received talquetamab. Median age was 62 years (range: 33-81), 60% (37/62) were males, and 45% (28/62) received prior CAR-T. Patients who had prior CAR-T therapy had more prior lines of therapy compared to those who did not. Overall, ORR to teclistamab was 61%, which is comparable to previous studies and other real-world reports. ORR and ≥CR rates were comparable between patients with and without prior CAR-T (Table). Of the 28 pts who received CAR-T before BsAbs, 61% (17/28) received idecabtagene vicleucel, 10% (3/28) were ciltacabtagene autoleucel, and 29% (8/28) on clinical trial. We then compared outcome of BsAb between pts who had relapsed from CAR-T within 1 year (n=21, median PFS: 8.84 months (range, 1.12, 10.84)) or after 1 year (n=7, median PFS: 16.62 months (range, 13.30, 36.20)). At the time of BsAb infusion, pts with who relapsed < 1 year vs ≥1 year post CAR-T had comparable blood counts, ALC, M-protein and involved FLC levels, CRP, ferritin and LDH. BsAb CR/sCR rate was significantly higher in pts with disease relapse ≥1 year compared to <1 year post CAR-T (57% vs 14%, p=0.02). Conclusions: Irrespective of prior CAR-T exposure, BsAb have clinical activity in SOC practice in pts with MM. Our preliminary data suggest that responses to BsAbs are better in pts with late compared to early relapse post CAR-T. Longer follow-up is needed to understand the duration of response. Larger, multi-center studies with longer follow-up will help identify factors that impact BsAb response post CAR-T.[Table: see text]">

        <tr id="e23309 Background: BCMA-directed T-cell–engaging therapies have been introduced into clinical practice for the treatment of TCE RRMM. While efficacious, such treatments are associated with safety considerations such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and serious infections. These treatments also vary in reported efficacy, administration processes, and hospitalization requirements. The aim of this study is to quantify patient preferences and tradeoffs regarding these attributes. Methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was designed to elicit preference weights corresponding to seven attributes related to efficacy (objective response rate [ORR], overall survival [OS]), safety (all-grade CRS, all-grade ICANS, serious infections) and treatment procedures (treatment administration, hospitalization requirements). Attribute levels were based on plausible ranges of potential values. Patients in the United States (US) with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of TCE RRMM were recruited. Pre-test interviews with patients were conducted and the final survey deployed online in 2023. A random-parameters logit model was used to estimate preference weights. Conditional relative importance (CRI) was calculated to rank the relative importance of each attribute. The minimum acceptable benefit (MAB) and maximum acceptable risk (MAR) were calculated to estimate the tradeoffs between efficacy and safety attributes. Results: The sample included 200 respondents (mean [standard deviation] age: 61 [6.4] years; 43% female; 46% White; 10% African American). A total of 197 participants reported having responded to prior treatment, of whom 195 had relapsed or become refractory. In the DCE, a 24-month increase in OS was found to be the most important attribute, with a CRI of 32.0%. Next most important were avoiding a 60% risk of serious infection (CRI 17.3%), avoiding 14-day hospitalization requirements (CRI 15.0%), and a 38% increase in ORR (CRI 13.7%). A treatment that could be started immediately and administered weekly or up to every 4 weeks was preferred over a CAR T-like procedure with a waiting period. Fewer initial hospitalization days was significantly preferred over more hospitalization days. The MABs for OS when the risk of serious infection was increased from 20% to 60%, CRS from 40% to 95%, and ICANS from 3% to 20% were 24.2, 17.1, and 18.0 months, respectively. When OS was increased from 12 to 36 months, the estimated MARs for serious infections, CRS, and ICANS were > 60%, > 95%, and > 20%, respectively. Conclusions: This study highlights US patient preferences regarding treatment attributes for TCE RRMM. Treatment benefits and risks and the mutual tradeoffs considered by patients should be evaluated when developing and selecting therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="Introduction Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive sarcomas with unacceptably low cure rates occurring often in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 defects. To investigate oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (oHSV) as an immunotherapeutic approach, we compared viral replication, functional activity, and immune response between unarmed and interleukin 12 (IL-12)-armed oncolytic viruses in virus-permissive (B109) and -resistant (67C-4) murine MPNSTs. Methods This study compared two attenuated IL-12-oHSVs with γ134.5 gene deletions (Δγ134.5) and the same transgene expression cassette. The primary difference in the IL-12-oHSVs was in their ability to counter the translational arrest response in infected cells. Unlike M002 (Δγ134.5, mIL-12), C002 (Δγ134.5, mIL-12, IRS1) expresses an HCMV IRS1 gene and evades dsRNA activated translational arrest in infected cells. Results and discussion Our results show that oHSV replication and gene expression results in vitro were not predictive of oHSV direct oncolytic activity in vivo. Tumors that supported viral replication in cell culture studies resisted viral replication by both oHSVs and restricted M002 transgene expression in vivo. Furthermore, two IL-12-oHSVs with equivalent transcriptional activity differed in IL-12 protein production in vivo, and the differences in IL-12 protein levels were reflected in immune infiltrate activity changes as well as tumor growth suppression differences between the IL-12-oHSVs. C002-treated tumors exhibited sustained IL-12 production with improved dendritic cells, monocyte-macrophage activity (MHCII, CD80/CD86 upregulation) and a polyfunctional Th1-cell response in the tumor infiltrates. Conclusion These results suggest that transgene protein production differences between oHSVs in vivo, in addition to replication differences, can impact OV-therapeutic activity.">

        <tr id="The spread of cancer from organ to organ (metastasis) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however, most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread. It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner, and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors (IL-6R and IL-8R) with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects. However, while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential, elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 BsAb, exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antibody-receptor) complexes. Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. AIH can present in all ages, races, and ethnicities, but it predominantly affects women. As a heterogeneous disease, AIH presents variably in different patients, making diagnosis and treatment a challenge. Currently, the standard treatment for AIH comprises immunosuppressants; however, their long-term use is associated with adverse effects. The pathogenesis of AIH is complex, involving T cells, macrophages, and plasma cells that invade the periportal parenchyma and lead to an inflammatory cascade that can result in liver damage. Due to the complexity of AIH pathogenesis, treatment targets several inflammatory pathways. However, unlike other autoimmune diseases in which targeted treatments have been approved, there has been little progress made in advancing the treatment paradigm for AIH. Major obstacles to progress include challenges in conducting clinical trials, particularly patient recruitment and ensuring a diverse range of backgrounds; poorly defined outcomes to assess treatment response and improved quality of life; and a lack of study designs that account for the stage of disease and variations in treatment. A focus on individualized and steroid-free treatment approaches is needed to improve AIH prognosis and minimize steroid-associated adverse effects.">

        <tr id="Multiple chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies are FDA approved, and several are under development. While effective for some cancers, toxicities remain a limitation. The most common toxicities, i.e. cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), are well described. With increasing utilization, providers worldwide are reporting on other emergent, and often complicated toxicities. Given the evolving toxicity profiles and urgent need to catalogue these emerging and emergent CAR T toxicities and describe management approaches, the American Society of Hematology Subcommittee on Emerging Gene and Cell Therapies organized the first Scientific Workshop on CAR T cell toxicities during the annual society meeting. The workshop functioned to 1) aggregate reports of CAR T emergent toxicities, including movement disorders after BCMA CAR T, coagulation abnormalities, and prolonged cytopenias; 2) disseminate bedside to bench efforts elucidating pathophysiological mechanisms of CAR-T toxicities, including the intestinal microbiota and systemic immune dysregulation; and 3) highlight gaps in the availability of clinical tests such as cytokine measurements, which could be utilized to expand our knowledge around the monitoring of toxicities. Key themes emerged. First, while clinical manifestations may develop before the pathophysiologic mechanisms are understood, these must be studied to aid in the detection and prevention of such toxicities. Second, systemic immune dysregulation appears central to these emergent toxicities and research is needed to elucidate links between tumor, CAR T, and microbiota. Finally, there was consensus around an urgency to create a repository to capture emergent CAR-T toxicities and the real-world management.">

        <tr id="2574 Background: While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies, they are less effective in treating solid tumors, which is in part due to the poor persistence and decreased survival of these cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling axis has emerged as a promising target to remodel the TME to make it more immune favorable, and work from our group previously demonstrated that STING agonists could improve the persistence and antitumor activity of CAR T cells in an immunocompetent murine breast tumor model. Yet, the T cell intrinsic effect of STING activation is thought to decrease T cell proliferation and lead to T cell death. Thus, we sought to better understand the impact of activating STING in different T cell subsets to be able to more effectively target STING as an adjunct to cellular therapies. Methods: Primary T cell cultures generated from murine splenocytes and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were polarized in vitro towards either a Th/Tc1 or Th/Tc17 lineage and treated with the mammalian STING agonist 2’3’-cGAMP. Cells were subsequently characterized by immunophenotyping, bioenergetic analysis, and RNA sequencing. Adoptive cell transfer experiments in a murine melanoma model and an immunocompetent murine breast cancer model utilizing an anti-Neu CAR T cell were employed to determine the differential impact of STING agonism on T cell subsets in vivo. Results: While treatment of Th/Tc1 cells with cGAMP led to impaired proliferation and T cell death, Th/Tc17 cells were immune to this effect. Instead, cGAMP triggered activation of a non-canonical STING pathway in Th/Tc17 cells resulting in metabolic reprogramming in favor of fatty acid oxidation over glycolysis. Th/Tc17 cells treated with cGAMP assumed more of a stem like memory T cell phenotype and displayed a more favorable bioenergetic profile with improved mitochondrial health and decreased reactive oxygen species production. Adoptive transfer of cGAMP conditioned Th/Tc17 memory like cells enhanced tumor control in an aggressive murine melanoma model, which was secondary to improved persistence of T cells in the TME. Further, while intratumoral delivery of STING agonists augmented the antitumor activity of Th/Tc17 cells, the function of Th/Tc1 cells was impeded by activating STING. Conclusions: STING activation in T cells leads to differential responses within T cell subsets as Th/Tc17 cells uniquely shift to a more fit T cell with improved antitumor properties. As cGAMP is found in the tumor microenvironment and can be secreted by tumor cells, CAR T cells with a greater Th/Tc17 footprint may be able to better subsist in the TME. Our findings also provide insight into how to engineer cellular therapies to take advantage of this non-canonical pathway to optimize the integration of STING based therapeutics into patient treatments.">

        <tr id="Adoptive T cellular immunotherapies have emerged as relevant approaches for treating cancer patients who have relapsed or become refractory (R/R) to traditional cancer treatments. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has improved survival in various hematological malignancies. However, significant limitations still impede the widespread adoption of these therapies in most cancers. To advance in this field, six research groups have created the “NEXT Generation CART MAD Consortium” (NEXT CART) in Madrid’s Community, which aims to develop novel cell-based immunotherapies for R/R and poor prognosis cancers. At NEXT CART, various basic and translational research groups and hospitals in Madrid concur to share and synergize their basic expertise in immunotherapy, gene therapy, and immunological synapse, and clinical expertise in pediatric and adult oncology. NEXT CART goal is to develop new cell engineering approaches and treatments for R/R adult and pediatric neoplasms to evaluate in multicenter clinical trials. Here, we discuss the current limitations of T cell-based therapies and introduce our perspective on future developments. Advancement opportunities include developing allogeneic products, optimizing CAR signaling domains, combining cellular immunotherapies, multi-targeting strategies, and improving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)/T cell receptor (TCR) therapy. Furthermore, basic studies aim to identify novel tumor targets, tumor molecules in the tumor microenvironment that impact CAR efficacy, and strategies to enhance the efficiency of the immunological synapse between immune and tumor cells. Our perspective of current cellular immunotherapy underscores the potential of these treatments while acknowledging the existing hurdles that demand innovative solutions to develop their potential for cancer treatment fully.">

        <tr id="e19011 Background: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy can induce durable remission in some patients but requires time for a patient’s own cells to be reengineered to produce CAR proteins that can bind to and destroy cancer cells. During this time, bridging therapy is often used in debulking to reduce treatment toxicities and to control the disease while waiting for the manufacturing of CAR-T cells. Because bridging therapy often involves systemic treatment, the bridging therapies can induce responses, in and of themselves, in clinical trials testing CAR-T therapies. As such, we sought to assess bridging therapies used in CAR-T trials. Methods: Using the FDA labels (labels.fda.gov) to identify the indications and the pivotal clinical trials that led to the approval of each CAR-T cell therapy, we looked at which bridging therapies were used, whether multiple therapies were combined, response rates, and the reported adverse events associated with bridging therapy. We took note of all relevant comments regarding bridging therapy in the main paper and supplemental results. Results: Of the 11 studies testing CAR-T therapies, 10 reported the bridging therapies that were used in the study. Notably, only three of 11 studies provided clear information about which combinations of bridging therapy treatments were used during the trials. Of those that reported the types of bridging therapies (n=10), the most commonly used bridging therapy was dexamethasone, which was used in every study (10/10). The next three most commonly used treatments include rituximab (6/10), gemcitabine (5/10), and etoposide (5/10). Of the trials, 2/11 clearly reported whether patients had a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or very good partial response (VGPR) to bridging therapy. 5/11 vaguely reported responses, using terminology outside of CR, PR, VGPR. 4/11 trials did not report or mention any response information in regards to bridging therapy. Of all the trials, 1/11 clearly reported adverse events associated with bridging therapy in the supplement, while 10/11 of the trials listed adverse events associated with the treatment groups, without clarifying those associated with bridging. Conclusions: Although patients are often refractory to first-line therapies, which share considerable overlap with the bridging therapies used, these therapies may still induce responses. Despite this possibility, the reporting of bridging therapy combinations and their subsequent response rates and adverse event rates, is highly variable. Of 11 pivotal clinical trials that led to the approval of a CAR-T cell therapy, none clearly reported bridging therapy data that encompassed all three categories (combinations used, response rates, adverse events). What is more, these data were often omitted completely. These findings highlight the need for greater transparency in the reporting of bridging therapy in order to more reliably assess the efficacy of CAR-T therapies.">

Unfortunately, although immunotherapy has greatly improved the prognosis of patients, not all respond to anti-PD1 immunotherapy, making it crucial to identify alternative treatments that could be combined with current immunotherapies to improve their effectiveness. Here, we show that iron supplementation significantly boosts T-cell responses in vivo and in vitro. This boost is associated with a metabolic reprogramming of T cells in favor of lipid oxidation. We also found that the "adjuvant" effect of iron led to a marked slowdown of tumor-cell growth after tumor-cell line transplantation in mice. Specifically, our results suggest that iron supplementation promotes anti-tumor responses by increasing IFN-γ production by T cells. In addition, iron supplementation considerably improves the efficacy of anti-PD1 cancer immunotherapy in mice. Finally, our study suggests that, in cancer patients, the quality and efficacy of the anti-tumor response following anti-PD1 immunotherapy may be modulated by plasma ferritin levels. In summary, our results suggest the benefits of iron supplementation on the reactivation of anti-tumor responses and support the relevance of a fruitful association between immunotherapy and iron supplementation.">

        <tr id="Abstract BACKGROUND Immunotherapy is a developing but challenging field of research for the treatment of central nervous system malignancies. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has been effective in treating hematologic malignancies, but that success has not been clinically translated to solid tumors in children. B7-H3 has been identified as a promising immunotherapy target as it is highly expressed in pediatric glioblastoma and correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis. We aim to evaluate a nanobody-based CAR-T cell therapy that binds B7-H3 with high affinity and hypothesize that anti-B7-H3 nanobody CAR-T cells can effectively kill B7-H3-expressing tumor cells. METHODS B7-H3 nanobodies were isolated from camel phage libraries and cloned into lentiviral CAR-T cell constructs. Human T cells were transduced by lentivirus to express CAR on the surface. Nanobody CAR-T cell functionality was evaluated by an impedance-based cytotoxicity assay and cytokine release was measured by ELISA. CAR-T avidity was quantified by the Lumicks z-Movi assay. In vivo studies are evaluating the efficacy of B7-H3 CAR-T cells in an orthotopic glioblastoma model in immunodeficient mice. Mice were treated with B7-H3 CAR-T cells by intracerebroventricular or intravenous delivery. RESULTS We confirmed high expression of B7-H3 on the surface of three pediatric glioblastoma cell lines by flow cytometry and Quantibrite staining. We confirmed effective killing of B7-H3-expressing tumor cells and the release of high levels of cytokines. B7-H3 nanobody CAR-T cells were observed to have high avidity compared to control CAR-T cells. In vivo studies are currently ongoing and treatment response will be evaluated by luminescence imaging and endpoint histologic analysis. CONCLUSION We have shown that B7-H3 nanobody CAR-T cells demonstrate significant preclinical efficacy. It is critical to study CAR-T cell therapy in immunocompetent in vivo models for further development and clinical application.">

        <tr id="Brentuximab vedotin (BV), a conjugate of anti-CD30 antibody and monomethyl auristatin E, has emerged as a promising treatment option for refractory CD30+ mycosis fungoides (MF) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (pcALCL). BV has been shown to be safe and effective in treating Hodgkin's lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. This multicenter, prospective, single-arm phase I/II study evaluated the efficacy of BV in Japanese patients with CD30+ cutaneous lymphomas, namely CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Participants were divided into two groups: those with CD30+ MF or pcALCL (cohort 1, n = 13) and those with CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders other than those in cohort 1 (cohort 2, n = 3). The studied population included the full analysis set (FAS), modified FAS (mFAS), and safety analysis set (SAF). These sets were identified in cohorts 1 and 1 + 2 and labeled FAS1 and FAS2, mFAS1 and mFAS2, and SAF1 and SAF2, respectively. Each treatment cycle lasted 3 weeks, and BV was continued for up to 16 cycles after the third cycle based on treatment response. The primary endpoint was the 4-month objective response rate (ORR4) determined by the Independent Review Forum (IRF). ORR4 was 69.2% for FAS1 and 62.5% for FAS2 (P < 0.0001). Secondary endpoints of ORR, assessed using the global response score (53.8% in FAS1) and modified severity-weighted assessment tool (62.5% in FAS1), using the IRF, provided results comparable to the primary findings. The incidence of ≥grade 3 adverse events (≥15%) in SAF1 was peripheral neuropathy in three patients (23%) and fever and eosinophilia in two patients (15%). In conclusion, BV showed favorable efficacy, tolerability, and safety profile in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory CD30+ primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The trial was registered with University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry, Japan (protocol ID: UMIN000034205).">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered a prototypic autoimmune disease of the CNS. It is the leading cause of chronic neurologic disability in young adults. Proinflammatory B cells and autoreactive T cells both play important roles in its pathogenesis. We aimed to study alterations of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which likely also contribute to the disease, but their involvement is less clear. Methods By combining multiple experimental approaches, we examined the Treg compartments in 41 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 17 healthy donors. Results Patients with MS showed a reduced frequency of CD4+ T cells and Foxp3+ Tregs and age-dependent alterations of Treg subsets. Treg suppressive function was compromised in patients, who were treated with natalizumab, while it was unaffected in untreated and anti-CD20–treated patients. The changes in natalizumab-treated patients included increased proinflammatory cytokines and an altered transcriptome in thymus-derived (t)-Tregs, but not in peripheral (p)-Tregs. Discussion Treg dysfunction in patients with MS might be related to an altered transcriptome of t-Tregs and a proinflammatory environment. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Tregs and their subtypes in MS.">

        <tr id="Although Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells have shown high efficacy in hematologic malignancies, they can cause severe to life-threatening side effects. To address these safety concerns, we have developed adaptor CAR platforms, like the UniCAR system. The redirection of UniCAR T-cells to target cells relies on a Target Module (TM), containing the E5B9 epitope and a tumor-specific binding moiety. Appropriate UniCAR-T activation thus involves two interactions: between the TM and the CAR T-cell, and the TM and the target cell. Here, we investigate if and how alterations of the amino acid sequence of the E5B9 UniCAR epitope impact the interaction between TMs and the UniCAR. We identify the new epitope E5B9L, for which the monoclonal antibody 5B9 has the greatest affinity. We then integrate the E5B9L peptide in previously established TMs directed to Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) and assess if such changes in the UniCAR epitope of the TMs affect UniCAR T-cell potency. Binding properties of the newly generated anti-FAP-E5B9L TMs to UniCAR and their ability to redirect UniCAR T-cells were compared side-by-side with the ones of anti-FAP-E5B9 TMs. Despite a substantial variation in the affinity of the different TMs to the UniCAR, no significant differences were observed in the cytotoxic and cytokine-release profiles of the redirected T-cells. Overall, our work indicates that increasing affinity of the UniCAR to the TM does not play a crucial role in such adaptor CAR system, as it does not significantly impact the potency of the UniCAR T-cells.">

        <tr id="2593 Background: PD-1 blockade has demonstrated positive anti-tumor activity across multiple tumor types. While the anti-tumoral response can be substantial and even curative, response rates remain low in many cancer types. Long-lasting responses are only observed in a minority of patients, and additional immunotherapeutic alternatives remain limited for patients who fail to respond or initially respond but subsequently experience progression. Combining anti-PD-1 with other immunotherapies may improve the durability and depth of anti-tumoral immune responses. Non-clinical data suggest anti-PD-1 interactions with macrophage Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) compromise therapeutic activity by several mechanisms including the rapid removal of anti-PD-1 from its target on CD8+ T-cells and phagocytosis of anti-PD-1 coated CD8+ T cells. Accordingly, we and others have shown that blockade of Fc/FcγR interactions with immunocompetent antibodies to the inhibitory FcγRIIB, a receptor highly upregulated in the tumor microenvironment, overcomes these resistance mechanisms and enhances anti-PD-1 efficacy in vitro and in vivo. BI-1206 is a fully human IgG1 targeting CD32b (FcγRIIB). Methods: This is a Ph1/2a trial in patients with advanced solid tumors who received previous lines of treatment with anti-PD 1/PD-L1 agents to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK/PD of BI-1206 at ascending IV and SC doses after coadministration with pembrolizumab Q3W using a mTPI-2 design. Results: Dose escalation with BI-1206 IV has been completed with no formal MTD defined. The most frequent related adverse events were infusion-related reactions, thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. All were transient without any clinical consequences, and adequate pre-medication with corticosteroids or split dose administration reduced the risk and/or intensity of these events. Out of 15 evaluable patients, 5 patients showed SD, including one lasting >24 months in a metastatic melanoma patient. Furthermore, long-lasting PR (>24 months) was observed in a uveal melanoma patient, and CR was observed in a metastatic melanoma patient who previously received three prior anti-PD-1 containing treatments (one including anti-CTLA4). Enrollment to BI-1206 SC dose escalation began Nov2023. Dose level and administration route to be further explored in Phase 2a will be determined after an integrated review of PK, PD and safety. The Ph2a consists of 3 expansion cohorts at the RP2D, each comprising a specific subset of subjects with advanced solid tumors (e.g., NSCLC, MM, and other tumors responsive to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition). More than one dose level may be evaluated if warranted. Conclusions: Coadministration of BI-1206 with pembrolizumab was well tolerated in a heavily pretreated population, with promising hints of responses to be further explored in Ph2.

        <tr id="Background Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has achieved marked therapeutic success in ameliorating hematological malignancies. However, there is an extant void in the clinical guidelines concerning the most effective chemotherapy regimen prior to chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, as well as the optimal timing for CAR-T cell infusion post-chemotherapy. Materials and Methods We employed cell-derived tumor xenograft (CDX) murine models to delineate the optimal pre-conditioning chemotherapy regimen and timing for CAR-T cell treatment. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing was implemented to identify the therapeutic targets and elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing the treatment regimen. Results Our preclinical in vivo evaluation determined that a combination of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by the infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells five days subsequent to the chemotherapy, exerts the most efficacious therapeutic effect in B-cell hematological malignancies. Concurrently, RNA-seq data indicated that the therapeutic efficacy predominantly perturbs tumor cell metabolism, primarily through the inhibition of key mitochondrial targets, such as C-Jun Kinase enzyme (C-JUN). Conclusion In summary, the present study offers critical clinical guidance and serves as an authoritative reference for the deployment of CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in the treatment of B-cell hematological malignancies.">

        <tr id="Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Significant unmet need remains for patients with relapsed/refractory FL after ≥3 lines of prior therapy. While recent advancements have likely improved the survival of patients with FL, most patients will eventually relapse. The treatment of patients with FL after multiple relapses or those with refractory disease has historically led to lower overall response rates (ORR) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) with each subsequent line of therapy. New treatments with high ORR and durable PFS are needed in this setting, particularly in patients that progress within 2 years of first line chemoimmunotherapy (POD24) and/or those refractory chemoimmunotherapy.

        <tr id="e19050 Background: Tafasitamab (tafa) is a CD19-targeting immunotherapy that induces enhanced antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. Tafa received accelerated FDA approval in 2020 for treating relapsed or refractory DLBCL in combination with lenalidomide in patients ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, based on results from L-MIND, a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial. FirmMIND (NCT05429268) is an ongoing identical study, further evaluating efficacy and safety of tafa in this setting. Several other CD19 targeting agents are available; however, CD19 antigen loss following treatment with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy targeting CD19 (CART19) has raised concerns over CD19-targeted therapy sequencing. Loss of CD19 has not been observed to date in tafa clinical trials or practice. Methods: To evaluate CD19 expression at screening and after disease progression in firmMIND, we developed an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay using a mAb that binds to an intracellular epitope of CD19 clone LE-CD19. To validate that CD19 expression is detectable after tafa treatment, we treated cultured SU-DHL-4 or Jurkat cells with tafa at a saturating concentration for 24 hours. After washing out unbound tafa, cells were harvested at specific timepoints. Resulting cell line blocks were assessed for CD19 expression by IHC. We also monitored CD19 trafficking in response to fluorescently labeled tafa by confocal microscopy. Results: By IHC, CD19 expression was comparable between treatment conditions, suggesting the assay can effectively measure CD19 expression in lymphoma biopsy samples post-tafa. Confocal microscopy showed a fraction of tafa-bound CD19 internalized and colocalized with a CD19 intracellular pool labeled with anti-CD19 mAb clone EPR5906; this mAb also detected CD19 that remained localized on the cell surface. The data demonstrated that CD19 persists on tumor cells after tafa treatment at levels that could be bound by other CD19-targeting therapies. As of the January 25, 2024 data cutoff, we received 6 end-of-treatment (EOT) samples from patients in firmMIND. Biopsies were collected 14-26 days after the last tafa dose; 5 of 6 samples were biopsies from lymph nodes or liver and showed ≥80% of tumor cells staining CD19+ on membranes with 3+ intensity by IHC, except 1 that was collected only 6 days after last dose and showed 50% positivity. The sixth biopsy (extranodal subcutaneous lesion) showed no CD19 expression at baseline or EOT. Conclusions: Patient biopsy analysis and preclinical data suggest that following tafa treatment, CD19 antigen is preserved on the surface of tumor cells after short and transient internalization and could be targeted by other CD19 agents, such as CART therapy. This conclusion is supported by sequential treatment with tafa followed by CART in vivo (Sakemura, 2024). Analyses are ongoing to confirm these findings.">

        <tr id="7060 Background: IMM0306 is a fusion protein of CD20 monoclonal antibody with the CD47 binding domain of SIRPα on both heavy chains. It exerts excellent cancer killing efficacy by activating both macrophages and NK cells via blockade of CD47-SIRPα interaction and FcɣR engagement. Here, we report the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy results of phase I study in patients (pts) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). Methods: Eligible pts with R/R CD20-positive B-NHL were enrolled in this multicenter phase I study (NCT05805943). IMM0306 was administered as monotherapy at escalating doses of 0.04, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 mg/kg intravenously once a week until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated in the first 28 days. Safety was evaluated per CTCAE 5.0, PK and PD analysis were also assessed, tumor assessments performed once every 8 weeks by Lugano 2014 criteria. Results: As of Nov 21, 2023, 48 pts were enrolled. The median age was 56 years with 30 (62.5%) males. The median prior lines of therapy were 2. All pts received previous anti-CD20 therapy. No DLTs were observed. Recommended phase II dose was determined as 2.0 mg/kg. The most frequent treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were WBC decreased (66.7%), anemia (64.6%), lymphocyte decreased (58.3%), ANC decreased (47.9%), PLT decreased (45.8%), infusion-related reactions (35.4%). ≥grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 33 (68.8%) pts, with the most common being lymphocyte decreased (56.3%), WBC decreased (18.8%), ANC decreased (18.8%). 8 (16.7%) pts experienced treatment related serious adverse event. Discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 1 pt (grade 4 PLT decreased at 1.6mg/kg without bleeding). No AE led to death. IMM0306 exhibited approximate dose-proportional increase in PK exposure from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg and no obvious accumulation was observed after repeated dosing. At 1.2 mg/kg and higher dose, CD47 receptor occupancy on peripheral lymphocytes was saturated, suggesting IMM0306 is well tolerated from perspective of CD47 engagement. B-cell depleted rapidly at doses ≥ 0.8 mg/kg. Elevated cytokines levels were observed after first dosing of IMM0306, but multiple dosing did not stimulate further cytokine activation. Among 33 pts who received doses ≥ 0.8 mg/kg, 5 CR (4 follicular lymphoma [FL], 1 marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]), 5 PR (3 FL, 1 MZL, 1 diffuse large B cell lymphoma) and 11 SD were seen; the median PFS was 10.58 months (95% CI, 2.2, NA) and the median OS was not reached. Among 17 FL pts, 7 (41%) responded including 4 CR and 3 PR; among 6 MZL pts, 2 (33.3%) responded including 1 CR and 1 PR.

        <tr id="Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors improve antitumor responses The understanding of the immune system has increased considerably in the past 30 years, leading to the development of better therapies for cancer as well as immune-mediated disorders. These advances include unleashing T cell antitumor activity with monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoints and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKis or jakinibs) that block cytokine signaling for autoimmune, atopic, and inflammatory pathologies (1, 2). On pages 1315 and 1314 of this issue, Zak et al. (3) and Mathew et al. (4), respectively, report that combining these therapeutic approaches results in improved clinical responses compared with immune checkpoint inhibition alone in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma as well as metastatic non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These are exciting advances, but at the same time the strategy might seem paradoxical. Why would jakinibs enhance immune-mediated elimination of cancer cells given that they limit lymphocyte activation and proliferation?">

        <tr id="TPS1137 Background: BriaCell (BC) human immortalized cell lines have been engineered to trigger robust immune responses and deliver efficacy through diverse mechanisms, including adaptive (involving T-cells) and innate responses (dendritic and NK cells). BC can match patients’ HLA antigens for optimal effectiveness. BC works by several mechanisms, including direct antigen presentation and activation of CD4+ T-cells. When combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, the BC regimen has demonstrated clinical benefit in 54 heavily treated MBCs. Most pts whose disease has progressed after checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy showed similar or improved PFS compared to the patient's last treatment regimen. Disease control after prior antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) has been observed in 40% of patients, and clinical benefit has been seen in 5/7 patients with untreated intracranial metastases. CD8+ Immuno PET shows an increase in CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes suggesting systemic activation and infiltration into lymphoid organs and metastatic sites. Sequencing of CPI with BC and the latest phase 3 formulation are associated with improved clinical outcomes, including OS (median 13.4 months), PFS, and CBR, which are reflected in the design of this ongoing pivotal registration enabling Phase 3 study [doi:10.1158/1538-7445.sabcs22-p3-07-12]. Methods: Multicenter randomized, open label Bria-IMT regimen (with SV-BR-1-GM cells) plus CPI vs Treatment of Physicians' Choice (TPC) in MBCs with no approved curative therapies available. ECOG <2 allowed with no limit on prior therapies. Eligibility encompasses all MBC subtypes including pts with CNS metastases. Prior immune therapy is allowed if administered more than 21 days before the first cycle of Bria-IMT; treatments within 21 days preclude participation. Initial randomization will be 1:1:1 to the Bria-IMT regimen + CPI (combination), TPC, and the Bria-IMT regimen alone (monotherapy). There will be 100 sites across the US, Canada, and ex-NA for 404 total evaluable pts. The Bria-IMT regimen includes: Day -2 Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2, Day 0 20 million irradiated SV-BR-1-GM cells intradermally, and 0.1mcg peg α interferon intra-dermally (Day 2 or 3) into each Bria-IMT inoculation site. After the first 150 pts have enrolled, the monotherapy arm will be discontinued. Bria regimen + CPI arms treatment cycles occur q3w. CPI infusion is given every cycle between Day –3 to Day 3 TPC cycle details will be according to the site's SOC. Imaging assessment will be q6w x2 then q8w. The primary endpoint is overall survival with an interim analysis at 144 events targeting a hazard ratio of 0.6. Key secondary endpoints will include PFS, ORR, CBR, CNS event free survival, and TWiST (time without symptoms or toxicities). Safety analysis will be ongoing. Patient-reported outcomes will be incorporated to assess subjective treatment effects. Clinical trial information: NCT06072612 .">

        <tr id="The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK, CD247) is a potential target for antibody-based therapy. However, no antibody-based therapeutics targeting ALK have entered clinical trials, necessitating the development of novel antibodies with unique therapeutic merits. Single-domain antibodies (sdAb) bear therapeutic advantages compared to the full-length antibody including deeper tumor penetration, cost-effective production and fast washout from normal tissues. In this study, we identified a human immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain (VH domain) (VH20) from an in-house phage library. VH20 exhibits good developability and high specificity with no off-target binding to ~6000 human membrane proteins. VH20 efficiently bound to the glycine-rich region of ALK with an EC50 of 0.4 nM and a KD of 6.54 nM. Both VH20-based bispecific T cell engager (TCE) and chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR Ts) exhibited potent cytolytic activity to ALK-expressing tumor cells in an ALK-dependent manner. VH20 CAR Ts specifically secreted proinflammatory cytokines including IL-2, TNFα and IFNγ after incubation with ALK-positive cells. To our knowledge, this is the first reported human single-domain antibody against ALK. Our in vitro characterization data indicate that VH20 could be a promising ALK-targeting sdAb with potential applications in ALK-expressing tumors, including neuroblastoma (NBL) and non-small cell lung cancer.">

        <tr id="The identification and targeting of B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) through immunotherapeutic strategies such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR T-cells), and T-cell engagers (TCE) have revolutionized the care of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). These treatment modalities have improved survival outcomes of relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) MM patients compared to previously established strategies and are moving into earlier lines of therapy (LOT). Despite their efficacy, the majority of patients eventually relapse, necessitating additional therapeutic targets for salvage. G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D (GPRC5D), Fc receptor-homolog 5 (FcRH5), and SLAMF7 are some examples of novel targets in development. This expanding armamentarium of immunotherapeutic agents will be crucial to address the unmet need for relapses following BCMA-targeting therapies, particularly antigen-negative relapses. The utilization of sequential T-cell redirective therapies including agents targeting different tumor-associated antigens and combination therapies appears feasible paves the way for effective chemotherapy-free regimes. Deliberate consideration of treatment timing, preserving T-cell health, overcoming antigenic loss, and comprehension of the complex tumor microenvironment would be key to maximizing therapeutic benefits and minimizing adverse effects. This review summarizes novel targets in development for myeloma beyond BCMA, presenting pivotal safety and efficacy data derived from clinical trials where available and the considerations vital for navigating this expanding landscape of immunotherapeutic options.">

        <tr id="2043 Background: Patients with glioblastoma (GBM) face three major challenges. First, the tumor itself as well as chemoradiation treatment result in lymphopenia, which is associated with shorter survival. Second, the tumor microenvironment (TME) has a paucity of T cells and consequently, immunotherapies have failed in multiple phase 3 clinical trials for GBM. Third, a treatment resistant population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to inevitable tumor recurrence. In preclinical models, we have shown that a long-acting IL-7, NT-I7, significantly increases peripheral CD8 T cells and separately, oncolytic Zika virus (ZIKV) directly targets CSC and induces an anti-tumor CD8 T cell response. The aim of this study was to determine whether we can leverage the NT-I7 driven T cell expansion peripherally and combine it with ZIKV therapy to pull immune cells into the TME to successfully treat a highly immunosuppressive mouse model of GBM. Methods: SB28 syngeneic tumor cells were intracranially implanted in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were treated with NT-I7 subcutaneously on days 7 and 10 post tumor implantation, followed by intratumoral ZIKV on day 14. Mice were monitored for survival and bled weekly to assess the systemic T-cell response to NT-I7. Immunoprofiling of brain, draining lymph node, and peripheral blood via flow cytometry was done on days 17 and 21. Results: NT-I7 significantly expanded peripheral T cells compared to control (5,623 cells/µL vs 136 cells/µL, p<0.05). Cytotoxic CD8 T cells were particularly increased (4,776 cells/µL vs 47 cells/µL, p<0.05), with the expansion peak at day 7 after the first dose of NT-I7 and persisting for 21 days. When ZIKV was administered at the peak of the NT-I7-driven CD8 T cell expansion, the combination resulted in significant improvement in survival compared to NT-I7 or ZIKV monotherapy (median 47 days vs 35 days and 33 days, respectively, p<0.05). Combined NT-I7 and ZIKV treatment significantly increased TME CD8 T cell infiltration (369,814 cells/g vs 23,947 cells/g and 63,961 cells/g, respectively) as well as increased expression of interferon-γ, TNF-α, perforin, and granzyme B (p<0.05). Long-term survivors were protected against tumor rechallenge, suggesting that this treatment strategy confers immune memory against tumor antigens. The addition of immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD1 antibody resulted in nearly 80% complete tumor clearance. Conclusions: Timing the oncolytic ZIKV injection with the NT-I7-induced peak expansion of peripheral CD8 T cells greatly increased tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and improved survival in the immunotherapy resistant SB28 glioma model. This work suggests a new “expand and pull” approach for the treatment of highly immunosuppressive tumors such as GBM: priming the systemic immune system with NT-I7, followed by an oncolytic stimulus to draw them into the TME to engage and clear tumor cells.">

        <tr id="Despite recent advances, the prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unsatisfactory due to disease recurrence and the development of resistance to both conventional and novel therapies. Engineered T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their cellular surface represent one of the most promising anticancer agents. CAR-T cells are increasingly used in patients with B cell malignancies, with remarkable clinical results despite some immune-related toxicities. However, at present, the role of CAR-T cells in myeloid neoplasms, including AML, is extremely limited, as specific molecular targets for immune cells are generally lacking on AML blasts. Besides the paucity of dispensable targets, as myeloid antigens are often co-expressed on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with potentially intolerable myeloablation, the AML microenvironment is hostile to T cell proliferation due to inhibitory soluble factors. In addition, the rapidly progressive nature of the disease further complicates the use of CAR-T in AML. This review discusses the current state of CAR-T cell therapy in AML, including the still scanty clinical evidence and the potential approaches to overcome its limitations, including genetic modifications and combinatorial strategies, to make CAR-T cell therapy an effective option for AML patients.">

However, the influence of thymic positive selection on diabetogenic CD8+ T cell development remains unclear. Using CD5 marker representing T-cell receptor (TCR) signal strength, we illustrated that naïve CD5hiCD8+ T cells of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with enhanced TCR signals displayed predisposed differentiated/memory T cell traits with increased activation and proliferation upon TCR stimulation, compared to CD5lo counterparts. Additionally, CD5hiCD8+ T cells exhibited gene expression landscape similar to effector T cells and exacerbated disease in transfer model. Interestingly, the protective effects of transgenic phosphatase Pep expression, which lowers TCR signaling and diabetes incidence, were abolished in NOD strain 8.3 with high CD5 expression linked to increased thymic positive selection. Strikingly, TCR repertoire analysis identified higher frequencies of autoimmune disease-related clonotypes in naïve CD5hiCD8+ cells, supporting that distinct effector functions arise from intrinsic TCR repertoire differences. Overall, CD5hiCD8+ clones may be potential targets for autoimmune diabetes treatment.">

        <tr id="e19000 Background: B-cell-Activating Factor-Receptor (BAFF-R), predominantly expressed on the surface of the mature B cells, including malignant B cells, serves as an attractive therapeutic target for the diseases where CD19 or CD20-targeted therapies encounter challenges, such as loss of therapeutic targets or development of resistance. No BAFF-R targeting agent has been approved yet for clinical use to date. ESG206, a recombinant humanized anti-BAFF-R monoclonal antibody modified by glycoengineering for enhanced ADCC effects, is being developed as a treatment for relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies. Preclinical investigations have successfully validated the antitumor effects of ESG206 across a spectrum of malignant B cell disease models, including lymphoma xenografts which were resistant to Rituximab, and Ibrutinib. This report provides preliminary clinical safety, PK, PD, and efficacy results from an FIH study of ESG206 in patients with R/R B-cell malignancies. Methods: This Phase I, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study enrolled patients with R/R B-cell malignancies resistant to standard therapy. Dose escalation utilized accelerated titration (1 mg/kg) and Bayesian Optimal Interval design (3, 6, and 9 mg/kg). ESG206 was administered intravenously every 2 weeks, with a 4-week cycle, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. DLT was assessed in the first 28 days. Safety was evaluated per CTCAE 5.0. Tumor assessments every 8 weeks, and peripheral CD20-positive B cell counts as a PD marker were evaluated. Results: As of Jan 30th, 2024, data cut-off date, 6 pts (3 follicular lymphoma (FL), 3 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)) were enrolled, with a median age of 56 years, 83.3% female; median 2 prior lines of therapy (range 1-3). No DLTs were observed up to 6 mg/kg Q2W. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included anemia (n=2), decreased white blood cell count (n=1), hyperlipidemia (n=1, grade 2), elevated bilirubin (n=1), diarrhea (n=1), infusion reactions (n=1, grade 2), upper respiratory infections (n=1, grade 2), etc. No grade≥3 TRAEs occurred. Among 6 evaluable patients, 1 FL patient (3 mg/kg Q2W) and 1 DLBCL patient (3 mg/kg Q2W) achieved partial response. After 2 cycles of treatment, there was a 39.5% size reduction in the brain lesions of an FL patient who had intracranial metastases in baseline, suggesting that ESG206 may have a therapeutic effect on brain metastases. A significant decrease in the peripheral CD20+B cells was observed at both 1 and 3 mg/kg Q2W dose levels. ESG206 exposure increased with dose escalation across the 1–3 mg/kg dose range. Conclusions: Preliminary data indicates ESG206 is well-tolerated with promising efficacy signals in R/R B-cell malignancies. These encouraging results warrant continued clinical evaluation as the Phase I study progresses. Clinical trial information: NCT05263739 .">

        <tr id="Cytokines are small proteins that modulate the activity of the immune system. Because of their potent immunomodulatory properties, some recombinant cytokines have undergone clinical development and have gained marketing authorization for the therapy of certain forms of cancer. Recombinant cytokines are typically administered at ultralow doses, as many of them can cause substantial toxicity even at submilligram quantities. In an attempt to increase the therapeutic index, fusion proteins based on tumor-homing antibodies (also called "immunocytokines") have been considered, and some products in this class have reached late-stage clinical trials. While antibody-cytokine fusions, which preferentially localize in the neoplastic mass, can activate tumor-resident leukocytes and may be more efficacious than their nontargeted counterparts, such products typically conserve an intact cytokine activity, which may prevent escalation to curative doses. To further improve tolerability, several strategies have been conceived for the development of antibody-cytokine fusions with "activity-on-demand", acting on tumors but helping spare normal tissues from undesired toxicity. In this article, we have reviewed some of the most promising strategies, outlining their potential as well as possible limitations.">

        <tr id="Summary Despite extensive regulatory T cell (Treg) research, fundamental questions on in vivo dynamics remain to be answered. The current study aims to dissect several interwoven concepts in Treg biology, highlighting the ‘self-reactivity’ of Treg and their counterparts, namely naturally-arising memory-phenotype T-cells, as a key mechanism to be exploited by a human retroviral infection. We propose the novel key concept, Periodic T cell receptor (TCR)-signalled T-cells, capturing self-reactivity in a quantifiable manner using the Nr4a3-Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-activity (Tocky) technology. Periodic and brief TCR signals in self-reactive T-cells contrast with acute TCR signals during inflammation. Thus, we propose a new two-axis model for T-cell activation by the two types of TCR signals or antigen recognition, elucidating how Foxp3 expression and acute TCR signals actively regulate Periodic TCR-signalled T-cells. Next, we highlight an underappreciated branch of immunological research on Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) that precedes Treg studies, illuminating the missing link between the viral infection, CD25, and Foxp3. Based on evidence by single-cell analysis, we show how the viral infection exploits the regulatory mechanisms for T-cell activation and suggests a potential role of periodic TCR signalling in infection and malignant transformation. In conclusion, the new perspectives and models in this study provide a working framework for investigating Treg within the self-reactive T-cell spectrum, expected to advance understanding of HTLV-1 infection, cancer, and immunotherapy strategies for these conditions.">

        <tr id="Mosunetuzumab (Mosun) is a CD20xCD3 T‐cell engaging bispecific antibody that redirects T cells to eliminate malignant B cells. The approved step‐up dose regimen of 1/2/60/30 mg IV is designed to mitigate cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and maximize efficacy in early cycles. A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model was developed from 439 patients with relapsed/refractory B‐Cell Non‐Hodgkin lymphoma receiving Mosun IV monotherapy, including fixed dosing (0.05–2.8 mg IV every 3 weeks (q3w)) and Cycle 1 step‐up dosing groups (0.4/1/2.8–1/2/60/30 mg IV q3w). Prior to Mosun treatment, ~50% of patients had residual levels of anti‐CD20 drugs (e.g., rituximab or obinutuzumab) from prior treatment. CD20 receptor binding dynamics and rituximab/obinutuzumab PK were incorporated into the model to calculate the Mosun CD20 receptor occupancy percentage (RO%) over time. A two‐compartment model with time‐dependent clearance (CL) best described the data. The typical patient had an initial CL of 1.08 L/day, transitioning to a steady‐state CL of 0.584 L/day. Statistically relevant covariates on PK parameters included body weight, albumin, sex, tumor burden, and baseline anti‐CD20 drug concentration; no covariate was found to have a clinically relevant impact on exposure at the approved dose. Mosun CD20 RO% was highly variable, attributed to the large variability in residual baseline anti‐CD20 drug concentration (median = 10 μg/mL). The 60 mg loading doses increased Mosun CD20 RO% in Cycle 1, providing efficacious exposures in the presence of the competing anti‐CD20 drugs. PopPK model simulations, investigating Mosun dose delays, informed treatment resumption protocols to ensure CRS mitigation.">

 Intravesical therapies have been the mainstay of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (BC) management; however, their efficacy is limited by toxicities, recurrences, and supply shortages. Consequently, many patients are recommended cystectomy, which is fraught with high complication rates. Thus, bladder-sparing treatments present a major, unmet clinical need. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, wherein T cells are engineered to express an artificial receptor to a target, is an immunotherapeutic approach with efficacy in hematologic malignancies. Similar success in solid tumors has been hindered by a lack of suitable targets, reduced T cell infiltration/activity, and major toxicities, including on-target off-tumor effects and cytokine release syndromes. To overcome these limitations, locoregional delivery of CAR T cells is being investigated. Yet, to date, no studies have examined their potential as intravesical therapies. In this study, we used a computational pipeline using large-scale BC transcriptomics data to discover potential CAR targets which met strict criteria of high cell-surface expression on BC and minimal expression on normal tissue. We identified MUC16, a surface-bound mucinous glycoprotein, as a top candidate from this pipeline, which has more reduced pan-tissue expression than targets of precision-guided therapies in BC. Consistent with prior reports, MUC16 transcript and protein levels increase with grade and T stage and correlates with chemotherapeutic resistance. We also find MUC16 expression persists in recurrent tumors after BCG-therapy. To target MUC16, we designed second-generation CARs based on scFv derived from the antibody 3a5 (3a5-28z) and natural-ligands based on the high-affinity MUC16-mesothelin interaction (MSLN-28z) or its truncated binding domain (truncMSLN-28z) which were fused to CD28 co-stimulatory domains and CD3z chains of the T cell receptor. Using human BC lines with a broad range of MUC16 levels, we show MSLN-28z more effectively lyses MUC16+, but not MUC16−, cells than compared to 3a5-28z or truncMSLN-28z CAR T cells. Ablation of MUC16 by CRISPR/Cas9 or modification of MSLN-based CAR to lack signaling domains abolishes the cytotoxicity of MSLN-28z CAR T cells, demonstrating dependency on MUC16 engagement. Using multiplex assays and intracellular cytokine staining, we further demonstrate MSLN-28z CAR T cells have potent polyfunctionality through secretion of cytokines IL-2, IFN-g, and TNF-a by both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Last, in immunodeficient mice orthotopically xenografted with HT1376 cells, intravesical delivery of MSLN-28z CAR T cells enhances survival compared to CAR T cells delivered intravenously. This enhanced anti-tumor response correlates with reduced tumor weights and increased T cell infiltration. Notably, intravesically delivered CAR T cells are not detectable in peripheral circulation of tumor-bearing mice. Together, our findings substantiate MUC16 as a targetable antigen in BC and validate MSLN-based CAR T cells as a potential intravesical therapy.

        <tr id="One of the major challenges in the choice of the best therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients affected by hemophilia A (HA) is the definition of criteria predicting the formation of factor VIII (FVIII) neutralizing antibodies, called inhibitors. Both genetic and environmental elements influencing the immune response toward FVIII have been identified but still not all the factors causing the pathological rejection of FVIII have been identified. Since there is a connection between coagulation and inflammation, here we assessed the role played by the FVIII deficiency in shaping the humoral and cellular response toward an antigen other than FVIII itself. To this aim, we challenged both HA and wild-type (WT) mice with either FVIII or ovalbumin (OVA) and followed antigen-specific antibody level, immune cell population frequency and phenotype up to 9 weeks after the last antigen booster. The activation threshold was evaluated in vitro by stimulating the murine T cells with a decreasing dose of α-CD3. The humoral response to FVIII was similar between the two groups while both the in vivo and in vitro experiments highlighted an antigen-independent sensitivity of HA compared with WT T cells causing an increase in memory T-cell conversion and proliferation capability.">

 Although CAR-T19 therapy is widely used for relapsed/refractory B cell lymphomas, approximately half of patients experience post CAR-T relapse. The mechanisms underlying this resistance remain largely unknown and efforts to overcome this limitation are hindered by the lack of suitable pre-clinical models for study. To address these unmet needs, we generated a novel genetically engineered mouse model with conditional expression of Ezh2Y641F and BCL2 in germinal center (GC) B cells. Ezh2/BCL2 mice developed follicular lymphoma (FL) which histologically and transcriptionally recapitulates human FL. Moreover, we established a cell line derived from an Ezh2/BCL2 mouse that developed transformed FL (tFL). Injection of the cell line named “tFL-P6” in immunocompetent C57BL6 recipients resulted in rapid disease progression that histologically and transcriptionally mimics human tFL. Treatment of tFL-P6 with EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i) didn’t affect proliferation and viability, however, the number of pretreated cells was significantly reduced when co-cultured with T cells. EZH2i pretreated tFL-P6 displayed extended interaction with T cells, as measured by live imaging. EZH2i reprogrammed tFL-P6 to restore T cell engagement genes such as ICOSL, ICAM1, OX40L, and integrins, as well as cytokines and chemokines involved in T cell recruitment, therefore enhancing immunogenicity. Notably, pretreated tFL-P6 cells were rejected by C57BL6 whereas they developed lethal disease in immunodeficient recipients. Pre-treatment of tFL-P6 as well as human DLBCL and PDX-derived cell lines significantly enhanced CAR-T19 cell killing effects in vitro. Administering CAR-T cells in mice engrafted with EZH2i-pretreated tFL-P6 significantly reduced the tumor burden and prolonged their survival (100% vs 30%, p<0.01). To assess the direct interactions between lymphoma cells and CAR-T cells in vivo, we performed intravital 2-photon imaging of popliteal lymph nodes using dTomato labeled CAR-T cells and GFP+ tFL-P6 cells. Pretreatment of tFL-P6 cells with EZH2i doubled the recruitment of CAR-T cells in the microenvironment and enhanced the duration of contact and surface engagement with CAR-T cells. To explore the impact of EZH2 inhibition on CAR-T cells, we manufactured CAR-T cells from splenic T cells of mice treated with EZH2i or vehicle for 14 days. Prior exposure to EZH2i didn’t affect proliferation and transduction during CAR-T production. Ex vivo assays with those CAR-T cells and tFL-P6 cells showed a superior killing effect and expansion of EZH2i-exposed CAR-T (p<0.001). Mice bearing tFL-P6 lymphomas displayed a longer survival when infused with EZH2i-pretreated CAR-T cells (p=0.06). Pretreatment with EZH2i resulted in an increased memory/effector ratio (p<0.01) and reduction of PD1+CD38+ exhausted CD8CAR-T cells (p<0.001). Overall, EZH2i improved CAR-T therapy by enhancing lymphoma cell immunogenicity and CAR-T cell functions. These results prompted the initiation of a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in R/R B cell lymphomas (NCT05934838).

        <tr id="Although adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells has achieved unprecedented response rates in patients with certain hematological malignancies, this therapeutic modality is still far from fulfilling its remarkable potential, especially in the context of solid cancers. Antigen escape variants, off-tumor destruction of healthy tissues expressing tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), poor CAR-T cell persistence, and the occurrence of functional exhaustion represent some of the most prominent hurdles that limit CAR-T cell ability to induce long-lasting remissions with a tolerable adverse effect profile. In this review, we summarize the main approaches that have been developed to face such bottlenecks, including the adapter CAR (AdCAR) system, Boolean-logic gating, epitope editing, the modulation of cell-intrinsic signaling pathways, and the incorporation of safety switches to precisely control CAR-T cell activation. We also discuss the most pressing issues pertaining to the selection of co-stimulatory domains, with a focus on strategies aimed at promoting CAR-T cell persistence and optimal antitumor functionality.">

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK) cell therapy represents a promising advancement in the field of oncology offering a novel approach to target and eliminate tumor cells with high specificity and reduced risk of immune-related adverse effects. This paper reviews the mechanism, potential targets, and recent advances in CAR-NK cell therapy for lung cancer, including the design and engineering of CAR-NK cells, preclinical studies, and the outcomes of early-phase clinical trials. We highlight the unique advantages of using NK cells, such as their innate ability to recognize and kill cancer cells and their reduced potential for inducing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) compared to CAR T-cell therapies. Results from recent studies demonstrate significant antitumor activity in lung cancer models with improved targeting and persistence of CAR-NK cells observed in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we discuss the challenges in optimizing CAR-NK cell therapies, including the potential resistance mechanisms. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future directions of CAR-NK cell research and its implications for lung cancer treatment emphasizing the importance of continued innovation and collaboration in the field.">

        <tr id="Objective Mechanisms underpinning clinical evolution to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from preceding antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positivity are poorly understood. This study aimed to understand blood immune cell transcriptional signatures associated with subclinical ANA positivity, and progression or non-progression to SLE. Methods Bulk RNA-sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated at baseline from 35 ANA positive (ANA+) subjects with non-diagnostic symptoms was analysed using differential gene expression, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, deconvolution of cell subsets and functional enrichment analyses. ANA+ subjects, including those progressing to classifiable SLE at 12 months (n=15) and those with stable subclinical ANA positivity (n=20), were compared with 15 healthy subjects and 18 patients with SLE. Results ANA+ subjects demonstrated extensive transcriptomic dysregulation compared with healthy controls with reduced CD4+naïve T-cells and resting NK cells, but higher activated dendritic cells. B-cell lymphopenia was evident in SLE but not ANA+ subjects. Two-thirds of dysregulated genes were common to ANA+ progressors and non-progressors. ANA+ progressors showed elevated modular interferon signature in which constituent genes were inducible by both type I interferon (IFN-I) and type II interferon (IFN-II) in vitro. Baseline downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex I components significantly associated with progression to SLE but did not directly correlate with IFN modular activity. Non-progressors demonstrated more diverse cytokine profiles. Conclusions ANA positivity, irrespective of clinical trajectory, is profoundly dysregulated and transcriptomically closer to SLE than to healthy immune function. Metabolic derangements and IFN-I activation occur early in the ANA+ preclinical phase and associated with diverging transcriptomic profiles which distinguish subsequent clinical evolution.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Relapse/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (r/r B-ALL) represents paediatric cancer with a challenging prognosis. CAR T-cell treatment, considered an advanced treatment, remains controversial due to high relapse rates and adverse events. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of CAR T-cell therapy for r/r B-ALL. Methods The literature search was performed on four databases. Efficacy parameters included minimal residual disease negative complete remission (MRD-CR) and relapse rate (RR). Safety parameters constituted cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Results Anti-CD22 showed superior efficacy with the highest MRD-CR event rate and lowest RR, compared to anti-CD19. Combining CAR T-cell therapy with haploidentical stem cell transplantation improved RR. Safety-wise, bispecific anti-CD19/22 had the lowest CRS rate, and anti-CD22 showed the fewest ICANS. Analysis of the costimulatory receptors showed that adding CD28ζ to anti-CD19 CAR T-cell demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing relapses with favorable safety profiles. Conclusion Choosing a more efficacious and safer CAR T-cell treatment is crucial for improving overall survival in acute leukaemia. Beyond the promising anti-CD22 CAR T-cell, exploring costimulatory domains and new CD targets could enhance treatment effectiveness for r/r B-ALL.">

        <tr id="Multifunctional molecules involved in tumor progression and metastasis have been identified as valuable targets for immunotherapy. Among these, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), a significant tumor cell membrane-bound proteoglycan, has emerged as a promising target, especially in light of advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. The profound bioactivity of CSPG4 and its role in pivotal processes such as tumor proliferation, migration, and neoangiogenesis underline its therapeutic potential. We reviewed the molecular intricacies of CSPG4, its functional attributes within tumor cells, and the latest clinical-translational advances targeting it. Strategies such as blocking monoclonal antibodies, conjugate therapies, bispecific antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors, CAR T-cell therapies, trispecific killer engagers, and ribonucleic acid vaccines against CSPG4 were assessed. CSPG4 overexpression in diverse tumors and its correlation with adverse prognostic outcomes emphasize its significance in cancer biology. These findings suggest that targeting CSPG4 offers a promising avenue for future cancer therapy, with potential synergistic effects when combined with existing treatments.">

        <tr id="e14677 Background: HLAE is a non-classical MHC class I molecule complexed with the VMAPRTLFL nonapeptide, derived from the leader sequence of HLAG (HLAEpHLAG). HLAEpHLAG is overexpressed across a wide type of tumors prominently on Multiple Myeloma (MM). HLAEpHLAG complex is the ligand to CD94-NKG2A in the immune system which negatively regulates the activation of natural killer (NK) cells as well as NKG2A positive T cells. Harnessing of the HLAE-NKG2A axis by the cancer cells leads to evasion from the immune system attack resulting in cancer progression. Currently, several Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) target the NKG2A receptor which has a low specificity to cancer and high toxicity to the patient. Engineering a new ICI that targets the HLAEpHLAG complex can potentially yield improved outcomes in cancer therapy. Methods: Using the hybridoma system, a new mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) called 4D7 that targets the HLAEpHLAG complex was developed. mAb 4D7 affinity was assessed in vitro with recombinant proteins and a panel of cell lines that expressed zero to high levels of HLAE. The functional impacts of the mAb 4D7 was examined in a system where various MM cell lines were separately co-cultured with primary NK (pNK) cells. pNK were isolated from the peripheral blood of 5 healthy donors, and their activity was examined in the presence of mAb 4D7 by CD107a degranulation assay. Also, the functional impacts of the mAb 4D7 on allogenic pNK and MM blast cells, isolated from the bone marrow of 6 MM patients were assessed. Results: mAb 4D7 was determined to be an IgG-kappa isotype showing a high specific binding to recombinant HLAEpHLAG. Cell lines with overexpression of membranal HLAEpHLAG: RPMI8226, U266, 721.221 HLAE, and 721.221 HLAG showed positive staining with the mAb 4D7. While cell lines with low to zero expression of HLA-E like 721.221 WT showed low or negative staining with the mAb 4D7. The degranulation of NKG2A+ pNK subset cells against MM target cells increased in presence of mAb 4D7. However, adding mAb 4D7 to NKG2A -pNK subset cells co-cultured with MM target cells did not affect the pNK activity. Similar results were obtained when the target and effector cells were isolated from the bone marrow of active treatment-naive MM patients. Conclusions: MAb 4D7 demonstrates a remarkably high affinity for binding to the HLAEpHLAG complex, ensuring the safety of its application. The ability of 4D7 mAb to effectively block the HLAEpHLAG complex and counteract the inhibition signal in NK cells. mAb 4D7 is a promising monoclonal antibody with substantial potential to serve as an ICI for clinical use in MM patients.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy has been a popular treatment for tumors in recent years, and it has good efficacy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially B-lymphoblastic ALL. Generally, CAR-T therapy affects the tumor immune microenvironment and activates the immune response, so it may lead to the occurrence of inflammation and some other adverse effects, most of which are self-limiting symptoms. However, a small number of children will develop severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening in severe cases. Currently, the main means of treating or alleviating CRS is the application of monoclonal antibodies, glucocorticosteroids, boosting drugs, etc. Although these drugs can relieve symptoms, further effects need to be further discussed. The mechanism of CAR-T causing ALL is described in this paper, and the mechanism, advantages and disadvantages of various drugs, and their impact on tumor treatment are compared to analyze the better measures to deal with CRS, so as to provide ideas for further clinical practice.">

        <tr id="7043 Background: Combination trials of BTK inhibitors (BTKi) with CAR-T have suggested potential synergistic benefit by improving CAR-T immunophenotype and clinical outcomes but are limited by increased toxicity. We report immunophenotype, cytokine profile, and patient outcomes with the new non-covalent BTKi, pirtobrutinib (pirto) when given prior to LV20.19 CAR-T and compare the final CAR product to pts who did not receive pirtobrutinib prior to CAR. Methods: Pts received LV20.19 CAR-T as part of a phase 1/2 trial (NCT04186520). Only pts who received pirto £4 weeks prior to apheresis were included. To determine the impact of pirto on LV20.19 CAR-T, we calculated both polyfunctionality (PFA) and polyfunctional strength index (PSI) for each product using the Isoplexis. Descriptive statistics, t-tests and Kaplan-Meier method were used as appropriate. Results: 11 pts received pirto prior to LV20.19 CAR-T (Table). Median age was 65 (50-80) yrs and median prior lines of therapy were 4 (2-8). There were 4 MCL pts, 5 Richter’s (RT)/CLL, 1 MZL and 1 DLBCL. Median duration of pirto was 4 (1-20) mo. Pts were on pirto for a median of 12 (1-22) days prior to apheresis. All except 1 pts received target CAR-T dose. The day 28 ORR was 82% (CR=7, PR=2). After a median follow up of 13 mo, 3 pts died (PD, Covid, Guillain Barre). The median PFS and OS were both 30.8 mo while the 1-year PFS and OS rates were 9 and 15 mo respectively. 9 pts had CRS and 2 had ICANS, all grades 1-2, while 4 had IEC-HS. One pt had afib recurrence and 1 pt had CMV viremia within 30 days of CAR-T. Among the pts with immunophenotypic data (n=10), there were no differences in naïve or more differentiated T-cell percentages in apheresis and final CAR-T products when compared to pts who did not receive pirto before LV20.19 CAR-T (n=57). Although not statistically significant, both PFA (CD4=61.8 vs 59, CD8= 49.8 vs 46.9) and PSI (CD4= 1752 vs 1608, CD8=1299 vs 1079) were higher with pirto pre-treated pts, suggesting a potential trend towards improved CAR-T functionality. Conclusions: These data represent the largest experience of pirto prior to CAR-T apheresis and demonstrate that pirto can be safely used as a bridge to LV20.19 CAR-T without negatively impacting their immunophenotype and potentially improving functionality. These data support our planned phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety of pirto as bridging and maintenance therapy with LV20.19 CAR-T (NCT05990465). [Table: see text]">

        <tr id="177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan (Betalutin) is an anti-CD37 radioimmunoconjugate evaluated as single administration therapy for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan treatment is well-tolerated and shows consistent activity in most of the patients evaluated so far. Herein, we investigated the activity of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan in a panel of 55 lymphoma cell lines of B and T cell origin. CD37-targeted radioimmunotherapy was more effective in CD37-positive B-cell lymphomas (n=46) than negative CD37 negative T-cell lymphomas (n=9). Focusing on DLBCL cell lines, mutations such as BCL2 or MYC translocations were not correlated to sensitivity. However, BCL2 expression was higher in resistant than sensitive GCB-DLBCL cell lines, and the addition of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax showed synergism when added to the radioimmunoconjugate. Finally, the pattern of activity of 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan differed from what was achieved with a CD37-targeting antibody-drug conjugate or with R-CHOP, indicating the potential benefit of the beta-emitter payload. In conclusion, this systematic analysis of the responsiveness of lymphoma cell lines to CD37-targeting radioimmunotherapy consolidated 177Lu-lilotomab satetraxetan as a promising compound for the treatment of CD37 positive malignancies and identified candidate biomarkers and co-targets to detect and overcome cancer cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms.">

        <tr id="2650 Background: REGN6569 is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is highly specific for glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor–related protein (GITR). GITR is expressed on several immune cell subtypes, notably regulatory T cells (Tregs), and activated natural killer (NK) cells. REGN6569 demonstrated greater in vitro antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against GITR-expressing Tregs, as compared to GITR-expressing CD8+ T cells. Mouse studies showed that REGN6569 + cemiplimab (anti-PD-1) combination treatment achieved longer-term tumor responses compared with either drug alone. Methods: This is a first-in-human study (NCT04465487) evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of REGN6569 administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) + cemiplimab 350 mg IV Q3W, in pts with advanced solid tumors for which immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies have not been approved or are not available. The study includes a dose-escalation part with 5 dose levels (DL1-DL5) for REGN6569 (“4+3” design), with an initial dose of REGN6569 monotherapy given as a safety lead-in followed by REGN6569 + cemiplimab in subsequent doses. Results: As of the data cutoff date Oct 20, 2023, the dose-escalation part has been completed. 29 pts (median age 58.0 years, 62.1% male) were treated with REGN6569 + cemiplimab, up to the 1200 mg dose level (DL5), across many solid tumor types. The most common tumor type was colorectal cancer (34.5%). One pt (40 mg DL2) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (Grade 3 hepatic failure); maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Twelve pts (41.4%) had a Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and 16 pts (55.2%) had a treatment-related TEAE (any grade). The most frequent TEAEs (any grade) were arthralgia (24.1%), infusion-related reactions, and abdominal pain (20.7% each). There were no treatment-related deaths; 19 (65.5%) pts had disease progression leading to death. Two pts achieved ongoing partial responses by investigator assessment with REGN6569 + cemiplimab treatment: 1 pt with mucoepidermoid tumor of the parotid gland treated with 120 mg (DL3) REGN6569 and 1 pt with B3 thymoma treated with 400 mg (DL4) REGN6569, with duration of responses, 5.6 and 10.4 months, respectively. Full receptor occupancy on circulating Tregs was observed in all dose cohorts following REGN6569 treatment. Increased frequency (~10–50%) of proliferating NK cells in peripheral blood was observed post REGN6569 treatment across all dose cohorts. Conclusions: In this dose-escalation study, REGN6569 was administered up to 1200 mg (DL5) in combination with cemiplimab with one dose-limiting toxicity. The study has progressed to dose-expansion cohorts in anti–PD-1-resistant head and neck cancer, with pts treated with REGN6569 (DL5) + cemiplimab. Clinical trial information: NCT04465487 .">

T cell receptor (TCR) bispecifics have shown overall survival (OS) benefit with tebentafusp (gp100 ´ CD3) in a phase (Ph) 3 trial in metastatic uveal melanoma [1]. IMC-F106C is the first TCR bispecific protein targeting CD3 and PRAME (PRAME ´ CD3), redirecting T cells towards cancer cells presenting a PRAME peptide on the cell surface by HLA-A*02:01 proteins. PRAME is expressed in the vast majority of melanoma. In an ongoing Ph 1 study (NCT04262466), IMC-F106C monotherapy was well tolerated and demonstrated evidence of durable clinical activity in heavily pre-treated, advanced melanoma patients, including those who progressed on prior ICI and targeted therapy [2]. Two doses, 40 mcg and 160 mcg, were selected for further study based on exposure response modeling. Safety of combination TCR bispecifics with ICI has been demonstrated in the ongoing IMC-F106C Ph 1 study and in a prior study of tebentafusp + ICI [3]. Combining IMC-F106C with the anti-PD1 ICI nivolumab has the potential to improve progression free survival (PFS), OS, and response rate (RR). Methods: PRISM-MEL-301 is a randomized, global, open-label, Ph 3 study in previously untreated HLA-A*02:01+ patients with unresectable or metastatic non-uveal melanoma; up to 10% of patients can have a diagnosis of mucosal, acral, or other non-CM melanoma. The first 90 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive IMC-F106C 40 mcg + nivolumab (Arm A), IMC-F106C 160 mcg + nivolumab (Arm B), or a nivolumab regimen (Arm C) from which a final IMC-F106C dose (Arm A or B) will be selected. Subsequently, approximately 590 additional patients will be randomized to Arm (A or B) vs. control Arm C, either nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab + relatlimab, dependent on the country. Randomization will be stratified by 1) American Joint Committee on Cancer (8th Edition) M stage with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; M0 or M1 with normal LDH vs M1 with elevated LDH); 2) prior anti-PD[L]1 adjuvant therapy (yes vs no); and 3) BRAF V600 mutation status (positive vs negative). Primary endpoint is PFS per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints include OS, ORR, and safety. Enrollment is ongoing globally.

        <tr id="TPS7083 Background: Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1) is a key component of the caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD 11)-B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL 10)-MALT1 signalosome complex, which activates nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling in response to B-cell–receptor or T-cell–receptor stimulation. Activation of NF-κB signaling promotes survival and proliferation of B-cell lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma. ONO-7018 is an oral, potent, and selective MALT1 inhibitor that has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in several lymphoma models (Morishita D, et al. Blood. 2020). Therefore, ONO-7018 has therapeutic potential for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of ONO-7018 as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL or CLL. Methods: This Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter study will be done in two parts, a dose-escalation phase (part 1) and a dose-expansion phase (part 2). An estimated 54 eligible patients will be enrolled. Patients must be adults with relapsed/refractory NHL or CLL with measurable disease; all acute toxic effects of prior antitumor therapy should be grade ≤1; have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2; and have adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function. Exclusion criteria include history of other lymphoid malignancy, central nervous system involvement, active autoimmune disease, systemic and active infection, serious or uncontrolled medical disorder, and patient inability to swallow tablets. ONO-7018 will be administered orally. In part 1, patients will be assigned to a dose level cohort (≤4 dose levels: DL1-DL4) using a 3+3 dose-escalation design. In part 2, patients will be given the recommended dose level from part 1, following safety review. The primary endpoints include dose-limiting toxicity, MTD, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics, objective response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The study began February 13, 2023, and is currently recruiting; part 1 is ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT05515406 .">

        <tr id="7004 Background: A substantial proportion of patients (pts) with relapsed/refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) will not derive a long-term benefit from the existing anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. To enhance therapeutic efficacy, we have engineered huCART19-IL18, a 4th generation 4-1BB anti-CD19 construct, armored with the ability to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-18. Methods: This is a first-in-human trial using huCART19-IL18 for CD19+ B-cell malignancies (NCT04684563). Expedited 3-day manufacturing is utilized to limit T-cell exhaustion. To be eligible for the NHL cohort, pts must be R/R to prior anti-CD19 CAR T cells if indicated by FDA label. Dose levels (DL) between 3x106 and 3x108 of huCART19-IL18+ cells are administered as a single IV infusion following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Bridging therapy is optional. Responses are first assessed at 3 months (mo) using Lugano criteria. Results: As of January 20, 2024, 21 pts with CD19+ NHL were infused with huCART19-IL18. Characteristics include median age 64 yrs (47-74), 76% male, 9 (43%) DLBCL, 6 (29%) FL, 3 (14%) MCL, 2 (10%) tFL, 1 (5%) HGBCL. Median number of prior Rx was 7 (4-14) with 20 (95%) pts R/R to prior anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Manufacturing of DL5 (3x108) was not feasible due to inability to achieve the target dose in 4/6 (67%) pts assigned to DL5. 18 (86%) pts received bridging. 3 pts received DL1 (3x106), 4 pts DL2 (7x106), 1 pt non-defined dose (2.8x107), 6 pts DL3 (3x107), 5 pts DL4 (7x107), 2 pts DL5 (3x108). No study-related deaths occurred in 21 safety-evaluable pts. CRS occurred in 15 (71%) pts: G1 in 8 (38%), G2 in 4 (19%), G3 in 3 (14%). ICANS occurred in 3 (14%) pts: G1 in 2 (10%), G2 in 1 (5%). The most common G3 adverse events at least possibly related to huCART19-IL18 included fatigue (38%), hypotension (29%), and low fibrinogen (23%). 20 pts are efficacy evaluable with median (m) follow-up of 15 mo (3-31). The 3 mo ORR was 80% (90% CI: 60-93%), with CR 50% (90% CI: 30-70%) and PR 30% (90% CI: 14-51%). mDOR was 10 mo (5.5-NR). mPFS was 8.7 mo (90% CI 5-NR), and mOS was NR (90% CI 25 mo-NR). We detected continued persistence of huCART19-IL18 in pts with 24 mo follow-up. No correlation between cell dose and outcome was identified, but response rates and mean expansion (copies/µg gDNA) were higher in pts previously exposed to CD28 CAR than those who had prior 4-1BB CAR (Table). Conclusions: Treatment with huCART19-IL18 has an acceptable safety profile and produced durable remissions in heavily pre-treated pts with R/R NHL despite prior CAR T-cell therapy. The subtype of the preceding CAR product may influence the expansion and effectiveness of huCART19-IL18. Clinical trial information: NCT04684563 . [Table: see text]">

        <tr id="e19537 Background: Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) is a benign precursor of multiple myeloma (MM). Individuals with MGUS have an overall 1% risk per year of disease progression to active MM or other cancers, although risk varies depending on multiple factors. Natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and dendritic cells have been shown to be altered in MM. Immune profile analysis can help to understand the microenvironment for monoclonal plasma cells better and help identify early factors for progression of MGUS into MM. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of individuals from 2007-2023 who had a confirmed MGUS diagnosis and available flow-cytometry based immunophenotyping of peripheral blood. Demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), immunoglobulin subtype, date of diagnosis and progression, CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, CD19+ B-cells, memory B-cells, gamma delta T cells, NK cells, and exhausted/non-exhausted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were characterized. Descriptive statistics were expressed as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and tabulated frequencies for categorical variables. Pearson’s chi-square test of independence was used to explore the relationship between categorical race and diagnosis across categorical variables. Analysis of variance was utilized to assess the variation in continuous variables by race and diagnosis. The investigation of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) involved using univariate and multivariate Cox models across all pertinent variables. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated. A stepwise regression model was incorporated into the Cox multivariate model for a comprehensive analysis. All statistical tests were tested at alpha=0.05. Results: This retrospective study analyzed 151 patients, 84 (55.6%) being male. Average age was 55-77.8 years. The primary sub-diagnosis included IgG kappa at 30.5%, followed by IgG lambda at 29.8%. No significant associations were observed between MGUS subtype and comorbidities, race and Immunoglobulin subtype, Mayo risk status, and free light chain ratio (FLCR). After median follow-up of 666 days, median PFS was 8.07 years with a 95% CI of (4.45, 14.68), and median OS exceeded 12.71 years. The Univariate model for PFS identified the CCI Score (p=0.003, HR=1.25), FLCR (p=0.012, HR=1.024), and NK T-cells (%gated) (p=0.0211, HR=1.033) as significant factors. Only the CCI score was retained in the multivariate stepwise model. Univariate model for OS revealed associations with CCI (p<0.001, HR=1.50), NK T-cells (%gated) (p=0.007, HR=1.05), monoclonal protein (p=0.008, HR=2.80), Non-exhausted T-cells-CD4 (% of CD4+) (p=0.013, HR=0.96), and age (p=0.023, HR=1.09). Conclusions: In this single-center retrospective review, only CCI remained prognostically significant in the multivariate model. CCI and NK T-cells were prognostically significant for OS in the univariate analysis.">

        <tr id="Abstract BACKGROUND High-grade gliomas (HGG) represent the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in children due to a lack of curative therapies. Challenges of cellular therapies in brain tumors include the lack of unique tumor antigens, downregulation of targeted antigens, and immune suppressive tumor microenvironment. To circumvent these obstacles, we devised a cellular delivery system using post-mitotic migratory cortical inhibitory interneuron precursors (MCIPs) to deliver therapeutic payloads in an antigen-independent manner. Notably, HGGs secrete the same chemoattractants stimulating long-distance MCIP migration as during normal fetal development, leading to the hypothesis that MCIPs would preferentially migrate to HGG cells. METHODS MCIP to HGG cell migration was assessed in vitro using transwell migration assays, and in vivo via stereotactic injection of MCIP and glioma xenografts in nude mice. As proof of principle, MCIPs were equipped with an EGFR or CD19 control bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) which activates T-cells upon their linkage to the tumor cells resulting in glioma elimination. Equipped MCIPs were co-cultured with HGG cells and CD8 T-cells at an effector to target ratio of 4:1. Results were validated in vivo via xenografts of HGG, MCIPs, and either a single dose of CD8 T-cells or repeated T-cell dosing via intraventricular cannula. Survival was evaluated via Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS MCIPs migrated preferentially to the majority of HGG cell lines in vitro and in vivo. This migration was mediated, at least in part, via CXCR4 ligands. MCIPs secreting an EGFR-BiTE potently killed HGG cells in vitro versus CD19-BiTE controls. Furthermore, nude mice xenografted with HGG and EGFR-expressing MCIPs experienced prolonged survival versus controls. CONCLUSION These data suggest that MCIPs form a viable cellular delivery system and can be equipped with various agents targeting HGG. Modified MCIPs could be differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells and injected into the resection cavity margins to eliminate residual cells.">

 Approximatively 40% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients exhibit primary resistance to standard therapy. Moreover, relapse is a common event in first-line responders. Overexpression of BCL-2 is a major determinant of resistance to chemotherapy in several B-cell neoplasms, including DLBCL. While venetoclax, a specific BCL-2 inhibitor, has dramatically changed the therapeutic landscape of other B-cell malignancies, only 12% of DLBCL patients exhibit a complete response to venetoclax, with a mean progression-free survival of 1 month. In this scenario, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. We tested the possibility to overcome the resistance of DLBCL cells to venetoclax by rewiring their reactive oxygen species (ROS) set point, which is higher in cancer cells compared to their healthy counterparts. We employed a panel of 14 DLBCL cell lines of both germinal center B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC) derivation. Cell death, ROS accumulation, and NADPH levels were evaluated upon treatment of DLBCL cells with three inhibitors of NADPH production, the central electron donor required to maintain ROS scavengers in their reduced form. The synergism between venetoclax and inhibitors of NADPH production was assessed through isobologram analysis. RNA-Seq, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blot techniques were used to dissect the mechanism of cooperation between venetoclax and inhibition of NADPH production. The Zebrafish model was used for in vivo validation of the therapeutic approach. We observed that inhibiting NADPH production dramatically improves the response to venetoclax by more than 500-fold, while no toxic effects were observed in normal B-cells. By generating isogenic cell lines with differing sensitivity to venetoclax, we demonstrated that the resistance to this drug positively correlates with the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL. Moreover, RNA-seq and protein analyses indicated that the increase of ROS levels engages the integrated stress response (ISR). Pharmacological inhibition and gene silencing of key effectors of the ISR rescued DLBCL cells from cell death induced by our therapeutic strategy. We also confirmed the ROS-dependency of BCL-xL downregulation using both ROS scavengers and by pulsing cells with exogenous hydrogen peroxide. Finally, in vivo studies confirmed the sensitization of DLBCL cells to venetoclax upon the inhibition of NADPH production. Taken together, these results provide the first proof-of-principle evidence for a ROS-based strategy to increase the therapeutic window of venetoclax in DLBCL, suggesting a viable therapeutic avenue to treat refractory patients.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy for hematological malignancies is a rapidly advancing field that has gained momentum in recent years, primarily encompassing chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and other modalities. However, its clinical efficacy remains limited, and drug resistance poses a significant challenge. Therefore, novel immunotherapeutic targets and agents need to be identified. Recently, N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent RNA epitope modification, has emerged as a pivotal factor in various malignancies. Reportedly, m6A mutations influence the immunological microenvironment of hematological malignancies, leading to immune evasion and compromising the anti-tumor immune response in hematological malignancies. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the roles of the currently identified m6A modifications in various hematological malignancies, with a particular focus on their impact on the immune microenvironment. Additionally, we provide an overview of the research progress made in developing m6A-targeted drugs for hematological tumor therapy, to offer novel clinical insights.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania parasites exhibits a wide range of clinical manifestations. Although parasites influence disease severity, cytolytic CD8 T cell responses mediate disease. While these responses originate in the lymph node, we found that expression of the cytolytic effector molecule granzyme B was restricted to lesional CD8 T cells in Leishmania-infected mice, suggesting that local cues within inflamed skin induced cytolytic function. Expression of Blimp-1 (Prdm1), a transcription factor necessary for cytolytic CD8 T cell differentiation, was driven by hypoxia within the inflamed skin. Hypoxia was further enhanced by the recruitment of neutrophils that consumed oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species and ultimately increased the hypoxic state and granzyme B expression in CD8 T cells. Importantly, lesions from cutaneous leishmaniasis patients exhibited hypoxia transcription signatures that correlated with the presence of neutrophils. Thus, targeting hypoxia-driven signals that support local differentiation of cytolytic CD8 T cells may improve the prognosis for patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis, as well as other inflammatory skin diseases where cytolytic CD8 T cells contribute to pathogenesis.">

The development of mutation-targeted therapies has greatly enhanced the treatment armamentarium, with FLT3 inhibitors and isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors improving outcomes in frontline and relapsed/refractory (RR) AML, and menin inhibitors showing efficacy in RR NPM1mut and KMT2A-rearranged AML. With so many new drugs approved, the number of potential combinatorial approaches to leverage the maximal benefit of these agents has increased dramatically, while at the same time introducing clinical challenges, such as key preclinical and clinical data supporting the development of combinatorial therapy, how to optimally combine or sequence these novel agents, how to optimise dose and duration to maintain safety while enhancing efficacy, the optimal duration of therapy and the role of measurable residual disease in decision-making in both intensive and low-intensity therapy settings. In this review, we will outline the evidence leading to the approval of key agents in AML, their on-label current approvals and how they may be optimally combined in a safe and deliverable fashion to further improve outcomes in AML.">

This review offers a thorough examination of how genetically modified T-cells might transform into CAR+ SPM. It explores genetic and molecular pathways leading to T-cell lymphomagenesis, the balance between CAR T-cell persistence, stemness, and oncogenic risk, and the trade-off of T-cell exhaustion, which may limit therapy efficacy but potentially reduce lymphomagenesis risk.">

        <tr id="Four new studies inform on the multistep path to generate broadly active HIV-1 antibodies A successful HIV-1 vaccine will have to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), which can counter most circulating HIV-1 strains. The Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) trial showed that the VRC01 bnAb, when passively delivered at a sufficient concentration, can prevent human infection by diverse VRC01-sensitive viruses (1). But how can bnAbs be elicited by vaccination? The germline-targeting (GT) approach is considered a leading strategy: Immunogens are designed to specifically target naïve human B cells that have the intrinsic genetic capacity to become bnAb-producing plasma cells. That is, their B cell receptors (BCRs) represent the germline (gl) precursors of mature bnAbs. On pages 754 and 755 of this issue, Steichen et al. (2) and Xie et al. (3), respectively, describe progress on a GT strategy for the V3-N332 glycan-dependent bnAb epitope. Additionally, Cottrell et al. (4) and Wang et al.

        <tr id="Purpose Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most prevalent paediatric brain tumour. Despite improvements in patient survival with current treatment strategies, the quality of life of these patients remains poor owing to the sequelae and relapse risk. An alternative, or, in addition to the current standard treatment, could be considered immunotherapy, such as Natural Killer cells (NK). NK cells are cytotoxic innate lymphoid cells that play a major role in cancer immunosurveillance. To date, the mechanism of cytotoxicity of NK cells, especially regarding the steps of adhesion, conjugation, cytotoxic granule polarisation in the cell contact area, perforin and granzyme release in two and three dimensions, and therapeutic efficacy in vivo have not been precisely described. Materials and Methods Each step of NK cytotoxicity against the three MB cell lines was explored using confocal microscopy for conjugation, Elispot for degranulation, flow cytometry, and luminescence assays for target cell necrosis and lysis and mediators released by cytokine array, and then confirmed in a 3D spheroid model. Medulloblastoma-xenografted mice were treated with NK cells. Their persistence was evaluated by flow cytometry, and their efficacy in tumour growth and survival was determined. In addition, their effects on the tumour transcriptome were evaluated. Results NK cells showed variable affinities for conjugation with MB target cells depending on their subgroup and cytokine activation. Chemokines secreted during NK and MB cell co-culture are mainly associated with angiogenesis and immune cell recruitment. NK cell cytotoxicity induces MB cell death in both 2D and 3D co-culture models. NK cells initiated an inflammatory response in a human MB murine model by modulating the MB cell transcriptome. Conclusion Our study confirmed that NK cells possess both in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic activity against MB cells and are of interest for the development of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has transformed over the past several decades through enhanced supportive care, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), improved human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, and novel graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-prevention and treatment strategies. Most notably, the implementation of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has dramatically increased the safety and availability of this life-saving therapy. Given reductions in nonrelapse mortality (NRM) with these advances, the HCT community has placed even greater emphasis on developing ways to reduce relapse - the leading cause of death after HCT. When using RIC HCT, protection from relapse relies predominantly on graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactions. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), adoptive cellular therapy, checkpoint inhibition, and post-HCT maintenance strategies represent approaches under study that aim to augment or synergize with the GVL effects of HCT. Optimizing donor selection algorithms to leverage GVL represents another active area of research. Many of these strategies seek to harness the effects of T cells, which for decades were felt to be the primary mediators of GVL and the focus of investigation in relapse reduction. However, there is growing interest in capitalizing on the ability of natural killer (NK) cells to yield potent anti-tumor effects. A potential advantage of NK cell-based approaches over T cell-mediated is the potential to reduce NRM in addition to relapse. By decreasing infection, without increasing the risk of GVHD, NK cells may mitigate NRM, while still yielding relapse reduction through identification and clearance of cancer cells. Most T cell-focused relapse-prevention strategies must weigh the benefits of relapse reduction against the increased risk of NRM from GVHD. In contrast, NK cells have the potential to reduce both, potentially tipping the scales significantly in favor of survival. Here, we will review the role of NK cells in GVL, optimization of NK cell match or mismatch, and burgeoning areas of research in NK cell therapy such as adoptive transfer and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells.">

        <tr id="Introduction & Objective: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease characterized by loss of immune tolerance to self-autoantigens and destruction of insulin-producing beta-cells. No single therapy confronts the several contributors to the disease. We developed an oral Salmonella-based vaccine that provides autoantigen in combination with TGFβ, IL10, and anti-CD3. The vaccine partially prevented and reversed autoimmune diabetes in mice. We also found that the hormone gastrin was beneficial to human islets in vitro and prevented, to a degree, autoimmune diabetes in mice. We hypothesized that the vaccine in combination with a gastrin analogue (GAST-17) would be more salutary in rodents with T1D than either agent alone.
 Methods: The vaccine and GAST-17 combination were administered to autoimmune diabetic mice and outcomes compared with animals that received the vaccine or gastrin alone. Effects on glucose metabolism, islet cellular infiltration, and specific immune cells were characterized. The tolerogenic mechanisms of the combination therapy were examined.
 Results: Administration of the vaccine with GAST-17 in combination reversed disease in 80% of diabetic mice compared to 63% of vaccine alone and 5% of GAST-17 alone treated animals. This was associated with increased antigen-specific regulatory T-cells, decreased islet-infiltrating lymphocytes, and increased beta-cell mass. As well, combination treated mice showed increased serum levels of the tolerogenic cytokine IL10 and decreased inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, GM-CSF, IL1-alpha, IL12).
 Conclusion: A novel combination treatment of an oral diabetes vaccine and GAST-17 was superior in the reversal of established T1D in mice. This combination strategy could be worthwhile examining in individuals with autoimmune diabetes.

        <tr id="T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a mature T-cell neoplasm associated with marked chemotherapy resistance and continued poor clinical outcomes. Current treatments, i.e. the CD52-antibody alemtuzumab, offer transient responses, with relapses being almost inevitable without consolidating allogeneic transplantation. Recent more detailed concepts of T-PLL's pathobiology fostered the identification of actionable vulnerabilities: (i) altered epigenetics, (ii) defective DNA damage responses, (iii) aberrant cell-cycle regulation, and (iv) deregulated pro-survival pathways, including TCR and JAK/STAT signaling. To further develop related pre-clinical therapeutic concepts, we studied inhibitors of (H)DACs, BCL2, CDK, MDM2, and clas-sical cytostatics, utilizing (a) single-agent and combinatorial compound testing in 20 well-characterized and molecularly-profiled primary T-PLL (validated by additional 42 cases), and (b) 2 independent murine models (syngeneic transplants and patient-derived xenografts). Overall, the most efficient/selective single-agents and combinations (in vitro and in mice) in-cluded Cladribine, Romidepsin ((H)DAC), Venetoclax (BCL2), and/or Idasanutlin (MDM2). Cladribine sensitivity correlated with expression of its target RRM2. T-PLL cells revealed low overall apoptotic priming with heterogeneous dependencies on BCL2 proteins. In additional 38 T-cell leukemia/lymphoma lines, TP53 mutations were associated with resistance towards MDM2 inhibitors. P53 of T-PLL cells, predominantly in wild-type configuration, was amenable to MDM2 inhibition, which increased its MDM2-unbound fraction. This facilitated P53 activa-tion and down-stream signals (including enhanced accessibility of target-gene chromatin re-gions), in particular synergy with insults by Cladribine. Our data emphasize the therapeutic potential of pharmacologic strategies to reinstate P53-mediated apoptotic responses. The identified efficacies and their synergies provide an informative background on compound and patient selection for trial designs in T-PLL.">

        <tr id="The evasive tactics of Treponema pallidum pose a major challenge in combating and eradicating syphilis. Natural killer (NK) cells mediate important effector functions in the control of pathogenic infection, preferentially eliminating targets with low or no expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. To clarify T. pallidum's mechanisms in evading NK-mediated immunosurveillance, experiments were performed to explore the cross-talk relations among T. pallidum, NK cells, and platelets. T. pallidum adhered to, activated, and promoted particle secretion of platelets. After preincubation with T. pallidum, platelets expressed and secreted high levels of MHC class I, subsequently transferring them to the surface of T. pallidum, potentially inducing an immune phenotype characterized by the "pseudo-expression" of MHC class I on the surface of T. pallidum (hereafter referred to a "pseudo-expression" of MHC class I). The polA mRNA assay showed that platelet-preincubated T. pallidum group exhibited a significantly higher copy number of polA transcript than the T. pallidum group. The survival rate of T. pallidum mirrored that of polA mRNA, indicating that preincubation of T. pallidum with platelets attenuated NK cell lethality. Platelets pseudo-expressed the MHC class I ligand on the T. pallidum surface, facilitating binding to killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors with two immunoglobulin domains and long cytoplasmic tail 3 (KIR2DL3) on NK cells and initiating dephosphorylation of Vav1 and phosphorylation of Crk, ultimately attenuating NK cell lethality. Our findings elucidate the mechanism by which platelets transfer MHC class I to the T. pallidum surface to evade NK cell immune clearance.">

        <tr id="3593 Background: The prognosis of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) is poor with limited treatment options available. IBI363 is a PD-1/IL-2α-bias bispecific antibody that specifically activate PD-1(+)CD25(+) tumor specific T cells while sparing PD-1(-)CD25(-) bystander T cells, and activate peripheral regulatory T cells to protect the body from autoimmunity. Herein, we report the safety and efficacy of IBI363 in patients (pts) with advanced CRC in a phase I study. Methods: Eligible pts with locally advanced or metastatic CRC who failed or intolerant to standard treatment were enrolled and received IBI363 intravenously at dose levels ranging from 100 ug/kg to 3 mg/kg every week (QW), every two weeks (Q2W) or every three weeks (Q3W). The primary endpoint was safety. The secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), etc. per RECIST v1.1. Results: As of December 22, 2023, a total of 68 pts (males: 55.9%, median age: 55.5 years, ECOG PS 1: 50.0%, liver metastasis: 61.8%; previous treatment ≥3 lines: 76.5%; previous immunotherapy: 27.9%) were recruited and received IBI363 treatment including 24 pts at 600 ug/kg Q2W and 20 pts at 1 mg/kg Q2W. Microsatellite stable (MSS)/proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) was presented in 57 (83.8%) pts and microsatellite status of the remaining 11 (16.2%) pts were unknown. Median follow up time was 5.3 months (95%CI: 4.4-6.9). Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 65 (95.6%) pts including grade ≥3 TEAEs in 22 (32.4%) pts. Common TEAEs (≥20%) were arthralgia (35.3%), anemia (32.4%), pyrexia (22.1%) and hypoalbuminemia (20.6%). Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 62 (91.2%) pts including grade ≥3 TRAEs in 16 (23.5%) pts. Immune related adverse events (irAEs) were reported in 22 (32.4%) pts including grade ≥3 irAEs in 4 (5.9%) pts. Serious TRAE were reported in 12 (17.6%) pts. TRAEs leading to treatment interruption and discontinuation were reported in 25 (36.8%) and 2 (2.9%) pts. No TRAE leading to death was reported. Pts with at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment were included in efficacy evaluable set. In all evaluable pts (n=63), overall ORR was 12.7% (95%CI: 5.6-23.5). In pts with liver metastasis (n=38), ORR was 13.2% (95%CI: 4.4-28.1). In pts with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 (n=13), ORR was 30.8% (95%CI: 9.1-61.4), and DCR was 76.9% (95%CI: 46.2-95.0). The median DoR was not reached. A prospective cohort of CRC pts with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 has been initiated. Further details and data will be updated at the meeting. Conclusions: IBI363 showed acceptable tolerability and manageable safety profiles in pts with advanced CRC. Preliminary efficacy of IBI363 was observed, particularly in pts with PD-L1 CPS ≥1.

        <tr id="Introduction Severe Graves’ disease is a life-changing condition with poor outcomes from currently available treatments. It is caused by directly pathogenic thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor-stimulating antibodies (TRAb), which are secreted from plasma cells. The human anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab was developed to target plasma cells which express high levels of CD38, and is currently licensed for treatment of the plasma cell malignancy, myeloma. However, it can also deplete benign plasma cells with the potential to reduce TRAb and alter the natural history of severe Graves’ disease. This study aims to establish proof of concept that daratumumab has efficacy in patients with severe Graves’ disease and will provide important data to inform a choice of dosing regimen for subsequent trials. Methods and analysis The Graves-PCD trial aims to determine if daratumumab modulates the humoral immune response in patients with severe Graves’ disease, and if so, over what time period, and to find an optimal dose. It is a single-blinded, randomised, dose-finding, adaptive trial using four different doses of daratumumab or placebo in 30 adult patients. Part 1 of the trial is dose-finding and, following an interim analysis, in part 2, the remaining patients will be randomised between the chosen dose(s) from the interim analysis or placebo. The primary outcome is the percentage change in serum TRAb from baseline to 12 weeks. Ethics and dissemination The trial received a favourable ethical opinion from London-Hampstead Research Ethics Committee (reference 21/LO/0449). The results of this trial will be disseminated at international meetings, in the peer-reviewed literature and through partner patient group newsletters and presentations at patient education events.

Castleman disease (CD) is a benign lymphoproliferative disease causing severe systemic inflammation. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a major pathogenesis of multicentric CD (MCD), but only 30-60% of patients respond to IL-6 inhibitors. Novel agents for IL-6 inhibitor-refractory cases are needed. Clinical data and samples are being collected on a large scale and the clinical, pathological and pathogenetic aspects are being elucidated.


AREAS COVERED
The pathological and clinical classification of CD is outlined. Focusing on idiopathic MCD (iMCD), this review identifies therapeutic targets and summarizes currently recommended drugs and promising therapeutic candidates.


EXPERT OPINION
The pathogenesis of MCD has been implicated in the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK)-transcriptional signaling activator (STAT)3 pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mechanical target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. iMCD-TAFRO (thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever/elevated CRP, reticulin myelofibrosis/renal dysfunction, organ enlargement) is resistant to IL-6 inhibitors, and cyclosporine and mTOR inhibitors are sometimes effective. JAK inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors may be therapeutic agents for iMCD. Recently, we have shown that peripheral helper T (Tph) cell abnormalities are at the core of iMCD pathogenesis. Therapies targeting chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13) produced by Tph cells and blocking the Tph-CXCL13-B cell pathway may satisfy unmet need in refractory cases.">

        <tr id="e14523 Background: Adoptive cell therapy for the treatment of cancer has largely focused on the administration of autologous engineered αβ T cells. Although successful in some haematological malignancies, the solid tumour microenvironment (TME) poses significant challenges to the efficacy of CAR-T cells, including physical barriers, heterogeneous antigen expression or antigen escape and immunosuppressive mediators. Remodeling the immunosuppressive solid TME is pivotal to the success of immunotherapies. Recent studies have highlighted key roles for neutrophils in tumour control and in facilitating successful responses to cancer immunotherapy, with neutrophil functional heterogeneity within the TME becoming increasingly appreciated. Methods: At LIfT Biosciences we have developed the first-in-class, stem cell-derived immuno-cell therapy with anti-cancer neutrophil properties called Immunomodulatory Alpha Neutrophils (IMANs). IMANs are derived from CD34+ stem cells expanded and differentiated in proprietary media compositions in a simple and scalable GMP-compliant manufacturing process. IMANs are designed to recapitulate those neutrophil states that are both cytotoxic and capable of immunomodulating the solid TME for long-lasting tumour control. Off-the-shelf, allogeneic, innate IMANs have the potential to provide major clinical benefits in the treatment of multiple solid tumours. Results: IMANs multimodal mechanisms of action (MoA) have been demonstrated in different state-of-the-art solid tumour models, including co-culture with patient-derived xenograft organoids (PDX-O) and with 3D ex vivo patient tissues (tumour-on-a-chip). Direct antigen-independent cytotoxicity towards PDX-O from a range of solid tumour indications has been demonstrated. Additionally, and fundamental to IMANs MoA is their ability to migrate to the solid TME and recruit and activate recipients’ anti-tumour immune responses. We have demonstrated IMANs ability to rapidly migrate into the solid TME and promote recruitment of patients’ immune cells leading to enhanced tumour cell death using tumour-on-a-chip technology accompanied by daily live cell imaging. Mechanistically, co-culture with IMANs enhanced expression of co-stimulatory receptors on T and NK cells, such as OX40 and 4-1BB, as well as promoting secretion of TME-modulating factors, such as CXCL10. Furthermore, co-culture with IMANs enhanced secretion of IFN-γ by activated tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. Conclusions: These cytotoxic and immunomodulatory functions enable IMANs to remodel the TME, leaving the solid tumour more susceptible to host immune responses.">

        <tr id="The tuberculin skin test (TST) is a cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity reaction to antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We provide the first single cell sequencing characterisation of the human TST reaction, based on skin suction blisters induced at the site of the TST on day 2 in 31 individuals. Integrated single cell RNA and TCR sequencing showed the immune response to be dominated by T cells, with smaller populations of NK cells and myeloid cells. T cells comprised CD4, CD8, gamma/delta and NK T cells, with 50% of all T cells identified as cytotoxic and 14% as regulatory. Interferon gamma gene expression was strongest in CD8 T cells, and distinct CD4 T helper lineages could not unambiguously be identified at this time point. Amongst myeloid cells, 63% displayed antimicrobial gene expression and 28% were functionally polarised towards antigen presentation with higher levels of HLA class 2 expression. We derived and validated transcriptional signatures for cell types and cellular functions relevant to the immune landscape of the TST. These data help to improve our understanding of the immune response to Mtb and enable further exploration of bulk transcriptomic data through context-specific cellular deconvolution.">

This study explores the impact of NOTCH1 signalling on venetoclax sensitivity in vitro. Although NOTCH1 activation minimally impaired the susceptibility of CLL cells to venetoclax, ex vivo cell competition studies reveal that cells with constitutive NOTCH1 activation outgrew their wild‐type counterparts in the presence of ongoing venetoclax exposure. Our findings suggest that while NOTCH1 activation is insufficient to confer venetoclax refractoriness, there is enhanced potential for cells with NOTCH1 activation to escape and thus become fully resistant to venetoclax.">

        <tr id="With an estimated 10 million people infected, the deltaretrovirus human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the second most prevalent pathogenic retrovirus in humans after HIV-1. Like HIV-1, HTLV-1 overwhelmingly persists in a host via a reservoir of latently infected CD4+ T cells. Although most patients are asymptomatic, HTLV-1-associated pathologies are often debilitating and include adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL), which presents in mature adulthood and is associated with poor prognosis with short overall survival despite treatment. Curiously, the strongest indicator for the development of ATLL is the acquisition of HTLV-1 through breastfeeding. There are no therapeutic or preventative regimens for HTLV-1. However, antiretrovirals (ARVs), which target the essential retrovirus enzymes, have been developed for and transformed HIV therapy. As the architectures of retroviral enzyme active sites are highly conserved, some HIV-specific compounds are active against HTLV-1. Here, we expand on our work, which showed that integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) and some nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) block HTLV-1 transmission in cell culture. Specifically, we find that dolutegravir, the INSTI currently recommended as the basis of all new combination antiretroviral therapy prescriptions, and the latest prodrug formula of the NRTI tenofovir, tenofovir alafenamide, also potently inhibit HTLV-1 infection. Our results, if replicated in a clinical setting, could see transmission rates of HTLV-1 and future caseloads of HTLV-1-associated pathologies like ATLL dramatically cut via the simple repurposing of already widely available HIV pills in HTLV-1 endemic areas. Considering our findings with the old medical saying “it is better to prevent than cure”, we highly recommend the inclusion of INSTIs and tenofovir prodrugs in upcoming HTLV-1 clinical trials as potential prophylactics.">

        <tr id="4129 Background: 23ME-00610 is being evaluated in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid malignancies (NCT05199272) and has demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with favorable PK and peripheral CD200R1 saturation. Here, we report data from the neuroendocrine cancer Phase 2a expansion cohort for the first time. Methods: Eligible patients had histologically diagnosed locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic neuroendocrine cancers who had progressed on standard therapies. Key exclusion criteria included active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy and Grade ≥ 3 immune-mediated toxicity related to prior immunotherapy that led to discontinuation. The primary objective was evaluation of clinical antitumor activity. Exploratory biomarkers included CD200R1 and CD200 tumor expression by IHC in archival tissue, germline genotyping, and polygenic risk score calculation for immune-mediated and cancer phenotypes. At least 15 patients were accrued to characterize target-specific biomarkers and efficacy. Patients received 1400 mg given IV every 3 weeks until disease progression, and CT/MRI scans were conducted every ~ 8 weeks. Results: Between February 23 and November 7, 2023, 16 patients with advanced neuroendocrine neoplasms (87.5% Stage IV; 62.5% NEC, 25% pancreatic, 6.3% colorectal; age: 33 to 74), who received a median of 3.5 prior treatment lines (range: 1 to 10), were enrolled and received ≥ 1 dose of 23ME-00610. Median exposure was 43.5 days (range: 1 – 212 days), and 11 patients (69%) had disease progression by the December 13, 2023 data cutoff. In the 15 efficacy evaluable patients, investigator assessed stable disease rate was 46.7% (N=7) and median progression free survival (mPFS) was 2.1 months (median potential follow-up time was 6.3 mo); 4 patients (26.7%) had durable SD > 6 mo. At least 1 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) was reported by all patients (N=16). Related TEAEs occurred in 8 patients (50%); all were G1/G2, and the most common were maculopapular rash (18.8%), pruritus (18.8%), nausea (12.5%), and fatigue (12.5%). Immune related TEAEs were G1 (18.8%) and included maculopapular rash (18.8%) and pruritus (12.5%). No G4/G5 or TEAEs leading to 23ME-00610 discontinuation were reported. 1400 mg dose resulted in full peripheral saturation of CD200R1 and minimal treatment-emergent ADA. Conclusions: 23ME-00610 continues to show encouraging PKPD, safety, and disease control in a subset of unselected patients with advanced neuroendocrine cancers. Exploratory biomarker data warrant additional analyses to examine the potential for biomarker stratification on disease outcomes. Phase 2a expansion trials of 23ME-00610 utilizing retrospective biomarker analysis are ongoing in multiple indications. Clinical trial information: NCT05199272 .">

        <tr id="Standard-of-care treatment for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is comprised of surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has demonstrated disease-modifying activity in GBM and holds great promise. Radiation, a standard-of-care treatment for GBM, has well-known immunomodulatory properties and may overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME); however, radiation dose optimization and integration with CAR T cell therapy is not well defined. Murine immunocompetent models of GBM were treated with titrated doses of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) of 5, 10, and 20 Gray (Gy), and the TME was analyzed using Nanostring. A conditioning dose of 10 Gy was determined based on tumor growth kinetics and gene expression changes in the TME. We demonstrate that a conditioning dose of 10 Gy activates innate and adaptive immune cells in the TME. Mice treated with 10 Gy in combination with mCAR T cells demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity and superior memory responses to rechallenge with IL13Rα2-positive tumors. Furthermore, 10 Gy plus mCAR T cells also protected against IL13Rα2-negative tumors through a mechanism that was, in part, c-GAS-STING pathway-dependent. Together, these findings support combination conditioning with low-dose 10 Gy radiation in combination with mCAR T cells as a therapeutic strategy for GBM.">

        <tr id="Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy for β-thalassemia major in children. However, it often induces graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), which is associated with complications. In the present study, we used cyclophosphamide (Cy) to treat a thalassemia patient post-HSCT to reduce the adverse effects of GVHD. We monitored the numbers and phenotype of granulocytes. In this case study, an 11-year-old female patient, diagnosed with β-thalassemia major (Pesaro class II), was treated with Cy before and after HSCT with mobilized CD34+ cells. Both the relative and absolute granulocyte counts, as well as CD33+CD11b+ cell counts, increased significantly after HSCT until day 56. However, they suddenly began to decrease after day 56, accompanied by severe diarrhea, skin rash, and a decrease in bilirubin levels compared to day -12. Furthermore, compared to day -12, IL-22 levels increased until day 56, and then decreased, while IDO levels continued to rise after day 56. Our data suggest the potential use of IL-22 and IDO as biomarkers for GVHD assessment. It also indicates that Cy promotes HSCT reconstitution by increasing CD33+CD11b+ cells, which may play a crucial role in reducing GVHD risks. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism behind GVHD recurrence.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The need for reliable biomarkers to predict clinical benefit from anti-PD1 treatment in metastatic melanoma (MM) patients remains unmet. Several parameters have been considered in the tumor environment or the blood, but none has yet achieved sufficient accuracy for routine clinical practice. Whole blood samples from MM patients receiving second-line anti-PD1 treatment (NCT02626065), collected longitudinally, were analyzed by flow cytometry to assess the immune cell subsets absolute numbers, the expression of immune checkpoints or ligands on T cells and the functionality of innate immune cells and T cells. Clinical response was assessed according to Progression-Free Survival (PFS) status at one-year following initiation of anti-PD1 (responders: PFS > 1 year; non-responders: PFS ≤ 1 year). At baseline, several phenotypic and functional alterations in blood immune cells were observed in MM patients compared to healthy donors, but only the proportion of polyfunctional memory CD4+ T cells was associated with response to anti-PD1. Under treatment, a decreased frequency of HVEM on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after 3 months of treatment identified responding patients, whereas its receptor BTLA was not modulated. Both reduced proportion of CD69-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increased number of polyfunctional blood memory T cells after 3 months of treatment were associated with response to anti-PD1. Of upmost importance, the combination of changes of all these markers accurately discriminated between responding and non-responding patients. These results suggest that drugs targeting HVEM/BTLA pathway may be of interest to improve anti-PD1 efficacy.">

As such, ASCs are key mediators of humoral immunity whether it be in the context of pathogen exposure, vaccination or even homeostatic clearance of cellular debris. Therefore, understanding basic tenants of ASC biology such as their differentiation kinetics following B cell stimulation is of importance. Towards that aim, we developed a mouse model which expresses simian HBEGF (a.k.a., diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)) under the control of the endogenous Jchain locus (or J-DTR). ASCs from these mice expressed high levels of cell surface DTR and were acutely depleted following diphtheria toxin treatment. Furthermore, proof-of-principle experiments demonstrated the ability to use these mice to track ASC reconstitution following depletion in 3 distinct organs. Overall, J-DTR mice provide a new and highly effective genetic tool allowing for the study of ASC biology in a wide range of potential applications.">

        <tr id="Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare lymphoproliferative neoplasm considered incurable, with a median survival of 3-5 years. In recent years, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) have been introduced, demonstrating high therapeutic activity. However, the prognosis for MCL patients failing ibrutinib therapy is particularly poor, with a survival expectation of a few months. In this phase II trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of the carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRD) combination in MCL patients who were relapsed/refractory (R/R) or intolerant to BTKi and in need of treatment. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the KRD combination in terms of 12-month overall survival (12-month OS). From September 2019 to December 2020, 16 patients were enrolled from 11 Italian centers. After a median follow-up of 2.37 months (95% CI 0.92-6.47), the 12-month OS was 13%. The rate of grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) was 35%, and the overall response rate (ORR) was 19%. These results led to the premature termination of enrollment, as defined in the protocol stopping rules. The efficacy of the KRD combination in advanced-stage MCL patients who are R/R to BTKi is unsatisfactory and too toxic.">

        <tr id="e19040 Background: The combination of rituximab (anti-CD20 mAb) and lenalidomide was approved for use in relapsed or refractory (R/R) indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). IMM0306 is a fusion protein of CD20 monoclonal antibody with the CD47 binding domain of SIRPα on both heavy chains. It exerts excellent cancer killing efficacy by activating both macrophages and NK cells via blockade of CD47-SIRPα interaction and FcɣR engagement. Here, we report on a Phase I study of 8 patients (pts) with R/R CD20-positive B-cell NHL. Methods: This is an open-label, multicenter phase I study (NCT05771883). The study is designed to use "3+3" scheme for dose escalation exploring in 2 dose levels of IMM0306 (1.6 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg), intravenously administered each week in each 28-day cycle; while lenalidomide will be administered as fixed dose of 20 mg for NHL, taken orally once daily for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle to determinate maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was evaluated in the first 28 days of the combination therapy. Safety was evaluated per CTCAE 5.0, tumor assessments performed once every 8 weeks by Lugano 2014. Results: As of Jan 5, 2024, 8 pts with R/R follicular lymphoma (FL, n=6) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL, n=2) were enrolled. The median age was 52.5 years with 7 (87.5%) males. The median prior line of therapy was 1. All pts received previous anti-CD20 therapy. Among 7 efficacy evaluable pts, 1 CR (FL), 4 PR (2 FL, 2 MZL), and 1 SD were seen. The ORR and DCR were 71.4% and 85.7%, respectively. Two DLTs (grade 4 PLT decreased without bleeding) were observed at 2.0 mg/kg IMM0306 + 20 mg Lenalidomide dose level, but none at the dose level of 1.6 mg/kg IMM0306 + 20 mg Lenalidomide. The most common treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were lymphocyte decreased (62.5%), ANC decreased (62.5%), WBC decreased (50%), anemia (50%), bilirubin increased (50%), PLT decreased (37.5%), infusion-related reactions (37.5%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 6 pts, including lymphocyte decreased (62.5%), PLT decreased (25%), WBC decreased (12.5%), ANC decreased (12.5%) and pneumonia (12.5%). One pt experienced treatment related serious adverse event. 5 patients experienced TRAEs, leading to the study drug interruption, while no patients experienced TRAEs leading to the study drug discontinuation or death. 2 pts had a dose reduction of IMM0306 (2.0 mg/kg dose level), 3 pts had dose reductions of lenalidomide due to TRAEs. Pharmacodynamics analysis demonstrated IMM0306 combine lenalidomide effectively depleted B cell in peripheral blood within 24 hours. Conclusions: 1.6 mg/kg IMM0306 in combination with 20 mg lenalidomide was well-tolerated and with a robust preliminary anti-tumor activity in pts with R/R FL and MZL. The phase I study is ongoing.

        <tr id="Abstract BACKGROUND B7-H3 CAR T-cells effectively eradicate brain tumors in xenograft models and have proven safe in clinical trials, yet no objective responses were observed in patients. The limited efficacy is partly attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), a characteristic not fully recapitulated in investigations using xenograft models. In this study, we set to optimize B7-H3 CAR structure and examine the effects of CAR design on the brain TME using an immunocompetent glioma model. METHODS We generated a panel of fully murine B7-H3 CARs with variations in transmembrane, co-stimulatory, and activation domains. This enabled us to comprehensively investigate their effector functions within the intact immune system. High-dimensional flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing were then used to investigate changes in the brain TME following CAR T-cell therapy. RESULTS While five out of six B7-H3 CARs with single co-stimulatory domains exhibited potent functionality in vitro, optimizing co-stimulation and signaling failed to enhance their anti-glioma efficacy in vivo. To further enhance therapeutic effectiveness and persistence, we incorporated 4-1BB and CD28 co-stimulation through transgenic expression of 4-1BBL on CD28-based CAR T-cells. Although this design significantly improved anti-glioma efficacy in vitro, it conferred no additional benefits in vivo. Analysis of the TME revealed that CAR T-cell therapy influenced the immune composition of the brain TME. Successful anti-tumor responses were dictated by the recruitment, activation, and spatial localization of unique inflammatory ‘immune hubs’ containing specific subsets of macrophages and endogenous T-cells. Interestingly, depletion of brain macrophages using CSF1R inhibitor markedly inhibited CAR T-cell anti-tumor activity. CONCLUSION Our study highlights the critical role of CAR structural design and its modulation of the TME in mediating the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy in brain tumors. Yet, more specific targeting and/or reprogramming of the TME is warranted for the successful design of effective adoptive immunotherapies for high-grade glioma.">

        <tr id="Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of the most common and relevant opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised individuals such as kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). The exact mechanisms underlying the disability of cytotoxic T cells to provide sufficient protection against CMV in immunosuppressed individuals have not been identified yet. Here, we performed in-depth metabolic profiling of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in immunocompromised patients and show the development of metabolic dysregulation at the transcriptional, protein, and functional level of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells in KTRs with non-controlled CMV infection. These dysregulations comprise impaired glycolysis and increased mitochondrial stress, which is associated with an intensified expression of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nucleotidase (NADase) CD38. Inhibiting NADase activity of CD38 reinvigorated the metabolism and improved cytokine production of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells. These findings were corroborated in a mouse model of CMV infection under conditions of immunosuppression. Thus, dysregulated metabolic states of CD8+ T cells could be targeted by inhibiting CD38 to reverse hypo-responsiveness in individuals who fail to control chronic viral infection.">

        <tr id="Immunosuppressive treatment in patients with rheumatic diseases can maintain disease remission but also increase risk of infection. Their response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination is frequently blunted. In this study we evaluated the effect of immunosuppression exposure on humoral and T cell immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in two distinct cohorts of patients; one during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and 3 months later during convalescence, and another prior to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, with follow up sampling 6 weeks after vaccination. Results were compared between rituximab-exposed (in previous 6 months), immunosuppression-exposed (in previous 3 months), and non-immunosuppressed groups. The immune cell phenotype was defined by flow cytometry and ELISA. Antigen specific T cell responses were estimated using a whole blood stimulation interferon-γ release assay. A focused post-vaccine assessment of rituximab-treated patients using high dimensional spectral cytometry was conducted. Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was characterised by T cell lymphopenia, and a reduction in NK cells and naïve CD4 and CD8 cells, without any significant differences between immunosuppressed and non-immunosuppressed patient groups. Conversely, activated CD4 and CD8 cell counts increased in non-immunosuppressed patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection but this response was blunted in the presence of immunosuppression. In rituximab-treated patients, antigen-specific T cell responses were preserved in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, but patients were unable to mount an appropriate humoral response.">

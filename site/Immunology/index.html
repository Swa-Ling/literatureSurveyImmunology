        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Although effective for immunologically hot tumors, immune checkpoint inhibitors minimally affect tumors that are not T cell inflamed, including breast cancer. An alternate strategy to combat immune cold breast tumors may be to reeducate innate immunity. This study identifies strategies to skew neutrophils to acquire tumoricidal properties. Systemic Toll-like receptor (TLR)–induced inflammation, concomitant with mitochondrial complex I inhibition in breast tumors, increases neutrophil cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells and independently of CD8+ T cell immunity. These therapy-entrained neutrophils enhance secretory granule production, increasing expression of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase machinery and inducing a respiratory burst. Moreover, systemic administration of TLR agonists elevates nuclear factor κB signaling in neutrophils to increase production of secretory granule and NADPH oxidase machinery components, whereas complex I inhibitors are required to potentiate oxidative damage. In summary, we describe a class of neutrophils, educated by the combined action of inflammatory mediators and metabolic inhibitors, having tumoricidal functions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Severe coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2, are marked by systemic inflammation, T-cell exhaustion, lymphopenia, and chronic immune dysfunction, with limited therapeutic options for recovery. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a naturally occurring feline coronavirus infection, mirrors these immune pathologies, providing a valuable translational model. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) therapy combined with antiviral treatment in cats with effusive FIP. Hematologic, virologic, and immunologic analyses were conducted over 12 weeks. Antiviral therapy reduced cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion by downregulating inhibitory receptors PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3. MSC-treated cats demonstrated enhanced immune recovery, evidenced by reduced expression of exhaustion-related transcription factors (IKZF2, ZEB2, PRDM1) and increased regulatory T-cell populations, promoting immune homeostasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of mesenteric lymph nodes revealed transcriptomic shifts indicative of immune rejuvenation, including elevated memory T-cell markers (IKZF1, GZMK, IL7R) and reduced hyperproliferative lymphocyte subsets. Serum cytokine analysis revealed 3 distinct inflammatory mediator patterns using principal component analysis. Both treatment groups showed transitions toward cytokine profiles resembling those of healthy controls. Notably, residual cytokine elevations persisted at the study’s end, mirroring features of chronic immune dysregulation. PDGF-bb, a marker of tissue repair, was uniquely associated with higher lymphocyte counts, suggesting its role in lymphoid recovery. This study highlights the potential of MSC therapy to modulate immune dysfunction and support durable immune recovery. The findings underscore its translational relevance for addressing severe viral diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, advancing both veterinary and human medicine.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and associated receptors remains poorly characterized. We applied a single-cell multi-omics approach (CITE-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy donors, before and after in vitro TNF stimulation. Using integrated analysis of surface protein expression and transcriptomic data, we focused on phenotypic and transcriptional changes in dendritic cell populations. DCs from RA patients exhibited elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, indicative of an inflammatory phenotype, and showed marked responsiveness to TNF. Upon stimulation, RA-derived DCs upregulated genes involved in antigen presentation (CD83, LAMP3), lymph node migration (CCR7, ADAM19), and inflammation (TRAF1, IL24) whereas such activation was absent in healthy controls. Our data reveal a TNF-responsive, pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in dendritic cells from RA patients and underscore the relevance of the TNF receptor profile in shaping DC function. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of RA and identify dendritic cells as potential targets for personalized immunomodulatory therapy.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (TINs) are highly heterogeneous and mostly immunosuppressive in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Current biomarkers of TINs and treatment strategies targeting TINs have not yielded optimal responses in patients across cancer types. Here, we separated human and mouse neutrophils into three developmental stages, including promyelocyte (PM), myelocyte & metamyelocyte (MC & MM), and banded & segmented (BD & SC) neutrophils. Based on this separation, we observed the predominance of human but not mouse MC & MM-stage neutrophils in bone marrow (BM), which exhibit potent immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting properties. MCs & MMs also occupy the majority of TINs among patients with 17 cancer types. Moreover, through the creation of a NCG-Gfi1-/- human immune system (HIS) mouse model, which supports efficient reconstitution of human TIN, we found a significant increase of BM MCs & MMs in tumor-bearing mice. By comparing the scRNA-seq analysis results of human neutrophils from both BM and tumors, we found CD63 and Galectin-3 distinguish MC & MM from neutrophil populations in cancer patients. Furthermore, we proposed a strategy with Flt3L to specifically induce the trans-differentiation of MCs & MMs into monocytic cells, and trigger tumor control in NCG-Gfi1-/- HIS mice. Thus, our findings establish an essential role of human MC & MM-stage neutrophils in promoting cancer progression, and suggest their potential as targets for developing potential biomarkers and immunotherapies for cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a critical therapeutic strategy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, relapse remains a major challenge, with limited effective options for managing post-transplant recurrence. Tumor cells escape immune surveillance by establishing a complex, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a central role in immune evasion and disease relapse. Understanding the TME’s impact on immune cells and their functional alterations is therefore of significant clinical importance. Methods Utilizing a non-irradiated AML mouse model and bioinformatic analysis, we systematically analyzed T-cell dynamics during AML progression and identified abnormal metabolic activation in CD8+ T cells at early disease stages, which correlated with leukemia cell immune evasion. Result We found that when major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on AML cells were haplomatched with immune cells, CD8+ T cells exhibited robust cytokine and cytotoxic activation, retaining immune profiles similar to those of normal T cells. However, under the same tumor burden, T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, showed dramatic metabolic gene activation in MHC-matched leukemic mice. This metabolic activation led to rapid exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, accelerating leukemia progression. Based on these activated metabolic genes, we established a metabolism-associated genes (MAGs) scoring system. Validation using public datasets revealed that a high MAG score is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Conclusions Our findings provide molecular evidence supporting the stronger graft-versus-leukemia effects observed in HLA haploidentical HSCT. Moreover, they highlight that abnormal metabolic activation in CD8+ T cells during early AML progression contributes to rapid disease advancement and poor prognosis.

        <tr id="Aging significantly influences host immune responses to viral infections, including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV), which is associated with high mortality in elderly patients. Despite its high fatality rate and pandemic potential, effective therapies remain unavailable, and the age-dependent mechanisms underlying SFTSV pathogenesis are not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed a ferret model (an immunocompetent animal model that mimics human SFTSV infections) and performed multi-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing and histopathological analyses. Our results reveal that, upon SFTSV infection, aged ferrets experience extensive decrease of critical immune cells (particularly B and T cells) due to infection-induced cell death and excessive hemophagocytosis in hematopoietic organs, whereas young-adult ferrets rapidly clear the virus with minimal lymphocyte changes. Notably, aged ferrets display marked immune dysregulation, characterized by non-specific activation of T-bet ⁺ age-associated memory B cells (T-bet+ ABCs) and the proliferation of defective plasmablasts (MKI67 ⁺ PB1), which serve as major viral reservoirs and drive systemic viral dissemination. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that the MKI67 ⁺ PB1 subset dominates SFTSV⁺ cells in both aged ferrets and human fatal cases, exhibiting the highest per-cell viral UMI counts. Moreover, monocytes and macrophages in aged ferrets exhibit heightened inflammatory gene expression, contributing to the hyper-inflammatory state observed during infection. Collectively, these insights underscore the critical role of dysregulated memory B cell responses and hyper-inflammation in age-dependent SFTSV pathogenesis, highlighting potential targets for interventions in elderly populations.">

        <tr id="Introduction Immune-based agents, especially Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI), are standard of care therapy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC); however, a significant number of patient tumors fail to respond, or develop resistance. While target expression, mutation burden and oncogenic pathways impact responses, an established mechanism contributing to ICI therapy failure is evasion of T-cell responses via downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Conversely, natural killer (NK) cells eQector function is enhanced in the absence of HLA, making NK cellular therapies an attractive option for ICI resistant tumors. Challenges for current NK cell therapies include failure to adequately infiltrate solid tumors and long-term persistence, which may be overcome by deploying NK-derived extracellular vesicles (NKEVs) as a personalized novel adoptive cellular therapeutic with cytotoxic effects. Methods In a human NSCLC cohort (n=10), we used single cell RNAseq and antibody labeling (CITEseq) to examine the immune cell landscape in peripheral immune cells (PBMCs) and tumors. NKEVs retrieved from patient NK cells were characterized with proteomics and bulk RNAseq, and EV functionality was assessed using primary tumor organoids. Results We identified circulating NK cell subsets, describing diQerences in cell composition, gene expression and signaling, related to time point, NSCLC subtype (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell), composition and tumor grade. Next, we examined the functional capabilities of patient NKEVs in organoid structures derived from primary tumor cells, finding that exposure to patient NKEVs resulted in a 40-45% decrease in organoid viability, and significantly lowered the cisplatin dose required to elicit cytotoxicity. In Nivolumab treated PBMC co-culture experiments, NKEV addition favorably shifted the organoid infiltrating immune population to significantly fewer CD4+ T cells and more CD56+ NK cells. Finally, we used the multi-omic characterization of NKEV molecular cargo to identify RNA transcripts and proteins associated with cytotoxic and immune recruiting functions. Conclusions This work demonstrated that NKEVs can be successfully harvested from patient derived, expanded NK cells, and highlights their heterogeneous cargo, and anti-tumor properties in combination with standard-of-care therapies.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T play essential roles in antitumor immune responses. However, immunotherapy has limited clinical efficacy in many solid tumors. Here, we performed an epigenetic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in CD8+ T cells directly under cancer immunotherapy setting and found that Prdm12 is a transcriptional repressor implicated in nociceptive neuron development but uncharacterized within immunological contexts. Prdm12 deletion markedly enhanced in vivo tumor clearance of mouse CD8+ T cells and promoted activation, effector differentiation marker expression, and cytokine secretion in both murine and human CD8+ T cells in vitro. Mechanistically, Prdm12 deficiency augmented effector transcriptional programs while inhibiting exhaustion of CGRP-RAMP1 neuroimmune axis facilitation. Additionally, Prdm12 ablation remodeled the chromatin accessibility landscape, with H3K9me3 deposition at loci regulating T cell differentiation (Trib1 and Sgk1) and exhaustion (Rgs1 and Nr4a2). These results together reveal a negative regulatory mechanism for CD8+ T cells and advance our understanding of cancer immunotherapy by linking neurobiological signaling to immune regulation.">

In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan in mice induces peripheral trained immunity by reprogramming AMs in the lungs, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (lipopolysaccharide) or viral (polyI:C) challenges via a neutrophil/IFN-γ-dependent manner. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.">

Using multidimensional spectral flow cytometry and serology, we characterized in-depth immune responses in 50 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated lymphoma patients across12 lymphoma subtypes, treated with anti-CD20 antibody (aCD20) ± chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. Compared to healthy control, aCD20±CT-treated patients exhibited distinct immune alterations, including elevated late-stage effector memory (EM3) CD4+, and terminally differentiated (EMRA) CD8+ T cells, reduced circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, and increased dysfunctional DN3 B cells. While B cell depletion was expected with aCD20 therapy, our data reveals broader immune dysregulation beyond B cell loss. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, aCD20±CT treated patients showed impaired vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses. In contrast, CT-only Hodgkin lymphoma patients maintained antibody responses comparable to healthy controls. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in aCD20±CT treated patients displayed fewer regulatory T cells, increased Th1 population, and more EMRA CD8+ T cells, suggesting a compensatory T-cell mediated immunity. Antibody response correlated positively with naïve T cell frequencies and transitional, classical memory, and DN2 B cell subsets. These findings inform the tailored development of vaccine strategies for immunocompromised patients to enhance protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral pathogens.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are traditionally recognized for their pro-inflammatory roles. However, accumulating evidence has begun to highlight the plasticity of transcriptional states of neutrophils during pathological insults. Whether such unconventional neutrophils may share commonality across diverse disease conditions is incompletely understood. Here, we systematically profile over 500,000 neutrophils in key immune compartments and disease-inflicted tissues of the mouse models of metabolic disorder, autoimmunity, tissue damage, peripheral cancers, and intracranial gliomas. Of importance, we observe two distinct neutrophil clusters with unique immune features. The first cluster, characterized by Cd274, Vegfa, and antigen presentation, is highly enriched within the diseased tissues. In contrast, the second cluster with elevated Cd244 and type 2 immune response but reduced maturation markers primarily emerges in the peripheral blood and spleens of specific disease scenarios. These results have elucidated the common signatures of neutrophils in response to various pathological conditions, providing a valuable reference for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.">

We profiled circulating immune cells from healthy older adults (median age: 73) who were CMV(+) or CMV(-) using single-cell RNA-sequencing and validated key findings by flow cytometry. CMV(+) individuals exhibited significant expansion of adaptive immune cells: CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ TEMRA T, GZMK+ CD8⁺ T, γδ T, and atypical B cells. Among innate immune cells, monocytes and dendritic cells remained largely unchanged while KLRC2+ (adaptive) NK cells increased and CD56dim NK cells decreased. To facilitate CMV assessment in datasets with unknown CM serostatus, we developed CMVerify, a machine learning classifier that accurately predicts CMV serostatus from single-cell data across platforms and age groups (97% accuracy). These findings reveal extensive CMV-associated immune remodeling in older adults and underscore the importance of incorporating CMV status in studies of immune aging.">

        <tr id="Multiple mechanisms of immunity must be coordinated to defend against a comprehensive range of pathogens; however, the mechanisms by which broad-spectrum antipathogens act remain largely elusive. Here, we employed systems biology approaches to understand the organization of human immune cells at the single-cell level, as well as their reorganization in response to K21, a silane derivative effective against viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. K21 induced pro-inflammatory pathways in M1 and M2c macrophages without altering cytokine secretion, decreased a specific subtype of M1 macrophages and CXCL4-induced M2-like macrophages, and improved mitochondrial health by enhancing mitochondrial recycling via mitophagy. Similar treatment of the in vivo model organism C. elegans induced mitophagy and extended lifespan, suggesting evolutionary conservation of mechanism. Our work demonstrates that a drug that remodels mitochondria and metabolism can shape the immune cell repertoire, which could aid the development of more effective antimicrobials and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are central orchestrators of antitumor immunity, bridging innate sensing with adaptive T‐cell responses. This review dissects the developmental pathways and functional specializations of diverse DC subsets—including cDC1, cDC2, pDCs, DC3s, tDCs, moDCs, and emerging RORγt+ antigen‐presenting cells (APCs)—and explores how the tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamically reprograms these cells. Immunosuppressive cytokines, metabolic stress, hypoxia, and altered lipid metabolism can induce tolerogenic phenotypes such as mregDCs and ISG+ DCs, dampening antigen presentation and T‐cell activation. We detail how specific DC subsets interact with the TME—either reinforcing immune evasion or promoting antitumor immunity—depending on their transcriptional states and spatial organization. Emphasis is placed on recent findings from spatial transcriptomics and single‐cell studies that reveal key DC–T cell niches critical for immune control. Furthermore, we evaluate current and emerging therapeutic strategies that aim to restore DC functionality or exploit their antigen‐presenting capabilities, including mRNA vaccines, receptor‐targeted delivery, CD40 agonists, and in situ cellular reprogramming. By integrating mechanistic insights with clinical advances, this review underscores the potential of context‐aware, subset‐specific DC interventions to overcome immune suppression and enhance cancer immunotherapy. Impact statement By dissecting the complexity and plasticity of dendritic cell subsets in cancer, our work offers novel insights into their reprogramming by the tumor microenvironment and therapeutic exploitation, paving the way for next‐generation, context‐aware immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play dual roles in cancer, either promoting or suppressing tumor progression, complicating therapeutic approaches. TAMs include recruited macrophages (recMacs), derived from circulating monocytes, and tissue-resident interstitial macrophages (IMs). We recently identified a heterogeneous population of chemokine-expressing IMs, including subsets that support tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation during lung inflammation. Here, we show that IMs can be either pro- or anti-tumorigenic, depending on the subset. Using Pf4 Cx3cr1 mice to deplete CD206hi IMs expressing Cxcl13, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10, we demonstrate their essential role in TLS formation, lymphocyte recruitment, and tumor suppression in melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma. In contrast, Ccl2-expressing IMs promote tumor growth by recruiting pro-tumorigenic recMacs. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the distinct localization and chemokine profiles of these subsets. Finally, CCR5 blockade with the FDA-approved inhibitor Maraviroc during neoantigen vaccination improved tumor control by preventing the migration of immunosuppressive, antigen-presenting recMacs (moDCs). These findings support the development of macrophage-targeted therapies by identifying pro-tumorigenic subsets and recMac trafficking as actionable targets, while preserving macrophage populations that sustain anti-tumor immunity.">

We analyzed RNA sequencing data from 55 glioma patients, estimating immune infiltration with CIBERSORTx and immune cell states via Ecotyper. IDH-wildtype gliomas showed significantly higher immune cell infiltration (p = 0.002), notably of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages, and a greater proportion of exhausted T cells compared to IDH-mutant gliomas. Clustering based on immune profiles revealed two groups. Cluster A, enriched for IDH-wildtype cases, exhibited heightened immune infiltration but also marked immunosuppression. Cluster B, which included both IDH-wildtype and mutant cases, showed lower levels of immune infiltration. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) cultured from IDH-wildtype tumors demonstrated limited expansion following anti-PD-1, a CSF1R inhibitor, or a STAT3 inhibitor treatment, without clear cluster-specific differences. Tumor-reactive TILs were mainly observed in cluster A. These findings highlight that IDH-wildtype gliomas have an immunosuppressive and heterogeneous microenvironment, potentially limiting responses to single-agent immunotherapies. A personalized, multi-targeted approach addressing multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms may be essential to improve immunotherapy outcomes in this aggressive glioma subgroup.">

 Lung cancer remains a significant public health burden. One of the most personalized treatments uses a patient’s own tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and TIL activity is also essential for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) effectiveness. Responses to immunotherapies vary due to immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and limited antigen presentation. In this study, we computationally examine cell-cell signaling and transcriptional activity using single-cell RNA sequencing of lung cancer treated by inhibiting methyltransferase EZH2. We show that EZH2 inhibition shifts the TME to immunogenic signaling patterns conducive to increased T cell response, including antigen presentation and homing. T cells also showed more stem-like phenotypes. Transcriptional activity was quieter with EZH2 inhibition but revealed better interferon response, altered myeloid and B cell differentiation, and apoptotic markers. Importantly, inferred EZH2 activity showed it could perform non-methyltransferase duties vital for T cell differentiation. These results indicate that EZH2 inhibition could improve immunotherapies for lung cancer patients.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a major public health burden responsible for over a million deaths each year. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms that balance protective immunity and immunopathology is essential for developing more effective therapeutics. This review focuses on the dynamic interplay between CD4+ T cells and B cells in the lung, with an emphasis on their interactions in tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). TLS are immune cell aggregates that arise in inflamed, nonlymphoid tissues, range from loosely to highly organized clusters, and serve as localized hubs for immune cell interaction, activation, and diversification. Drawing on insights from other disease contexts, including infections, cancer, and chronic inflammatory conditions, we examine the molecular signals and cellular interactions involved in TLS formation, maintenance, and function during Mtb infection. Additionally, we explore the anatomical and functional integration of TLS with the lymphatic and vascular systems, and how this spatial organization may influence bacterial persistence and dissemination. Clarifying the functional role of TLS in TB—whether they support protective immunity, contribute to lung pathology, or both—could inform novel approaches to modulate local immune responses and improve TB disease outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most prevalent cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) of cervical cancer (CC). Although TAMs frequently exhibit an immunosuppressive phenotype, their plasticity enables them as an intriguing reprogrammable target for immunotherapy of CC. Methods Consensus clustering was employed to delineate immune infiltration patterns in a cohort of 119 patients with CC. Single-cell RNA sequencing, complemented by flow cytometry analysis, was used to characterize hexokinase 3 (HK3)-expressing cell populations. In vivo tumor models were established to assess the functional impact of HK3-expressing cells on the TME, with interventions including Hk3 knockout and CD8+ T-cell depletion. A comprehensive approach involving bulk RNA sequencing, immunoprecipitation assays, confocal microscopy imaging, and in vitro co-culture systems was implemented to elucidate the mechanisms underlying HK3 inhibition-mediated enhancement of antitumor immunity. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of HK3 inhibition, both as a monotherapy and in combination with immunotherapeutic strategies, was systematically evaluated in preclinical tumor models. Results We elucidated a cross-regulation between TAMs and CD8+ T cells, with HK3 serving as a central regulatory node. Upon HK3 expression was upregulated by CD8+ T cells through the IFN-γ-STAT1 signaling axis, TAMs exhibited impaired cross-presentation capacity, which in turn attenuated CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, HK3 physically interacted with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), promoting nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and resulting in excessive lysosomal activation and antigen degradation. Moreover, targeting HK3 in combination with immune checkpoint blockade yielded a synergistic effect in enhancing antitumor immunity. Conclusions Targeting HK3 in TAMs represents a promising therapeutic strategy capable of enhancing antitumor immunity and synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade by restoring efficient antigen cross-presentation.">

We identified four macrophage subtypes, including one highly susceptible to infection and another with antiviral properties that is rapidly destroyed. The viral E165R gene was essential for ASFV replication while disrupting host defense signals. By tracking cellular changes, we revealed how macrophages drive ASFV progression.

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a debilitating neglected tropical disease characterized by lesions that can range from self-healing to permanent disfigurations. A predominant Th1 response, which stimulates IFN-γ production, is crucial for parasite control during self-healing CL. While IFN-γ primarily activates macrophages to produce nitric oxide via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) leading to parasite control, IFN-γ also activates other downstream pathways involved in cell autonomous immunity. One such pathway is the activation of guanylate binding proteins (GBPs), a class of interferon inducible GTPases. However, the role of GBPs during CL has been minimally explored. Utilizing RNA-Seq we found that Leishmania major infection leads to the upregulation of several GBPs in C57Bl/6 mice. In vitro studies using GBPChr3 knockout (KO), and C57Bl/6 control mice reveal that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from KO mice exhibit higher parasite burdens following IFN-γ treatment, independent of GBP localization to the parasite. Single-cell RNA-Seq identifies macrophages as the primary expressers of GBPs during L. major infection in vivo. In vivo, GBPChr3 KO mice display increased disease severity and parasite load. GBPChr3 KO macrophages and monocytes show elevated ARG-1 and reduced iNOS expression, indicating a shift toward a parasite-permissive environment that supports parasite growth. These findings highlight a critical role for GBPs in immune-mediated control of CL.">

        <tr id="While lymphoid progenitors have demonstrated unexpected plasticity in vivo, their differentiation into myeloid cells under in vitro conditions has been largely dismissed as an artifact or biologically irrelevant. Consequently, the functional properties of these cells remain poorly characterized. In this study, we show that cultured common lymphoid progenitors (cCLPs) differentiate into CD11b⁺CD115⁺ monocytic cells (cCLP-Ms) via IL-6-C/EBPβ signaling. Molecular and phenotypic analyses revealed that cCLP-Ms acquire essential features of myeloid cells, including innate immune sensor expression and phagocytic capacity, while retaining unique characteristics distinct from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), such as reduced MHC class II expression and TNF-α production. Functionally, cCLP-Ms exhibit immunoregulatory properties, effectively suppressing IgE-mediated cutaneous allergic inflammation upon adoptive transfer. These findings highlight the plasticity of lymphoid progenitors and establish a robust platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying myeloid differentiation. This system deepens our understanding of hematopoietic cell lineage flexibility and offers a foundation for exploring therapeutic applications in immune regulation and inflammation.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neonates have increased vulnerability to life-threatening infections due to the distinct immune landscape. Interleukin (IL)-27 is a key component of this immune profile that we have previously shown to be elevated in both newborn humans and mice. IL-27 continues to increase in the serum and tissues consistent with poor outcomes during gram-negative neonatal bacterial sepsis. Presently, we dissected the IL-27 producer profile at a single-cell level using IL-27p28eGFP reporter mice in our previously established model of neonatal sepsis with luciferase-expressing K1-encapsulated Escherichia coli. Whole animal imaging regionally highlighted the spleen, liver, and lungs as key infection sites by bacterial luminescence. Flow cytometry showed that IL-27 producers increased significantly in the liver with infection and were predominantly F4/80+ and CD11b+ with subpopulations that emerged expressing additional markers. This information paired with single-cell RNA sequencing further identified the most robust populations as monocytes, monocyte-derived cells, and Kupffer cells followed by smaller populations of dendritic cells and neutrophils. The transcriptome demonstrated a diverse range of functionality amongst populations that included differential expression of genes implicated in bactericidal, metabolic, and inflammatory changes. Collectively, the transcriptome of IL-27 producers from the livers of infected animals suggests an uncoordinated mix of inflammatory and suppressive activity that may contribute to immune dysregulation characteristic of sepsis. Together, this work provides previously undescribed insight into the details of IL-27 producers during early-life infection. This further provides essential information needed to support IL-27 as a therapeutic target for neonatal bacterial sepsis.">

        <tr id="Cancer therapies that induce immunogenic cell death such as necroptosis can arm the immune system to clear residual tumor cells. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) signaling can trigger necroptosis, orchestrating immune responses to solid tumors. Whether RIPK3 activity can be exploited for controlling B cell malignancies remains unclear. Here, we establish a strategy to manipulate RIPK3 activity in malignant B cells and promote immune-mediated tumor control. By controlling and visualizing RIPK3 signaling using intravital imaging, we established that RIPK3 activation promoted apoptosis and rapid macrophage engulfment but failed to induce necroptosis due to limited MLKL expression in B-lineage cells. RIPK3-induced cell death could be diverted toward necroptosis with type I IFN and caspase inhibition. Exploiting these findings, we showed that a combination therapy activating RIPK3 with SMAC mimetics while suppressing caspase activity and providing type I IFN resulted in immune-mediated control of B cell tumors. Hence, reprogramming RIPK3 activity represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity to target B cell malignancies.">

        <tr id="Polytrauma with significant bone and volumetric muscle loss presents substantial clinical challenges. Although immune responses significantly influence fracture healing post-polytrauma, the cellular and molecular underpinnings of polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation require further investigation. While previous studies examined either injury site tissue or systemic tissue (peripheral blood), our study uniquely investigated both systemic and local immune cells at the same time to better understand polytrauma-induced immune dysregulation and associated impaired bone healing. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in a rat polytrauma model, we analyzed blood, bone marrow, and the local defect soft tissue to identify potential cellular and molecular targets involved in immune dysregulation. We identified a trauma-associated immunosuppressive myeloid (TIM) cell population that drives systemic immune dysregulation, immunosuppression, and potentially impaired bone healing. We found CD1d as a global marker for TIM cells in polytrauma. In the local defect tissue, we observed Spp1+ monocytes/macrophages mediating inflammatory, fibrotic, and impaired adaptive immune responses. Finally, our findings highlighted increased signaling via Anxa1-Fpr2 and Spp1-Cd44 axes. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of immune dysregulation-mediated nonunion following traumatic injury and provides biomarkers that could function as treatment targets.">

        <tr id="Introduction Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is an effective treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, yet the mechanisms underlying immune reset and sustained remission remain incompletely understood. This study provides a longitudinal immune profiling of patients undergoing AHSCT, with a specific focus on immune reconstitution at two years post-AHSCT. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 22 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients at baseline and multiple time points post-AHSCT. Immune reconstitution was characterized using high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry to assess phenotypic changes in B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells. Results AHSCT led to profound alterations in immune cell populations. B-cell recovery was marked by a rapid expansion of naïve B cells, while memory B cells and plasmablasts remained depleted. Notably, patients with evidence of inflammatory disease activity (EIDA) post-AHSCT exhibited higher pre-transplant frequencies of non-switched IgD+IgM+ memory B cells, raising the possibility of a potential biomarker for treatment response. Myeloid-cell reconstitution showed a decline in classical monocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, potentially shifting the immune balance toward a more tolerogenic state. CD4 T-cell reconstitution demonstrated a shift from central memory (Tcm) to effector memory (Tem) phenotypes, with a selective depletion of polyfunctional Th1/Th17cells lacking PD-1 expression. Clusters enriched for PD-1+ Tem CD4 T cells appeared to differ between patients with and without EIDA. Furthermore, an increase in atypical naïve CCR7⁻CD62L⁻ CD4 T cells was observed in EIDA patients, raising questions about their role in the pathophysiology of MS. CD8 T-cell reconstitution followed a similar pattern, with a shift from a naïve/Tcm-dominant to a Tem-skewed population, albeit with substantial interpatient variability. Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells showed a sustained decrease, possibly reflecting microbiota alterations post-transplant. Conclusions Taken together, these findings provide an exploratory characterization of immune reconstitution following AHSCT, highlighting candidate biomarkers and mechanisms that warrant validation in larger cohorts to guide patient stratification and monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.">

        <tr id="Tumor immunosuppression remains a major barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy and is often driven by the immunoregulatory activities of innate immune cells, such as myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Myeloid populations—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—play pivotal roles in dampening anti-tumor immune responses and promoting tumor progression. Recent advances in our understanding of myeloid cell biology have unveiled new therapeutic opportunities to disrupt these immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with tumor inflammation. This review highlights key signaling pathways and surface molecules involved in myeloid-mediated immune suppression, including CSF1R, PI3Kγ, mTOR, Syk, MerTK/Axl, and immune checkpoints such as Trem2, LILRBs, VISTA, and CD40. We examine preclinical and clinical findings that support targeting these pathways to reprogram the TME and enhance anti-tumor immunity. By integrating insights from mechanistic studies and therapeutic development, this review underscores the potential of myeloid cell-targeting strategies as promising adjuncts to current cancer immunotherapies. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges in translating these approaches into durable clinical benefit.">

        <tr id="Background CD24 plays a crucial role not only in promoting tumor progression and metastasis but also in modulating macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity. However, its impact on the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unexplored. Here, we investigated the role of CD24a, the murine CD24 gene, in tumor progression and TME immune dynamics in a murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model. Methods Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 knockout technology was employed to generate CD24a knockout in the murine TNBC cell line 4T1. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the immune cell populations, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer cells, T cells, and macrophages, within tumors, spleens, and bone marrow in the orthotopic mouse 4T1 breast cancer model. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to detect the immune cells in tumor sections. High-speed confocal was used to perform three-dimensional (3D) mapping of immune cells in the 4T1 orthotopic tumors. Results Knocking out CD24a significantly reduced tumor growth kinetics and prolonged mouse survival in vivo. Flow cytometry and IF analysis of tumor samples revealed that CD24a loss significantly promoted the infiltration of M1 macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells into the TME while reducing the recruitment and expansion of granulocytic MDSCs (gMDSCs). In vitro coculture experiments showed that CD24a deficiency significantly enhanced macrophage‐mediated phagocytosis and CD8⁺ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, effects that were partially reversed by re‐expression of CD24a. Moreover, in vivo depletion of macrophages and CD8+ T cells reverted the delayed tumor growth caused by CD24a knockout, underscoring their critical role in tumor growth suppression associated with CD24a knockout. 3D mapping of immune cells in the TME confirmed the anti-tumor immune landscape in the CD24a knockout 4T1 tumors. Furthermore, in vitro analysis showed that CD24a loss upregulated macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression while suppressed levels of CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL10, chemokines known to recruit gMDSCs, further providing a molecular basis for enhanced macrophage recruitment and diminished gMDSC accumulation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that CD24a may regulate immune suppression within the TNBC TME. Targeting CD24a enhances macrophage- and CD8⁺ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and is associated with a shift in the TME toward a more immunogenic state, thereby suppressing tumor growth. These results may support CD24 as a promising immunotherapeutic target for TNBC.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT NK cells are critical for immunosurveillance, yet become dysfunctional when chronically stimulated by virally infected or cancerous cells. This phenomenon is similar to T cell exhaustion but less characterized, limiting therapeutic interventions. As shown for T cells, NK cells often display an increased expression of immune checkpoint proteins (ICP) following chronic stimulation, and ICP blockade therapies are currently being explored for several cancer types, with remarkable patient benefits. Nevertheless, the nature of ICP expression in NK cells is still poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that lead to and the phenotype of immune checkpoint LAG3‐expressing NK cells. Using various experimental models, we found that LAG3 is expressed by murine NK cells upon activation in different contexts, including in response to cancer and acute viral infections. LAG3 marks a subset of immature, proliferating, and activated cells, which, despite activation, have a reduced capacity to respond to a broad range of stimuli. Further characterization also revealed that LAG3+ NK cells exhibit a transcriptional signature similar to that of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our results support the use of LAG3 as a marker of dysfunctional NK cells across diverse chronic and acute inflammatory conditions.">

To investigate the cellular tropism and infection dynamics of EV-D68, we profiled naive and EV-D68-infected human spinal cord organoids (hSCOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Examining the cellular composition of healthy hSCOs, we found that hSCOs comprise diverse cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and multipotent glial progenitor cells (mGPCs). Upon infection with two EV-D68 strains, US/IL/14-18952 (a B2 strain) and US/MA/18-23089 (a B3 strain), we observed distinct viral tropism and host transcriptional responses. Notably, US/IL/14-18952 showed a significant preference for neurons, while US/MA/18-23089 exhibited higher rates of infection in cycling astrocytes and OPCs. These findings provide novel insights into the host cell tropism of EV-D68 in the spinal cord, offering insight into the potential mechanisms underlying AFM pathogenesis.

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) significantly contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and targeted inhibition of MDSCs is a potential therapeutic strategy against cancer. Here, we identify macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) as a critical regulator of MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression in breast cancer. The present study demonstrates that MARCO is expressed on MDSCs, and breast tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) enriched with macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) promote MDSC differentiation and amplify immunosuppressive activity by up-regulating MARCO. Genetic ablation of MARCO in a murine breast cancer model attenuated tumor growth, accompanied by reduced monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) and total tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), along with enhanced infiltration of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Furthermore, we developed a specific MARCO down-regulation-promoting monoclonal antibody that impeded TDE-induced MDSC differentiation and immunosuppression. In vivo, MARCO down-regulating antibody suppressed tumor growth and reprogrammed the TME by diminishing immunosuppressive MDSCs and TAMs and revitalizing CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Strikingly, combining the MARCO down-regulating antibody with PD-1 blockade synergistically enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. This work establishes MARCO as a key regulator of MDSC-mediated immunosuppression and presents a compelling case for the inclusion of MARCO as a therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Both intrinsic and microenvironmental factors contribute to the genesis and progression of leukemia. Dendritic cells (DCs) are important members of the immunomicroenvironment. The immature DCs (imDCs) and regulatory DCs (DCregs) participate in the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that play adverse role in tumor progression. However, the characteristics of DCs in leukemia microenvironment have not been well established. Here, we identified a novel CD11c+MHCIIlo DC population (T-DC) accumulated in the mouse splenic T-ALL microenvironment. T-DCs exhibited an immature phenotype as they were characterized by low expression of MHCII molecules and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD86, CD83 and CD40. Database analysis revealed that low level expression of DC maturation-associated genes correlated with poor prognosis in leukemia patients. Furthermore, T-DCs promoted T-ALL progression contributed by their attenuated phagocytosis and CD4+ T cell activation potential. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that T-DCs expressed low level of genes related to maturation and antigen processing. T-DCs showed similar expression pattern with DCregs and expressed high levels of immunosuppressive genes. In addition, single cell RNA sequencing demonstrated the heterogeneity of T-DCs, showing that they are mainly compose of cDC1s, cDC2s and macrophage-like DCs. Therefore, our findings uncover the critical role of a novel imDC subset in promoting leukemia progression through the suppression of T-cell immunity. These results may have significant implications for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies aiming at reversing immune evasion in leukemia and improving patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="B cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). As a receptor of prostaglandin D2, chemoattractant receptor homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells (CRTH2) is known to be involved in Th2 cell activation, but its function in B lymphocytes is unclear. Here, we show that CRTH2 is critical for an IL-1β-producing B cell subset. Mice with B-cell-specific deletion of Crth2 exhibit reduced numbers of IL-1β-producing B cells, resulting in amelioration of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the principal animal model of MS. Compared to wild-type B cells, adoptive transfer of Crth2-deficient B cells attenuates EAE disease severity in B-cell-deficient recipient mice. The IL-1β-producing B cell subpopulation was mainly transitional type 2 B cells identified by flow cytometry and single cell sequencing. Mechanically, CRTH2 promotes IL-1β production in B cells through p38 signaling, and pharmacological inhibition of p38 attenuates EAE disease severity in DK-PGD2-treated mice. Taken together, our results reveal a key function of CRTH2 in driving IL-1β expression in B cells and in controlling their pathogenic activity in autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Objective Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome triggered by infection, characterized by high clinical heterogeneity and complex immunopathological mechanisms. Immune dysregulation plays a central role in its progression. This study aims to investigate the compositional changes of immune cells, characteristics of intercellular communication, and potential regulatory mechanisms of N⁶-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in sepsis, with a particular focus on the functional remodeling of platelets. Methods This study integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE167363 dataset) from sepsis patients with m6A methylation sequencing data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Through systematic analysis, we compared the differences in immune cell composition, developmental trajectories, intercellular communication, and m6A modifications among healthy controls, survivors, and non-survivors, and further screened for key m6A-regulated target genes. Results The analysis revealed that platelets gradually accumulated during the progression of sepsis, while B cells, T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) exhibited a trend toward platelet-like phenotypic remodeling. Cell–cell communication analysis showed a marked decline in communication strength among immune cells as the disease worsened, particularly a significant weakening of the APP–CD74 signaling pathway between platelets and B cells, indicating impaired immune network synergy. m⁶A methylation sequencing revealed distinct remodeling of m⁶A peaks and dysregulation of related regulatory factors in non-survivors. Further integrative analysis identified RPA1 as a key m⁶A-regulated target gene, whose expression was closely associated with APP and co-regulated by multiple m6A-modifying factors. Conclusion This study reveals disruptions in immune cell interactions and an m6A-dependent mechanism of platelet functional remodeling during sepsis progression. The identification of the key target gene RPA1 offers new insights into the immunopathological mechanisms of sepsis and lays a theoretical foundation for future precision interventions and therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Gasdermin D (GSDMD), an effector molecule of cell pyroptosis, is known to be activated in various cells during inflammation. However, the patterns of GSDMD activation in immune regulatory cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) remain unclear. In this study, we found that neutrophils in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues exhibited reduced GSDMD transcription, as evidenced by a single-cell RNA sequencing result. Consistent with this, cleaved GSDMD expression is negatively correlated with S100A8 in CRC tissues. Additionally, CD15+CD14−LOX1+ cells (G-MDSCs) from the peripheral blood of CRC patients exhibited a significant reduction in GSDMD activation. Mice with ubiquitous GSDMD deficiency bred in a clean environment exhibited a notable increase in G-MDSCs. These GSDMD−/− MDSCs enhanced immunosuppressive activity by both inhibiting effector T-cell activity and promoting regulatory T-cell induction. This enhancement was also observed in GSDMDflox/flox-S100A8Cre mice, in which GSDMD was specifically deleted in MDSCs. The tumor-promoting effects in the GSDMD−/− and GSDMDflox/flox-S100A8Cre mice were abrogated following MDSC depletion, as shown by the use of an anti-DR5 antibody. In the absence of GSDMD, G-MDSCs showed reduced inflammasome activation and decreased production of IL-1β and IL-18. Furthermore, a significant reduction in interferon-related factor 8/7 (IRF8/7) was observed in GSDMD−/− G-MDSCs via bulk RNA sequencing analysis. After treatment with LPS/nigericin, these cells maintained mitochondrial integrity, thus impairing the mtDNA release and the downstream cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF8/7 signaling axis activation. Reduced IRF8/7 levels were responsible for increased differentiation of GSDMD−/− G-MDSCs. Finally, treatment with a GSDMD recombinant lentivirus injected into in situ tumors significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced G-MDSC levels, suggesting that a GSDMD-based vaccine could simultaneously exert anti-carcinoma and anti-MDSC effects.

        <tr id="Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic to Latin America and is characterized by chronic inflammation of cardiac tissues due to parasite persistence. Hypoxia within infected tissues may trigger the stabilization of HIF-1 and be linked to ATP release. Extracellular ATP exhibits microbicidal effects but is scavenged by CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, which ultimately generate adenosine (ADO), a potent immunosuppressor. Here, we comprehensively study the importance of HIF-1 stabilization and the CD39/CD73/ADO axis, on CD4+ T cells with the cytotoxic phenotype, in facilitating the persistence of T. cruzi. Myocardial infection induces prominent areas of hypoxia, which is concomitant with HIF-1α stabilization in T cells and linked to early expansion of CD39+CD73+CD4+ T cell infiltrating population. Functional assays further demonstrate that HIF-1 stabilization and CD73 activity are associated with impaired CD4+ T cell cytotoxic potential. RNA-Seq analysis reveals that HIF-1 and purinergic signaling pathways are overrepresented in cardiac tissues of patients with end-stage Chagas disease. The findings highlight a major effect of purinergic signaling on CD4+ T cells with potential cytotoxic capacity in the setting of T. cruzi infection and have translational implications for therapy.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment that importantly contributes to treatment resistance. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), which comprise approximately 50% of the cellular population within the GBM microenvironment, represent a major subset of tumor-associated macrophages. These cells drive tumor progression by promoting angiogenesis, immune evasion, and the phenotypic transformation of tumor cells. MDM infiltration is mediated by specific signaling pathways and regulated by the disruption of the blood–brain barrier and tumor-associated hypoxia. Recent technological advances have uncovered substantial heterogeneity among macrophages, including hypoxia-induced, lipid-metabolizing, phagocytic, and interferon-activated subtypes. This functional diversity is shaped by tumor-specific genetic alterations and metabolic reprogramming. Therapeutic approaches focusing on MDMs include inhibiting their recruitment, enhancing phagocytic activity, employing genetically engineered macrophage, and modulating metabolic pathways. While preclinical studies suggest that these approaches may improve efficacy when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, the dynamic spatiotemporal heterogeneity and adaptability of macrophages within the tumor microenvironment remain substantial therapeutic challenges. Future development in combination therapies, integrating single-cell multi-omics, spatial metabolic profiling, and targeted interventions, will be critical to precisely modulate MDMs, overcome immune tolerance, and improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Neutrophils, traditionally viewed as first-line defenders in innate immunity, are increasingly recognized for their dualistic roles in cancer. In breast cancer, a distinct subset known as N2 neutrophils exhibits pro-tumorigenic activity, facilitating angiogenesis, immune suppression, and metastasis. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the molecular mechanisms underlying N2 polarization—focusing on key pathways such as TGF-β, STAT3/6, and hypoxia-mediated signaling—and their implications in breast cancer progression. We further explore how N2 neutrophils interact with other immune cells within the tumor microenvironment to promote an immunosuppressive milieu. A unique contribution of this review lies in its integration of emerging single-cell and flow cytometry data to underscore neutrophil plasticity and subtype-specific differences in neutrophil activity across breast cancer variants. Therapeutic strategies targeting N2 neutrophils are critically examined, including small-molecule inhibitors, cytokine blockade, and neutrophil-targeted nanomedicine. However, major challenges persist—most notably the difficulty in selectively depleting or reprogramming N2 neutrophils without compromising essential antimicrobial functions. Additionally, the lack of validated N2-specific markers in clinical samples limits translational progress. Addressing these gaps is crucial for the development of safe, effective immunomodulatory therapies in breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Chemotherapy is an integral part of the clinical management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), however, development of chemoresistance occurs frequently. Tumor sensitivity to treatment is known to be strongly influenced by the immune microenvironment, signifying the predictive potential of immune alterations. How tumor cells that acquire resistance may subsequently modulate the immune microenvironment it is still not well described. Here, we investigated immunomodulation in the context of acquired chemoresistance in TNBC, focusing on the role of the secretome. Methods Bulk RNA sequencing and multiplex cytokine profiling were performed on paclitaxel-resistant and -sensitive isogenic variants of TNBC cells to reveal resistance-associated secretome alterations. The immunomodulatory influence of the tumor cell secretome was investigated by exploring its effect on monocytes, macrophages (MΦs) and T cells derived from healthy blood donors. The influence on the immune cell phenotype and activity was evaluated by measuring molecular markers and performing functional assays. To validate the clinical relevance, we utilized longitudinal -omics data from breast cancer patients refractory to standard chemotherapy in the NeoAva clinical trial. CIBERSORT was applied to transcriptomics data to infer MΦ and T cell abundance in individual tumors upon treatment. To evaluate their association with the secretome profiles, patient-matched serum cytokine data were used. Results The acquisition of chemoresistance was accompanied by enhanced secretion of cytokines. Subsequently, the resistant cell secretome affected the abundance, phenotype and activity of immune cells. Specifically, it potentiated the recruitment of monocytes, facilitated the polarization of MΦs towards the immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype, and attenuated the activation of CD8+ T cells. Data from the NeoAva clinical cohort validated the enrichment of M2 MΦs and/or the depletion of M1 MΦs after treatment in the majority of residual tumors. The MΦ-associated changes counteracted CD8+ T cell abundance and were partially associated with the cytokine-enriched secretome. Conclusion Development of chemoresistance in BC is associated with alterations in the tumor secretome, which impairs immune activation and facilitates immunosuppression. Knowledge on the immune microenvironment in residual tumors after standard chemotherapy could aid in selecting rational treatment options for this group of patients.

        <tr id="Imbalances in the gut microbiome have been linked to increased intestinal permeability and disease flares in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our study revealed that patients with flares of lupus nephritis (LN) and intestinal expansions of the anaerobic commensal, Ruminococcus gnavus (RG), displayed whole blood transcriptome profiles indicative of platelet, neutrophil, and myeloid cell activation, a profile reminiscent of sepsis. Serum analysis confirmed elevated serum levels of Platelet Factor 4 and neutrophil extracellular traps, which significantly correlated with levels of IgG-antibody to a novel lipoglycan (LG) produced by pathogenic RG strains, which was also documented in an independent LN cohort. To test for causality, in vivo mouse models further demonstrated that gut colonization with LG-producing RG strains, as well as a single intraperitoneal challenge with an LG preparation, caused platelet activation and megakaryocytosis in bone marrow and spleen. Mice colonized with RG strains that produce LG developed cellular infiltration of the kidneys by neutrophils and monocytes. Hence, RG expansions during renal flares may identify a specific LN flare endotype driven by thromboinflammatory mechanisms. Antibodies that arise from immune exposure to the RG lipoglycan may serve as a surrogate biomarker, helping to elucidate the impact of the relationship between gut microbiota communities and clinical outcomes in patients afflicted by LN.

        <tr id="Trained immunity represents a recent concept that elucidates the long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells, enabling them to adapt and respond more effectively to subsequent encounters with diverse pathogens. Initially recognized through the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine, Candida albicans infection, and β-glucan administration, this phenomenon challenges the traditional view that immune memory is exclusive to the adaptive immune system. Trained immunity is characterized by epigenetic and metabolic modifications in innate immune cells that facilitate enhanced responses to infections through mechanisms like chromatin remodeling and altered gene expression. This review focuses on the implications of trained immunity within the lung environment, which is constantly exposed to a plethora of pathogens and environmental irritants. We discuss the roles of various immune cell types, including alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, in mediating trained immunity and how these adaptations may influence pulmonary insults and disease. Furthermore, we highlight the potential for leveraging trained immunity to enhance vaccine efficacy and develop novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related lung conditions.

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) tumors present a major clinical challenge due to complex immune evasion mechanisms and generally poor responses to immunotherapy. Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a critical determinant of immunotherapy resistance. Immunosuppressive cell populations such as regulatory T cells, M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts, together with aberrant cytokine networks and mechanical stress in the tumor stroma, cooperate to exclude T-cell infiltration and induce T-cell exhaustion, thereby undermining the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, TIME-driven signaling pathway activation and epigenetic reprogramming further reinforce immune escape and therapeutic failure. Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies have greatly improved our understanding of these processes. Meanwhile, strategies including multi-target combination immunotherapies, epigenetic modulators, mRNA vaccines, and gut microbiota interventions are under active investigation to reverse resistance and remodel the TIME. This mini review summarizes the multifaceted mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in GI tumors and discusses the potential of emerging therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer, predominantly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains a principal driver of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite advancements in surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted treatments, outcomes remain poor in advanced NSCLC. The tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts a critical influence on therapy responses. Within the TME, immune cells such as T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells can drive both pro- and anti-tumor processes. This review integrates their classification, phenotypic plasticity, and roles in NSCLC, highlighting key preclinical and clinical evidence while discussing pathogenesis, prognostic significance, and therapeutic potential. We also summarize the current immunotherapeutic strategies for advanced NSCLC, including first- or second-line regimens with immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or combined with chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, or additional checkpoint inhibitors, and future directions. By elucidating the interplay between the NSCLC immune microenvironment and emerging immunotherapies, this review emphasizes the need for novel combination regimens and robust predictive biomarkers to improve clinical outcomes and extend survival in advanced NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Dysfunction of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) remains a major cause of tumor immune evasion and is correlated with poor cancer survival. Here, we found that increased soluble form of ICOSL (sICOSL) induced CTL dysfunction and was associated with shorter survival of patients with breast cancer. sICOSL emerged as a formidable adversary to CTLs, by directly triggering ICOS internalization and subsequent degradation—a critical blow to the co-stimulatory machinery essential for CTL activation. Our research shows that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) mainly breaks down sICOSL. Notably, certain chemotherapeutic drugs activate the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which in turn suppresses DPP4 expression. To address this issue, we have developed nanobody-DPP4 fusion proteins that can specifically degrade sICOSL, achieving substrate selectivity and tumor targeting. Overall, This work unveils that sICOSL orchestrates CTL dysfunction, and establishs targeted degradation of sICOSL as a new strategy for immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Background Immunosenescence describes the gradual remodeling of immune responses, leading to disturbed immune homeostasis and increased susceptibility of older adults for infections, neoplasia and autoimmunity. Decline in cellular immunity is associated with intrinsic changes in the T cell compartment, but can be further pushed by age-related changes in cells regulating T cell immunity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent inhibitors of T cell activation and function, whose induction requires chronic inflammation. Since aging is associated with low grade inflammation (inflammaging) and increased myelopoiesis, age-induced changes in MDSC induction and function in relation to T cell immunity were analyzed. Results MDSC numbers and functions were compared between “healthy” young and old adults, who were negatively diagnosed for severe acute and chronic diseases known to induce MDSC accumulation. MDSCs were either isolated from peripheral blood or generated in vitro from blood-derived CD14 cells. Aging was associated with significantly increased MDSC numbers in the monocytic- (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSC subpopulations. MDSCs could be induced more efficiently from CD14 cells of old donors and these MDSCs inhibited CD3/28-induced T cell proliferation significantly better than MDSCs induced from young donors. Serum factors of old donors supported MDSC induction comparable to serum factors from young donors, but increased immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs was only achieved by serum from old donors. Elevated immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs from old donors was associated with major metabolic changes and increased intracellular levels of neutral and oxidized lipids known to promote immunosuppressive functions. Independent of age, MDSC-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation required direct MDSC– T cell contact. Besides their increased ability to inhibit activation-induced T cell proliferation, MDSCs from old donors strongly shift the immune response towards Th2 immunity and might thereby further contribute to impaired cell-mediated immunity during aging. Conclusions These results indicate that immunosenescence of innate immunity comprises accumulation and functional changes in the MDSC compartment, which directly impacts T cell functions and contribute to age-associated impaired T cell immunity. Targeting MDSCs during aging might help to maintain functional T cell responses and increase the chance of healthy aging.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite causative links to lymphoproliferative disorders, little is known about early events governing KSHV infection in B lymphocytes. IL‐6 signaling plays a critical role in KSHV‐mediated disease, with human IL‐6 (hIL6) levels correlating with viral load and disease progression. This dynamic is even more complex due to the coexistence of hIL6 and KSHV‐encoded viral IL‐6 (vIL6) in these diseases. We hypothesize that hIL6 and vIL6 play critical, separable and collective roles in the early stages of KSHV infection in B cells. In this study, we use our ex vivo model of KSHV infection in human tonsil lymphocytes to investigate the relative contributions of vIL6 and hIL6 to early infection events in human B cells. We demonstrate that vIL6 and hIL6 collectively suppress KSHV infection in B cells restricting the distribution of KSHV within B cell subsets. We show that vIL6 manipulates hIL6 expression in a subset‐specific manner, and that vIL6 and hIL6 differentially influence the differentiation of germinal center and plasmablasts. Taken together, these results suggest a novel paradigm in which KSHV uses vIL6 to abrogate the GC‐mediated maturation pathway for antibody secreting cells that is driven by hIL6 signaling.">

Here, we describe that TH17 cytokines strongly inhibit expression of critical chemokines in epithelial tissues, which leads to blocking infiltration of proinflammatory immune cells into the colon, rendering resistance to DSS-induced colitis and colon cancer. We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of TH17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy. Overall, our findings have identified a previously unrecognized critical gap between TH17 cytokines, epithelial chemokine expression, and immune cell infiltration through a C/EBPβ-mediated pathway.">

        <tr id="Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is characterized by a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that enables EOC progression and limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. In this study, we demonstrated that isogenic BRCA2-mutated PEO1 and BRCA2-wild type PEO4 EOC cells induced immunosuppressive TMEs through distinct mechanisms. PEO1 cells produced IFNγ-induced PD-L1 and expressed CD39 and CD73 for generating adenosine. Treatment with the adenosine antagonist CGS15943 reversed PEO1 cell-mediated suppression of effector T cell activation. In contrast, PEO4 cells secreted IFNγ-induced CXCL10 and promoted up-regulation of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Treatment with the CXCL10/CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 attenuated PEO4 cell-induced Tregs and decreased IL10 production. In vivo, administration of a monoclonal antibody against CXCR3 effectively hindered the progression of tumor ascites and prolonged survival in the p53(-/-) ID8 EOC syngeneic mouse model. Additionally, AMG487 treatment synergized with the VEGFA inhibitor bevacizumab, significantly reducing tumor ascites and extending mouse survival. Collectively, our results reveal that EOC leverages CXCL10-induced Tregs or adenosine signaling to dampen T cell-mediated anti-cancer immune responses. These findings suggest that targeting CXCL10/CXCR3 and adenosine signaling could effectively counter immunosuppression of EOC, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for improving patient outcomes.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), microglia, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) constitute the major immunosuppressive axis, promoting tumor progression through cytokine secretion (IL-10, TGF-β), metabolic reprogramming, and inhibition of cytotoxic immunity. These innate immune cells not only facilitate immune evasion but also impair adaptive T-cell responses, limiting the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Emerging evidence highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting innate immunity via TAM repolarization, MDSC depletion, and NK cell activation to reshape the immunosuppressive TME.

        <tr id="Relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the leading cause of treatment failure in patients with hematologic malignancies. To better understand the mechanisms underlying early relapse (ER), we comprehensively explored the expression of inhibitory receptors (IRs) in bone marrow (BM) T cells at differentiation stage and examined transcriptional differences. Among the evaluated IRs, TIM3 was significantly upregulated in CD3+T cells of patients with ER compared to patients with complete remission (CR). Notably, double-negative T (DNT) cells, a unique subset with MHC-independent cytotoxic potential, constituted a high proportion of BM T cells and expressed increased TIM3 expression in ER patients. Moreover, regulatory T cells (Tregs) showed elevated TIM3 levels, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment after allo-HSCT. Transcriptomic analysis revealed downregulation of cytotoxic granules and effector genes in DNT cells from ER patients. Functional assays demonstrated that TIM3 blockade with sabatolimab restored T cell cytotoxicity, leading to enhanced leukemia cell apoptosis in ER patients. These findings highlight TIM3 as a critical regulator of T cell exhaustion and immune suppression in patients with ER and provide a rationale for the therapeutic use of TIM3 blockade in preventing and treating relapses after allo-HSCT.

The presence of immune evasion mechanisms, such as the loss of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression, upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, and metabolic reprogramming (hypoxia-induced glycolysis and lactate accumulation), further contributes to immune suppression and poor treatment responses. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, response rates remain highly variable, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven patient selection and combinatorial therapeutic strategies.

The discussion encompasses the emergence of distinct neutrophil subtypes, particularly senescent neutrophils, within tumors and their context-dependent functions in tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis, and recurrence. The plasticity of these cells, driven by intrinsic factors and the tumor microenvironment, allows them to be reprogrammed between pro-tumor and anti-tumor phenotypes. This process is influenced by cytokines, metabolic reprogramming, and interactions with other immune cells. The potential of targeting and engineering neutrophil as a therapeutic avenue for cancer treatment is further underscored, including the use of senolytic agents, metabolic inhibitors, and reprogramming strategies. Finally, future research directions are proposed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying neutrophil heterogeneity and plasticity, with the aim of developing novel therapeutic approaches to modulate neutrophil function in cancer.">

        <tr id="Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a malignant monoclonal gammopathy characterized by the proliferation of plasma cells (PC) in the bone marrow (BM). The tight cross-talk between the BM microenvironment and PC is the hallmark of MM. The BM microenvironment comprises a cellular compartment, consisting of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. The first includes myeloid cells, T- and B-lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and osteoclasts (OCs). In contrast, non-hematopoietic cell types include BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), osteoblasts, adipocytes and endothelial cells. Besides the cellular compartment, there is a non-cellular compartment that includes extracellular matrix, growth factors, chemokines, and several cytokines. All these members play distinctive but interacting roles in the progression of MM and the drug response. MM remains an incurable disease, but in the last years immunotherapy has emerged as an important tool in the treatment of MM. The involvement of the BM microenvironment is a relevant barrier in the response to immunotherapy and in generating resistance. In this review, we provide an overview of the BM microenvironment perturbation in MM patients and how it can determine the possible resistance to immunotherapy, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody-drug conjugates, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T), and bispecific T-cell engagers (BsAbs).">

The immunosuppressive AML microenvironment, characterized by profound immune dysfunction, critically impairs anti-leukemic immune surveillance. This immunologically hostile niche is principally governed by specialized immunosuppressive cell populations—notably regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs), and regulatory B cells (Bregs)—which collectively establish an immune-privileged sanctuary for leukemic cells. This review critically examines three fundamental aspects of these immunosuppressive regulators in AML pathogenesis: (1) their recruitment dynamics within the leukemic niche, (2) the molecular mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive functions, and (3) current and emerging therapeutic approaches designed to neutralize their inhibitory effects. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to provide a mechanistic framework for developing more effective immunotherapeutic interventions against AML.">

Beyond their well-established role in thrombopoiesis, MKs have been identified as important for BM niche maintenance, such as by supporting the growth and differentiation of other cell types. Recently, megakaryopoiesis has been reported as yielding divergent subpopulations of MKs, as evidenced by single-cell RNA sequencing of lung, spleen, or BM resident MKs. Interestingly, these subpopulations constitute a significant proportion of “immune MKs” expressing various classical immune markers and capable of phagocytosing pathogens and contributing to antigen presentation. As such, MKs were also found to regulate inflammation, mainly by secreting various cytokines and chemokines to crosstalk with other cell types. The level and functional signature of these “immune MKs” were found to be altered in various pathological conditions, indicative of their purposeful values in health and diseases. In this review, we survey and highlight newly reported functional immune and inflammatory properties of MKs in health and in select pathologies.">

Using flow cytometry, we elucidated that erythroblast-derived soluble products modulate T cell differentiation by promoting Treg development and increasing PD-1 surface expression on B cells. The immunoregulatory potential of erythroblasts is subpopulation-dependent: CD45+ erythroblasts respond to hemolytic stress by upregulating the surface expression of immunosuppressive molecules PDL1 and Galectin-9, while CD45- erythroblasts primarily increase TGFb production.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing natural killer (NK) cells has demonstrated success against hematological malignancies. Efficacy against solid tumors has been limited by poor NK cell survival and function in the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To enhance efficacy against solid tumors, stimulatory cytokines have been incorporated into CAR-NK cell therapeutic approaches. However, current cytokine strategies have limitations, including systemic toxicities, exogenous dependencies, and unwanted TME bystander effects. Here, we aimed to overcome these limitations by modifying CAR-NK cells to express a constitutively active interleukin (IL)-7 receptor, termed C7R, capable of providing intrinsic CAR-NK cell activation that does not rely on or produce exogenous signals nor activate bystander cells. Methods We examined persistence, antitumor function, and transcriptional profiles of CAR-NK cells coexpressing C7R in a novel tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) co-culture system and against hematologic and solid tumor xenografts in vivo. Results Peripheral blood NK cells expressing a CAR directed against the solid tumor antigen GD2 and modified with C7R demonstrated enhanced tumor killing and persistence in vitro compared with CAR-NK cells without cytokine support and similar functions to CAR-NK cells supplemented with recombinant IL-15. C7R.CAR-NK cells exhibited enhanced survival and proliferation within neuroblastoma TiME xenografts in vivo but produced poor long-term tumor control compared with CAR-NK cells supplemented with IL-15. Similar results were seen using C7R-expressing CD19.CAR-NK cells against CD19+leukemia xenografts. Gene expression analysis revealed that chronic signaling via C7R induced a transcriptional signature consistent with intratumor stressed NK cells with blunted effector function. We identified gene candidates associated with chronic cytokine-stressed NK cells that could be targeted to reduce CAR-NK cell stress within the solid TME. Conclusion C7R promoted CAR-NK cell survival in hostile TMEs independent of exogenous signals but resulted in poor antitumor function in vivo. Our data reveals the detrimental role of continuous IL-7 signaling in CAR-NK cells and provides insights into proper application of cytokine signals when attempting to enhance CAR-NK cell antitumor activity.">

        <tr id="Abstract Objectives The beneficial influence of exercise on outcomes such as infection control and cancer prevention has been attributed partly to the immune system response during physical exertion. CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in immune surveillance, and in this study, we performed an in‐depth analysis of the impact of supramaximal high‐intensity exercise (HIIT) on CD8+ T‐cell dynamics and function, which are currently lacking in the literature. Methods CD8+ T cells obtained from healthy human subjects before and after 3 × 30 s of HIIT were analysed ex vivo for viability and expansion properties, metabolic function using SeaHorse, IFN‐gamma release using EliSpot, phenotype using RNA‐seq and flow cytometry, and cytotoxic capacity by co‐culture with HEK293T cells. Results Exercise led to a threefold increase in CD8+ T‐cell count, and CD8+ T cells obtained after exercise had a more cytotoxic profile. Post‐exercise CD8+ T cells had a lower glycolytic capacity than pre‐exercise cells, and incubation of pre‐exercise CD8+ T cells with post‐exercise serum replicated this metabolic shift, suggesting a systemic effect of exercise on CD8+ T‐cell metabolism. Importantly, CD8+ T cells maintained their viability and expansion properties despite the metabolic challenges induced by exercise. Functionally, post‐exercise CD8+ T cells showed increased release of IFN‐gamma and an enhanced unspecific cell killing capacity as demonstrated by co‐culture with the immortalised cell line HEK293T. Conclusion The pronounced increase in the total number of circulating CD8+ T‐cells with an increased cytotoxic capacity suggests a potential improvement in immune surveillance after acute HIIT.">

        <tr id="Prolonged or broad-spectrum antibiotic courses are associated with intestinal dysbiosis and cytopenias, and depletion of hematopoietic progenitor populations following antibiotics is associated with loss of peripheral immune cells, leading to increased susceptibility to systemic infections. We evaluated the bone marrow hematopoietic compartment in a murine model of antibiotic exposure. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a substantial and previously unrecognized depletion of bone marrow B cells at all stages of development in antibiotic-treated mice, further confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. Depletion of the microbiota was associated with rapid changes in the peripheral B cell compartment, yet fecal microbiota transfer did not rescue both peripheral and bone marrow B cells to a greater degree than natural recovery from antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic-mediated loss of B cell progenitors was secondary to enhanced apoptosis and occurred independent of disrupted systemic type I and II interferon signaling, previously implicated in the maintenance of other hematopoietic compartments. Instead, the depletion of pro-survival MYC signaling was implicated in the depletion of circulating lymphocytes and bone marrow B cell progenitor populations during antibiotic treatment. Further, in vitro exposure of bone marrow cells to antibiotics demonstrated significantly decreased viability of B cells. We conclude that both microbiota depletion and cytotoxic effects of prolonged broad spectrum antibiotic treatment disrupt cytokine and cell survival signaling critical for B cell progenitor maintenance. These results contribute to our understanding of the compartment-specific mechanisms by which the microbiota maintains the hematopoietic system and suggest critical pathways for maintenance of bone marrow progenitors during prolonged antibiotic treatment.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous group of immune cells that play a central role in regulating host immune responses during fungal infections. Their recruitment is mediated by pathogen recognition receptors, particularly Dectin-1 and CARD9 signaling, which promote the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-1β. Once activated, MDSCs suppress T-cell and natural killer cell functions through immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β, as well as enzymes such as arginase-1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1). This review explores the role of MDSCs in fungal infections caused by Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Aspergillus spp., and Cryptococcus neoformans, emphasizing their impact on immune modulation and disease progression. The emerging evidence suggests that fungal bioactive compounds, such as polysaccharides, can influence MDSC activity and restore immune balance. Notably, therapies targeting MDSCs have demonstrated promise in both fungal infections. In particular, infections with P. brasiliensis and C. neoformans show improved T-cell responses following MDSC-targeted interventions. Additionally, polysaccharides from Grifola frondosa and exposure to Aspergillus sydowii affect MDSC behavior, supporting the potential of modulating these cells therapeutically. Together, these findings highlight the relevance of MDSCs in fungal pathogenesis and underscore their potential as targets for immunotherapeutic strategies in infectious diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The hyporesponsiveness of tumor-infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells to tumor cells contributes to immune escape of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), representing a major challenge in current immunotherapy. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Methods We first examined myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT) expression in RCC cell lines and clinical specimens, and analyzed its correlation with CD8+ T-cell exhaustion markers. To investigate the immunoregulatory role of MIAT, we evaluated its effects on CD8+ T-cell function using T-cell co-culture systems and humanized-peripheral blood mononuclear cells RCC patient-derived xenograft models. To determine the direct effects of MIAT on tumor cells, we assessed RCC cell malignant phenotypes following MIAT knockdown both in vitro and in immunodeficient nude mouse orthotopic xenograft models. Mechanistically, we employed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromatin isolation by RNA purification followed by mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to identify the molecular interactions between MIAT, transcription factors, and target genes. Results MIAT was highly expressed in RCC cells and positively correlated with CD8+ T-cell exhaustion status. MIAT knockdown significantly enhanced CD8+ T-cell function with increased perforin and interferon-γ production, while reducing the expression of exhaustion markers programmed cell death protein 1 and T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains. Mechanistically, MIAT was predominantly localized in the nucleus and formed a trimeric complex with transcription factor ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) and janus kinase 3 (JAK3) promoter, thereby upregulating JAK3 expression and activating the JAK3/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Importantly, ectopic expression of JAK3 largely abolished both the tumor-suppressive effects and enhanced T-cell function induced by MIAT depletion. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that the MIAT/JAK3/STAT3 pathway plays a critical role in malignant progression and immune escape of RCC through regulating CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for RCC immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The transmembrane protein Tim-3 has received significant attention in recent years as a possible immunotherapy target. This is due to its robust expression on dysfunctional, exhausted, T cells found in the settings of cancer and chronic infection and biochemical evidence suggesting an inhibitory function of Tim-3. However, numerous clinical trials of putative Tim-3 blocking antibodies have yielded modest benefits, at best, in clinical trials for various cancers. Thus, there is a need to more fully understand the function of Tim-3 in vivo. Here we have studied the function of Tim-3 early during a T cell response to LCMV Armstrong, which causes an acute viral infection in mice. We show that Tim-3 is rapidly expressed after infection and that the expression of Tim-3 is associated with acquisition of a type I effector phenotype, including expression of T-bet and downregulation of Tcf-1, by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In addition, we demonstrate that knockout or cytoplasmic truncation of Tim-3 attenuates the acquisition of the effector program by T cells after LCMV Armstrong infection. Together, these data help to clarify the role of Tim-3 during acute infection.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive brain tumor with an overall poor prognosis due to its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Microglia and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with pro-tumorigenic properties are dominant populations of immune cells in the glioblastoma TME. To date, several studies targeting TAMs to fight tumor progression in different tumor entities have been initiated. However, the impact of standard therapy schemes of glioblastoma cells on macrophage polarization, activation, and phagocytosis remains controversial. The same applies to the relevance of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in the interaction between macrophages and tumor cells. Our study, therefore, investigated patient-oriented treatment of GLIOBLASTOMA by examining the phagocytic capacity of polarized M1- and M2-like macrophages using GL261-luc2 tumor cells as a preclinical model system. Additionally, we analyzed the expression of activation and immune checkpoint markers on these macrophage subtypes following contact with tumor cells and their microenvironment. These factors were also determined after PD-1 blockade was initiated. The analyses revealed that the immunoregulatory M2-like macrophages generally exhibited a higher phagocytosis rate than the pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages; however, this was not influenced by the pretreatment of glioblastoma cells with chemo- or radiotherapy. This could not be improved by blocking the PD-1 receptor. Furthermore, there were no modulations in the expression of differentiation, activation, or immune checkpoint molecules of M1- and M2-like macrophages after cell-to-cell contact with glioblastoma cells. But the medium conditioned by tumor cells strongly altered M1-like macrophages toward a more activated state, whereas M2-like cells were only mildly influenced. This was further enhanced by tumor cell treatment, with the most prominent effect after irradiation. These results suggest that conventional GLIOBLASTOMA tumor cell treatment affects the immunogenic status of macrophage subtypes, which is relevant for enhancing the anti-tumor immune response in brain tumors.">

This decline leads to chronic inflammation, increased vulnerability to infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and reduced vaccine efficacy. As individuals age, the HSC niche undergoes significant changes, including greater adipocyte accumulation and alterations in the molecular microenvironment, which may influence the development and function of immune cells. Among these cells, the impact of the aging HSC niche on dendritic cell (DC) function is less understood. Heterochronic autologous HSC transplantation is a promising intervention to prevent age-related disorders, contributing to the extension of healthspan and longevity, however, several murine experiments failed to produce the expected results, which led us to presume that the problem lies within the old HSC niche. Therefore, we created in vitro models of young and old HSC niches and examined how these microenvironments affect the differentiation and maturation and functionality of BM-derived DCs (BMDCs). Results An analysis of the conditioned media from young and aged HSC niches revealed that the environment of aged niches exhibited an increased presence of adiponectin. This media was subsequently utilized in BMDC differentiation and maturation protocols, with their effects closely monitored. Our results indicate that the old HSC niche microenvironment promotes premature BMDC activation, characterized by elevated MHC class II expression and enhanced allostimulatory capacity of BMDCs at their immature stage. Additionally, LPS stimulation of BMDCs, used to induce DC maturation, significantly increased CD86 expression on BMDCs from the aged niche. However, these cells did not show superior allostimulatory capacity compared to their counterparts from the young niche environment. By analyzing the BMDC cytokine profile, we observed that when cultured in aged niche-conditioned media, the BMDCs secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6, indicating a heightened proinflammatory activation state. Conclusions Collectively, our findings suggest that aging-related changes within the HSC niche can considerably alter DC functionality by disrupting their normal development from BM precursors. These results emphasize the significance of this phenomenon and its implications for immunosenescence.

        <tr id="Understanding the roles of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a promising strategy to identify novel targets to counteract the immunosuppressive barriers protecting multiple myeloma (MM). Neutrophils are a new cancer research focus due to their potential to reduce the efficacy of immune-based therapies. This study aimed to deepen understanding of neutrophil function in MM by analyzing freshly isolated myeloid cells from paired focal lesions (FL) and bone marrow (BM) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunofluorescence imaging, and functional assays. We describe three distinct CXCR2+ mature neutrophil subsets: TREM1+CD10+, RETN+LCN2+, and TNFAIP3+CXCL8+, each exhibiting unique phenotypes within the TME. Notably, the TREM1+CD10+ subset was highly prevalent, particularly in FL, demonstrating potent immunosuppressive effects on T cells. This subset's gene signature was correlated with shorter overall survival (OS) in a large MM patient dataset, underscoring its clinical significance. Targeted inhibition of neutrophil activity through CXCR2 blockade, alone or combined with standard anti-MM therapies, significantly reduced tumor burden, improving OS in preclinical MM models. These insights into neutrophil-mediated immunosuppression in MM provide valuable knowledge regarding mechanisms driving immune evasion and reveal new therapeutic approaches to enhance the efficacy of MM treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Oncolytic virus (OV)-mediated immunotherapy has been shown limited efficacy. Small molecule inhibitors specific to the KRASG12C driver oncoprotein have recently been developed for cancer treatment. The combination of a potent OV with a KRASG12C inhibitor could be a potent combination strategy for treating KRASG12C cancer. Methods We explored combination therapies using KRASG12C inhibitor and OV in cancer cells in vitro and in two KRASG12C cancer models. We employed flow cytometry to evaluate the immune cell profiles, including dendritic cells, macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, natural killer (NK), subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and exhaustion markers (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3), activation markers (granzyme B, IFN-γ and 4-1BB) as well as enzyme-linked immunospot assay to identify tumor-antigen specific T cells. The importance of CD4+, CD8+ T and NK cells in the therapeutic effects was evaluated by antibody-mediated depletion in vivo. Results We confirmed that three inhibitors for KRASG12C, AMG510 (sotorasib), MRTX849 (adagrasib) and MRTX1257, all displayed potent cytotoxicity to cancer cells harboring KRASG12C, but not to cancer cells without this specific KRAS mutation in vitro. All three inhibitors exhibited potent antitumor activity in KRASG12C Lewis lung cancer, but not in MC38 colon cancer with wild-type KRAS. In two KRASG12C tumor models, either an IL-36γ-armed OV or orally delivered MRTX1257 inhibited tumor growth, but the combination worked much more efficiently, and efficacy was further improved with PD-1 blockade although with no statistical difference in survival, leading to complete tumor remission in a large fraction of the mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that MRTX1257, and other KRASG12C inhibitors as well, are potent inducers of antitumor immunity by themselves, and that it worked with OV to elicit potent innate and adaptive tumor-specific immunity. The combination therapeutic efficacy depended largely on increased tumor-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and to a smaller degree, on CD4+ T and NK cells. Conclusions Small molecule inhibitors of KRASG12C are novel inducers of tumor-specific immunity, and a unique triple combination regimen is highly efficacious through elicited potent antitumor immunity for KRASG12C cancers.">

        <tr id="The tumor metastatic dissemination and colonization is a highly complex, multi-step process that requires cooperation between cancer and host cells. Among these, cells of myeloid lineage mobilized from the bone marrow are crucial in facilitating tumor metastatic outgrowth. Recent studies indicate that myeloid cells of bone marrow origin, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, and progenitor cells, promote distant metastasis through immunological and non-immunological mechanisms. These cells are key contributors to creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment in the invaded tissue and draining lymph nodes, protecting metastatic cells from immunosurveillance, and promoting resistance to immunotherapy. Furthermore, the myeloid cells mediate the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in a metastatic niche via enzymes MMP9 and Hyal2, stimulating angiogenesis and establishing a metastasis-permissive microenvironment. This review describes recent findings demonstrating the metastasis-promoting functions of recruited marrow-derived myeloid cells throughout metastatic colonization and suggests new therapeutic avenues.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary This review examines how myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) might contribute to an age-related increase in cancer incidence, traditionally attributed to the accumulation of somatic DNA mutations in stem cells. We discuss the emerging and potentially complementary perspective of a progressive decline in immune system fitness with age, which reduces its ability to detect and eliminate neoplastic cells. In particular, the review discusses the evidence implicating MDSCs in the suppression of immune function and their contribution to immunosenescence. Although several aspects of MDSC activity still remain unclear and more in-depth investigation is needed, advancing this area of research may lead to novel strategies for improving cancer treatment outcomes in elderly patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Emerging clinical and mouse tumor data indicate that tumor cells induce immune suppression in an anatomical site-specific manner. In lung metastases, tumor cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) engages myeloid cell programmed cell death protein 1 to activate SHP2 to suppress type I interferon (IFN-I) expression to repress Cxcl9 expression to impair cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) tumor recruitment. Loss of IFN-I expression thus underlies tumor immune evasion in lung metastases niche. We aimed at testing the hypothesis that forcing tumor cells to express IFNα2 activates Cxcl9 expression to increase CTL tumor recruitment to suppress lung metastasis. Methods Codon usage-optimized IFNα2-encoding DNA was designed and cloned to plasmid. IFNα2-encoding messenger RNA (mRNA) was synthesized. The plasmid DNA and mRNA were encapsulated into DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate)-cholesterol to generate lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mouse IFNα2 (LNP-mIFNα2), human IFNα2 plasmid, and mouse IFNα2 mRNA (LNP-mIFNα2-mRNA). Mouse breast tumor spontaneous lung metastasis, mouse melanoma experimental lung metastasis, and human colon tumor experimental lung metastasis humanized mouse models were used to determine LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid and mRNA efficacy in IFNα2 expression and antitumor immunity, toxicity, and mechanism of action in vivo. Results LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid primarily accumulated in tumor-bearing lungs in mice. LNP-IFNα2 therapy produces mouse IFNα2 protein in mouse tumor-bearing mice and human IFNα2 protein in human tumor-bearing humanized mice to suppress lung metastasis, respectively. Similarly, LNP-mIFNα2-mRNA therapy produces mouse IFNα2 protein and suppressed lung metastasis in tumor-bearing mice. The increased IFNα2 protein activates Cxcl9 expression and increases T cell infiltration in lung metastases. LNP-IFNα2 therapy did not induce liver toxicity and inflammatory cytokines. In human patients with cancer, IFN-I pathway activation is correlated with CXCL9 expression and T cell expansion after PD-(L)1 immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Mechanistically, LNP-delivered IFNα2 suppresses tumor lung metastasis through upregulating Cxcl9 in tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions Our findings determine that LNP-encapsulated IFNα2-encoding plasmid DNA and mRNA are effective agents in restoring IFNα2 expression to activate Cxcl9 expression to enhance T cell tumor recruitment to suppress tumor lung metastasis. LNP-IFNα2 is potentially a safe and yet effective third-generation IFNα2 agent for human cancer immunotherapy to treat patients with lung metastasis.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Patients with chronic blood cancers called myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) can benefit from a therapy based on interferon alpha, which helps the immune system fight disease. However, we still do not fully understand how this treatment works at the molecular level, or how to predict who will respond best. In this study, we analyzed blood samples from patients treated with interferon alpha to investigate changes in immune signals and gene activity over time. We found a progressive decrease in inflammation-related molecules and changes in genes involved in immune regulation, cell survival, and blood cell production. These results suggest that interferon gradually reshapes the immune system and may help control the disease by reducing inflammation and promoting cell death in abnormal blood cells. Our findings may help identify new biomarkers to personalize treatment and monitor its effectiveness in future patients.">

        <tr id="Background The metastatic microenvironment is often rich in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). In uveal melanoma (UM), high levels of TAMs positively correlate with tumor progression and poorer prognosis. We hypothesize that the immunomodulation of TAMs can remodel the UM tumor microenvironment and make it more susceptible to therapeutic interventions. Methods In our work, we designed a novel computational pipeline that combines single-cell transcriptomics data, network analysis, multicriteria decision techniques, and pharmacophore-based docking simulations to select molecular targets and matching repurposable drugs for TAM immunomodulation. The method generates a ranking of drug-target interactions, the most promising of which are channeled towards experimental validation. Results To identify potential immunomodulatory targets, we created a network-based representation of the TAM interactome and extracted a regulatory core conditioned on UM expression data. Further, we selected 13 genes from this core (NLRP3, HMOX1, CASP1, GSTP1, NAMPT, HSP90AA1, B2M, ISG15, LTA4H, PTGS2, CXCL2, PLAUR, ZFP36, TANK) for pharmacophore-based virtual screening of FDA-approved compounds, followed by flexible molecular docking. Based on the ranked docking results, we chose the interaction between caspase-1 and clindamycin for experimental validation. Functional studies on macrophages confirmed that clindamycin inhibits caspase-1 activity and thereby inflammasome activation, leading to a decrease in IL-1β, IL-18, and gasdermin D cleavage products as well as a reduction in pyroptotic cell death. This clindamycin-mediated inhibition of caspase-1 was also observable in TAMs derived from the bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients. Conclusions Our computational workflow for drug repurposing identified clindamycin as an efficacious inhibitor of caspase-1 that suppresses inflammasome activity and pyroptosis in vitro in TAMs. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13046-025-03478-5.">

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a critical, biphasic role: inadequate suppression during early hyperinflammation fails to control cytokine storms, while excessive/persistent activity in late-phase immunosuppression drives immune paralysis and secondary infection susceptibility. This review explores advances in targeting Treg immunoregulation across bacterial, viral, and fungal sepsis, where pathogenic type critically influenced the types of immunoresponses, shaping Treg heterogeneity in terms of phenotype, survival, and function.

Myeloid cells, which includes neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, microglia, and macrophages, play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment of GBM. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), T cells and natural killer (NK) cells exert anti-tumor functions, whereas myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can promote tumor progression by suppressing these immune responses. Therefore, MDSCs play a critical role in shaping the effectiveness of immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a high-mortality cancer due to its aggressive nature and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which enables evasion of immune surveillance. Despite chemotherapy and targeted therapies, 5-year survival is ~ 30%, necessitating novel immunotherapies. AML suppresses cytotoxic T/NK cells by co-opting regulatory pathways, creating an “immune paradox.” Emerging strategies aim to disrupt this evasion. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 nivolumab and anti-CD47 magrolimab, combined with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), enhance T-cell activity and phagocytosis, especially in TP53-mutated AML. Therapeutic vaccines targeting leukemia-associated antigens (e.g., WT1, PRAME) via dendritic cell fusion show early success in prolonging remission. Combinatorial approaches, like HMAs with STING agonists or dual checkpoint blockade, target multiple immunosuppressive pathways to overcome resistance. Challenges include TME heterogeneity, therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells, toxicities (e.g., anemia, cytokine release syndrome), relapse from clonal evolution, and a lack of predictive biomarkers. Autologous therapies face economic and logistical hurdles, driving demand for scalable solutions. Advances in single-cell genomics, AI, and synthetic biology are identifying novel targets (TIM-3, TIGIT, VISTA) and improving patient stratification. Integrating these innovations may transform AML into a chronic condition, bridging preclinical potential to clinical impact. In this review, we aim to evaluate mechanisms, challenges, and future directions of immunotherapies in AML with highlighting ICIs and vaccination to improve therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Cytokine-induced memory-like natural killer cells (CIMLNK) represent a novel form of adoptive cellular therapy that is easy to manufacture and readily available. These cells are generated after overnight stimulation of purified natural killer (NK) cells with interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-15 (IL-15), and interleukin-18 (IL-18). While CIMLNK has demonstrated efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), its potential application in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains unclear. Tafasitamab (TAFA), a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against CD19, a surface antigen expressed on B-ALL cells, has been developed to augment anti-tumor efficacy through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a mechanism predominantly mediated by NK cells. Consequently, we sought to assess the susceptibility of B-ALL to the combination of CIMLNK and TAFA using three B-ALL cell lines: NALM6, SUP-B15, and RS4;11. The addition of TAFA significantly augmented the cytotoxic activity, degranulation capacity, and IFN-γ production of CIMLNK. TAFA-induced ADCC was found to be dose-dependent and was abolished after CD16 blockade. Furthermore, TAFA-mediated effects against NALM6 and SUP-B15 were more pronounced in CIMLNK compared to unstimulated NK cells. In vivo, the combination of CIMLNK and TAFA led to a more pronounced survival benefit in leukemia-bearing mice. In summary, our findings suggest that this combination holds promise as a potential alternative treatment option for patients with relapsed refractory B-ALL.">

        <tr id="Abstract Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is characterized by chronic inflammation, immune evasion, and resistance to RT. Inflammatory pathways such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) promote tumor progression and reduce radiosensitivity. RT activates pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulates immune checkpoints including programmed death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), which contribute to immune suppression and treatment failure. Dual targeting of inflammatory and immune checkpoint pathways has shown potential to reverse radio resistance and enhance therapeutic response. Inhibition of COX-2 can reduce inflammation and improve tumor control, while blockade of PD-1 can restore T cell function and promote antitumor immunity. Strategies that integrate anti-inflammatory components, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and RT guided by molecular profiling may improve treatment outcomes in ESCC. This review focuses on the biological basis of inflammation-mediated radio resistance and presents dual targeting approaches as promising options to overcome current therapeutic limitations.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer remains the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, largely due to its late-stage diagnosis and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). A key mediator of immune evasion in ovarian cancer is the infiltration and activation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which suppress antitumor immunity and foster therapeutic resistance. Emerging therapeutic strategies to target Tregs—such as cytokine modulation, checkpoint blockade, metabolic inhibitors, and epigenetic regulators—are critically evaluated for their potential to restore antitumor immunity. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding how the ovarian TME shapes Treg biology, highlighting mechanisms such as cytokine signaling, chemokine-driven recruitment, metabolic reprogramming, and immune checkpoint interactions, as well as the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, including tissue-resident and follicular subsets, and their clonal expansion in response to tumor antigens. By elucidating the dynamic crosstalk between Tregs and the ovarian TME, this review provides a framework for developing novel immunotherapies to overcome Treg-mediated immunosuppression and improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="The liver presents a unique immune system. Liver diseases are closely associated with the immune system. Disruption of the tightly regulated balance between immune activation and tolerance induction leads to the development and worsening of immune-related liver diseases. T cells play diverse crucial roles in the immune system, and they have long been known to induce inflammation through direct tissue damage by effector molecules and the recruitment of effector cells via chemokines. Additionally, T cells interact with B cells to induce autoantibodies, promoting tissue inflammation and dysfunction through the deposition of IgG and immune complexes in the tissues. Recent advances in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have elucidated the role of T cells in the progression and recovery of liver fibrosis. Moreover, comprehensive and unbiased information can now be obtained from small samples of human and mouse tissues, which advances our understanding of tissue-specific functions of T cells, including resident memory T cells, peripheral helper T cells, and tissue Tregs. However, significant unmet needs remain in the fields of immune-related liver diseases. In this review, we discuss the T cell biology and its role in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which are non-viral liver diseases exhibiting a strong involvement of immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, the latest therapeutic concepts for the diseases and associated drugs targeting T cells have been overviewed.">

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are complex immune structures that spontaneously form within and outside of the tumor microenvironment, resembling secondary lymphoid organs. The formation of TLS formation dynamically adapts to the tumor microenvironment, with their immune function maintained by resident immune cells and cytokine networks. TLS develops antitumor immune competence following dynamic reorganization of their cellular components and proportions, although the precise mechanistic underpinnings remain to be fully characterized. Numerous studies have demonstrated that TLS can modulate the immune status of CRC, potentially enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Currently, the clinical setting lacks appropriate immunological markers to assess immunotherapy outcomes, and TLS may offer a solution to this limitation.

Some studies revealed PD-1/CD95 co-expression is a marker of T cell dysfunction, while CTLA-4 upregulation correlates with suppressed early T cell activation. IL-10 has emerged as a potential biomarker for chemoresistance and tumor aggressivity, consistent with its role in promoting anti-apoptotic signaling in cancer stem cells (CSCs). Engineered IL-2 variants and TNF-α modulation are highlighted as promising strategies to revitalize exhausted CD8+ T cells and disrupt CSC niches.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Cancer immunotherapy predominantly targets CD8 T cells, but recent evidence highlights the importance of CD4 T cells in adoptive cell therapy (ACT). The TAM receptor MerTK regulates immune responses and has been shown to provide costimulatory signals in CD8 T cells. However, its role in CD4 T cells remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that ProS1-MerTK signaling is upregulated in activated CD4 T cells, where it enhances central memory formation, metabolic fitness, and proliferation. Mechanistically, ProS1-MerTK signaling was linked to type 1 immune responses, suggesting a regulatory role in CD4 T cell polarization. Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout, we found that loss of MerTK reduced CD4 T cell fitness, function, and polarization. Furthermore, when ProS1 was added during the expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from advanced melanoma biopsies, it showed potential to promote favorable CD4 T cell memory and helper phenotypes, increase stemness, and reduce exhaustion – features associated with improved responses to ACT. These findings establish ProS1-MerTK as a key pathway for modulating CD4 T cell functionality and highlight its therapeutic potential to enhance TIL-based ACT outcomes.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion is one of the hallmarks of cancers, including glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of primary brain tumors. Multiple mechanisms are employed by tumor cells and its microenvironment to evade immune detection and foster tumor growth and progression. The secretion of immunosuppressive molecules such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), the expression of checkpoint proteins such programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and the recruitment of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to suppressed immune cell activity, favoring unchecked tumor growth. The FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1) has shown context/tissue-dependent effects in cancers of different tissue origins, with either oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles. Our laboratory has reported FAT1 to have an oncogenic function in glioblastoma. In addition, FAT1 promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment in glioblastoma, reducing T-cell and monocyte infiltration while increasing immunosuppressive cells such as MDSCs. It also upregulates pro-inflammatory mediators [cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)], fostering tumor-promoting signaling. This dual role in immune evasion and pro-tumorigenic inflammatory processes makes FAT1 a key driver of glioblastoma progression. This highlights the potential of FAT1 as a compelling therapeutic target. This article provides a concise overview of immune tolerance mechanisms in glioblastoma, and the crucial role of FAT1 in promoting immune tolerance and tumor advancement. In addition, this review highlights currently available immunotherapies in clinical use or undergoing trials, and the potential of FAT1 as a promising target for combinatorial therapeutic interventions.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Macrophages are heterogeneous immune cells with diverse subtypes and tissue‐specific distributions, displaying dynamic polarization states that critically govern their immunomodulatory functions and responses to environmental cues. As key regulators of innate and adaptive immunity, they originate from either embryonic progenitors or bone marrow‐derived monocytes and exhibit remarkable plasticity in response to microenvironmental cues. Tissue‐resident macrophages (e.g., Langerhans cells, Kupffer cells, microglia) display unique organ‐specific functions, while inflammatory stimuli drive their polarization into proinflammatory (M1) or anti‐inflammatory (M2) phenotypes along a functional continuum. This review systematically examines macrophage subtypes, their anatomical distribution, and the signaling pathways (e.g., NF‐κB, STATs, PPARγ) underlying polarization shifts in acute and chronic inflammation. We highlight how polarization imbalances contribute to pathologies including neuroinflammation, liver fibrosis, and impaired tissue repair, particularly in aging contexts. Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting macrophage plasticity, such as cytokine modulation, metabolic reprogramming, and subtype‐specific interventions. By integrating recent advances in macrophage biology, this work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding their dual roles in immune regulation and tissue homeostasis, offering insights for treating inflammatory and age‐related diseases through macrophage‐centered immunomodulation.">

        <tr id="Background Indirect acute respiratory distress syndrome (iARDS) is a life-threatening inflammatory lung injury often triggered by extrapulmonary insults. Although immune checkpoints are critical regulators of inflammation, the role of V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) in iARDS remains unexplored. Methods Using a murine model of iARDS, we compared outcomes in VISTA knockout (VISTA−/−) and wild-type mice. Disease severity was assessed through lung injury scoring, survival analysis, and cytokine/chemokine profiling in plasma, lung tissue, and peritoneal fluid. The therapeutic potential of VISTA was evaluated using an anti-VISTA antibody (13F3). Results VISTA−/− mice exhibited exacerbated lung injury, reduced survival, and elevated systemic levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, MIP-2, and KC compared to wild-type controls. While cytokine levels in lung tissue remained stable, peritoneal fluid mediators were dysregulated in VISTA−/− mice, highlighting compartment-specific inflammatory regulation. Treatment with 13F3 reduced VISTA expression on myeloid and structural cells (monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, epithelium, endothelium) and partially modulated cytokine/chemokine profiles across compartments. Conclusion Our findings establish VISTA as a protective immune checkpoint in iARDS that restrains systemic hyperinflammation and organ damage. Although antibody-mediated VISTA targeting altered inflammatory pathways, its incomplete efficacy suggests complex, multifactorial mechanisms at play. These results position VISTA as a novel therapeutic target for iARDS and warrant further exploration of timed immunomodulatory strategies to harness its protective effects.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background As a malignancy of hematopoietic origin, the standard-of-care cytoreductive chemotherapy can not provide satisfactory treatment effect for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Immunotherapy has received increasing attention in leukemia treatment. However, the immunosuppressive microenvironment and low cancer immunogenicity of AML blasts create major obstacles to effectively inducing immune responses. Methods We developed an extracellular vesicle-based dual-delivery biosystem, which enhanced anti-AML immune responses by activating the immunogenicity of leukemia cells and relieving immunosuppression in AML allografted mice. Red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles (REVs) were selected as delivery carriers due to the excellent biocompatibility. REVs were ligated with leukemia-targeting peptide P9 and subsequently loaded with immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer (Doxorubicin, Dox) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 siRNA (siIDO1) to construct a chemoimmunological cascade biosystem (REVs-Dox/siIDO1-P9). Results The biosystem can specifically deliver the loaded Dox and siIDO1 into target leukemia cells and was validated capable of inducing efficient ICD. ICD-mediated release of damage-associated molecular patterns synergistically functions with siIDO1-mediated IDO1 silence to effectually recruit CD8+ T cells and enhance CD8+ T cell’s functions. In the AML mouse model, REVs-Dox/siIDO1-P9 can evoke a strong antileukemia response and prolong leukemia-bearing mice survival compared with REVs-Dox/siNC-P9 and REVs-siIDO1-P9. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the extracellular vesicle-based chemoimmunological cascade biosystem provides a novel strategy for AML treatment.">

To overcome limitations of systemic inhibition of PMN-MDSCs in cancer-bearing patients such as neutropenia and compensatory myelopoietic adaptations, we developed a nanoengineering strategy to disrupt cell-specific signaling exclusively in PMN-MDSCs without compromising viability or provoking neutropenia. Single-cell RNA sequencing in human/murine PDAC, and flow cytometry in peripheral blood cells from treatment-naïve PDAC patients, nominated surface receptor CXCR2 as a PMN-MDSC-exclusive target. We chemically modified a small-molecule CXCR2 inhibitor AZD5069 by conjugating it with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance aqueous solubility. This AZD5069-PEG construct was then chemically grafted onto amphiphilic polysaccharide derivatives to engineer CXCR2-homing nanoparticles (CXCR2-NP). Cy5.5 dye-loaded CXCR2-NPs showed near-exclusive uptake in PMN-MDSCs compared with KrasLSL.G12D/+;p53R172H/+;Pdx1Cre/+ (KPC) PDAC tumor cells, KPC cancer-associated fibroblasts, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Encapsulation of JAK2/STAT3i Ruxolitinib (CXCR2-NPRuxo) resulted in more efficient and durable attenuation in STAT3-regulated arginase activity from PMN-MDSCs as well as robust induction of cytolytic T-cell activity compared with free Ruxolitinib in vitro and in orthotopic tumor cell-CAF co-injection models in vivo. Treatment of orthotopic tumor-bearing KPC mice with CXCR2-NPRuxo reduced tumor burden compared with vehicle, free Ruxolitinib, or non-drug-loaded CXCR2-NP treatments, without causing appreciable neutropenia. Taken together, cell-specific delivery of payloads via CXCR2-homing immunonanoparticles represents a novel strategy to disrupt MDSC-mediated immunosuppression and invigorate antitumor immunity in PDAC.

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a critical global health concern, particularly in regions with high endemicity of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for advanced HCC. Despite encouraging results, primary and acquired resistance to ICIs continues to pose significant challenges in clinical practice. Recent research has identified tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as key contributors to immune evasion and ICI resistance in HCC, primarily through polarization to the M2 phenotype. M2-polarized TAMs secrete a range of immunosuppressive cytokines that inhibit T cell activation and promote tumor progression through processes such as angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These mechanisms compromise the efficacy of ICIs and facilitate tumor expansion and metastasis. This review summarizes the role of TAM-related signaling pathways in driving immune evasion and ICI resistance in HCC, with particular emphasis on the contribution of TAM surface receptors and chemokines in immune suppression. Additionally, the review highlights emerging insights into TAM metabolic reprogramming and transcriptional regulation, which have been closely linked to ICI resistance. Furthermore, we explore promising therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs and their associated signaling pathways to enhance ICI efficacy in HCC. Integrating these novel approaches could potentially overcome TAM-driven immune evasion and ICI resistance, boosting the efficacy of immunotherapy and improving patient prognosis in HCC.">

To overcome these challenges, we engineered a novel Salmonella strain, VNP20009-CCL2-CXCL9 (VNP-C-C), leveraging the intrinsic tumor tropism of Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009 (VNP) and improving immune modulation through the recruitment of effector immune cells into the TME by the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL9. Methods VNP-C-C was genetically engineered through electroporation of Plac-CCL2-CXCL9 plasmid and validated in vitro. Its antitumor efficacy, immune regulation capacity and immunomodulatory mechanisms were evaluated in vitro by using OS cell lines and immune cells (dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (Mφs)) and in vivo by using both immunocompromised and immunocompetent mouse models of OS lung metastasis. Results VNP-C-C effectively accumulated within tumors, triggering immunogenic cell death and subsequently activating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, thereby robustly promoting type I interferon secretion. The chemokines CCL2 and CXCL9 amplified the immune response by recruiting DCs, Mφs, and T cells to the TME. This orchestrated immune modulation reprogrammed tumor-associated macrophages to an antitumor phenotype, induced DCs maturation, significantly increased T-cell infiltration and activation within tumors, and promoted systemic T-cell memory formation in peripheral lymphoid organs. These effects collectively inhibited OS lung metastasis progression and provided survival benefits in mouse models. Conclusion The engineered bacterial strain VNP-C-C effectively converts the OS lung metastatic TME into a pro-inflammatory milieu, thereby stimulating robust innate and adaptive immune responses. This offers a highly promising therapeutic avenue for OS lung metastasis with considerable translational potential in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="The severity of certain viral infectious diseases varies across the age; we hypothesize that these variations could be related to the variation of immune responses to viral immune complexes (ICs) among the age. This study aimed to investigate monocyte activation in response to ICs in children, adults, and elderly individuals. An experimental in vitro model was established using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. Monocyte activation markers (CD169, CD38, HLA-DR), the negative co-stimulatory molecule (PD-L1), and cytokine production were measured under basal conditions and upon stimulation with human adenovirus 5-IgG immune complex (Ad5-ICs), interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Monocytes from children and adults displayed similar activation profiles in response to ICs and IFN-α stimulation, characterized by increased expression of CD169 and PD-L1. In contrast, monocytes from elderly individuals exhibited weak or no overexpression of CD169 and PD-L1 coupled with a diminished PBMC cytokine response. Notably, cells from elderly participants produced high levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6 in the absence of stimulation. Multiple comparisons confirmed reduced monocyte activation and PBMC cytokine responses in the elderly compared to adults and children. Although children exhibited a significant response to ICs, their secretion of IFN-α, IP-10, IFN-γ, IL-8, and IL-2 was lower than that observed in adults. Our findings suggest that elderly individuals have poor and dysregulated responses to ICs, likely due to immunosenescence and chronic inflammation. Adults exhibit a robust and balanced response to ICs, while children display a moderate response, possibly influenced by ‘trained immunity’ resulting from frequent early-life exposures to pathogens. These insights highlight the importance of further research to develop age-specific therapeutic strategies to modulate immune function during viral IC exposure.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a significant barrier to the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), contributing to long-term morbidity and non-relapse mortality in both pediatric and adult populations. Central to GVHD pathophysiology is the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, where JAK2 mediates key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF. These cytokines promote donor T cell activation, effector differentiation, and target organ damage. The introduction of ruxolitinib, a selective JAK1/2 inhibitor, has transformed the treatment landscape for steroid-refractory acute and chronic GVHD, leading to improved response rates and durable symptom control. However, its limitations—such as cytopenias, infectious complications, and incomplete responses—have catalyzed the development of next-generation agents. In 2024, the FDA approved axatilimab, a CSF-1R inhibitor that targets monocyte-derived macrophages in fibrotic chronic GVHD, and remestemcel-L, an allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cell therapy, for pediatric steroid-refractory acute GVHD. Both agents offer mechanistically distinct and clinically meaningful additions to the therapeutic armamentarium. In parallel, emerging combination strategies involving JAK2 inhibitors and novel biologics show promise in enhancing immune tolerance while preserving graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects. Recent advances in biomarker development, such as the MAGIC Algorithm Probability (MAP), are enabling early risk stratification and response prediction. The integration of these tools with organ-specific and personalized approaches marks a shift toward more precise, durable, and tolerable GVHD therapy. This review highlights the current state and future direction of JAK2 inhibition and complementary therapies in the evolving GVHD treatment paradigm.">

        <tr id="Myeloid leukemia (ML) is a clonal malignant disease with abnormal hematopoietic stem cells. With the emergence of novel immunotherapies, such as CAR-T, therapeutic outcomes in ML patients have improved, while significant challenges persist, including severe adverse events and disease recurrence. Natural killer cells (NK cells) are “natural killers” of the immune system that do not require antigen presentation and responsible for recognizing and destroying tumor cells. Some NK cells-based clinical experiments have been carried out and achieved remarkable results with lower side effects in ML. Crucially, within the ML microenvironment, NK cells frequently exhibit more severe functional exhaustion compared with T cells, characterized by impaired cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and proliferative capacity which limits anti-ML efficacy of NK cells. However, clinical studies utilizing NK cell-based therapies (e.g., adoptive transfer, CAR-NK cells) have demonstrated promising results with favorable safety profiles, underscoring their therapeutic potential. Therefore, developing more strategies based on NK cell is of great clinical significance for the treatment of ML. In this review, we systematically analysed the relationship between ML and NK cells, aiming to propose more novel protocols for NK cell expansion and persistence enhancement, establish evidence-based guidelines for next-generation NK cell-based immunotherapies in ML treatment.">

        <tr id="The dynamic evolution of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) during targeted therapy is a critical yet poorly understood determinant of treatment response and resistance. While most studies compare immune states before and after treatment, temporal immune changes during therapy remain largely uncharacterized, limiting development of effective combination strategies. Here, we investigated immune dynamics throughout targeted therapy using mouse melanoma models that recapitulate human therapeutic responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified a previously unrecognized inflection point where the inflamed TME during tumor regression, characterized by robust NK cell infiltration, transitions to an immune-excluded state upon onset of drug-tolerant residual disease. We uncovered a unique macrophage subset (F4/80 hi CCL5⁺MHCII⁺CD63⁺) that orchestrates NK cell recruitment through CCR2/5 signaling during regression. Depletion of these macrophages using LysM-cre;iDTR mice significantly reduced NK cell infiltration. Specifically during residual disease, pharmacological inhibition of Ptpn22, a phosphatase that negatively regulates immune activation, reprogrammed macrophages, restored NK cell recruitment and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Extending these findings to human cancer, longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of melanoma and lung cancer patient samples revealed dynamic NK cell infiltration during targeted therapy, establishing a direct link between innate immune remodeling and treatment outcome. Unlike prior prognostic studies assessing immune states at single time points, our results provide mechanistic evidence of a temporal relationship between NK cell infiltration and therapeutic efficacy. Together, these findings position immune evolution as a driver of acquired resistance and identify macrophage-NK cell crosstalk as a therapeutically actionable axis to overcome immune exclusion and improve targeted therapy across multiple cancer types.

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most prevalent hematological malignancy in adults, characterized by a rapid progression, short clinical course, and poor prognosis. Immune imbalance following severe infections post-chemotherapy represents a critical cause of mortality in AML patients. Our study investigates the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on immune imbalance in severe infections after AML chemotherapy and its mechanisms of action on mononuclear macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine storm models. The findings are expected to provide significant practical implications for both basic research and clinical interventions in managing severe infections in leukemia patients. Our findings indicated that some specific chemokines and cytokines exhibited abnormal increases in AML patients, with more pronounced elevations in severely infected AML patients (AML-SI) compared to uninfected counterparts. HCQ inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, although low concentrations demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity. Co-culture of THP-1 cells with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from AML patients significantly increased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels, which were markedly reduced upon HCQ intervention. HCQ exerted limited effects on the CXCL12-CXCR4/7 regulatory axis but induced programmed cell death of leukemic THP-1 cells. RNA-seq showed that the differentially expressed genes in HCQ intervention group were mainly enriched in NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, PPAR signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, HCQ suppressed monocyte proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and demonstrated stronger effects on activated mononuclear macrophages. Mechanistically, HCQ regulated Bcl-2 family protein expression, upregulated Bax, activated Caspase-3, and inhibited NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, thereby suppressing inflammatory cytokine storms. In all, HCQ effectively reverses immune imbalance and suppresses malignant biological characteristics of leukemic cells, and it also attenuates inflammatory cytokine storms by inhibiting chemokine regulatory axes and suppressing NLRP3/IL-17A and TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, offering promising potential for basic research and clinical applications in inflammatory cytokine storm management.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal survival rate due to limited effective therapies. While studies have focused on innate immune cell influence on adaptive immune cell functions, few have explored interactions between innate immune cells, which modulate the unique PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are responsible for clearance of neutrophil-mediated inflammation in physiologic immune responses; however, these cells co-exist in PDAC. We sought to determine how neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), neutrophil release of decondensed chromatin and intracellular contents, affect monocyte/macrophage populations in the PDAC TME. Utilizing samples from patients with PDAC, we demonstrate elevated monocyte chemokine CCL2 in plasma and elevated NET CitH3 and pan-macrophage marker CD68 in the PDAC TME via fluorescent immunohistochemistry. To determine how NETs impacted macrophage populations in the PDAC TME, we depleted NETs with DNase I and with genetic knockout of the PAD4 enzyme and found an elevation in pan-macrophage marker F4/80. The depletion led to increased T cell stimulatory signal CD80 while the pro-tumor macrophage marker CD206 was decreased. We further demonstrate that macrophages in the NET-deficient PDAC TME may be recruited through the CCL2/CCR2 axis, in which CCL2 can be released from tumor cells and macrophages in the presence of IFN-. Taken together, our findings reveal that inhibition of NETs can prime the innate immune response toward an anti-tumor phenotype.">

        <tr id="Background: Increased IL-1β levels may promote carcinogenesis and metastasis by affecting tumor biology and the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this context, extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role in cell-to-cell communication, thus modulating the TME and immune response. Here, we aimed to test whether tumor-derived small EVs (TEVs) isolated from sensitive and osimertinib-resistant (OR) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells may promote EMT via fibronectin binding to α5β1 integrin as well as suppress the immune system and if these effects may be favored by IL-1β. Methods: TEVs were isolated from control, OR, and IL-1β-stimulated NSCLC cells. Expressions of fibronectin and PD-L1 were screened in TEVs and the mRNA levels of vimentin and SMAD3 were also assessed in cancer cells after TEV co-culturing. Furthermore, to detect the effect on immune cells, we co-cultured TEVs with lung cancer patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: TEVs were positive for fibronectin and the highest protein levels were found in TEVs obtained from the OR and IL-1β-stimulated cells. TEV-mediated activation of α5β1 signaling led to the upregulation of vimentin and SMAD3 mRNA in NSCLC cells and stimulated cell migration. EVs also increased PD-1, CTLA-4, FOXP3, TNF-α, IL-12, and INF-γ mRNA in lung cancer patients’ immune cells. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that TEVs promote EMT in NSCLC cells by the activation of the fibronectin–α5β1 axis. Finally, IL-1β stimulation induces TEV release with biological properties similar to OR TEVs, thus leading to cancer invasion and immune suppression and suggesting that inflammation can promote tumor spreading.">

        <tr id="Background Blockade of Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) significantly improves progression-free survival in patients with cancers, including melanoma. In addition to unleashing antitumor immunity, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapies disrupt immune regulatory networks critical for maintaining homeostasis in various tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Despite growing reports of cancer- and ICI-related cognitive impairments among survivors, our understanding of the pathophysiology of ICI-related neurodegenerative effects is limited. Methods In this study, we used a murine model of melanoma, cognitive function tests, and neuroimmunological assays to investigate the cellular mechanisms and impact of combinatorial blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 on brain function. Syngeneic melanoma was induced in C57Bl6 mice via intradermal injection of D4M-3A.UV2 melanoma cells. After confirmation of tumor growth, cancer-bearing and non-cancer mice received combinatorial treatment of anti-CTLA-4 (1 mg per dose, twice per week) and anti-PD-1 (200 µg per dose, thrice per week) for three weeks. One month after completing ICI treatment, mice were evaluated for learning, memory, and memory consolidation cognitive function tasks. Neuroinflammation, synaptic and myelin integrity, and immune cell status in the brain were analyzed to examine neuro-immunological changes post-ICI treatment. Results While tumor-related alterations in brain function were evident, combined ICI treatment specifically disrupted synaptic integrity and reduced myelin levels independent of neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity in both cancer-bearing and non-cancer mice brains. Combined ICI selectively impaired hippocampal-dependent cognitive function. This was associated with a two-fold increase in T cell numbers within the brain along with immune activation of myeloid cells, especially microglia. Furthermore, an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model revealed that combination ICI predisposes the CNS to exacerbated autoimmunity, highlighting neuroinflammation-related, and tumor-independent, neurodegenerative sequelae of combination ICI. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that combinatorial blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 destabilizes neuroimmune-regulatory networks and activates microglia, contributing to long-term neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments. Therefore, selectively limiting microglial activation could be a potential avenue to preserve CNS functions while maintaining the therapeutic benefits of rapidly evolving ICIs and their combinations.

        <tr id="Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive cancer with an increasing incidence worldwide, highlighting the need for research into its pathogenesis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in melanoma progression and consists of cellular components and an extracellular matrix (ECM) rich in cytokines and signaling molecules. The most abundant stromal cells within the TME are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which remodel the ECM and modulate immune responses. Among immune cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) predominate, and their polarization toward the M2 phenotype supports tumor progression. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have diverse functions, including cytotoxic T-cells, helper T-cells that modulate immune response, B-cells forming tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), and regulatory T-cells with immunosuppressive properties. Dendritic cells (DCs) also play a complex role in the TME. A notable subpopulation are mature regulatory dendritic cells (mregDCs), which contribute to immune evasion. All of these TME components may drive tumorigenesis. Advancements in melanoma treatment—including immunotherapy and targeted therapies—have significantly improved outcomes in advanced-stage disease. In parallel, emerging approaches targeting the tumor microenvironment and gut microbiome, as well as personalized strategies such as neoantigen vaccines and cell-based therapies, are under active investigation and may further enhance therapeutic efficacy in the near future.">

        <tr id="Inflammation is a self-defense mechanism that controls the homeostasis of an organism, and its alteration by persistent noxious stimuli could lead to an imbalance in the regulation of inflammatory responses mediated by innate and adaptive immunity. During chronic inflammation, sustained exposure of myeloid cells to the various inflammatory signals derived from inflamed tissue could lead to the generation of myeloid cells with an immunosuppressive state, called myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which can exert protective or deleterious functions depending on the nature of signals and the specific inflammatory conditions created by different pathophysiological contexts. Initially identified in various tumor models and cancer patient samples, these cells have long been recognized as negative regulators of anti-tumor immunity. Consequently, researchers have focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying their potent immunosuppressive activity. As a key component of the signal transducing processes, protein kinases play a central role in regulating the signal transduction mechanisms of many cellular activities, including differentiation and immunosuppression. Over the past decade, at least a dozen kinases, including mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TAM RTKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and others, have emerged as key contributors to the generation and differentiation of MDSCs. Here, we discuss the recent findings on these kinases that directly contribute to the immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs.">

        <tr id="Background T-cell engagers (TCEs), the most extensively studied class of bispecific antibodies, redirect effector T cells to tumor cells to induce immune synapse formation, T-cell activation, and subsequent tumor cell killing. However, their therapeutic efficacy in solid tumors is limited by immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME). To address this challenge, we engineered an enhanced PSMA/CD3 bispecific antibody by incorporating the extracellular domain of CD80, which provides a co-stimulatory signal to counteract T-cell inhibition in prostate cancer. This trifunctional antibody is designated as TriTE-N13. Methods We engineered the fully humanized fusion antibody TriTE-N13 using gene editing and eukaryotic expression systems. In vitro, we evaluated its ability to activate and proliferate T cells, as well as its cytotoxicity against PSMA+ tumor cells in both 2D co-culture and 3D spheroid models. Additionally, we assessed the in vivo antitumor efficacy and safety of TriTE-N13 using human immune-reconstituted mouse models bearing prostate cancer xenografts. Results In vitro, TriTE-N13 demonstrated robust activation of human T cells and high-affinity binding to both human PSMA and CD3 antigens. Furthermore, TriTE-N13 effectively mediated T-cell-dependent cytotoxicity against PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells. In vivo studies revealed that TriTE-N13 achieved significantly greater tumor volume reduction compared to conventional bispecific TCEs, particularly in established large tumors. Conclusions Our findings indicate that incorporating CD80 as a co-stimulatory signal substantially enhances the antitumor efficacy of TCEs against solid tumors. These results position TriTE-N13 as a promising immunotherapeutic candidate for advanced prostate cancer treatment.

        <tr id="Introduction Acute cellular rejection of transplanted lung allografts involves activated cytotoxic T cells and reduced Regulatory T (Treg) cell function. Calcineurin inhibitors, the cornerstone of immunosuppressive regimens, suppress T cell cytotoxicity but inhibit Treg proliferation. The DNA hypomethylating agent decitabine (DAC) can abrogate T cell cytotoxicity while stimulating Treg proliferation. Methods We sought to determine the effects of DAC treatment in a murine MHC-mismatched orthotopic lung transplant model. Results Rescue treatment with DAC maintains lung allograft gross and histologic integrity with a reduction in cytotoxic T cell responses. CD4+FoxP3+ T cell depletion in Foxp3DTR mice exacerbated rejection lung injury compared to CD4+FoxP3+ T cell sufficient mice and failed to abolish the protective effect of DAC in this model. The protective effect of DAC was associated with a reduction in cytokine production from host T-cells. Discussion Decitabine could offer a new line of treatment for acute lung allograft rejection, in part via its effects on Tregs.">

        <tr id="Innate immune cells constitute the majority of the tumor microenvironment (TME), where they mediate both natural anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy responses. While single-cell T- and B-cell receptor sequencing has provided fundamental insights into the clonal dynamics of human adaptive immunity, the lack of appropriate tools has precluded similar analysis of innate immune cells. Here, we describe a method that leverages somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations to reconstruct clonal lineage relationships between single cells across cell types in native human tissues. We jointly sequenced single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin and mtDNA to profile n=124,958 cells from matched tumor, non-involved lung tissue (NILT), and peripheral blood of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, as well as n=93,757 cells from matched tumor and peripheral blood of ovarian cancer patients. Single-cell concomitant profiling of lineage and cell states of thousands of immune cells resolved clonality across cell types, tissue sites, and malignancies. Clonal tracing of innate immune cells demonstrates that TME-resident myeloid subsets, including macrophages and type 3 dendritic cells (DC3), are clonally linked to both circulating and tissue-infiltrating monocytes. Further, we identify distinct DC-biased and macrophage-biased myeloid clones, enriched in the tumor and NILT, respectively, and find that their circulating monocyte precursors exhibit distinct epigenetic profiles, suggesting that myeloid differentiation fate may be predetermined before TME infiltration. These results delineate the clonal pathways of intratumoral myeloid cell recruitment and differentiation in human cancer and suggest that remodeling of the tumor myeloid compartment may be peripherally programmed.">

        <tr id="Cellular and molecular heterogeneity contributes to the insufficient immunogenicity of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a lethal malignancy characterized by post-resection relapse, ultimately leading to limited immune cell infiltration. Here, we report a strategy to boost tumor immunity by activating the endogenous cGAS-STING signaling pathway through in-situ manipulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), thereby augmenting the immune responsiveness of GBM. Under white light irradiation, the synthetic butterfly-shaped photosensitizer B-TTPy disrupts the mitochondrial ETC by producing excessive reactive oxygen species. Synergistically, inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 amplifies ETC dysfunction, thus enhancing the cytotoxicity of B-TTPy against tumor cells. Our results demonstrate that the in-house-customized Mitochondrial Electron Alteration Nanoparticles in Glioblastoma (MEANING) efficiently activate innate and adaptive immune response by recruiting antigen-presenting cells and cytotoxic T cells to the surgical margin. Moreover, biodegradable hydrogel-medicated surgical cavity treatment with MEANING can reshape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and eliminate residual GBM cells. In sum, our findings establish a local immune activation approach for GBM, to prevent postoperative tumor recurrence and identify ETC blockade as a promising therapeutic strategy for low-immunogenic tumors.">

        <tr id="The lymphocyte-specific transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is a key player in immune evasion in cancers, with the complex mechanism(s) being barely understood. In this study, we have focused on the role of IRF4 in regulating T cell functions through its transcriptional regulation of programmed death 1 (PD1) and its ligand PD1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), which were identified as IRF4 transcriptional targets in multi-omics analysis. We have shown that IRF4 transcriptionally regulates both PD1 and PD-L1, promoting immune suppression in the context of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection. Co-culturing EBV+ JiJoye lymphoma cells with CD4+ T cells or with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) downregulates CD4+ T cell functions, but the depletion of IRF4 in EBV+ JiJoye lymphoma cells reduces PD1 and PD-L1 expression, and partially restores CD4+ T cell functions. Moreover, CD4+ T cell depletion from PBMCs enhances EBV transformation, and EBV has a greater efficiency in transforming PBMCs from HIV patients with impaired CD4+ T cell functions. These findings support the role of IRF4 in immune evasion by upregulating PD1/PD-L1 during EBV transformation, and that functional CD4+ T cells are essential for limiting EBV transformation.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical for maintaining immune tolerance by suppressing effector T cell responses. However, in chronic inflammatory diseases such as spondyloarthritis (SpA) and psoriasis (PsO), Tregs can lose their stability and acquire pro-inflammatory characteristics, a phenomenon known as Treg plasticity. Under inflammatory conditions, Tregs may downregulate FoxP3, upregulate RORγt, and produce cytokines such as IL-17 and IFN-γ, thus losing their suppressive function and contributing to disease progression. In SpA, altered numbers and impaired Treg function have been identified in peripheral blood and synovial fluid. Specific subsets, such as CD161+ Tregs with Th17-like features, suggest that inflammatory cytokines and signals like STAT3 activation and ICOS engagement promote pathogenic reprogramming. Genetic factors, including HLA-B27, may further predispose Tregs to instability. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses have provided evidence of shared TCR repertoires between Tregs and effector T cells, reinforcing the concept of lineage plasticity. Similarly, in PsO, skin-resident Tregs exposed to IL-23, IL-6, and IL-21 can acquire a Th17-like phenotype, producing IL-17A and exacerbating local inflammation. Environmental factors such as hypoxia also contribute to destabilizing Treg identity. The persistence of pathogenic Tregs, even following therapy blockade of IL-17 or IL-23, highlights the challenge of achieving long-term disease remission.">

As key mediators of cytotoxic immunity, CD8 T cells play a crucial and multifaceted role in ZIKV pathogenesis. While essential for controlling viral replication, their infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS)—an immune-privileged site—raises potential concerns regarding immunopathology. This review explores the dual roles of CD8 T cells during ZIKV infection, emphasizing both their antiviral functions and their potential to drive neuroinflammation. We examine how ZIKV infection and chemokine-mediated signals facilitate immune cell trafficking across the blood–brain barrier, drawing parallels with other neurotropic flaviviruses. We also explore how therapeutic agents, such as the S1P receptor modulator FTY720, influence lymphocyte trafficking and CNS immune regulation. Finally, we review emerging interventions—including vaccines, antivirals, immunomodulators, and passive immunotherapies—that aim to achieve effective viral control while minimizing neural damage. A balanced understanding of immune cell responses in flavivirus infections is essential for guiding future therapeutic strategies against ZIKV and related neurotropic viruses.">

        <tr id="Endometrial carcinoma (EC) represents one of the most prevalent malignancies within the female reproductive system. The frequency of its occurrence is on the rise annually, and patients diagnosed at advanced stages face a less favorable prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the significant influence of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) on the initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance of endometrial cancer. The TME encompasses various components such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). These elements contribute to an immunosuppressive milieu by secreting cytokines, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and engaging immune checkpoint pathways like PD-1/PD-L1, thereby supporting tumor immune evasion and resistance to treatment. This review synthesizes current understanding of the EC-TME, focusing on the distinct roles and interactions of its key constituents within the context of EC biology. Furthermore, we explore the rationale and progress for novel therapeutic strategies targeting the TME, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, combination therapies, and nano delivery systems leveraging EVs, aiming to provide insights for improving EC patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation and epithelial barrier dysfunction, remains a therapeutic challenge due to the limitations of current treatments, including drug resistance and invasive surgical risks. Emerging evidence implicates intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) pyroptosis as a key contributor to IBD progression. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (BMSCs-Exo) exhibit anti-inflammatory and tissue-reparative potential, yet the role of tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), a critical anti-inflammatory mediator in BMSCs-Exo, in modulating pyroptosis and intestinal barrier integrity remains unexplored. This study investigates the role of TSG-6 contained in mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSCs-Exo) in alleviating IBD by modulating the pyroptosis signaling pathway in IECs. Results In this study, TSG-6-enriched BMSCs-Exo significantly alleviated intestinal inflammation and pyroptosis in murine IBD models. BMSCs-Exo administration reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suppressed Caspase-1-mediated Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine release (IL-1β, IL-18). Notably, TSG-6 knockdown in BMSCs-Exo abolished these protective effects, confirming its essential role in blocking the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD axis. Furthermore, BMSCs-Exo restored intestinal barrier integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins (e.g., ZO-1, occludin) and reducing epithelial permeability. In vitro experiments revealed that BMSCs-Exo directly inhibited pyroptosis in IECs, attenuating cell membrane rupture and inflammatory cascade amplification. Conclusion This study identifies TSG-6 as a pivotal mediator in BMSCs-Exo that disrupts pyroptosis-driven IBD pathogenesis by targeting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The findings highlight BMSCs-Exo as a cell-free therapeutic strategy to mitigate intestinal inflammation and barrier damage, offering advantages over traditional MSCs-based therapies in safety and specificity. By elucidating the TSG-6/NLRP3 regulatory axis, this work provides a novel framework for developing exosome-engineered treatments for IBD and other pyroptosis-related inflammatory disorders.">

The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who develop severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. These signatures are exacerbated in patients with overweight/obesity compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic potential compared to non-SD. Using transcriptional and proteomics approaches we show decreased type-I Interferon responses in SD, suggesting defective innate immunity may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional T and NK-cell signatures underpin dengue pathogenesis and may represent novel targets for immunomodulatory therapy in dengue.">

        <tr id="Peritoneal metastasis (PM) of gastric cancer (GC) has an immune escape environment. Regulatory B cells (Bregs), characterized by IL-10 production, play an important role in the tumor immunity; however, the function of Bregs in PM remains unclear. We investigated the frequency and effects of Bregs on other immune cells in the PM using clinical specimens and mouse models of PM. In the peripheral blood and ascites, Breg frequency was significantly higher in patients with GC with PM than in those without PM. In clinical PM samples, Breg frequency was an independent prognostic factor. In the mouse PM model, peritoneal tumors showed higher Breg infiltration than subcutaneous tumors. In the PTEN-deficient PM model, activation of Bregs promoted ascites and peritoneal tumor growth, decreased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and increased the infiltration of M2 macrophages. In contrast, treatment with wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, suppressed Breg infiltration, resulting in decreased M2 macrophage infiltration and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration. Bregs are indicated to be involved in immunosuppression of PM and are promising targets for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy against PM.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background and Objectives A pivotal role of cancer (e.g., glioma) microenvironment is primarily executed by tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) in facilitating cancer immune evasion and even resisting immunotherapies. However, the molecular base for governing such functionality of TAMs remains poorly understood. Thereby, we here explore the impact of such a key regulatory transcription factor NFE2L1 (also called Nrf1) on glioma‐relevant TAMs. Methods A set of combining in vivo and in vitro experimental approaches, e.g., by utilizing CRISPR‐Cas9 and overexpression plasmids to modulate NFE2L1 expression, and the resulting phenotypic changes in TAMs were evaluated. Besides, immunofluorescence, RT‐qPCR and flow cytometry were conducted to assay the infiltration of various immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells and M1‐type macrophages, in the glioma microenvironment, as well as their therapeutic response to anti‐PD1 treatment. Results Deficiency of NFE2L1 causes a unique phenotypic switch in the TAMs from its pro‐cancer M2‐type to another anti‐cancer M1‐type, thereby inhibiting malignant progression of glioma. Such NFE2L1‐deficiency leads to significantly increases of CD8+ T cells and M1 macrophages within tumor tissues of glioma and hence enhances its sensitivity to anti‐PD1 therapy. Further experimental evidence has provided revealing a synergistic efficacy triggered by combined therapy of CD38 inhibitor with PD1 antibodies, significantly inhibited tumor growth, compared to that of their monotherapy. The mechanistic study unraveled that NFE2L1 enables for directly binding to those ARE sites within the promoter regions of both CD38 and PD‐L1 genes in order to govern their transcriptional expression. Conclusions The aberrant role of NFE2L1 in the malignant progression of glioma was discovered in this study. It is of crucial significance to emphasize the potential of NFE2L1 inhibition as a strategic approach to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic intervention. Overall, this discovery holds a substantial promise for advancement of innovative combination therapies, potentially enhancing treatment outcomes for individuals afflicted with glioma.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are immunocompromised and highly vulnerable to serious recurrent infections. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are principal sensors of pathogen challenge and are essential in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses to resolve infection. This study identified significant deficiencies in six functionally distinct DC subsets in blood of untreated CLL (UT-CLL) patients and selective normalization of pDCs in response to acalabrutinib (a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. DCs are continuously replenished from hematopoiesis in bone marrow (BM). Four BM developmental intermediates that give rise to cDCs and pDCs were examined and significant reductions identified in UT-CLL patients supporting a precursor/progeny relationship. The deficiencies in blood DCs and BM DC progenitors were significantly associated with alterations in the Flt3/FL signaling pathway critical to DC development and function. The CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI), a highly accurate model to predict progression-free survival and time-to-first treatment (TTFT), revealed that cDC1 and pDC were reduced in High/Very High CLL-IPI compared to Low CLL-IPI patients. Notably, UT-CLL patients with shared DC subset deficiencies had shorter TTFT, uncovering a profound alteration in innate immunity with the potential to instruct therapeutic decision-making.">

        <tr id="Background Sepsis is a complex and life-threatening disease process related to a systemic response to severe infection. Due to the challenges of treating patients with sepsis, new therapies are being investigated, including cell-based approaches. Trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are immune privileged cells with immunomodulatory properties. Thus, we proposed that TSCs may be beneficial in experimental models of sepsis to regulate the immune response and curtail organ injury. Methods Sepsis was induced by experimental models in mice; cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and lung infection with Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae. TSCs were isolated from the chorionic villi of human (h) term placentas, and from mouse (m) placentas using anti-CD117 MicroBeads, and were administered intravenously 6 h after CLP or S. pneumoniae infection. We assessed mortality, bacterial clearance, organ injury, inflammatory response, and production of cytokines and chemokines. Results CD117+ hTSCs did not express human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I or II, and were clonogenic and self-renewing. CLP led to severe mortality by 7 days, and administration of either hTSCs or mTSCs resulted in markedly improved survival compared with control cells or vehicle. hTSCs promoted bacterial clearance and decreased organ injury in the liver, kidney, spleen, and bowel. The elevated innate immune response in the peritoneum, predominantly neutrophils, was attenuated by hTSCs. In addition, neutrophil infiltration into the spleen was less in mice receiving hTSCs, which corresponded with reduced plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. When assessing the lung response to S. pneumoniae infection, administration of hTSCs resulted in fewer bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue, and less lung edema and injury. Neutrophils, which were markedly increased in BALF, were diminished and infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs was decreased by hTSCs. BALF pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were mitigated by hTSCs to levels of Sham mice, and systemic injury to the liver and spleen was attenuated. Conclusions CD117+ hTSCs are immune privileged cells that when given after the onset of experimental models of infection/sepsis resulted in improved outcomes due to enhanced bacterial clearance, resolving inflammation, and less organ injury. These data support hTSCs as a potential cell-based therapy for sepsis. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13287-025-04479-z.">

        <tr id="Background: The STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) pathway plays a vital role in the body’s innate immune defense system, primarily involved in DNA sensing and type I interferon production. While STING is well-established in various immune cells, its role in natural killer (NK) cells, particularly within the context of liver fibrosis, remains inadequately explored. Aim: The current study investigates the relationship between STING expression, NK cell activity, and insulin receptor (IR) signaling in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Methods: Peripheral NK cells were isolated from healthy controls and MASH patients with varying stages of liver fibrosis (early: F1/F2; advanced: F3/F4). The expressions of STING, IR, NK cell activation markers (CD107a, NKp46), and NK cell inhibitory markers (LAIR-1, Siglec-7) were assessed using flow cytometry. NK cell cytotoxicity against primary hepatic stellate cells (pHSCs) was evaluated through apoptosis assays. STING agonists (2′3′-cGAMP and DMXAA) were used to stimulate NK cells, and their effects on STING expression, NK cell activation, and cytotoxicity were measured. Additionally, the impact of insulin signaling on STING expression and NK cell function was examined. Results: Our results demonstrate that STING expression in NK cells correlates with disease severity in liver fibrosis. NK cells from MASH patients with advanced fibrosis (F3/F4) showed inhibited STING protein levels that were statistically comparable to healthy NK cells and accompanied by impaired cytotoxicity and decreased IFN-γ production. In contrast, NK cells from early fibrosis (F1/F2) exhibited higher STING expression and better functional activity. STING agonist treatment (2′3′-cGAMP) restored STING expression and enhanced NK cell activity across all fibrosis stages. Furthermore, insulin treatment and combined insulin and 2′3′-cGAMP treatment synergistically upregulated both IR and STING expressions, leading to improved NK cell function and increased cytotoxicity, particularly in advanced fibrosis. Conclusion: Our results highlight the potential of targeting STING and insulin signaling pathways as a therapeutic approach in restoring NK cell function and enhance immune surveillance in liver fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous and aggressive hematologic malignancy, remains challenging to treat due to high relapse rates, chemotherapy resistance, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While traditional therapies like chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have improved outcomes, their efficacy is often limited by toxicity and disease recurrence. Recent advancements in antibody engineering have revolutionized AML immunotherapy, offering precision-targeted strategies to overcome these barriers. This narrative review explores the transformative role of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), and bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) in redirecting immune effector cells, blocking immune checkpoints, and eradicating leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Key innovations include CD33-targeted gemtuzumab ozogamicin, CD123-directed bispecific engagers, and anti-CD47 agents that disrupt “don’t eat me” signals. We highlight breakthroughs in antibody design—such as Fc optimization, trispecific constructs, and conditionally active biologics—that enhance specificity while minimizing on-target off-tumor toxicity. Clinical trials demonstrate promising results, including improved remission rates and survival in refractory/relapsed AML when combining antibodies with hypomethylating agents, venetoclax, or checkpoint inhibitors. However, challenges persist, including AML’s genetic heterogeneity, adaptive immune evasion, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risks. Emerging strategies such as biomarker-driven personalization, TME modulation, and engineered NK-cell engagers are poised to address these limitations. By integrating preclinical insights with clinical data, this review underscores the potential of antibody-based combinatorial regimens to redefine AML therapy, offering durable responses and bridging the gap to curative approaches.">

        <tr id="Immune memory was considered for decades an exclusive hallmark of the adaptive immune response. However, recent studies have revealed that innate immune cells can also ‘recall’ information of a primary insult during infection or vaccination and deploy robust antigen-agonistic immune reactivity upon secondary challenge. This de-facto innate immune memory response is designated as ‘trained immunity’. γδ T cells are unconventional T cells that possess unique immunologic features of both adaptive and innate immunity. Their immune memory responses to various bacterial and viral agents were originally described to be of an adaptive immune nature. Nevertheless, growing evidence shows that γδ T cells can also mount antigen-independent memory responses resembling trained immunity. In this review, we discuss the dual nature of immune memory responses of γδ T cells and provide insights into their important role in protection against bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections in humans and animals.">

        <tr id="The immunological synapse (IS) serves as the fundamental architectural framework for direct interactions and secretory crosstalk between immune cells, as well as between immune cells and other cells. Its dysregulation is thought to be a key underlying cause of immune evasion or inflammation observed in various diseases, including tumors and infections. Numerous recent studies have addressed key signaling mechanisms and reported novel targets related to IS, further broadening our understanding of its function and regulatory factors. However, a comprehensive review that highlights recent progress and consolidates past knowledge is still lacking. In this study, we delineated the pre- and postsynaptic structures constituting the IS between T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages. We also detail the specific signaling mechanisms and pathways that modulate the formation and disassembly of the IS, including cytoskeletal remodeling, membrane reshaping, integrin signaling, and force transduction. Following these experimental findings, we systematically review the central roles of IS in maintaining homeostasis and health and outline various diseases arising from IS disorders. Finally, we thoroughly explore targets and treatments related to IS on the basis of preclinical evidence and clinical trials, with the aim of providing further investigatory and therapeutic insights for researchers and clinicians.">

        <tr id="The effective suppression of inflammation using disease-modifying therapies is essential in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies are commonly used long-term as maintenance therapies, largely due to the lack of reliable biomarkers to guide dosing and evaluate treatment response. However, prolonged use increases the risk of infections and other immune-mediated side effects. The unique ability of brain-derived blood extracellular vesicles (EVs) to cross the blood–brain barrier and reflect the central nervous system (CNS) immune status has sparked interest in their potential as biomarkers. This study aimed to assess whether blood-derived L1CAM+ EVs could serve as biomarkers of treatment response to rituximab (RTX) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Serum samples (n = 25) from the baseline (month 0) and after 6 months were analyzed from the RTX arm of the ongoing randomized clinical trial OVERLORD-MS (comparing anti-CD20 therapies in RRMS patients) and were compared with serum samples from healthy controls (n = 15). Baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the same study cohort were also included. EVs from both serum and CSF samples were characterized, considering morphology, size, and concentration, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The immunophenotyping of EV surface receptors was performed using flow cytometry with the MACSPlex exosome kit, while label-free quantitative proteomics of EV protein cargo was conducted using a proximity extension assay (PEA). TEM confirmed the presence of EVs with the expected round morphology with a diameter of 50–150 nm. NTA showed significantly higher concentrations of L1CAM+ EVs (p < 0.0001) in serum total EVs and EBNA1+ EVs (p < 0.01) in serum L1CAM+ EVs at baseline (untreated) compared to in healthy controls. After six months of RTX therapy, there was a significant reduction in L1CAM+ EV concentration (p < 0.0001) and the downregulation of TNFRSF13B (p = 0.0004; FC = −0.49) in serum total EVs. Additionally, non-significant changes were observed in CD79B and CCL2 levels in serum L1CAM+ EVs at baseline compared to in controls and after six months of RTX therapy. In conclusion, L1CAM+ EVs in serum showed distinct immunological profiles before and after rituximab treatment, underscoring their potential as dynamic biomarkers for individualized anti-CD20 therapy in MS.">

        <tr id="Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are critical components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), playing a pivotal role in tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. This review explores the dual roles of CAFs in regulating tumor cell senescence and cell death, elucidating their mechanisms in inducing cellular senescence, shaping an immunosuppressive milieu, and modulating cell death pathways. CAFs promote tumor progression by secreting pro-inflammatory factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, while also contributing to metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, thereby influencing anti-cancer treatment efficacy. Studies indicate that the heterogeneity and plasticity of CAFs determine their distinct functions across various tumor types. Consequently, precision-targeted therapeutic strategies against CAFs, including the elimination of senescent CAFs, inhibition of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and disruption of CAF-mediated cell death evasion mechanisms, have emerged as promising directions in cancer research. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of CAFs functions and their potential as therapeutic targets, offering valuable insights into the development of novel anti-cancer strategies.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women, with complex mechanisms driving its initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy. In recent years, the tumor microenvironment (TME) has gained attention for its critical role in shaping tumor behavior, where small extracellular vesicles (small EVs) have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication. These vesicles carry a diverse cargo of proteins, lipids, DNA, and various non-coding RNAs—such as miR-21, miR-155, and miR-1246—mirroring the molecular status of their originating cells. This review highlights the roles of small EVs in immune modulation, stromal remodelling, and metastatic niche formation, emphasizing their contribution to therapy resistance and immune evasion. We discuss recent updates on EV biogenesis, characterisation and isolation techniques, such as ultracentrifugation, immunoaffinity and microfluidic systems. We also critically evaluate their potential for clinical application and how well they conform to the MISEV2023 guidelines. Furthermore, we examine small EVs as diagnostic tools in liquid biopsies and compare them with conventional methods such as mammography and tissue biopsies. We also discuss organotropism mediated by small EV cargo (e.g., integrins α6β4, αvβ5) and the diagnostic potential of protein and lipid signatures (e.g., PD-L1, CD63, and exosomal lipidomics). Therapeutically, we explore engineered small EVs for drug delivery, gene modulation, and immune activation, addressing challenges of targeting efficiency, in vivo stability, immunogenicity, and clinical scalability. The review discusses ongoing clinical trials involving small EVs in BC and highlights key translational gaps between preclinical advances and clinical implementation. Finally, we explores how integrating artificial intelligence, single-cell transcriptomics, and multi-omics approaches can help overcome major challenges such as small EV heterogeneity and tracking limitations. Crucially, this integration enables a more tailored understanding of each patient’s tumor biology, reducing therapeutic failures by guiding more personalized and effective treatment strategies. Overall, small EVs represent a transformative tool in precision oncology, contingent on resolving key challenges in their clinical translation.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a critical role in the tumor microenvironment (TME), interacting with cancer cells and other components to promote tumor growth. Given the influence of TAMs on tumor progression and resistance to therapy, regulating the activity of these macrophages is crucial for improving cancer treatment outcomes. TAMs often exhibit immunosuppressive phenotypes (commonly referred to as M2-like macrophages), which suppress immune responses and contribute to drug resistance. Therefore, inhibiting immunosuppressive polarization offers a promising strategy to impede tumor growth. This study revealed retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ), a nuclear receptor, as a key regulator of immunosuppressive polarization in THP-1 macrophages. Indeed, the inhibition of RARγ, either by a small molecule or gene silencing, significantly reduced the expression of immunosuppressive macrophage markers. In a three-dimensional tumor spheroid model, immunosuppressive macrophages enhanced the proliferation of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, which was significantly hindered by RARγ inhibition. These findings suggest that targeting RARγ reprograms immunosuppressive macrophages and mitigates the tumor-promoting effects of TAMs, highlighting RARγ as a promising therapeutic target for developing novel anti-cancer strategies.">

        <tr id="As the diverse functions of neutrophils continue to be uncovered, elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate their differentiation, development, and apoptosis has become crucial for overcoming limitations in the treatment of neutrophil-related diseases. Hematopoietic cell-specific protein 1-associated protein X 1 (HAX1), encoded by the primary pathogenic gene of autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia, serves as a key target for in-depth exploration of neutrophil function. In the Hax1 myeloid knockout C57BL/6J mice and stably transduced HL-60 cells with HAX1 knockdown that we constructed, our results showed that the differentiation of granulocyte-monocyte precursor cells (GMPs) and the maturation of neutrophils were inhibited, significantly reducing the proportion of myeloid cells and neutrophils in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. In addition, HAX1 deletion disrupted mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial membrane potential in neutrophils and increased the protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family members and cleaved Caspase-9. Through RNA sequencing and mRNA validation, we further demonstrated that HAX1 regulates neutrophil apoptosis and maturation via the mitochondrial-mediated classical apoptotic pathway and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated purine-rich box 1 (PU.1) signaling. This study elucidated the critical role of HAX1 in neutrophil differentiation, maturation, and apoptosis, providing new targets for research into neutrophil-related diseases.

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown limited efficacy against solid tumors because of poor tissue penetration, constrained activity, and early exhaustion due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although stimulatory cytokines can counteract immune suppression, their systemic administration entails risk of toxicities and counter-regulatory responses. Here, we leveraged a population of tumor-associated TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs) to release interferon-α (IFN-α) and/or orthogonal interleukin-2 (oIL2) at the tumor site. Targeted cytokine delivery rescued CAR T cell functionality against the clinically relevant tumor antigen B7-homolog 3 (B7-H3) in an orthotopic, CAR T cell-refractory, immunocompetent mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM) named mGB2 that recapitulates pathological features of the human disease. Immunophenotypic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that inhibition of premature terminal exhaustion and induction of effector and memory states featuring activation of signaling pathways and transcriptional networks putatively boosted CAR T cell antitumor activity. Furthermore, IFN-α, especially when combined with private oIL2 signaling to CAR T cells, elicited potent endogenous T cell responses against multiple tumor-associated antigens, leading to delayed GBM growth and prolonged mouse survival even with tumors expressing B7-H3 in only a fraction of cells. These data suggest that the combination of TEM-based cytokine delivery and CAR T cells may have synergistic effects and support the further study of this approach for the treatment of patients with GBM.">

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are a specialised subset of immune cells that remain within tissues, playing a vital role in localised immune defence and long-term immunity. Unlike circulating memory T cells, TRM cells do not recirculate to provide rapid and effective responses against previously encountered pathogens at the tissue level. The formation of TRM cells is driven by tissue-specific cues, guiding their differentiation and retention within organs such as the skin, lungs and gut. They are characterised by the expression of unique markers, including CD69 and CD103, which facilitate their retention and longevity in tissues. TRM cells are essential for immune surveillance, effectively detecting and responding to different infections and contributing to tumour suppression. However, TRM cells are also implicated in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, where persistent activation by resident and autoantigens can lead to tissue damage. This pathogenic role is evident in chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, vitiligo and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where TRM cells may drive persistent localised inflammation and contribute to disease progression and severity. Emerging therapeutic strategies seek to modulate TRM cells to balance their protective and pathogenic roles in these inflammatory diseases. Approaches such as checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine modulation and cell-depletion therapies aim to enhance TRM cells' beneficial immune functions while minimising their role in autoimmunity. A deeper understanding of TRM cell development, maintenance and functional diversity is critical for advancing treatments for infectious diseases, chronic inflammation, autoimmune conditions and cancer.">

Natural Killer (NK) cells, a subset of innate lymphoid cells, have emerged as a promising
avenue in cancer immunotherapy due to their ability to recognize and eliminate malignant and virusinfected
cells without prior antigen sensitization. Unlike T cells, NK cells function independently of
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) restriction, making them effective against tumors that
evade adaptive immune responses. However, several challenges, including limited persistence, poor
tumor infiltration, and immune suppression, hinder their clinical efficacy, particularly in solid tumors.
Recent advancements in NK cell expansion, activation, and genetic engineering have significantly
enhanced their therapeutic potential. Strategies such as cytokine-mediated stimulation, artificial
scaffolds, and CRISPR-based modifications have improved NK cell persistence and cytotoxicity.
Additionally, Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-modified NK cells offer targeted tumor recognition
while minimizing the risk of Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) and Cytokine Release Syndrome
(CRS), making them a safer alternative to CAR-T therapy. Despite these advancements, immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironments and high manufacturing costs remain key obstacles.
Emerging approaches, including metabolic reprogramming, synthetic biology, and combinatorial
therapies integrating checkpoint inhibitors and bispecific antibodies, hold promise for overcoming
these limitations. Furthermore, the development of off-the-shelf, induced Pluripotent Stem Cell
(iPSC)-derived NK therapies is expected to enhance scalability and accessibility. This review highlights
the latest progress in NK cell-based immunotherapy, addressing both current challenges and
future directions in optimizing NK cell expansion, activation, and genetic engineering for clinical
applications.

        <tr id="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and chronic neuroinflammation. While microglia and astrocytes dominate CNS immune responses, emerging evidence implicates peripheral innate immune cells (PIICs)—including neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—as critical modulators of AD pathogenesis. This review synthesizes recent advances linking PIIC-related genetic polymorphisms to AD susceptibility and progression. We highlight how PIICs traffic into the brain via chemokine signaling, where they exhibit stage-specific effects: early recruitment may limit Aβ deposition via phagocytosis, whereas chronic infiltration exacerbates neuroinflammation and neuronal death. Paradoxically, some PIICs exert immunosuppressive effects that could be harnessed therapeutically. We further discuss preclinical strategies to modulate PIIC function, such as CCR2 inhibition, neutrophil depletion, and MDSC adoptive transfer. By bridging peripheral and central immunity, this review unveils PIICs as promising targets for next-generation AD therapies, advocating for precision immunomodulation tailored to disease stages.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune neuroinflammation occurs when an individual’s immune cells attack the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerves. Several Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) proteins have been shown to limit pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in myeloid cells and prevent neuroinflammation. They rely on several mechanisms to accomplish this. Their SH2 domain allows them to bind phosphorylated tyrosine residues on surface receptors to prevent downstream signaling while their C-terminal SOCS domain can promote their assembly with Cullin5 (CUL5) to degrade signaling proteins. To date, the role of CUL5 in myeloid-cell-mediated function is poorly understood. Here we show that loss of Cul5 in myeloid cells resulted in reduced neuroinflammation and attenuated progression of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although peripheral CD4+ T cell activation was not overtly affected, Cul5-deficient macrophages in the Central Nervous System (CNS) demonstrated a significant shift toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, characterized by increased expression of Arginase 1. This correlated with an enhanced frequency of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. In contrast to what would be predicted if CUL5 and SOCS proteins work together to degrade pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, Cul5 deletion in myeloid cells selectively enhanced IL-4-mediated Arginase 1 expression. These findings identify CUL5 as an unanticipated pro-inflammatory mediator during neuroinflammation and reveal its potential as a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Background Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) mediate cancer immune suppression by promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment that inhibits effective anti-tumor immunity. However, they are still a poorly understood, heterogeneous mix of neutrophil subsets. This study aims to determine the Siglec expression profile on several neutrophil subsets and assess their immunosuppressive ability. Methods We identified CD16high and CD16low neutrophil subsets from the low-density fractions of human peripheral blood and compared them to high-density neutrophils. We profiled the expression of the entire family of Siglecs on these three key neutrophil populations under steady-state conditions in healthy subjects as well as cancer patients. Moreover, the ability of these populations, isolated from healthy subjects, to suppress T cell proliferation was assessed. Results Two distinct subpopulations were investigated within the low-density fraction of human peripheral blood (CD15+CD66b+CD16low and CD15+CD66b+CD16high) and compared to high-density neutrophils (CD15+CD66b+CD16high). We found that in addition to CD33 (Siglec-3), Siglec-5/-14, -7, and -9, are differentially expressed on the CD16low and CD16high low-density subsets in both healthy, steady-state subjects, and cancer patients. Upregulated expression of CD33 on the CD16low cells led to the initial speculation that they are MDSCs. As the differential expression of Siglec-9 between these two populations was striking, we used CD16 and Siglec-9 double staining to quantify these populations, which demonstrated that the CD16lowSiglec-9low population is greatly upregulated in cancer patients. The CD16high low-density and high-density neutrophils, but not the CD16low low-density neutrophils from healthy subjects, inhibited T cell proliferation, indicating that the CD16lowSiglec-9low population are not MDSCs. Conclusions These results demonstrate that Siglecs are differentially expressed on neutrophil subsets, and along with CD16, may be used to help further define what is a PMN-MDSC. Consistent with current observations by others, PMN-MDSCs may encompass an array of neutrophil subtypes, including low-density neutrophils, and point to the need for more work to precisely define the genetic signatures of PMN-MDSCs.">

Immunotherapy leverages specific mechanisms of the immune system to improve effector cell-mediated attack of tumors. We engineered SAR-444245 [SAR'245, formerly known as THOR-707] as a not-alpha interleukin-2 (IL-2) designed for increased half-life and selective targeting of CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells while reducing targeting of immune-suppressive CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). The anti-tumoral efficacy of SAR'245 was investigated using the syngeneic CT-26 mouse model characterized by high infiltration with Tregs and responsiveness to programmed cell-death protein-1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitory antibodies. We evaluated SAR'245 pharmacokinetics and peripheral and intra-tumoral pharmacodynamics employing cytometry, histochemistry, RNAseq and secreted cytokine readouts, and in vivo efficacy as single-agent and in combination with an anti-mouse PD-1 antibody. In CT-26 tumor-bearing mice, SAR'245 administration induced peripheral expansion of CD8+ T and NK cells, including T cell memory subpopulations, without significant Treg expansion. SAR'245 stimulated anti-tumor activity that was enhanced in combination with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitory antibody, promoting both long-term survival and rejection of tumor cells on re-challenge. This agent elevated lymphocytic infiltration of tumors and T cell clonal diversity, eliciting multiple intra-tumoral gene signatures reporting on enhanced effector cell activity and persistence in the tumor microenvironment. Overall, we demonstrate that the IL-2 not-alpha agent SAR'245 induces immune responses that promote infiltration of CD8+ T and NK cells with enhanced effector function, leading to durable antitumoral response. These findings suggest SAR'245 potential for the treatment of solid tumors, particularly in combination with inhibitors of PD-1.">

        <tr id="Type II testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most common solid malignancies in young men and are classified into seminomas and non-seminomatous subtypes. Seminomas are known for their highly pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) with abundant immune cell infiltration. While previous work has demonstrated that the seminoma-derived cell line TCam-2 induces immune cell activation in co-culture and undergoes phenotypic changes itself, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. To explore the role of direct cell–cell interaction and the effects mediated by soluble mediators such as cytokines, we conducted co-culture experiments of TCam-2 cells with purified human T cells or monocytes, including Transwell assays and treatments with IL-6, TNFα, or their respective blocking antibodies Tocilizumab and Adalimumab. In this way, we found that immune cell activation, indicated by enhanced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an upregulation of activation markers, strongly depended on direct physical contact between both cell types. Nonetheless, we also unveiled the role of soluble mediators in both immune cell activation and promoting a shift in TCam-2 cells from a seminoma-like phenotype to a more dedifferentiated phenotype, suggesting that cytokines critically shape the TME. These observations highlight the complexity of tumor–immune interactions in the seminoma microenvironment, offering new insight into immune-driven dynamics in TGCTs.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and the most common malignant myeloid disorder in adults. Extensive research has elucidated the broad spectrum of biological mechanisms contributing to the development of AML and specifically characterized a variety of genetic alterations initiating and defining the disease. However, the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AML remains relatively unexplored; indeed, studies on the contribution of inflammatory signaling to disease initiation in myeloid malignancies have only recently gained attention, marking an emerging area of research. AML has the highest incidence in the elderly, where inflammation plays an even greater role. A granular understanding of inflammatory processes driving leukemogenesis thus promises to guide therapeutic strategies for a patient population where outcomes remain dismal. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of the current knowledge on the role of inflammatory signaling in AML pathogenesis. It discusses the role of inflammation from premalignant states through malignant transformation, dissecting phenotypic, correlative studies from mechanistic evidence. We thereby highlight questions requiring further research to exploit the translational potential of therapies targeting inflammatory signaling and to address challenges with current immune‐modulating treatments. A particular focus is placed on assessing the role of inflammation in the interplay with genetic events as established factors in disease initiation and progression to clarify the current understanding of inflammatory signaling in AML pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that limits the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the role of distinct neutrophil subsets within the TME in mediating tumor resistance to immunotherapy remains poorly understood. Here, the present study reveals that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (PLAUR)+ neutrophils are enriched in immunotherapy non-responders and correlate with poor prognosis. Through multi-omics analyses of clinical cohorts and preclinical models, PLAUR+ neutrophils identify as a pivotal driver of immunotherapy resistance by shaping an immunosuppressive TME. Mechanistically, spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA sequencing reveal that PLAUR+ neutrophils orchestrate immune evasion by CD8+ T cell exclusion and macrophage-dependent immune suppression. Through the structure-based virtual screening, a novel PLAUR inhibitor is identified that could reverse the immunosuppressive phenotype of neutrophils. In various in vivo tumor models, PLAUR inhibitor suppresses tumor growth and potentiates the efficacy of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. These results demonstrate that PLAUR+ neutrophils serve as a critical regulator of immunotherapy resistance and targeting PLAUR is a promising strategy to augment the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in HCC.">

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a hematologic malignancy originating from mature B cells, where the tumor microenvironmentparticularly proliferation centers (PCs)plays a pivotal role in disease progression and treatment resistance. PCs support tumor cell survival, proliferation, and therapy resistance through intercellular communication, metabolic reprogramming, and extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated signaling. This study investigates the mechanisms by which the CLL microenvironment, especially PCs, contributes to drug resistance and disease evolution, with a particular focus on EVs and metabolic remodeling. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to synthesize current findings in this domain.. Key findings reveal that PCs mediate resistance through multiple interconnected mechanisms, including: (1) the CXCL12/CXCR4 retention axis; (2) CD40-CD40L-induced activation of the alternative NF-B pathway; (3) metabolic reprogramming favoring anti-apoptotic profiles; and (4) EV-mediated communication that alters stromal cell behavior. CLL-derived EVs play a critical role in reshaping the bone marrow microenvironment by transferring miRNAs and proteins that alter stromal cell function and metabolism. Additionally, this study identifies a dual metabolic shift in CLL cells, characterized by the simultaneous enhancement of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which is closely linked to microenvironmental dependency. Furthermore, the research uncovers metabolic regionalization within PCs and spatiotemporal heterogeneity in EV distribution.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) are major immune components of the tumor microenvironment, promoting tumor growth and limiting the efficacy of chemotherapy in almost all cancer indications. While Tregs are well known for their immune suppressive activity toward the adaptive immune system, less is known about their regulatory activity toward the innate compartment. We showed in human and mouse lung cancer, that chemotherapy transiently reduced Treg number and switched the mononuclear phagocyte (MP) landscape toward a pro-inflammatory signature but also an increased TGFβ-expressing TAM accumulation over time. Preventing Treg recovery further increased the recruitment of monocytes and limited TGFβ expression upon TAM differentiation, demonstrating that Tregs dampen the pro-inflammatory status of the MP compartment induced by chemotherapy and promote tumor relapse. Anti-TNFR2 antibody treatment during the Treg recovery phase affected the direct interaction between Tregs and MPs, increased the pro-inflammatory signature of the MPs and improved survival in the mouse model. Targeting the crosstalk between tumor-associated Tregs and the MP compartment limits the reconstitution of an anti-inflammatory environment following chemotherapy and improves therapeutic outcome.">

        <tr id="Abstract While immune-modulating therapies which enhance antitumor T cell function have revolutionized cancer therapy, including for patients with brain metastases, the antigen specificity of intratumoral T cells remains poorly characterized. We performed droplet-based 5’ single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to characterize the transcriptional profile and clonal repertoire of tumor-infiltrating T cells in resected tumors from patients with previously untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases (n=6). We identified a population of clonally-expanded, CXCL13+CD8+ T cells enriched for transcriptional signatures predictive of tumor reactivity. Using a high-throughput T cell antigen identification method developed by our group, we screened 164 TCRs from clonally-expanded and/or CXCL13+CD8+ T cells against 2,289 putative neoantigens in addition to 146 tumor-associated antigens. In total, we identified reactivities for 21% (n=35) of the TCRs screened. Consistent with recent studies, we observed that the transcriptional state of the T cell was more predictive of tumor reactivity than the degree of clonal expansion. Of TCR specificities identified, 25.7% (n=9) of TCRs were reactive to neoantigens derived from somatic single-nucleotide variants specific to each patient (private antigen). Intriguingly, 54.3% (n=19) of the TCRs were reactive to unmutated peptides expressed by many patients’ lung tumors (public antigens). In summary, we present a deep characterization of the antigenic reactivities of intratumoral T cells in NSCLC brain metastases. Our data are consistent with an emerging body of literature that has theorized that “missing reactivities” from neoantigen-centric studies arise from complex mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic dysregulation within tumors. Further characterization of these “public antigens” may provide the basis for novel antigen-directed T cell therapies.">

        <tr id="The transformation of myeloid leukemia blasts into leukemia‑derived dendritic cells (DCleu) is a notable phenomenon. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in modulating physiological and pathological activities, particularly in immune activation. In the present study, EVs were isolated from DC/DCleu culture supernatants derived from healthy (H) donors (n=9) and patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=9) using whole blood (WB) samples, both with and without Kit M (granulocyte‑macrophage colony‑stimulating factor and prostaglandin E1). This was followed by T‑cell enriched mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) with Kit M‑treated and untreated WB. To assess the qualitative and quantitative differences in EVs between Kit M‑treated and untreated samples, transmission electron microscopy, fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis and multiplex bead‑based flow cytometry were employed. The present findings indicate that DC/MLC supernatant‑derived EVs can be successfully identified, quantified and characterized. Furthermore, these EVs exhibit regulatory properties in both H and AML samples. Results showed that a higher number of CD8+ EVs were detected after DC culture compared with before in both H and AML samples. Thrombocyte‑associated EVs (CD41b+, CD42a+ and CD62P+) significantly increased following DC culture in both groups. While low frequencies of progenitor/blast marker (CD133+) associated EVs were detected in H samples before and after DC culture, their frequencies increased after DC culture in AML samples. Additionally, a higher number of CD8+ and CD2+ EVs were observed after MLC culture compared with before in both H and AML samples. Correlation analyses revealed that improved blast lysis in Kit M‑pretreated samples (normalized to control) associated with the presence of EV subtypes associated with T (CD2+), B (CD20+, 24+), and other cell markers (for example, CD31+, CD146+, CD44+ and CD49e+). This comprehensive approach provides insights into the impact of Kit M on DC/DCleu generation and the subsequent activation of immune cells, leading to differences in EV production between H and AML samples.">

        <tr id="Background CNS stromal cells, especially fibroblasts and endothelial cells, support leukocyte accumulation through upregulation of adhesion molecules and lymphoid chemokines. While chronically activated fibroblast networks can drive pathogenic immune cell aggregates known as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), early stromal cell activation during CNS infection can support anti-viral T cells. However, the cell types and factors driving early stromal cell activation is poorly explored. Aims A neurotropic murine coronavirus (mCoV) infection model was used to better characterize signals that promote fibroblast networks supporting accumulation of antiviral lymphocytes. Based on the early appearance of IgD+ B cells with unknown functions during several CNS infections, we probed their potential to activate stromal cells through lymphotoxin β (LTβ), a molecule critical in maintaining fibroblast-networks in lymphoid tissues as well as promoting TLS in autoimmunity and cancers. Results Kinetic analysis of stromal cell activation in olfactory bulbs and brains revealed that upregulation of adhesion molecules and lymphoid chemokines Ccl19, Ccl21 and Cxcl13 closely tracked viral replication. Immunohistochemistry revealed that upregulation of the fibroblast marker podoplanin (PDPN) at meningeal and perivascular sites mirrored kinetics of RNA expression. Moreover, both B cells and T cells colocalized to areas of PDPN reactivity, supporting a potential role in regulating stromal cell activation. However, specific depletion of LTβ from B cells using Mb1-creERT2 x Ltβfl/fl mice had no effect on T or B cell recruitment or viral replication. B cell depletion by anti-CD20 antibody also had no adverse effects. Surprisingly, LTβR agonism reduced viral control and parenchymal T cell localization despite increasing stromal cell lymphoid chemokines and PDPN. Additional assessment of direct stromal cell activation by the viral RNA mimic poly I:C showed induction of Pdpn and Ccl19 preceding Ltb. Conclusions Neither B cell-derived LTβ or B cells are primary drivers of stromal cell activation networks in the CNS following mCoV infection. Although supplementary agonist mediated LTβR engagement confirmed a role for LTβ in enhancing PDPN and lymphoid chemokine expression, it impeded T cell migration to the CNS parenchyma and viral control. Our data overall indicate that stromal cells can integrate LTβR signals to tune their activation, but that LTβ is not necessarily essential and can even dysregulate protective antiviral T cell functions.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and intrinsic resistance to conventional therapies. Radiotherapy (RT), traditionally valued for its cytotoxic effects, has recently been recognized for its immunomodulatory potential. This mini-review explores the multifaceted interactions between RT and the PDAC immune microenvironment, highlighting mechanisms such as induction of immunogenic cell death, enhancement of antigen presentation, modulation of cytokine and chemokine profiles, and upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules. These effects may transform immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot” ones, providing a rationale for combination strategies with immunotherapy. However, the dense desmoplastic stroma, abundance of regulatory T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells within PDAC present substantial challenges that hinder effective immune activation. Advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomic technologies offer new opportunities to better characterize the TME and guide personalized treatment strategies. By synthesizing mechanistic insights and clinical evidence, this review underscores the potential of integrating RT with immunotherapy to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve therapeutic outcomes in PDAC.">

        <tr id="This study employed single-cell sequencing to analyze immune dynamics in pediatric infectious mononucleosis (IM), focusing on EBV-host interactions. EBV primarily infected B-cell subsets, showing distinct tropism from EBV-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, indicating stage-specific infection patterns. Coexpression of lytic (BALF3/5) and latent (EBNA-3A, LMP-2A) genes suggested dynamic infection states. Notably, RPMS1 expression was consistently detected in IM patients, where this oncogenic regulator influences viral latency maintenance and cellular transformation through Notch signaling. NK cell subsets exhibited differential responses: CD16 + CD56dim NK cells demonstrated enhanced EBV cytotoxicity, while CD16 - CD56bright NK cells showed immunoregulatory potential. Clonal expansion of IGHV4-34/59 in B cells (involved in EBV gp350 binding and autoimmunity) suggested dual roles in viral neutralization and pathogenesis. Frequent IGHJ4/IGLJ3 BCR rearrangements informed vaccine design. Elevated COTL1 in T cells correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokine release, indicating therapeutic potential. Dysregulated IRF4/PRDM1 in plasma cells reflected interindividual EBV control variability. These findings delineate IM immunopathology, linking EBV persistence to clonal expansion and immune evasion, while providing a framework for targeted therapies (NK cell engineering, IGHV4-directed antibodies, COTL1 modulation) to advance EBV-associated disease treatment.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, a key component of the innate immune system, have emerged as significant players in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer. Traditionally recognized for their role in defending against infections, neutrophils in cancer contribute to both tumor progression and suppression, depending on their activation state and the signals they receive. Neutrophil-driven inflammation within the TME is critical in promoting tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. This review explores the complex role of neutrophils in breast cancer, emphasizing the mechanisms through which they influence tumor inflammation, including their interactions with other immune cells and the signaling pathways involved. Neutrophils can either support tumor progression by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, and reactive oxygen species, or contribute to antitumor responses by directly killing cancer cells and stimulating adaptive immunity. The balance between these opposing functions is heavily influenced by the TME’s cytokine milieu and neutrophil polarization. Key signaling pathways, such as the CXCR2-CXCL8 axis and interactions with tumor-associated macrophages, regulate neutrophil recruitment and activation in the TME, enhancing inflammation and tumorigenesis. Additionally, neutrophils’ ability to form neutrophil extracellular traps further complicates their role, potentially promoting metastasis by trapping circulating tumor cells.">

        <tr id="Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are initially efficacious against anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene-positive lung adenocarcinoma (ALK+ LUAD), but acquired resistance inevitably occurs. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies are needed for TKI-resistant cases. Although the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has improved the prognosis of patients with lung cancer, patients with ALK+ LUAD exhibit little or no response to immunotherapy and the underlying resistance mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we explored the immunological status of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in ALK+ LUAD tissues. Tumor-infiltrating leukocyte analysis revealed reduced numbers of effector T cells and increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) relative to ALK- LUAD cases, indicating that ALK+ LUAD has a myeloid cell-dominant immunosuppressive TME. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis identified a subset of macrophages that expressed most T cell-attractant chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), and the macrophages were inactivated in ALK+ LUAD. In contrast, ALK+ LUAD expressed high levels of MDSC-attractant chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL8). In addition, ALK+ LUAD showed higher levels of IL-6, an MDSC-inducing cytokine, than ALK- LUAD. An IL-6R inhibitor transformed the TME in a murine ALK+ LUAD model, shifting it from an immunosuppressive to a T cell-dominant status. Although ICI monotherapy lacked antitumor effects, a combination of ICI and the IL-6R inhibitor had significant antitumor effects in mice. Our findings illustrate the molecular basis of fusion gene-mediated immunosuppressive TMEs, providing a rationale for a novel combination immunotherapy for ALK+ LUAD.">

        <tr id="Introduction T cells are major components of the immune system. Their activation requires interaction between the T cell receptor and co-stimulatory molecules, crucial during infection, inflammation, and allogeneic rejection. Monomeric CRP (mCRP) is a known modulator of inflammation and particularly the innate immune response, however its interaction with T cells as part of the adaptive immune response remains unclear. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and T cells were isolated. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted to evaluate Fcγ receptor CD16 expression on T cells, the binding of CRP to T cells, and its impact on proliferation and apoptosis. T cell activation was assessed after 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days by assessing CD69 and CD25 expression, and under various conditions including coculture with monocytes and several inhibitory factors. Results T cells express CD16 that binds mCRP in a concentration-dependent manner, and particularly on activated T cells. While mCRP reduces apoptosis and accelerates proliferation in T cells, it does not independently activate them. However, activation of monocytes by mCRP leads to T cell activation, indicating a direct cell to cell interaction during CRP-induced activation. This effect could be alleviated by inhibition of the CD80/CD28 pathway. Conclusion CRP does not activate T Cells directly but via PI3-kinase-dependent activation of monocytes and subsequent CD80/CD28 cell to cell contact. The findings suggest the effects of CRP on T cells depend on their environment and the presence of other proinflammatory agents.">

        <tr id="Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by cartilage damage and bone erosion. Current pharmacological treatments often fail to repair damaged tissues and may cause severe immune-related side effects. Moreover, some patients exhibit inadequate responses to existing therapies. This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles (EV) derived from immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) overexpressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA4Ig) (CT-EV) compared with iMSC-derived EVs (ASC-EV). Methods Following EV characterization and in vitro functional assessments, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model mice (n = 10/group) were treated with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS, 150 µL, twice weekly; Group C), ASC-EV (derived from the culture supernatant of 2 × 106 iMSCs/150 µL of dPBS, twice weekly; Group E), CT-EV (derived from the culture supernatant of 2 × 106 CTLA4Ig-overexpressing iMSCs/150 µL of dPBS, twice weekly; Group CT), or methotrexate (3 mg/kg, three times per week; Group M). A normal control group received dPBS (150 µL, twice weekly; Group N). Results CT-EV showed a significant increase in EV quantity and the production of CTLA4, transforming growth factor β1, and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist compared with ASC-EV. In mitogen-stimulated immune cells from CIA mice, CT-EV significantly reduced IL-6, IL-10, and Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Presumably Secreted (RANTES) levels. Administration of both ASC-EV and CT-EV led to a decrease in macrophage proportions and an increase in T helper type 2 cells and serum IL-4 levels. Furthermore, CT-EV treatment resulted in additional reductions in anti-CII antibody levels, C-telopeptide II concentrations, and the proportion of CD138⁺ cells, thereby contributing to cartilage protection. Conclusions CT-EV demonstrated superior therapeutic effects compared with ASC-EV in the CIA model, highlighting its potential as an effective treatment strategy for RA.

        <tr id="VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is an autoinflammatory disorder caused by acquired somatic UBA1 mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, affecting peripheral myeloid and natural killer (NK) cells. Given the high rate of severe infections observed in VEXAS patients, we hypothesized that NK cell dysfunction contributes to this increased susceptibility. We conducted a comprehensive immune characterization of peripheral NK cells in patients with VEXAS (n=40), patients with autoinflammatory diseases without UBA1 mutations (n=22), and elderly gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n=16). Multiparameter phenotyping was performed using CyTOF, scRNAseq, whole blood stimulation assays and in vitro NK cell cytotoxic assay. Peripheral NK cells in VEXAS were quantitatively and qualitatively impaired. Mass cytometry revealed reduced frequencies of mature cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells and an expansion of the CD56high CD16dim subset. NK cells exhibited features of exhaustion, including increased PD-1 expression, and reduced levels of cytotoxic markers such as NKp46 and CD8α. scRNAseq analysis showed decreased signatures of cytotoxicity and IL-2 and IFN-γ production, alongside increased inflammatory signatures. Whole blood stimulation assays confirmed impaired IL-2, IFN-γ, and granzyme B production following TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7/TLR8 agonist stimulation. Extended NK phenotyping by flow cytometry confirmed reduced activating receptors' expression and impaired IFN-γ production in VEXAS. Moreover, in vitro UBA1 inhibitors impaired NK cell cytotoxic capacity and promote cell death. Finally, reduced NK cell frequencies were independently associated with an increased risk of severe infections. These findings suggest that NK cell dysfunction in VEXAS syndrome contributes to increased susceptibility to severe infections.">

        <tr id="Aim The primary goal of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate role that VEGF plays in creating an immunologically tolerant milieu in cases of OSCC or oral squamous cell carcinoma. Examining how VEGF affects the behavior and functionality of dendritic cells (DCs). Through an examination of the interactions among VEGF, DCs, and the tumor microenvironment. Methods This study investigated the expression of the immunosuppressive markers IDO and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in DCs under the effect of VEGF employing real-time PCR (RT-PCR), flow cytometry and Western blot (WB). Additionally, mixed lymphocyte reactions and tumor cell cytotoxicity assays were conducted to assess functional changes in DCs. Results VEGF exposure led to an upregulation of IDO and PD-L1 in DCs, coupled with reduced T-cell proliferation and altered immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. In vivo studies using mice models further substantiated the role of VEGF in enhancing tumor immune tolerance. Conclusion Our findings elucidate the crucial role of VEGF in OSCC progression by modulating DC function, offering new insights into potential immunotherapeutic strategies targeting VEGF-mediated pathways.

        <tr id="Human papillomavirus-mediated recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a premalignant neoplasia of the upper airway characterized by significant dysphonia and respiratory obstruction. Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a potential alternative to repeated surgical interventions in RRP. Here, we investigated the intralesional T-cell composition and expression of the immune checkpoints programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) in RRP. We analyzed tissue samples from 30 patients treated at a tertiary care center between 2009 and 2021, including paired samples from individual patients collected at different time points. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for CD4, CD8, CTLA-4, FoxP3, and PD-L1 and correlated with disease severity and previous adjuvant therapies. Overall disease burden and intervention-free survival were not associated with the abundance of CD4+, CD8+, or FoxP3+ T cells, nor with immune checkpoint expression. However, patients with aggressive disease exhibited a higher intralesional FoxP3/CD4 T-cell ratio. Prior intralesional cidofovir treatment was associated with reduced CD4+ T-cell infiltration. These findings suggest that a locally immunosuppressive microenvironment, reflected by an elevated FoxP3/CD4 ratio, contributes to disease severity in RRP. Consistent CTLA-4 expression across all evaluated samples supports further investigation of anti-CTLA-4 therapy, either alone or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Since the lung is a mucosal barrier organ with a unique immunologic environment, mechanisms of immunoregulation in lung cancer may differ from those of other malignancies. Consistent with this notion, we found that CD8+ T cells play a paradoxical role in facilitating, rather than ameliorating, the growth of multiple lung adenocarcinoma models. These include spontaneous, carcinogen-induced, and transplantable tumor cell line models. Specifically, we found that CD8+ T cells promote homing of CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells to the tumor bed by increasing levels of CCR5 chemokines in the tumor microenvironment in an IFN-γ and TNF-α dependent manner. Contrary to their canonical role, these Th1 cytokines contributed to accelerated growth of murine lung adenocarcinomas while suppressing the growth of other malignancies. Surprisingly, lung cancer cells themselves can serve as a dominant source of IFN-γ, and deletion of this cytokine from cancer cells using CRISPR/Cas-9 decreases tumor growth. Importantly for translational applications, a high level of IFN-γ was also found in human lung cancer patients at both the mRNA and protein level. Our data outlines what we deem a novel and previously undefined lung cancer specific immunoregulatory pathway that may be harnessed to tailor immune based therapy specifically for this malignancy.">

However, the intricate mechanisms governing IgA class-switch recombination and its dysregulation in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease remain a significant challenge in the field. Our study delves into the significance of IgA regulation in mucosal immunity, focusing on the N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) in NIK mRNA by NAT10 in B cells. We discovered that NAT10-mediated ac4C stabilizes NIK mRNA, thereby promoting IgA production, which is pivotal for immune defense. Our findings in a B-cell conditional NAT10 knockout mouse model highlight a reduction in IgA expression and a dampened noncanonical NF-κB pathway, suggesting NAT10 as a potential therapeutic target for IgA-related disorders. This research provides novel insights into the post-transcriptional regulation of IgA and underscores the role of NAT10 in modulating mucosal immunity.">

Therefore, TIM3 has been suggested as a potential target for AML treatment. Hence, we explored the feasibility of targeting TIM3 with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T‐cells. Despite the expression of TIM3 on activated T‐cells, TIM3 CAR T‐cells were successfully generated from different healthy individuals with excellent in vitro expansion without signs of fratricide and sustained central‐memory phenotype with minimal expression of exhaustion‐related markers, including complete loss of TIM3 expression. TIM3 loss also did not affect effector functions since TIM3 CAR T‐cells efficiently lysed TIM3+ leukemic cell lines, produced Th1‐predominant cytokines, successfully inhibited the colony‐forming of TIM3+ AML‐derived LSPCs, and showed excellent AML tumor control in xenogeneic mouse models. Notably, TIM3 CAR T‐cells did not affect healthy hematopoietic progenitor cells and healthy mature hematopoietic cells that express TIM3 at moderate levels, suggesting an optimal therapeutic window for the treatment of AML.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive hematological malignancy, is driven by oncogenic mutations in stem and progenitor cells that give rise to AML blasts. While these mutations are well-characterized, their impact on healthy hematopoiesis-those blood cells exposed to AML but not mutated-has not been well-characterized. As the marrow is the major site for granulopoiesis, neutrophils are heavily influenced by AML pathobiology. Indeed, most AML patients report neutropenia, rendering them susceptible to infections. However, since AML studies use peripheral blood mononuclear cells devoid of neutrophils, the characterization of neutrophil dysfunction remains poorly understood. To investigate AML-exposed neutrophils, a pre-clinical AML mouse model was used where primary leukemic cells were transplanted into non-irradiated neutrophil reporter (Ly6G-tdTomato; Catchup) hosts. Neutrophils could not completely mature, suggesting impaired granulopoiesis. Single-cell transcriptomics of AML-exposed neutrophils revealed higher inflammation signatures and expression of CD14, an inflammatory marker. To address the factors contributing to this biology, an ex vivo cytokine screen was performed on marrow neutrophils and identified that NFκB signaling drove CD14 expression. AML-exposed neutrophils displayed widespread chromatin remodeling, and de novo motif discovery predicted increased binding sites for CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) and Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Moreover, AML-exposed neutrophils inhibited T-cell proliferation, highlighting their immune-suppressive capability. Finally, similar biology of immature, inflammatory neutrophils was found in AML patients, again indicating dysregulated granulopoiesis. Collectively, these data show that AML-associated inflammation alters neutrophil granulopoiesis, impairs neutrophil function, and drives immunosuppression, thus contributing to patient susceptibility to infection.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Colon cancer is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with significant global incidence and mortality. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in disease progression and treatment response. Among key components of the TME are tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs) and effector T cells, whose balance influences cancer outcomes.


METHODS
This review analyzes recent findings regarding the role of Treg cells in colon cancer progression by evaluating preclinical and clinical studies that explore immune cell composition, function, and modulation within the TME.


RESULTS
Treg cells demonstrate a dual role in colon cancer. While they suppress effective anti-tumor immune responses, facilitating immune evasion, they may also mitigate chronic inflammation, which contributes to carcinogenesis. High intratumoral Treg levels are correlated with poor prognosis, reduced immunotherapy efficacy, and lower overall survival. Strategies to deplete or reprogram Tregs, such as immune checkpoint inhibition, modulation of T cell plasticity, and selective targeting, have shown promise in enhancing anti-tumor immunity.


DISCUSSION
Complete depletion of Tregs risks inducing autoimmune toxicity. Therefore, a precise understanding of Treg cell subsets and functions is essential. This review highlights the importance of developing targeted immunotherapeutic strategies that modulate Treg activity while preserving immune homeostasis in colon cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, plays a pivotal and multifaceted role in tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance by transducing extracellular mechanical stimuli—such as matrix stiffness and fluid shear stress—into intracellular calcium influx. In tumor cells, Piezo1 promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by activating oncogenic signaling and contributes to an immunosuppressive TME through regulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. In the immune compartment, Piezo1 integrates mechanical cues with metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming to orchestrate the functions of T cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells. Notably, Piezo1 deficiency impairs TH9 cell differentiation, diminishes T cell cytotoxicity, and enhances the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, Piezo1 expression correlates with distinct tumor immune phenotypes, such as “cold tumors,” and with responses to immunotherapy, making it a promising predictive biomarker for treatment efficacy. Given its dual regulatory roles in tumor biology and immune modulation, targeting Piezo1—such as through combination with programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade—offers a potential strategy to reverse immunosuppression and enhance antitumor immunity. This review summarizes emerging insights into Piezo1’s role in cancer progression and immune regulation and highlights its translational potential as a novel target in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Acute myocarditis (AM), particularly fulminant myocarditis (FM), is an infrequent but life-threatening cardiac inflammation, with limited effective precision-targeted treatments available. This urgent clinical challenge has prompted further investigations into the mechanisms underlying this pathology to develop novel therapeutic approaches.


METHODS
We enrolled 40 patients diagnosed with AM (24 mild, 16 fulminant) between December 2022 and November 2023. Using a multi-omics approach, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma-integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing, cytometry by time of flight, and Olink proteomics to identify specific pathogenic immune subsets and molecular alterations. In vitro experiments validated the function and inducing signals of identified pathogenic subsets. In coxsackievirus B3-induced FM mice, cytometry by time of flight analysis was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cardiac infiltrating immune cells. Pharmacological blockade of key molecular was tested to assess potential therapeutic efficacy.


RESULTS
We identified that a specialized type of CD8+ effector T cells, CD57+CD8+ T cells with high cytotoxicity and migration potential, were significantly enriched and exhibited large clonal expansion in AM. Differential expression analysis revealed upregulation of natural killer-like receptor genes in CD57+CD8+ effector T cells from FM compared with mild cases, which was positively associated with enhanced cytotoxicity and migration potential. In vitro experiments confirmed the existence of circulating CD57+CD8+ effector T cells with high cytotoxic degranulation and migration potential inducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis, supporting their cardiac migration and cardiomyocyte cytotoxicity in pathogenesis. Elevated circulating interleukin (IL)-18 levels in patients with AM induced the functional differentiation of CD57+CD8+ effector T cells. In addition, increased proinflammatory CXCL8+CD14+ monocytes potentially contributed to increasing IL-18 levels and crosstalk with CD57+CD8+ effector T cells. In FM mice, we observed the analogous expansions of CD57+CD8+ effector T cells and CXCL2+LY6C+ monocytes in both blood and hearts, accompanied by elevated plasma IL-18 levels. Disrupting the pathogenic axis involving proinflammatory monocytes, IL-18 signaling, and CCR5-mediated cardiac recruitment significantly alleviated FM in mice.


CONCLUSIONS
Our study provides a comprehensive immune landscape for understanding the pathogenesis of AM, especially in FM, highlighting clonal CD57+CD8+ effector T cells with high cytotoxicity and migration potential, along with their upstream inflammatory signals, as potential therapeutic targets for mitigating immune-related cardiac damage in AM management, especially in FM.">

Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are widely used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reactivation being a significant unresolved issue. The pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. Integrated transcriptomic analysis could provide insights into monitoring tuberculosis progression after TNFi therapy and help reduce LTBI reactivation.


METHODS
We selected six transcriptomic datasets from studies related to TNFi treatment and tuberculosis. Pathway enrichment, pseudotime, and transcription factor analyses were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms.


RESULTS
Our analysis revealed distinct transcriptional changes in memory B cells during tuberculosis progression and TNFi therapy. In active tuberculosis (ATB), ROR1+ memory B cells were identified in a noncanonical differentiation trajectory, characterized by downregulation of B cell-related genes (e.g., CD22, EBF1, MS4A1), reduced translational capacity, and suppression of immune response pathways, accompanied by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, which highlighted metabolic alterations during tuberculosis progression. A similar subtype also emerged in TNFi-treated patients, suggesting that metabolic reprogramming of memory B cells may disrupt immune balance, thereby contributing to LTBI reactivation and ATB development following TNFi therapy.


CONCLUSIONS
The study integrates bioinformatics and single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the role of memory B cells in ATB progression and TNFi treatment, offering insights into TNFi-associated TB susceptibility and potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Background Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a highly aggressive subtype of lymphoma characterized by a poor prognosis. While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has emerged as an effective treatment modality for various cancers, its efficacy among individuals is inconsistent and remains suboptimal for the majority of NKTCL patients. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, recognized as a next-generation probiotic with immunomodulatory capabilities, has not yet been fully explored for its potential to influence the outcomes of ICB therapy. Methods We established syngeneic tumor-bearing mouse models of NKTCL and treated the mice with an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and F. prausnitzii. Metabolomics analysis was performed to quantify butyrate concentrations in fecal, plasma, and tumor samples from the mice. Furthermore, we used flow cytometry, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to assess the effects of butyrate supplementation on antitumor immune responses in mice receiving anti-PD-L1 therapy. Additionally, an antibiotic-pretreated mouse model was utilized to further investigate the influence of F. prausnitzii on the efficacy of ICB therapy. Results The combination of F. prausnitzii and an anti-PD-L1 mAb effectively inhibited tumor growth, primarily through the action of its metabolite butyrate. Notably, F. prausnitzii-derived butyrate played a crucial role in enhancing the efficacy of ICB therapy by augmenting antitumor immune responses, as evidenced by reduced PD-L1 expression and increased levels of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, prior administration of antibiotics significantly compromised the efficacy of the anti-PD-L1 mAb. However, supplementation with F. prausnitzii mitigated the negative effects of antibiotics and restored the altered gut microbiota in tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of F. prausnitzii in augmenting ICB therapy and presents a novel gut probiotic-centered therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NKTCL.

        <tr id="Immune evasion and suppression lead to unchecked tumor growth in glioblastoma. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been implicated in tumor progression and modulation in glioblastoma. To investigate this potential connection, CMV-associated changes in the glioblastoma immune landscape were characterized in vitro and in a murine glioblastoma model. Infection of mouse glioblastoma cells (GL261Luc2) with mCMV resulted in a short period of viral replication. MHC-I cell surface expression was reduced after mCMV infection by approximately 40% compared with non-infected tumor cells (p < 0.0001). Viral regulators of antigen presentation (vRAP) were shown to be responsible for MHC-I downregulation using a recombinant mCMV (ΔvRAP) lacking the known immune evasion genes. RNA sequencing of mCMV infected GL261Luc cells revealed 2711 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.005). Of particular interest was the downregulation of MHC-I-associated genes H2-Q1-10 and Tap1 fter CMV infection. In vivo, the mCMV immediate early gene (IE1) was detected in brains of mCMV + animals after tumor implantation and increased during tumor growth. mCMV + mice had significantly shorter survival than controls, depending on initial tumor size (P < 0.001). Tumor immune infiltrates in mCMV infection were characterized by B cell infiltrates and low levels of NK cell infiltration. Here, the landscape of immune cell infiltrates is shifted toward B cell infiltration and reduced numbers of NK cells. CMV leads to immune evasion mediated MHC-I downregulation in murine glioblastoma. Thus, CMV infection in glioblastoma may contribute to unchecked tumor growth in glioblastoma by increasing immune evasion.

Apart from providing structural support, they are emerging as key orchestrators of both activation and repression of immune responses in tissue microenvironment. The underlying mechanisms by which stromal cells contribute to immunomodulation are multifaceted, in which the chemokine-mediated interactions with immune cells have drawn great attention. The distinct stromal cell subpopulations can change the chemokine secretion profiles to regulate the recruitment and activation of immune cells in the onset and progression of inflammation. Elucidation of the mechanisms of the homeostatic and pathogenic stromal-immune cell interactions via chemokines can assist in the identification of novel therapeutic targets for modulating inflammatory diseases and enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, the current review highlights the updated understanding of the stromal-immune interactions via chemokines in inflammation, as well as potential therapeutic avenues to target at the intercellular crosstalk for inflammatory disorders and cancer.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) involves liver inflammation and fibrosis. Monocytes, key immune cells differentiating into macrophages and dendritic cells, are understudied in NASH using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).


METHODS
Liver nonparenchymal cells from NASH and control mice underwent scRNA-seq to identify monocyte subsets and transcriptional profiles. Findings were validated via transfection, coculture, immunofluorescence, and qPCR.


RESULTS
scRNA-seq analysis revealed that Ly6chi monocytes in Cluster 0 appeared to be converted into macrophages in the liver, potentially contributing to the progression of NASH inflammation. Similarly, Ly6clo monocytes in Cluster 1 seemed to differentiate into dendritic cells, possibly mediating T-cell immune responses in NASH. Notably, Sdc4 was uniquely abundant in Cluster 0. Sdc4+ monocytes were elevated in NASH patients and mice versus controls. Under lipotoxic conditions, Sdc4-deficient (sh-Sdc4) monocytes exhibited upregulated expression of CD206 (an M2 marker) and IL-10. When cocultured with sh-Sdc4 monocytes under palmitic acid stimulation, HepG2 cells accumulated fewer lipid droplets and produced less TNF-α protein, along with increased IL-10 genes, compared to controls.


CONCLUSION
Our study elucidates the heterogeneity and functional transformation of two major monocyte subsets in NASH. We foundSdc4+ monocytes may exacerbate NASH through pro-inflammatory mechanisms.">

Patients with short telomeres also develop immunodeficiency with low CD4+ T cells and impaired general immunosurveillance, particularly against solid neoplasms. We investigated a broad spectrum of lymphocyte subsets and myeloid immune cells from human patients with telomere biology disorders (TBDs) and matched healthy volunteers to understand further how the immune system is affected by telomere dysfunction. We employed mass cytometry (CyTOF) for deep-immunophenotyping peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), followed by high-dimensional data analysis. Cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were assessed in serum. Our results showed profound immune alterations in TBD beyond those observed in aging, with low naïve lymphocytes and thymic hypofunction. We further observed that T helper subsets were markedly skewed, with an inverted TH2/TH1 ratio and low TH17 and TH17.1 levels. T cell activation and exhaustion markers were upregulated, whereas circulating mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells were significantly decreased and overactivated. Several serum cytokine levels were positively correlated with telomere length and blood counts, suggesting an association with marrow function. In aggregate, these findings suggest a pro-inflammatory profile in TBDs. Our data provide new details on how TBD affects immune cells, particularly lymphocytes, which may contribute to the clinical phenotypes.">

        <tr id="Age-related conditions, such as neurodegenerative disease, cancer, and autoimmune disorders, are increasingly recognized as closely linked with the gradual deterioration of the immune system. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a small, specialized subset of T lymphocytes that play a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis and self-tolerance. As individuals age, Treg cells demonstrate reduced capacity to suppress some autoreactive immune responses, although they largely retain their capacity to regulate effector antiviral and antitumor immunity. Unlike conventional effector T cells (Teff), which primarily derive energy from glycolysis, Tregs rely more on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to fulfill their energy requirements. This metabolic profile renders them particularly sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction, underpinning the critical role of mitochondrial protective pathways in preserving the functional integrity of Treg cells. The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mitoUPR) is gaining special relevance among these protective mechanisms. In this review, we examine the complex interplay between immune aging and mitochondrial dynamics, with particular emphasis on the essential role of mitoUPR in supporting Treg function. We further discuss how targeting mitochondrial stress responses may offer novel therapeutic avenues for age-related diseases characterized by Treg dysfunction.">

        <tr id="Macrophages expressing Trem2 play a pivotal role in promoting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, MASH) progression to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite the widespread clinical use of anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade, its therapeutic efficacy in NASH-driven HCC remains suboptimal. This study investigates the mechanisms by which NAM Trem2 influences the response of NASH-driven HCC to immunotherapy. Clinical analysis revealed that elevated Trem2 expression in NASH is positively correlated with accumulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) and infiltration of PD1+Eomes+CD8+ T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Myeloid-specific knockout of Trem2 (Trem2Δmye) led to impaired macrophage reprogramming, resulting in the accumulation of pro-inflammatory Ly6ChiCX3CR1lo macrophages, which enhanced degradation of NETs in NASH. Trem2Δmye also disrupted TGF-β production via P-Syk-dependent efferocytosis, collectively suppressing the differentiation of PD1+Eomes+CD8+ T cells and Tregs. The efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in inhibiting NASH-driven HCC progression was also significantly enhanced by Trem2Δmye, primarily through the downregulation of Treg CXCR4 expression mediated by increased NET degradation. These therapeutic effects were further amplified when combined with the CXCR2 inhibitor AZD5069. Our findings identify Trem2 as a central regulator of the NASH-driven HCC immunosuppressive niche, and suggest a combinatorial therapeutic strategy that targets both myeloid reprogramming and NETosis to overcome immunotherapy resistance in metabolic liver cancer progression.">

Macrophages, which are central to the immune system, play a paradoxical dual role in cancer progression. While they can suppress tumor growth, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) frequently facilitate tumor development and metastasis, a complexity that is further intricate by the aging process. As macrophages transition into senescent cells, they undergo changes, including shifts in cytokine profiles, reduced phagocytic activity, and altered metabolism. These senescent macrophages contribute to cancer progression by creating an immunosuppressive environment, promoting angiogenesis, and supporting tumor invasion. This review explores the intricate functions of senescent macrophages in cancer, highlighting their implications for tumor biology and their potential as therapeutic targets.

        <tr id="T cell-dependent bispecific antibodies (TDBs) are next-generation antibody therapies that link cancer cells and T cells to achieve potent antitumor effects. Despite the successful development of TDBs for hematological malignancies, their efficacy against solid tumors remains limited. Overcoming this challenge requires a deeper understanding of their mechanisms of action. While the basic process of immunological synapse (IS) formation and T cell activation by TDB is known, the detailed effects of IS on the bystander effect and T cell migration, both crucial for therapeutic efficacy, remain unclear. This study investigated these mechanisms using an EGFR/CD3 TDB (hEx3) and EGFR knockout cancer cells (KO). The results revealed that IS formation by TDB induced a bystander effect, leading to damage in surrounding KO, with the extent depending on the proportion of EGFR-positive wild-type cancer cells (WT) and the duration of co-culture. Furthermore, IS formation significantly enhanced T cell cytokine and chemokine secretion, promoting T cell migration. These findings provide critical insights into TDB efficacy mechanisms and highlight the importance of evaluating IS formation in developing new antibody drugs. Establishing a reliable system for assessing IS formation will be essential for advancing TDBs and other antibody-based therapies, particularly against solid tumors.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The adaptive immune system is shaped by self‐recognition, creating a paradox where autoreactivity is essential for immune regulation, yet implicated in autoimmune diseases. Traditionally, B cell selection in the bone marrow (BM) has been viewed through the lens of negative selection, eliminating potentially harmful clones. Emerging evidence challenges this perspective, revealing a subset of B suppressor cells (Bsup) that actively regulate immune homeostasis. Unlike conventional negative selection, C1‐specific Bsup cells, which recognize collagen type II (Col2), engage Col2‐specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) to suppress inflammation in healthy individuals. This suggests that Bsup play a role in both peripheral and central tolerance, akin to Tregs. However, the molecular mechanisms governing Bsup selection, differentiation, and function remain unknown. Understanding how Bsup distinguish homeostatic from pathogenic autoreactivity could transform autoimmune disease treatment, shifting the focus from eliminating autoreactive B cells to harnessing their regulatory potential for precision immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains a major cause of mortality among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The interplay between fungal genotype and host immune response is critical in determining disease outcome. We conducted ex vivo cytokine profiling using peripheral blood from HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults stimulated with heat-inactivated whole-cell antigens from two Cryptococcus neoformans strains: the reference strain H99 and the genetically distinct UgCl377 clinical strain. These strains differ at multiple loci, including the CNAG_04922 gene. Luminex-based quantification revealed that H99 induced significantly higher levels of CD40-ligand, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, and IL-33. These cytokines reflect pro-inflammatory, Th2, and regulatory responses, suggesting robust immune activation. In contrast, the UgCl377 strain elicited a dampened cytokine profile. While this study does not isolate the effect of CNAG_04922 alone, it demonstrates that whole-cell antigens from genetically distinct strains of C. neoformans elicit differential cytokine responses. These findings provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies using purified proteins or isogenic strains.">

        <tr id="In the past decade, immunotherapies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) have been approved for solid tumors. However, some patients demonstrate suboptimal clinical outcomes due to resistance. The tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly affects the efficiency of immunotherapy by mediating interactions between tumor and non-tumor cells, including dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These non-tumor cells often exhibit two phenotypes with altered functions, and tumor cells drives their transition towards tumor promotion through tumor-education. Tumor-educated cells (TECs) are cells influenced by tumor cells, which acquire immune-suppressive phenotypes and promote tumor progression through resistance to anti-cancer therapies. These cells undergo modifications in response to signals from the tumor, which can influence their roles in tumor progression. Their dynamic interactions with tumor cells contribute to the reshaping of the TME, facilitating cancer growth and immune modulation. This review summarizes research on TECs in TME, explores mechanisms related to tumor education, and discusses their role in tumor progression and immunotherapy resistance. Additionally, potential therapeutic approaches targeting these cells are also reviewed, which may complement current treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="T helper 9 (Th9) cells are a newly identified subset of effector T cells, characterized by their production of IL-9, a hallmark cytokine. Transcription factors such as PU.1 and IRF4 bind to the IL9 gene promoter and transactivate its expression. IL-9 and its associated transcription factors regulate various aspects of Th9 cell biology, including proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and interactions with other immune cells through downstream signaling pathways. In recent years, the involvement of Th9 cells in autoimmune diseases has been widely investigated. Multiple studies have reported the aberrant expression of IL-9, PU.1, and IRF4 in these inflammatory conditions, and functional analyses have demonstrated their significant roles in disease development. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the relationship among Th9-related cytokines, transcription factors, and 14 autoimmune diseases based on both in vivo and in vitro evidence. We further discuss the regulatory effects of intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways on Th9 cell functions. This compilation of findings may facilitate future research and the development of clinical strategies targeting Th9 cells in autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Immunological heterogeneity in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) poses a significant challenge to the efficacy and response to immunotherapy. In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover substantial heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironments (TMEs) among patients received PD-1 inhibitor with partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and that who underwent surgery without prior therapy. Notably, tumors classified as SD demonstrated an immunosuppressive environment, characterized by a higher prevalence of M2-like macrophages and lower frequencies of T and B cells, especially PD1highCD8+ T cells. These PD1highCD8+ T cells were found to frequently engage with macrophages within the TMEs. Focusing on macrophages, we observed elevated expression of the Iron-Sulfur Cluster Assembly Enzyme (ISCU) in macrophages infiltrating SD tumors. ISCU was identified as a promoter of M2 macrophage polarization in a p53-dependent manner. Mechanistically, ISCU sequestrates p53 in the cytoplasm, reducing its nuclear location and relieving transcriptional repression of xCT and Arg1. Consequently, the increased expression of xCT and Arg1 modulates macrophage sensitivity to ferroptosis and the arginine metabolic pathway, thus affecting macrophage differentiation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, inhibition of ISCU expression was found to repolarize macrophages, enhance CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, and boost the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody. Collectively, our findings highlight the complex interplay within ESCC TMEs and suggest that targeting ISCU might be a novel strategy to reprogram the immunosuppressive TME, potentially improving immunotherapy outcomes in ESCC patients. Schematic illustration of the mechanism by which ISCU facilitates M2 macrophage polarization. ISCU interacted with p53, promoting its retention in the cytoplasm during M2 macrophage polarization. This nuclear reduction of p53 results in the upregulation of xCT and Arg1, as both are negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by p53. The increased expression of xCT and Arg1 modulates macrophage sensitivity to ferroptosis and the arginine metabolic pathway, respectively, thus affecting macrophage differentiation and inflammatory responses.

        <tr id="Natural Killer (NK) cells can play a significant role in the anti-tumoral immune response. In patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), NK cells are however often found in low numbers and exhibit poor activity, contributing to leukemic progression. Allogenic NK cells are emerging as promising cellular therapies for hematological cancer treatment. New strategies are however required to both reactivate NK cells in AML patients and enhance the anti-tumor activity of transplanted NK cells. Here, we demonstrate that targeting SUMOylation, a protein post-translational modification, activates NK cells from both healthy donors and AML patients. Subasumstat (TAK-981), a first-in-class inhibitor of SUMOylation used in phase I/II clinical trials, enhances NK cells degranulation, secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, FasL) and cytotoxicity against AML cells. In vivo, TAK-981 improves the anti-leukemic efficacy of ex-vivo expanded cord-blood NK cells in leukemia-bearing mice. One early effect of TAK-981 is to specifically increase the accessibility and activation of cis-regulatory regions of type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway genes and induce their transcription. TAK-981-induced secretion of interferon-ß, mostly by NK cells and myeloid cells, is required for NK cells activation. Surprisingly, IFNB1 induction does not require its best-characterized activators MDA5, cGas, IRF-1, -3 and -7. Altogether, this suggests that targeting SUMOylation activates a non-canonical IFN-I pathway, which enhances the anti-leukemic potential of NK cells.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are specialized lymphocytes that help protect against viruses and cancer. However, in the context of bacterial infections, NK cells can be harmful, rather than protective. Such immune pathogenesis by NK cells has been linked to the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines like interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). In this context, IFN-γ-deficient mice display increased survival rates in response to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection. However, little is known about how NK cells respond to S. aureus in humans, which causes life-threatening, invasive systemic infections with high mortality rates. In this study, we found that the peripheral blood of patients with bloodstream S. aureus infection was enriched for CD57- NKG2A+ NK cells with greater cytokine-producing capacity, compared to healthy controls and those hospitalized with Escherichia coli bloodstream infections. As a possible mechanistic cause, superantigens from S. aureus promoted the expansion of CD57- NKG2A+ NK cells that produced IFN-γ through a mechanism that appears to be IL-12 independent and exhibited reduced levels of CD16 compared to unstimulated NK cells. These data suggest that S. aureus bloodstream infection in humans promotes a phenotypic shift toward CD57- NKG2A+ NK cells with greater IFN-γ-producing capacity, providing a plausible way to promote inflammation-driven disease pathogenesis.">

        <tr id="Undernutrition remains a major global health crisis, with nearly 1 billion people experiencing severe food insecurity. Malnourished individuals are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases, which is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for this population. Despite the known link between undernutrition and infection susceptibility, the mechanisms remain poorly understood, and it is unclear whether refeeding can reverse nutritionally acquired immunodeficiency. Here, we investigate how malnutrition leads to immune dysfunction and the ability of refeeding to repair it. Malnourished mice show an inability to control sublethal Listeria monocytogenes infection, reduced immune cell function and expansion, and early contraction before pathogen clearance. Myelopoiesis is particularly affected, with fewer neutrophils and monocytes present both before and after infection in malnourished mice. While refeeding restores body mass, lymphoid organ cellularity, and T cell responses, refed mice remain susceptible to Listeria infection, revealing that recovery from lymphoid atrophy alone is not sufficient to restore protective immunity. Accordingly, peripheral neutrophils and monocytes fail to fully recover, and emergency myelopoiesis remains impaired in refed animals. Altogether, this work identifies dysregulated myelopoiesis as a link between prior nutritional state and immunocompetency, indicating that food scarcity is an immunologic risk factor, even after nutritional recovery.">

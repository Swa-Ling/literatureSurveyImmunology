        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a prevalent condition whose recurrence leads to multiple adverse effects. Previous studies on INS pathogenesis primarily focused on immune dysregulation, particularly T-cell changes and their correlation with cytokine shifts. Accumulating evidence suggests that B-cell dysfunction also plays a role. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and effective treatment strategies remains incomplete. Methods This study investigates changes in gene expressions and cellular interactions of immune cells at a single-cell level using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). And subsequently validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry. Results We identified seven main clusters using unsupervised clustering of 103,213 high-quality single cells. Through unsupervised clustering, patient-specific T cells (IFI44L + CD4 + T cells) that exhibited a pronounced elevation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is identified. Activation of ISGs and interferon (IFN)-related pathways are also observed in other clusters. Specifically, this study demonstrates that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role by promoting the interaction between B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and receptors on B cells. This interaction triggers the release of autoantibodies, thereby initiating INS pathogenesis. Furthermore, telitacicept has shown efficacy in treating pediatric patients with frequent relapse NS(FRNS). Conclusions Overall, our findings underscore the role of interferon and its related pathways in INS pathogenesis, providing novel therapeutic interventions for NS.

        <tr id="Streptococcus pneumoniae, a Gram-positive, human-specific commensal infectious pathogen, poses a significant global health threat, especially in children under five, often resulting in fatalities. The intricacies of the immune response in pneumococcal meningitis (PM) remain elusive, necessitating a meticulous examination of immune cell subsets at the single-cell resolution. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PM patients and healthy individuals. We found significant relative changes in the compositions of immune cell subset, with significant relative increases in platelets, neutrophils, and their precursors, alongside relative decreases in natural killer (NK) cells, T cell subtypes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in PM patients. Functional enrichment analyses revealed an up-regulation of neutrophils-related immune genes across multiple immune cell types, including platelets, myeloid cells and B cells, suggesting excessive neutrophil activation. However, a down-regulation of genes involved in antigen processing and presentation in myeloid cells and B cells in the PM group indicated a relative dampening of the adaptive immune response in the PM patients. This was further corroborated by the reduced proportions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T cells. Furthermore, genes involved in cytotoxity were down-regulated in both NK cells and T cells, alongside impaired T cell activation. Notably, distinct B cell subtypes, including unique naïve B cell clusters, demonstrated differentially expressed genes associated with both innate and adaptive immune responses. In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic landscape of immune responses in PM. The identified cellular and molecular signatures offer potential targets for therapeutic intervention and provide a foundation for further investigation into the immunopathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis.">

        <tr id="Chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are critical but unresolved drivers of disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Advanced melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that has spread and cannot be surgically removed. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved survival for some patients by helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. However, reliable methods to predict which patients will benefit are still lacking. This study investigated whether analyzing both tumor and blood samples before treatment could help identify patients most likely to benefit from ICIs. By studying gene activity in tumors and immune cell types in the blood, we found that patients with low immune activity in their tumors had poorer outcomes. Conversely, those with higher levels of a specific immune cell type in their blood—PD-1+ effector memory CD4+ T-cell—tended to respond better to treatment. These findings suggest that combining both tumor and blood analysis could support more personalized and effective treatment decisions for patients with advanced melanoma.">

        <tr id="Negative regulators of T cell function represent promising targets to enhance the intrinsic antitumor activity of CAR T cells against solid tumors. However, the endogenous immune ecosystem in solid tumors often represents an immunosuppressive therapeutic barrier to CAR T cell therapy, and it is currently unknown whether deletion of negative regulators in CAR T cells reshapes the endogenous immune landscape. To address this knowledge gap, we developed CAR T cells targeting B7-H3 in immune-competent osteosarcoma models and evaluated the intrinsic and extrinsic effects of deleting a potent negative regulator called Regnase-1 (Reg-1). Deletion of Reg-1 not only improved the effector function of B7-H3-CAR T cells but also endowed them with the ability to create a proinflammatory landscape characterized by an influx of IFNγ-producing endogenous T cells and NK cells and a reduction of inhibitory myeloid cells, including M2 macrophages. Thus, deleting negative regulators in CAR T cells enforces a non-cell-autonomous state by creating a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Despite advances in immunotherapy, metastatic melanoma remains a considerable therapeutic challenge due to the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. Intratumoral type I interferon (IFN-I) has long been associated with improved clinical outcomes. However, several IFN-I subtypes can also paradoxically promote tumor growth in some contexts. We investigated this further by engineering murine B16 melanoma cells to overexpress various IFN-I subtypes, where a spectrum of outcomes was observed. Characterization of these tumors by RNA sequencing revealed a tumor immune phenotype, where potent IFN-I signaling concomitant with diminished type 2 inflammation failed to confer durable tumor control. T cell–mediated rejection of these tumors was restored by introducing interleukin-4 (IL-4) into the tumor microenvironment, either through ectopic expression or in a preclinical adoptive T cell therapy model. Collectively, our findings highlight the IFN-I/IL-4 axis in promoting antitumor immunity, which could be harnessed to target and stratify solid tumors that are nonresponsive to frontline therapies.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant non-cancerous cell type in glioblastoma (GBM) and heavily influence GBM biology, contributing to tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, immune evasion, and neovascularization. Current in vitro models that utilize IL-4/IL-13 stimulation fail to capture the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of TAMs observed in vivo. In this study, we utilize a serum-free indirect co-culture model with patient-derived xenolines to polarize primary human macrophages and characterize their molecular and functional phenotypes. We demonstrate that xenoline-polarized macrophages diverge from classical M1/M2 states and instead adopt transcriptional signatures reflective of TAM subsets identified from patients. Notably, macrophages polarized with the radiation-therapy selected xenoline, JX14P-RT, exhibited gene expression patterns enriched for interferon response and hypoxia, mirroring recurrent GBM samples. In contrast, JX14P TAMs showed enrichment in phagocytic gene sets. Functional validation of these phenotypes revealed discrepancies between the transcriptionally predicted and observed phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of integrating phenotypic validation in sequencing studies. Altogether, our findings establish xenoline-polarized macrophages as a more physiologically relevant alternative to traditional models, offering a useful model for studying tumor-immune interaction in vitro.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs) are an abundant, phenotypically plastic cell population that is critical for initiating a robust antitumor response. To properly combat cancer cells, TAMCs must sense and transduce both soluble and vital biophysical cues imparted by the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite ample research enumerating the deleterious effects of a primary tumor’s ECM on TAMCs’ functionality, few studies have evaluated the contribution of mechanosensitive cation channel(s) underlying these detrimental changes. Methods Our study aimed to evaluate the significance of the mechanosensitive cation channel PIEZO1 in TAMCs’ phenotype and effector functionality. To do so, we generated CD11b-conditional Piezo1 knockout mice, orthotopically inoculated them with rhabdomyosarcoma 76–9, an aggressive syngeneic rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, and evaluated tumor burden, pan-immune compartment changes, and intrinsic myeloid and lymphoid transcriptomic and functional changes. Results Genetic deletion of Piezo1 in CD11b-expressing cells significantly hindered primary and metastatic tumor burden. Intratumorally, we observe enhanced infiltration of CD11b+ dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8+, but not CD4+, T cells. This phenotype was driven by CD11b+ DCs that have undergone transcriptional changes related to improved antigen presentation and T cell activation. Despite being canonically inefficient cross-presenters in the wildtype state, Piezo1 KO CD11b+ DCs, specifically the cDC2A subpopulation, efficiently cross-prime CD8+ T cells on exposure to exogenous particulate antigens. Conclusions Here, we report for the first time an association between mechanosensation and cross-presentation by cDC2A cells. Our findings may be impactful to improving the continued development of DC vaccines whose success hinges on proper antigen processing and presentation to cytotoxic T cells in the TME.">

        <tr id="Background Early administration of IL-6R blockade is effective in adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD), but the underlying immune alterations during combined immunotherapy remain unclear. Methods We employed high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry and an unbiased bioinformatics pipeline to characterize the immune landscape in treatment-naïve AOSD patients, stable AOSD patients after 24 weeks of IL-6R blockade plus methotrexate and prednisone, and matched healthy controls. Cytokine profiling was conducted using a high-throughput cytometric bead array, and potential regulatory networks were identified using the PerformanceAnalytics package. Validation was performed via flow cytometry and mRNA sequencing. Results We identified 22 peripheral immune cell populations and characterized their composition and phenotypic markers. Treatment-naïve AOSD patients exhibited significant depletion of CD4+ T cells and B cells, along with excessive activation of CD8+ T cells and a previously unreported CD45+CD3−CD19−CD10−CD66a+ population, findings that were validated in an independent AOSD cohort. mRNA sequencing revealed the proinflammatory role of CD8+ T cells. Notably, these dysregulated immune profiles were markedly restored following immunotherapy. IL-18, IL-21, and IFN-γ demonstrated strong associations with adaptive immune cells and AOSD clinical indices. Conclusions Combined IL-6R blockade effectively modulates immune dysregulation in refractory AOSD, reversing key pathological immune alterations and highlighting its therapeutic potential.

        <tr id="Although lung myeloid cells provide an intracellular niche for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), CD4+ T cells limit Mtb growth in these cells to protect the host. The CD4+ T cell activities including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production that account for this protection are poorly understood. Using intravenous antibody labeling and lineage-tracing reporter mice, we show that monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), rather than phenotypically similar monocytes or dendritic cells, are preferentially infected with Mtb in murine lungs. MDMs were recruited to the lungs by Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells via IFN-γ, which promoted the extravasation of monocyte precursors from the blood. It was possible that CD4+ T cells recruited infectable MDMs because these cells are uniquely poised to receive cognate MHCII-mediated help to control intracellular bacteria. Mice with MHCII deficiency in monocyte-derived cells had normal Mtb-specific CD4+ T cell activation, expansion and differentiation but the CD4+ T cells were unable to attenuate Mtb growth. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we showed that MDMs receiving cognate MHCII-mediated help from CD4+ T cells upregulated glycolytic genes associated with Mtb control. Overall, the results indicate that CD4+ T cells recruit infectable MDMs to the lungs and then trigger glycolysis-dependent bacterial control in the MDMs by engaging their MHCII-bound Mtb peptides. Moreover, the results suggest that cognate MHCII-mediated help to promote MDM glycolysis is an essential, IFN-γ-independent effector function of Mtb-specific CD4+ T cells.">

        <tr id="The current concept is that the eye is an immune privileged site endowed with innate immune regulatory networks to maintain organ function. We now have evidence that resident T cells occupy intraocular tissues. In immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, tissue resident T cells trigger disease flares in the skin and joints. This suggests resident T cells in the uvea may have similar functions in non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis, a collective term for autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases of the uveal tract causing intraocular inflammation. Here, we demonstrate by spectral cytometry and immunofluorescence imaging that non-inflamed uveal tissue contains multiple T cell subtypes including CD8+ CD103+ tissue resident memory T (TRM) cells. Using single cell RNA & T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to profile aqueous humour cells from donors with acute, active uveitis, we identify clonally expanded T cells which are enriched for TRM -associated genes. We further show that in donors with active uveitis, CD8+ CD103+ T cells persist within tissue in the uveal tract. Using bulk RNA sequencing and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) we show that quiescent iris tissue from donors with a history of uveitis are enriched for genes associated with T cell activation and antigen presentation. Finally, we demonstrate that TRM cells persist in the anterior uvea in mice following resolution of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). Our results show that the human eye contains T cells both in health and during active inflammation. Our findings challenge the dogma that the eye is devoid of lymphocytes and supports the concept of resident T cell involvement in the pathogenesis of non-infectious immune-mediated uveitis and as promising targets for therapy.

        <tr id="Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), a lethal manifestation of acute lung injury, remains a critical public health concern due to the absence of targeted therapies. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for immunopathology during DAD progression are largely undefined. Here, by integrating single cell RNA sequencing, functional assays, and genetic/pharmacological interventions in a mouse model of ricin-induced DAD, we revealed a significant accumulation of neutrophil with an activated phenotype that plays a critical role in immunopathology. We observed the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during DAD, which further intensified inflammation and tissue injury. IL-17A signaling activity was upregulated in DAD-affected lungs, while IL-17A deficiency or functional blockade significantly attenuated neutrophil recruitment, NET generation, and tissue damage. Mechanically, IL-17A stimulates lung resident fibroblasts to produce the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1. Notably, type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) emerged as the dominant source of IL-17A, highlighting a triad of interactions among ILC3, fibroblast, and neutrophil in DAD pathogenesis. This finding delineates a pathogenic IL-17A-neutrophil-NET axis that amplifies lung immunopathology after ricin-induced DAD, a deeper understanding of these relationships may pave the way for mitigate DAD immunopathology and other lung inflammatory disorders.">

        <tr id="Background T cells play a central role in host protection against respiratory pathogens, but a maladaptive T cell response can lead to pulmonary diseases. Defining the biology of protective versus pathogenic T cell responses in the lungs of humans will be critical to nominate novel approaches to improve respiratory health. Previous studies have examined T cells from the lungs captured via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endobronchial brushings, or biopsies. However, whether these different approaches are capturing distinct T cell phenotypes and/or clonotypes remains unclear. Objective To evaluate and compare the transcriptional signatures of T cells isolated via BAL versus endobronchial brushings in healthy controls (HCs) and allergic asthmatics (AAs). Methods Flexible bronchoscopy was performed to obtain BAL and endobronchial brushings from 3 HC and 3 AA subjects. CD3+ T cells were sorted and single cell RNA- and T cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing was performed using the 10X Chromium platform. Unbiased clustering, differential gene expression analysis and TCR repertoire analysis was performed. Results Unbiased clustering analysis allowed us to define 7 CD8 and 6 CD4 T cell subsets. The most significant difference in T cell subsets abundance between AAs and HCs was the enrichment of CD4 T helper type 2 (Th2) cells when comparing endobronchial brush samples (OR=26.2, P=0.002), but not when examining BAL (OR=1.7, P=0.46), indicating differences in the T cell subsets captured from the BAL versus airway mucosa specimen processing. In further support of this observation, comparing the BAL and brush T cells across all subjects revealed an up-regulation of resident-memory T cell markers (i.e. ITGAE, CD69) in brush T cells versus BAL T cells in both CD4 and CD8 lineages. In contrast, BAL CD8 and CD4 T cells exhibited an enriched type I and II interferon signatures compared to brush T cells. Lastly, TCR repertoire analysis revealed that brush T cells contained dramatically expanded TCR clones. Expanded T cell clones from the brush expressed high levels of resident-memory markers, suggesting the airway mucosa is enriched for TRM cells with unique TCR specificity. Conclusions Sampling T cells via BAL versus airway brushings yielded distinct T cell phenotypes and clonotypes with important implications for future research in lung immunology.">

        <tr id="Introduction End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing worldwide, and although kidney transplantation improves survival, long-term graft loss–driven mainly by immune-mediated rejection–remains common. We aimed to delineate immune mechanisms that distinguish recipients with stable versus impaired graft function. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from kidney-transplant recipients with normal (n = 10) or impaired (n = 10) renal function were profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing. Fourteen immune populations were identified; CD4+ T-cell “stemness” was quantified using mRNAsi and EREG_mRNAsi indices, lineage trajectories were reconstructed with Monocle, and ligand–receptor communication was inferred with iTalk. Findings were validated in an independent bulk RNA-seq cohort (n = 192) using differential expression and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Results Recipients with graft dysfunction exhibited (i) expansion of Th17 cells and contraction of Treg cells, (ii) significant loss of CD4+ T-cell stem-like features (lower mRNAsi/EREG_mRNAsi, p < 0.001), and (iii) pseudotime trajectories skewed toward Th17 differentiation. iTalk revealed enhanced S100A8/A9-TLR4 signalling from myeloid cells to neutrophils, consistent with reduced circulating neutrophils and presumptive intragraft accumulation. Bulk validation confirmed the stemness deficit and identified eight hub genes (API5, CAPRIN1, CCT2, DLG1, NMD3, RDX, SENP7, S100A4) that correlated with both low stemness and poor clinical outcome. Pathway enrichment implicated cell-morphogenesis, tight-junction, and metabolic-homeostasis pathways in graft injury. Discussion Integrative single-cell and bulk analyses link diminished CD4+ T-cell stemness, Th17-dominant polarization, and S100A4-mediated neutrophil recruitment to graft dysfunction. These signatures nominate stemness indices, Th17/Treg balance, and the S100-TLR4 axis as candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets to preserve allograft integrity and prolong transplant survival.">

        <tr id="Axl, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family comprised of Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK, is a promising cancer therapeutic target actively under clinical investigation. Axl is understood to be a dual target in cancer to (1) prevent tumor cell growth and invasion and (2) potentiate anti-tumor immunity. This immunity is characterized by myeloid cell activation and downstream recruitment and activation of anti-tumor T cells. However, the ways by which Axl inhibition promotes myeloid cell activation in the tumor microenvironment are incompletely understood. There is thus a need to understand the effects of Axl inhibition on myeloid cells in the context of the broader tumor microenvironment. Here, we developed a human in vitro model system using primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and Axl-expressing melanoma tumor cells to elucidate the effects of Axl inhibition on the myeloid compartment of the tumor microenvironment. We found that treatment with the Axl-specific small molecule inhibitor bemcentinib yields increased expression of markers of activation in both macrophages and dendritic cells. Interestingly, the addition of dendritic cells to the system appears to dampen macrophage response, suggesting that these cells cooperate to share the burden of the innate immune response. Most importantly, we found that treatment-naïve tumor cells and targeted therapy-treated tumor cells have distinct impacts on macrophage state, and these differences dictate the nature of the immune cell response to Axl inhibition. As a whole, our work highlights the utility of in vitro models in unraveling the complex mechanistic effects of Axl inhibition and establishes a robust model system that can be used in future mechanistic drug studies with the potential to inform clinical trial design.">

        <tr id="Although immune checkpoint blockade therapy has generated dramatic responses in certain cancer types, breast tumors are largely unresponsive. Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity leads to the assembly of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and drives resistance of breast tumors to immunotherapies. Importantly, targeting CD73 completely sensitizes quasi-mesenchymal breast tumors to anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. However, the mechanism(s) of sensitization remained unknown. We demonstrate that targeting CD73 in quasi-mesenchymal breast tumors sensitizes them to anti-CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade therapy in a CD4+ T-cell dependent manner. Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity results in elevated expression of cancer cell-intrinsic CD73 in human triple negative breast cancers. Given the ability of quasi-mesenchymal cancer cells to metastasize and resist multiple therapies, these findings can instruct the formation of novel translational strategies for the treatment of human breast cancers. These findings also bring to the forefront the attractive possibility of utilizing the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells along with CD73 and CD4+ T-cells as a predictive criterion for immunotherapy responsiveness.

        <tr id="Prior infection elicits durable reprogramming in myeloid cells and their progenitors; however, the long-term consequences of this reprogramming are not well understood. We previously established a murine model of sepsis survival induced by cecal ligation and puncture which results in enhanced lung injury responses to lipopolysaccharide. In this model, classical monocytes from post-sepsis mice display persistently enhanced cytokine expression after lipopolysaccharide. To test the hypothesis that inflammatory reprogramming of monocytes mediates enhanced lung injury in post-sepsis mice, depletion and/or adoptive transfer was performed three weeks and three months after sepsis. Transcriptomic and epigenomic pathways associated with monocyte reprogramming and shifts in novel monocyte subsets were determined after sepsis in mice and humans. Monocytes from post-sepsis mice mediated enhanced LPS-induced lung injury and promoted neutrophil degranulation. Prior sepsis enhanced JAK-STAT signaling and AP-1 binding in monocytes, shifting toward the neutrophil-like monocyte subset and their progenitors. Similar neutrophil-like monocyte shifts were observed in adult sepsis patients and monocyte counts were predictive of 90-day mortality. We conclude that sepsis induces inflammatory memory affecting bone marrow progenitors and monocyte subsets predisposing to lung injury. These observations serve as a foundation for future investigations on neutrophil-like monocytes and inflammatory program interaction in tissue injury responses. Summary Sepsis shifts the immune program and ontogeny of monocytes and their progenitors contributing to long-term risk for new organ injury.">

        <tr id="Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) share features and regulatory pathways with normal stem cells, yet how the stem cell niche contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify CXCR4+ macrophages as a niche population enriched in normal mammary ducts, where they promote the regenerative activity of basal cells in response to luminal cell-derived CXCL12. CXCL12 triggers AKT-mediated stabilization of β-catenin, which induces Wnt ligands and pro-migratory genes, enabling intraductal macrophage infiltration and supporting regenerative activity of basal cells. Notably, these same CXCR4+ niche macrophages regulate the tumor-initiating activity of various breast cancer subtypes by enhancing TIC survival and tumor-forming capacity, while promoting early immune evasion through regulatory T cell induction. Furthermore, a CXCR4+ niche macrophage gene signature correlates with poor prognosis in human breast cancer. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in orchestrating interactions between niche macrophages, mammary epithelial cells, and immune cells, thereby establishing a supportive niche for both normal tissue regeneration and mammary tumor initiation.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects various organs and systems, significantly impacting patients’ health and quality of life. Conventional drugs, including glucocorticoids and standard immunosuppressive drugs, may not be enough to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic outcome in some refractory SLE patients. The abnormal phenotype and function of macrophages participate in the development of SLE. The targeted delivery to reprogram macrophage in SLE has been a long-standing challenge. Apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) are essential for intercellular communications. This study aims to explore an effective and targeted treatment to SLE via macrophage reprogramming and Treg differentiation. In this work, we found that M2 macrophages-derived ApoBDs (M2-ApoBDs) could selectively target and localize to the spleen, where they were engulfed by splenic macrophages (phagocytic rate 73.4%). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the efferocytosis of M2-ApoBDs triggered transcriptional changes in M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages within the spleen, subsequently promoting the differentiation of Treg cells in vivo. Immunological experiments revealed that M2-ApoBDs prompted the reprogramming of M2 macrophages in vitro, which subsequently influenced Treg cell differentiation via ligand-receptor interactions. In SLE mice, M2-ApoBDs alleviated the disease progression, including 24-hours urinary protein, plasma creatinine, plasma C3 levels, and glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. These findings show that M2-ApoBDs can targeted-modulate macrophage polarization and Treg immune regulation, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for the effective treatment of SLE.

        <tr id="Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized ectopic lymphoid clusters of immune cells that develop in non-lymphoid tissue to promote antigen presentation, drive cytotoxic immune responses, and enhance humoral immunity via B cell clonal expansion. Their presence within the tumor microenvironment (TME) correlates with increased patient survival and an improved response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), positioning TLS as potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers. Despite the widespread use of ICIs across various cancers, their effectiveness remains limited in gynecological malignancies, including ovarian cancer (OC), a notably challenging disease characterized by poor responses to both single and combination ICI therapies. Interestingly, the infiltration of T cells into the OC TME is linked to enhanced progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), yet an immunosuppressive TME frequently impedes therapeutic efficacy, suggesting cell activity within localized immune niches can impact antitumor immunity. This review explores the roles of TLS, their maturity, functionality, identification, and related gene signatures; specific immune cells and cytokines that play a role in TLS formation and antitumor response; and other modifiable elements, including gut microbiota, that may drive improving OC survival by leveraging a TLS-driven antitumor response to bolster immunotherapy outcomes.">

        <tr id="To date, murine sepsis models have failed to recapitulate human acute respiratory distress syndrome, one of the leading complications of human sepsis. We set out to determine if preexisting T cell memory, which is common in human adults and lacking in laboratory mice, could contribute to lung inflammation in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis. After administering an anti-CD3ε activating antibody to C57Bl/6 mice to induce a T cell memory repertoire, we compared the pulmonary immune response to CLP in these “Immune-Educated mice” to responses observed in Uneducated control animals. Compared to Uneducated mice, 24 hours after CLP, Immune-Educated mice had higher alveolar inflammatory cytokine and chemokine concentrations and more pulmonary interstitial macrophages. After 48 hours, the proportion of effector CD4 T cells that produced interferon-gamma was greater in Immune- Educated mice. After 72 hours, there were more alveolar macrophages in the lungs of Educated mice. Separately, we performed adoptive transfer of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells from immunized C57Bl/6J to B6.SJL mice and IFNγ blockade at the time of CLP. Interstitial macrophage recruitment 24 hours post-CLP was more pronounced in mice undergoing adoptive transfer of memory T cells compared to mice that did not undergo adoptive transfer. IFNγ blockade resulted in higher absolute numbers of T cells, memory T cells, and innate cells in the lungs of Educated mice 24 hours post-CLP suggesting that IFNγ is necessary for curbing an overactive immune response in these mice. In conclusion, the presence of memory T cells affects the course of CLP- induced lung inflammation and may provide a model that more closely resembles sepsis- associated lung injury. Summary Statement Prior immune memory alters the course of CLP-induced lung inflammation in mice.">

        <tr id="Dysregulation of T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cell homeostasis in germinal centers (GCs) can lead to antibody-mediated autoimmunity. While IL-1β modulates the GC response via IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 receptors on follicular T cells in animal models, its role in humans remains unclear. We analyzed Tfh and Tfr phenotypes in human secondary lymphoid organs (tonsils, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes) using flow cytometry, single-cell transcriptomics, and in vitro culture, comparing findings with samples from autoimmune patients. We observed organ-specific Tfh/Tfr phenotypes according to activation status and IL-1 receptor expression. An excess of IL-1R1 over IL-1R2 expression promoted a unique activated Tfr subset with Treg and GC-Tfh features. IL-1β signaling via IL-1R1 enhanced follicular T cell activation and Tfh-to-Tfr differentiation, while IL-1β inhibition upregulated IL-1R1, indicating a tightly regulated process. In autoimmune patients, high IL-1β and circulating Tfr levels correlated with increased autoantibody production, linking inflammation, IL-1β signaling, and Tfr/Tfh balance. Our findings highlight the critical role of IL-1β in follicular T cell activation and suggest that targeting IL-1β signaling in Tfh and Tfr cells could be a promising strategy for treating antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="The success of cancer immunotherapies is currently limited to a subset of patients, which underscores the urgent need to identify the processes by which tumours evade immunity. Through screening a kinome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA library we identified MAP3K7 (TAK1) as a suppressor of CD8+ T cell mediated killing. We demonstrate that TAK1 acts as a cancer-intrinsic checkpoint by integrating signals from T cell-secreted TNF and IFNy effector cytokines to elicit a cytoprotective response. This cytoprotective response profoundly limits the anti-cancer activity these key effector molecules and completely abrogates bystander killing by perforin deficient T cells. Inhibition of the TAK1 checkpoint effectively redirects the combined TNF/IFNy pathway activation to promote inflammatory cell death via RIPK1 and Caspase-8 and simultaneously amplifies the output of the IFNy pathway, thereby priming cells for cytokine-induced cell death. Mechanistically, TAK1 deficiency led to proteasomal degradation of cFLIP, enhancing the formation of Complex II and subversion of other cytoprotective responses. Targeting the TAK1 checkpoint led to profound attenuation of tumour growth in immune competent mice, with minimal impact in immune deficient counterparts. Adoptive cell therapy led to preferential elimination of TAK1 deficient clones. Collectively, our study uncovers a cancer-intrinsic checkpoint controlled by TAK1 activity that switches TNF and IFNy responses from cytoprotective to apoptosis. Cancer cells exploit this to limit cell death in the presence of the cytotoxic lymphoctye cytokines TNF and IFNγ and therapeutic intervention can fully unleash the impact of these effector molecules both on the direct target and bystander cells. These findings highlight the clinical development of TAK1 biologics as a potential strategy to improve cancer immunotherapies through harnessing and enhancing the cytotoxic potential of CTL-derived cytokines. In Brief Djajawi et al. identify TAK1 as a cancer-intrinsic cytokine toxicity checkpoint that limits the efficacy of anti-cancer immune responses. Cancer cells exploit TAK1 activity to confers resistance to CD8+ T cell-derived TNF and IFNγ-induced apoptosis, limiting both direct and bystander killing. Mechanistically, TAK1 loss acts through 1. cFLIP and RIPK1 to promote cell death, 2. The inactivation of pro-survival signals and 3. Via amplification of the IFNy response. Targeting of this TAK1 checkpoint enhanced anti-tumour immunity in vivo and improved adoptive cellular therapy. These findings identify a strategy employed by transformed cells to avoid destruction by inflammatory cytokines and provide new therapeutic vulnerabilities for enhancing immunotherapies. Highlights CRISPR screens identify TAK1 as a tumour-intrinsic survival checkpoint limiting destruction by CD8+ T cells. TAK1 protects tumour cells from combined TNF and IFNγ-induced apoptosis. TAK1 loss destabilizes cFLIP, priming cells for STAT1 and RIPK1-dependent cell death. TAK1 loss promotes tumour control in immune competent animals and enhances the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Background: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to immune suppression observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MDSCs are immature myeloid cells that are hijacked during development and further reprogrammed by the tumor microenvironment (TME) to harbor immune-suppressive properties and inhibit T-cell functions. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, including BRD4, are epigenetic modulators that regulate genes implicated in CLL pathogenesis and TME interactions. Previously, we investigated how the novel BET inhibitor OPN-51107 (OPN5) prevents CLL disease expansion, modulates T-cell immune function, and alters gene expression related to MDSCs. In turn, we hypothesize that BET proteins such as BRD4 regulate MDSC functions, and subsequent pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 will alleviate MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL. Methods: Utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model of CLL, we evaluated BRD4 protein expression in MDSCs derived from the bone marrow of transgenic and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. We then investigated the ex vivo functionality of OPN5-treated MDSCs, expanded from Eµ-TCL1 and WT bone marrow in MDSC-supportive medium. Finally, we conducted an in vivo study utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 adoptive transfer mouse model to determine the in vivo effects of OPN5 on MDSCs and other immune populations. Results: Through the course of this study, we found that MDSCs isolated from Eμ-TCL1 mice upregulate BRD4 expression and are more immune-suppressive than their WT counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrated ex vivo OPN5 treatment reverses the immune-suppressive capacity of MDSCs isolated from leukemic mice, evident via enhanced T-cell proliferation and IFNγ production. Finally, we showed in vivo OPN5 treatment slows CLL disease progression and modulates immune cell populations, including MDSCs. Conclusions: Altogether, these data support BET inhibition as a useful therapeutic approach to reverse MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL.">

        <tr id="PV001 / #50Poster Topic:AS01 - Adaptive ImmunityJuvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune condition which causes significant morbidity in children and young adults. While many aspects of immune dysfunction have been studied extensively in adult-onset SLE, there is limited and contradictory evidence of how cytotoxic CD8+T cells contribute to disease pathogenesis, and studies exploring cytotoxicity in JSLE are rare.Detailed characterization of peripheral blood CD8+T cells was undertaken in JSLE patients (n=44, median age 22 years and disease duration 9 years) and age/sex-matched healthy controls (HC, n=68, median age 20 years). Multiparameter flow cytometric immunophenotyping, RNA sequencing, serum metabolomic profiling, cell culture assays/functionalin vitrostudies, and mitochondrial morphology studies were performed.Frequencies of CD8+T cells expressing the cytotoxic mediator perforin and effector cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-α were reduced in JSLE vs HC, irrespective of treatment or disease activity. Transcriptomic and serum metabolomic analysis identified that upregulated type I IFN signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disturbances underpinned these observations (see Figure). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that alteration in these pathways lead to a deficiency in effector memory (EM) JSLE CD8+T cells, which are enriched for cytotoxic mediator-expressing cells, due to enhanced apoptosis of these cells selectively in JSLE vs HC.Figure.Transcriptomic analysis reveals upregulation of IFN-α responses and potential metabolic and mitochondrial disturbances in CD8+T cells in JSLE. (a) Volcano plot showing differences in gene expression from RNA sequencing of CD8+ T cells from JSLE (n=26) vs HC (n=29). Blue and red points represent statistically significant differentially expressed genes below the FDR adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05. Blue and red arrows indicate number of statistically significant downregulated and upregulated genes, respectively. (b) Bar plot showing -log10p values and enrichment ratios (ER) of summary enriched pathway GO BP ontology terms in CD8+ T cells in JSLE vs HC using the 147 significantly upregulated and 91 significantly downregulated genes (FDR adjusted p<0.05). Statistical significance of enrichment was determined using a p-value cut-off of 0.01 and a minimum enrichment score of 1.5. Terms highlighted in red and blue represent pathways of potential interest, derived from upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) genes in JSLE vs HC. (c) Word cloud representing all words taken from significantly enriched pathways in Metascape GO enrichment and GSEA analysis of DEGs in CD8+ T cells in JSLE vs HC. Text size indicates the frequency of the word.Cytotoxic capacity of CD8+T cells is diminished in JSLE due to a numerical deficiency in EM CD8+T cells, which is linked to mitochondrial defects, dysregulated type I IFN signaling, and increased apoptosis. Future studies are needed to understand the therapeutic implications of these findings.">

        <tr id="Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) causes enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), a B-cell lymphoma in cattle. Previous studies have demonstrated that T cells of BLV-infected cattle show increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules, including programmed death-1 (PD-1), lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), leading to T-cell exhaustion. However, the key immune checkpoint molecules driving T-cell exhaustion in BLV-induced tumorigenesis remained unclear. In this study, we identified the key immune checkpoint molecules by performing comprehensive flow cytometric analyses of T cells from EBL cattle, and elucidated the phenotype and function of exhausted T cells using a transcriptomic analysis by RNA sequencing and cell culture assays. The comprehensive expression analysis revealed that the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells co-expressing PD-1 and TIM-3 was significantly increased in the peripheral blood and tumor tissues of EBL cattle compared to healthy cattle. Transcriptomic analysis of PD-1+TIM-3+ T cells revealed the upregulation of genes related to terminal exhaustion and the downregulation of genes related to T-cell differentiation and response in this subset. Additionally, PD-1+TIM-3+ T cells exhibited higher expression of CTLA-4, LAG-3, and Eomes, and lower expression of T-bet, suggesting a terminally exhausted phenotype. Cell culture assays revealed a significant impairment in IFN-γ production in PD-1+TIM-3+ T cells upon stimulation, reflecting severe dysfunction. These findings indicate that PD-1+TIM-3+ T cells play a central role in T-cell exhaustion during BLV-induced tumorigenesis. This study provides valuable insights for future therapeutic strategies against BLV infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly prevalent and deadly disease that is largely refractory to immunotherapy. The only CRC subset that responds to these therapies is characterized by prevalent microsatellite instability (MSI), extensive  CD8+ T cell infiltration and high expression of innate immune signaling pathways. Endogenous activation of the cGAS/STING pathway is essential for this CD8+ T cell antitumor response in MSI CRCs, suggesting that activating it in other CRCs could boost immunotherapy response rates. In contrast, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is typically associated with tumor-promoting inflammation although this has primarily been studied in immune cells. Methods We used a mixture of flow cytometry, activation assays, in vivo orthotopic models and patient-derived organoids to investigate the effect of NLRP3 activation in CRC cells on cGAS/STING-mediated antitumor immunity. Results Our results show that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome specifically in CRC cells boosts cGAS/STING signaling in both MSI and non-MSI CRCs and that dual stimulation increases CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. The ability of NLRP3 to enhance cGAS/STING signaling was specific and did not occur with activation of other innate immune pathways such as AIM2 or TLRs. Enhancement of cGAS/STING signaling by NLRP3 proceeded via a positive feedback loop that was inflammasome-independent and required early crosstalk between the signaling mediators and regulation of their gene expression. Conclusions Activation of NLRP3 specifically in CRC cells could be a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity in otherwise immunotherapy resistant CRCs.

        <tr id="Persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) is a severe condition that may follow sepsis and is characterized by ongoing inflammation and immune suppression, diminishing quality of life and potentially causing death. The role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in PICS, despite their association with thrombopoiesis, is not well understood. In this study, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile MKs in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained from 11 patients, including six with PICS, five with sepsis, and five healthy controls, to determine the diversity and molecular signatures of the MKs. Five subgroups of MKs are identified (MK1-MK5), and their proportions vary across the groups. MK1 and MK2 are predominant in PICS. Gene Ontology analysis shows that genes related to antigen processing and presentation and IL-17 signaling are enriched in MK1, whereas genes associated with platelet degranulation and neutrophil activation are enriched in MK2. Moreover, the expression level of CCL5 is markedly increased in MKs. Ligand-receptor analysis reveals dynamic interactions among MKs and T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages, suggesting a broad role of MKs in immune homeostasis. In PICS model mice, MKs regulate systemic inflammation by reducing the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A and promoting lung tissue repair. Our findings establish MKs as essential components of the immune system in PICS and provide new insights into their potential as therapeutic targets for post-sepsis immune dysfunction.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Macrophages play essential roles in generating a tolerogenic resident environment, but the interactions between bacteriophages and their action in macrophage tolerance memory remain unknown. Here, we find that gut bacteriophage exposure in vivo induces tolerance immunity via reprogrammed macrophages which significantly enhances protection against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Bacteriophage-memory macrophages orchestrate LPS-challenge responses into tolerization or hyperresponsive gene expression clusters in a function-specific manner. The tolerized gene cluster encodes pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the induction cluster is a defense-specific response including anti-inflammatory cytokines, antiviral and antimicrobial effectors, and negative regulators of inflammation. Mechanistically, this augmented defense response is dependent on increased expression of IL-10, but not suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, bacteriophages suppressed LPS-induced pro-inflammatory genes by repressing histone acetylation target enhancers that coordinate chromatin accessibility to limit inflammation. Thus, our study identifies the function and mechanism of reprogramming actions for bacteriophage in moderating LPS immune responses.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC), a leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits profound molecular heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) features that limit therapeutic efficacy. This review elucidates the dual roles of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in GC progression. TLS, ectopic lymphoid organs formed under chronic inflammation, correlate with improved survival and immunotherapy sensitivity by fostering effector T/B cell interactions and antigen presentation. Conversely, immunosuppressive TME components like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) drive immune evasion via cytokine-mediated suppression and checkpoint activation (PD-1/PD-L1). CD8+ T cells exert context-dependent effects, with high infiltration reducing recurrence risk but paradoxically inducing exhaustion in PD-L1-rich microenvironments. Th17 and memory T cells further modulate disease through IL-17-driven angiogenesis and CD45RO+ immune memory dynamics. Multi-omics-based TLS scoring and combinatorial therapies emerge as promising strategies to overcome resistance.">

        <tr id="Viral myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial damage. However, the involvement of immune cells and the interaction between immune cells and stromal cells remain poorly understood. We successfully established a mouse model of viral myocarditis induced by Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and systematically analyzed immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury at different time points. Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) was performed at the peak of immune cell infiltration to characterize the immune landscape of infected cardiac tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Macrophage depletion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition were performed to validate the immune‐stromal crosstalk. Peak immune cell infiltration and myocardial injury occurred on the 7th day of infection. scRNA‐seq revealed that endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) were the most substantially expanded cell populations in the hearts of mice with viral infection. Trem2 macrophage, characterized by tissue repair gene signatures, was the predominant MNP subcluster in the infected heart, while tip cells and capillaries were the most expanded endothelial cell clusters. Cell–cell communication analysis identified increased macrophage–endothelial cell interactions during CVB3 infection. Macrophage‐derived VEGFA secretion, partially induced by CVB3 infection and apoptotic cardiomyocyte debris, promoted angiogenesis, while macrophage depletion resulted in reduced VEGFA secretion and endothelial proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of VEGFR exacerbated cardiac dysfunction, highlighting the protective role of angiogenesis in myocarditis progression. In summary, these results elucidated a cardioprotective role of macrophage‐driven angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor signaling during viral myocarditis, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for inflammatory heart diseases.">

        <tr id="Inhaled fungal pathogens often generate granuloma-contained latent infections that can reactivate to cause invasive disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the inability to generate sterilizing immunity against latent infection remains poorly understood. Here, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics and flow cytometry to characterize the immune dynamics and cellular architecture of cryptococcal granulomas. Using fate mapping and murine genetic tools, we demonstrate that alternative activation of monocyte-derived myeloid cells by CD4+ T helper 2 cells antagonizes pulmonary fungal clearance during latent infection. In contrast to the prevailing view in the field, we find that alternatively activated myeloid cells are not an intrinsic replication niche for the fungus and more broadly, Cryptococcus predominantly resides in the extracellular environment. We propose a T helper 2 cell-myeloid circuit establishes a local immunosuppressive environment to drive extracellular fungal persistence, which could be leveraged as a new target for host-directed therapy to treat latent fungal infections.">

        <tr id="Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by pancytopenia and decreased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow, it can be either congenital or acquired, predominantly affecting adolescents and the elderly, with higher incidence in Asia compared to Europe and America. Current treatment options include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or immunosuppressive agents, yet proximately a third of patients fail to reach long-term survival. AA is primarily driven by immune-mediated destruction of HSPCs, initiated by self-activated T cells. Early stages feature a Th1 response, which later shifts to Th17 and effector memory CD8+ T cells. Key cytokines including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) play crucial roles in this immune dysregulation, influencing HSPCs and contributing to bone marrow failure. Furthermore, bone marrow macrophages (MΦ), particularly M1 subtype, are implicated in AA via the TNF-α/TNF-α receptor pathway, leading to T cell activating and subsequent HSPC damage. Interestingly, MΦ with high expression of IL-27Ra have been demonstrated to contribute to HSPC destruction in AA murine models. Beyond their role in thrombosis, platelets also participate in immune regulation. Some studies suggest that platelet may modulate T cell responses through mechanisms such as Akt-PGC1α-TFAM pathway or PF4-mediated activity, which could play a role in AA. However, direct evidence connecting platelet regulation to T cell-mediated HSPC damage is limited, and current research has largely focuses on CD8+ T cells. Moving forward, it is essential to investigate the interactions between platelets, CD4+ T cells, and mitochondrial energy metabolism. In this review, we propose that platelet-derived factors such as PF4 and TGFβ may activate mitochondrial pathways, influencing T cell activation and leading to HSPC destruction in AA. This hypothesis could provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AA and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies (Highlight).">

        <tr id="Background Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a severe complication in lung cancer, characterized by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and limited therapeutic options. This study investigates the role of IL-6 in regulating immune suppression and tumor progression in MPE and evaluates the efficacy of dual IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade. Methods IL-6 levels were measured in MPE and paired serum samples from lung cancer patients, and correlations with PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes were analyzed using publicly available datasets. RNA sequencing and immune deconvolution were used to assess immune cell infiltration. CAFs and immune cell infiltration were further evaluated using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and multiplex immunofluorescence. In vitro co-culture systems were employed to simulate the MPE microenvironment and explore IL-6 interactions with CAFs, as well as its regulatory effect on tumor cell PD-L1 expression. Results IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in MPE compared to paired serum and correlated with higher PD-L1 expression and poor survival outcomes in lung cancer patients. In the MPE mouse model, combination therapy with IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade reduced MPE volume, tumor burden, and PD-L1 expression, while enhancing T cell infiltration and alleviating TME immunosuppression. IL-6 was found to drive a positive feedback loop with iCAFs, promoting an immunosuppressive environment. In vitro, IL-6 from the MPE upregulated tumor cell PD-L1 expression the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Conclusion This study identifies IL-6 as a critical contributor of immune suppression and tumor progression in MPE. The combination of IL-6 and PD-L1 blockade effectively alleviated immunosuppression and reduced tumor burden, offering a potential therapeutic approach for MPE management.

        <tr id="Background Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-natural killer (NK) cell therapy has demonstrated safety and feasibility in clinical settings; however, limited efficacy due to intrinsic dysfunction and extrinsic suppression remains an unresolved issue. T cells provide multifaceted support to NK cell-mediated responses. Here, we aimed to design a novel CD19-targeted CAR-NK, engineered with secreted interleukin-15 and C-C motif chemokine ligand 21 (ie, 15×21 CAR-NK), capable of recruiting and cooperating with T cells. Methods We characterized 15×21 CAR-NK cells by performing experiments in vitro and in mouse models, and conducting RNA sequencing. Results 15×21 CAR-NK cells exhibit strong capabilities in cytotoxicity, cytokine production, effector molecule expression, and T-cell recruitment in vitro. Cooperation with T cells promoted efficient tumor-cell elimination, alleviated mutual exhaustion phenotypes, and enhanced the expression of effector molecules/receptors. The recruitment and cooperative effects also result in effective tumor control in mouse models. In addition, 15×21 CAR-NK cells strongly enrich the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway - a key intracellular signaling cascade that is associated with enhanced downstream pro-survival signaling, anti-apoptotic ability, mitochondrial function, and cytotoxicity. Conclusions Our study highlights the intrinsic advantages and extrinsic T-cell cooperative benefits of 15×21 CAR-NK cells, providing a promising strategy for NK-cell-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical sentinels of the immune system, serving as indispensable bridges between innate and adaptive immune responses. DCs are a heterogeneous population, with subsets playing specialized roles in immune defense, tolerance, or disease development. Among these, the recently redefined DC3 subset has gained attention for its unique features and potential roles in health and disease. This review focuses on the phenotypic, functional, and developmental diversity of DC subsets—primarily DC3s—and their contributions to cancer. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors is characterized by varying degrees of immune cell infiltration, including DCs. Within the TME, DCs play diverse roles, either promoting anti-tumor responses or facilitating immune evasion. Key subsets include conventional type 1 and type 2 DCs (cDC1s and cDC2s), as well as plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). DC3s share certain features with cDC2s and monocytes but are distinct in their phenotype, function, and ontogeny. Functionally, DC3s can prime and activate T cells, skewing CD4+ T cells towards Th17 and stimulating CD8+ T cells with a tissue-resident memory phenotype. In cancer, their presence correlates with diverse outcomes depending on the TME: DC3 presence is linked to increased survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and oropharyngeal cancer while in non-small-cell lung cancer and melanoma it is associated with immunosuppression. The emerging understanding of DC3s highlights the complexity of DC biology and its relevance to diseases. The dynamic immunomodulatory functions of DC3s open new avenues for developing targeted therapies against cancer and immune-mediated disorders.">

        <tr id="People living with HIV and who initiated antiretroviral therapy (PLH) at the chronic stage of the infection are generally exposed to persistent inflammation. We here assessed the impact of the interferon (IFN)/JAK-STAT pathway on myeloid cells from PLH and the potential of a JAK1/2 inhibitor, Baricitinib, to prevent IFN-driven myeloid cell activation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 16 chronically infected and virologically suppressed PLH were compared to 15 healthy uninfected individuals (UI) before and after exposure to type 1 IFN, type 2 IFN, and Baricitinib. First, we report an increased activation profile on monocytes and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) from PLH compared to UI, associated with a higher expression of PD-L1 and CD11b ex-vivo, and elevated transcription of pd-l1, cxcl-10 and ifnar1. Then, we unveil the role of type 1 and 2 IFN as inducers of PD-L1 expression at the transcriptional and protein level and highlight an increased response to IFN in PLH myeloid cells, associated with the delay before antiretroviral therapy initiation and the level of CD4 T cell depletion. Last, we describe the preventive effects of Baricitinib on IFN-driven PD-L1 expression. Our study shows that PLH harbor signs of myeloid cell activation, associated with increased type 1 and 2 IFN-signaling, which could be reversed by JAK1/2 inhibitors in vitro.

        <tr id="Targeting inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major unmet need. Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2LD) selectively increases regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers in patients with coronary artery disease. Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor analyses and show that IL-2LD clonally expands effector Treg cells in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The clonally expanded Treg cells upregulate key immunosuppressive and metabolic pathways and show an increased number of predicted ligand–receptor interactions. These Treg cells also display similar predicted antigen specificities, which cluster with published sequences specific to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. By tracking the T cell receptors of single cells over time, we identify an inflammatory polarization of the T cell compartment after myocardial infarction, which is restrained by IL-2LD. We identify BACH2 as a repressor of the Treg effector program. However, BACH2-mediated regulation is bypassed with IL-2LD. Overall, these results lend insight into the IL-2-driven clonal expansion program in human Treg cells, with important therapeutic implications for patients with cardiovascular and other immune-mediated diseases.">

        <tr id="Introduction: In mouse models of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an effective anti-leukemia immune response was obtained by depleting a specific regulatory T-cell (Treg) subset. While STAT5 signaling could alter the homeostasis of naïve (nTreg) and activated (aTreg) subsets, which are capable of suppressing also CLL patients’ responses to microbial antigens, perturbed STAT3 signaling could drive CXCR5 expression in circulating T-follicular regulatory cells (Tfr) and their entry into the lymph node/tumor microenvironment. Materials and Methods: By using phospho-specific flow cytometry, we monitored STAT signaling/phosphorylation (pSTAT), in vitro responses to Sars-Cov2-antigen-specific stimulation, and circulating Treg subsets in relation to Binet stage and total tumor mass/tumor distribution (TTM/TD) scoring in 62 patients with CLL. Results: The percentage of CXCR5+ Treg significantly increased in patients with Binet stage B disease, and Tfr-like subsets were associated with higher TTM and lower TD. The pSTAT3 levels in CD4+ T-cells were only significantly increased in patients undergoing therapy. Lower nTreg percentages correlated with increased disease duration, and an increased aTreg/nTreg ratio correlated with SARS-CoV-2-antigen-induced STAT5 signaling responses. Conclusions: The results show increased amounts of circulating CXCR5+ Tfr-like subsets in patients with extensive lymph node involvement and augmented STAT3 signaling in patients on therapy. While STAT5 responses may drive nTreg differentiation into aTreg, nTreg decline is associated with increased disease duration.">

This study compared the immunomodulatory effects of alpha-emitting (225Ac) and beta-emitting (177Lu) radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT) using NM600 in murine prostate cancer models. Methods We assessed immunological changes in TRAMP-C1 and Myc-CaP tumor models treated with 225Ac-NM600 or 177Lu-NM600. Flow cytometry was used to profile immune cell populations, activation markers, and checkpoint molecules, while multiplex assays analyzed cytokine and chemokine expression. Results In general, 225Ac-NM600 elicited stronger immunomodulatory effects than 177Lu-NM600, including cell line dependent increased CD8/Treg ratios, activation of effector and memory T cells, and depletion of suppressive Tregs and MDSCs. The treatment elevated Th1 cytokines, pro-inflammatory chemokines, and checkpoint molecules like PD-1 on CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 on MDSCs, creating a more “hot” TME. Conclusion Alpha-emitting 225Ac-NM600 demonstrated superior ability to enhance antitumor immunity compared to beta-emitting 177Lu-NM600.

        <tr id="Despite the proven clinical activity of checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in several cancer indications, frequent occurrence of primary and secondary resistance reduces their overall effectiveness. Development of ICI resistance has been attributed mainly to genetic or epigenic alterations that affect the tumor antigen presentation machinery leading to diminished anti-tumor immune responses. There is an urgent need for new approaches which can either re-sensitize resistant tumors to the ICIs or engage alternate immune pathways to inhibit tumors. Intratumoral delivery of nanoparticle encapsulated murine IL12 (mIL12) mRNA induces powerful anti-tumor immune responses in murine tumor models, and the human version of this drug results in objective responses in patients with advanced disease. Here, we tested the efficacy of mIL12 mRNA as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibodies in ICI-sensitive Yummer 1.7 melanoma and MC38 colorectal murine tumors and in ICI resistant, β2-microglobulin (B2M) knockout versions of these models. mIL12 mRNA monotherapy was sufficient to cause complete responses (CRs) in ≥ 60% of both ICI-sensitive or -resistant Yummer 1.7 melanoma and MC38 colorectal carcinoma tumors. The mIL12 mRNA treatment resulted in potent upregulation of TH1 type cytokines and chemokines. A reduction in number of Tregs, increase in numbers and activation state of both cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) as well as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was observed indicating enhanced anti-tumor, cell-based immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. This mIL12-induced concerted immune activation was associated with a robust killing and phagocytosis of tumor cells resulting in durable CRs. These observations suggest that intratumoral IL12mRNA therapy may benefit patients with ICI-resistant cancers.

        <tr id="Regulatory B cells (B regs) are immune cells that help suppress excessive inflammatory responses by interacting with other immune components. Among them, B-10 cells are known for their strong immunoregulatory function. This study focused on how B-10 cells influence macrophage phenotype and function through the PD-1 signaling pathway. To investigate this, B-10 cells derived from mouse spleens were co-cultured with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from either wild-type (WT) or PD-1 knockout (PD-1 KO) mice, using both direct contact and Transwell setups. The findings indicated that direct co-culture with B-10 cells significantly promoted the polarization of macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory M2 type, characterized by increased expression of surface markers (F4/80+, CD206+, CD163+), higher levels of PD-1, and upregulation of M2-related genes (IL-1ra, IL-10, Arg-1, IL-6, and CCL1). These macrophages also exhibited enhanced phagocytic activity and greater secretion of specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPMs) like RvD2 and 15-epi LXA4. In contrast, these effects were reduced when B-10 cells were cultured indirectly or when PD-1 was absent. These findings suggest that B-10 cells promote anti-inflammatory macrophage activity primarily through PD-1 signaling, offering insights into potential therapeutic approaches for controlling inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (VCA) is an important therapeutic option for patients that incur debilitating injuries to the face or limbs. The complexity and immunogenicity of tissue types within VCA grafts pose unique challenges and necessitate the use of intensive immunosuppression; however, graft rejection remains a challenge in VCA. Methods Deep proteomic profiling and high dimensional analysis with cytometry time of flight were used to define the cell types and effector mechanisms elicited by VCA in BALB/c (H-2Kd) > C57BL/6 (H-2Kb) limb recipients. Spleen and cervical draining lymph nodes were collected post-transplant days 1, 3, 5, and 7 (n =4–6 mice/group/day). We identified dynamic, coordinated signatures in T cell and monocyte populations associated with VCA allograft rejection. Results In comparison to syngeneic transplant recipients, allogeneic recipients exhibited significant alterations in the immune cell populations within secondary lymphoid tissues. These changes included very early expansion of double-negative TCRβ- T cells, including IL-17A-producing γδ T cells, and patrolling monocytes. Subsequently, CD8+CD62L+ T cells and CD8+ effector/effector memory T cells (Teff/Tem), Ly6ChiCCR2hiCX3CR1low classical monocytes, CD4+ Teff/Tem, and CD8+CD25hiCCR7low Teff/Tem were increased by day 5. CD8+CD25hiCCR7low Teff/Tem with the highest expression of IFN-γ, perforin, and granzyme B were enriched by day 7. Conclusions High dimensional proteomic analysis reveals multiple innate and Teff/Tem subsets in acute rejection following VCA. In particular, IL-17A-producing γδ T cells and classical monocytes may be particularly important in initiating the alloimmune response in VCA recipients.">

        <tr id="Immunocompromise is a hallmark of cancer, affecting both the peripheral immune system and local tumor microenvironment (TME). Current immunotherapies like checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, and neo-antigen vaccines show limited efficacy due to severe immunosuppression in most patients. Here, we report an immunologically engineered injectable nano-hydrogel (iHG) that can: (i) recruit the desired set of immune cells away from the suppressed TME and peripheral organs, (ii) activate them within a protective ambit of engineered immune-stimulatory hydrogel niche, and (iii) release them to target cancer even in distant locations. Biodegradable and injectable iHG compositions were tested and optimized for their ability to attract and activate dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T cells via STING, TLR, CD86, and Th1-polarized cytokine pathway without requiring exogenously introduced neo-antigens as vaccines. In a mouse melanoma model, optimized iHGs elicited a robust antitumor immune response through innate and adaptive arms. Most importantly, iHGs as a single agent immunomodulator exhibited better tumor control than when combined with anti-PD1 immune checkpoint antibody. These findings highlight the potential of engineering immunologically functional and injectable hydrogel niches as a new type of immunotherapeutics to reprogram immune cells to overcome both local and systemic immunosuppression and combat cancer effectively.">

        <tr id="Background Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is associated with over-activation, which contributes to disease progression. Platelet-leukocyte aggregates play a critical role in HIV-1 infection. However, research on the characteristics of platelet-natural killer (NK) cell aggregates in HIV-infected individuals still has certain limitations. Methods Platelet-NK cell aggregates in the peripheral blood of participants were detected by flow cytometry and confirmed by imaging flow cytometry. Platelet activation was evaluated by CD62P expression. The expression of various activating and inhibitory receptors, markers of apoptosis, lipid droplets, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Granzyme B, and Perforin in platelet-NK cell aggregates were assessed. The signaling lymphocyte activating molecule (SLAM) family receptors in both platelets and NK cells and the levels of phosphorylation signals in NK cells were respectively measured through flow cytometry. Results In this study, we observed an increase in platelet-NK cell aggregates that were negatively correlated with CD4 count, a prognostic marker for HIV-1 disease progression. Furthermore, platelet activation was inversely associated with both HIV-1 disease progression and the platelet-NK cell aggregates. However, antiretroviral therapy (ART) couldn’t restore the levels of these aggregates or platelet activation. Compared to platelet-free NK cells, platelet-NK cell aggregates exhibited over-activation (CD69) and exhaustion phenotypes (CD39, LAG-3, PD-1), increased levels of apoptosis (Annexin V and CD95) and lipid droplets (Bodipy 493/503 and LipidTOX). Furthermore, NK cells' cytokine secretion (IFN-γ) and cytotoxic function (Granzyme B and Perforin) within the aggregates were declined. Screening results of SLAM receptors in NK cells and platelets suggested that platelets may transmit signals to NK cells via SLAMF5. Moreover, elevated levels of p-Fyn, p-PLC-γ2, p-SHP-1, and p-SHP-2 denoted disturbances in the downstream signals of the SLAM family within platelet-NK cell aggregates. Conclusion Our study indicates that platelet-NK cell aggregates exhibit characteristics of over-activation and dysfunction during HIV-1 infection. Hyperactivated platelets and the formation of platelet-NK cell aggregates contribute to the HIV-1 disease progression and the inflammation of the immune system. These findings may implicate potential targets of overactivated platelets for HIV-1 disease progression.

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet its clinical efficacy remains limited to a subset of patients with specific tumor types. The present review provides a comprehensive analysis of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity from both local and systemic perspectives, with particular emphasis on CD8+ T cells as primary effectors. The review discusses how the complex trafficking between the tumor microenvironment (TME), surrounding lymphoid tissues and peripheral circulation creates multiple opportunities for tumors to evade immune surveillance. Within the TME, T-cell exclusion mechanisms, antigen specificity and the spectrum of T-cell exhaustion states, from progenitor exhausted T cells to terminally exhausted T-cell phenotypes, are reviewed. Beyond the local TME, the crucial roles of tumor-draining lymph nodes and tertiary lymphoid structures in maintaining sustainable antitumor immunity, as well as the significance of circulating T cells as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, are analyzed. This systemic perspective provides insights into the dynamic nature of antitumor immunity and suggests potential strategies for next-generation immunotherapies, including combination approaches targeting multiple immune compartments to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.">

This review summarizes recent studies in understanding tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) biology, highlighting CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) as pivotal regulators of immune surveillance and suppression. We summarize emerging biomarkers such as TCR clonality, spatial distribution of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and exhaustion markers including PD-1, TCF1, and TIM-3, which predict immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy beyond PD-L1 expression. This review specifically describes radiotherapy-induced immunogenic remodeling and peripheral T cell dynamics as innovative strategies to monitor immune response and resistance mechanisms. By integrating results from single-cell omics and AI-driven spatial analysis, we propose multidimensional frameworks of TIL in NSCLC to overcome resistance and optimize immunotherapy combinations.

        <tr id="Programmed Death Receptor-1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor expressed on the surface of T cells. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, are among the most widely utilized immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy, dramatically improving the prognosis of patients with various malignancies. Traditionally, platelets, which are cytoplasmic fragments derived from megakaryocytes, have been primarily recognized for their roles in hemostasis and coagulation. However, recent studies have highlighted the emerging role of platelets in cancer biology and therapy. Platelets can modulate immune cell functions through various mechanisms, including the release of bioactive molecules and direct interactions with immune cells. A deeper understanding of the interplay between platelets and immune responses could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment. In our research, in patients with better treatment responses, there are higher levels of mature and activated CD8+ T cells in their PBMCs prior to treatment. Additionally, the activation of platelets is also more pronounced, and the proteins expressed on these platelets may modulate immune cells. After receiving immunotherapy, patients in the responsive (R) group exhibited a higher abundance of activated effector CD8+ T cells, which demonstrated stronger immune response capabilities. Furthermore, the increased levels of activated platelets in the R group may contribute to the regulation of CD8+ effector memory T cells, influencing their quantity and function. Our study suggests that the functional state of CD8+ T cells and the level of activated platelets prior to treatment may serve as predictive indicators for the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in head and neck cancer patients. Activated CD8+ effector T cells may contribute to the differences in immunotherapy responses, with activated platelets playing a role in promoting the maturation and activation of CD8+ effector memory T cells.These insights help better understand the interactions between platelets and immune cells, particularly emphasizing the role of CD8+ effector memory T cells in immunotherapy. Additionally, they offer potential strategies for predicting patient responses to PD-1 inhibitor treatment and optimizing the efficacy of immunotherapy.

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) includes a uniquely regulated immune response that supports homeostasis, response to injury, and response to pathogens. Recent work has shown that virus-associated immune responses in the CNS may contribute to neuronal injury and long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive decline. However, the fundamental mechanisms that regulate acute infiltration of immune cells from vascular compartments into the CNS are not well defined. Using an attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC83 (referred to as TC83) to inoculate using olfactory and intracranial injections, we show that infection in the CNS and olfactory pathways results in rapid infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as early as 3- and 5-days post-infection. CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells exhibit a bystander, memory phenotype (CD49d+, Tbet+, NKG2D+, Eomes+), are cytotoxic, and are recruited independent of antigen specific responses. We show that infiltration of CD8+ bystander T-cells is supported by microglia and infiltrating macrophage expression of IL-15 and interferon expression in the CNS. These innate antiviral immune signals support activation of bystander CD8+ T-cells in the CNS that contribute to tissue injury independent of virus replication at early time points post-infection. These data support a mechanism by IL-15 stimulates bystander memory CD8+ T-cells to enter the CNS and contribute to injury independent of antigen-specific stimulation. Importance Prior studies have shown that virus infections in the respiratory and olfactory nerve pathways can result in long term injury in the brain. However, the mechanisms that link virus infection in the olfactory neurons and brain injury are not understood. We show that virus infection of olfactory neurons results in immune stimulation in the brain of resident immune cells to release a cytokine called IL-15 and interferon. This results in infiltration and activation of non-specific T-cells that cause injury of neurons in the brain. This may be an important mechanism by which respiratory viruses and other viruses cause inflammation and injury in the brain.">

        <tr id="IL-17A-expressing lymphocytes, including Tc17 cells, are instrumental in immunity, immunopathology, and autoimmunity. We have previously shown that experimental attenuated live fungal vaccine-induced Tc17 cells are stable, long-lived without plasticity, and necessary to mediate sterilizing immunity during CD4+ T cell deficiency, which poses higher susceptibility to fungal infections. Cell metabolism is integral for T cell homeostasis but the metabolic adaptations of Tc17 cells are poorly defined. In this study, we hypothesized that effector Tc17 cells adopt high energy-yielding metabolic pathways to form stable, long-lived memory cells in vivo. Using a mouse model of attenuated fungal vaccination, we found that effector Tc17 cells were metabolically highly active with higher proliferation and protein synthesis than IFNγ+ CD8+ T (Tc1) cells. Glucose was necessary for effector Tc17 cell expansion but with less dependency during the late expansion despite the active metabolism. Contrary to established dogma, we found that the effector Tc17 cells preferentially channeled the glucose to OXPHOS than glycolysis, which was correlated with higher mitochondrial mass and membrane potential. Inhibition of OXPHOS shrunk the Tc17 responses while sparing Tc1 cell responses. Tc17 cells actively relied on OXPHOS throughout the expansion period, resisting adaptation to aerobic glycolysis. Our data showed that the effector Tc17 cells predominantly utilize glucose for metabolism through OXPHOS rather than aerobic glycolysis. Our study has implications in vaccine design to enhance the efficacy and immunotherapeutics to modulate the immunity and autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="The roles of circulating complement C3, produced in hepatocytes, in immune defense are well defined in the literature. Interestingly, the C3 gene evolved before the circulatory system, suggesting an essential but yet unknown role of locally produced C3. Here, we investigated the effect of C3 on cancer immunotherapy and found that cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived C3, not hepatocyte-derived C3, determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Tumors developed in CAF-specific C3 knockout mice exhibited resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, with increased immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage infiltration. Mechanistically, the C3 degradation product iC3b suppressed myeloid cell infiltration via complement receptor 3 signaling, and the therapeutic targeting of this pathway restored ICB sensitivity of immunotherapy-resistant tumors. In human cancers, stromal C3 expression correlates with reduced M2-like macrophage infiltration and improved immunotherapeutic outcomes. These data demonstrate the role of locally produced C3 in the innate immune response, which may have been conserved across many organisms.">

In addition to its function in host defense, trained immunity contributes to diverse immune-mediated diseases.

We found that C1q leads to profound reprogramming of myeloid cell metabolism, particularly glycolysis, and exerts control over the transcriptional regulation of important metabolic and inflammatory genes. We corroborate our findings by identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms close to the C1q gene that are linked to induction of trained immunity by Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) or beta-glucan in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results reveal an immunomodulatory role for C1q and provide evidence of a molecular interaction between the complement system and innate immune memory.

        <tr id="Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest primary brain tumor in adults, where current therapies fail to meaningfully extend survival. Available animal GBM tumor models, especially therapy-resistant and recurrent ones with unique immunological aspects, are restricted, impeding innovative treatment research. To confront this critical obstacle we established a unique GBM mouse model that utilizes patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) within humanized mice. Methods We selected two immune-deficient mouse models to facilitate the reconstitution of myeloid lineage cells. After undergoing myeloablation, mice received CD34+ hematopoietic stem progenitor cells derived from human umbilical cord blood for humanization. Upon confirming the reconstitution of human blood cells, mice were xenografted with PDXs resistant to radiation. Tumor profiles and immune cell infiltration were analyzed via flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The findings were evaluated against scRNA-seq data from recurrent human GBM. Results A diverse range of human immune cells, including T, NK, and myeloid lineage cells, infiltrated PDX tumors in humanized mice. Notably, gene expression profiles in these immune cells resembled that of recurrent human GBM. Unlike conventional xenograft models, this model highlighted enhanced tumor diversity, particularly a high fraction of neural progenitor-like cells. Conclusions Our humanized GBM mouse model displayed an immune cell signature similar to recurrent GBM. This model is a valuable resource for analyzing the tumor immune landscape and assessing new therapies, particularly immunotherapies. By enabling effective evaluation of novel treatments, our model has the potential to significantly advance GBM research. Key Points A wide array of human immune cells infiltrates GBM-PDX tumors in humanized mice. The tumor heterogeneity of GBM-PDX is more evident in humanized mouse xenografts. Importance of the study Current GBM treatment development is primarily constrained by the absence of appropriate animal models that can enhance our understanding of human GBM biology and its immune dynamics. We created a specialized GBM mouse model using humanized mice with patient-derived xenografts resistant to radiation. Detailed immune cell analysis showed various human blood cells in the GBM-PDX derived from humanized mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered crucial T-cell subgroups, notably regulatory and exhausted T cells, which matched those observed in recurrent GBM patient tumors. Moreover, the model outperformed standard xenograft approaches in tumor heterogeneity, resembling the intricate diversity observed in recurrent GBM samples. Our humanized GBM mouse model provides a powerful platform to study the interactions between human tumors and immune cells. This tool will facilitate the discovery of immunosuppressive mechanisms and accelerate the assessment of immunotherapies applicable to various brain tumors.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer globally and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, following lung cancer. Despite the immune system’s capacity for tumor surveillance and elimination, CRC tumors can evade immune responses through complex mechanisms, ultimately escaping immune detection. T and B lymphocytes play a critical role in adaptive immunity against tumors, with T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, driving tumor elimination. Additionally, B cells contribute by producing tumor-specific antibodies, including various immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses that participate in immune modulation. However, the effectiveness of adaptive immunity in CRC is often limited due to tumor-driven immunosuppression. This study investigates the expression of T and B cell activation genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from CRC patients. A panel of 84 genes involved in T and B cell activation was analyzed to assess changes in expression using RT2 QPCR arrays. Additionally, we measured serum levels of the four IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) in CRC patients to explore possible alterations in humoral immunity. Compared to healthy controls, 5 genes were found to be downregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCL3 (fold regulation − 6.36), IL6 (fold regulation − 12.46), CSF2 (fold regulation − 7.50), CXCR3 (fold regulation − 3.01), and TNFSF14 (fold regulation − 4.90). Moreover, 13 genes were upregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCR3 (fold regulation 59.21), CD2 (fold regulation 3.07), CD27 (fold regulation 6.39), CD3G (fold regulation 4.15), CD8B (fold regulation 3.25), FAS (fold regulation 3.94), IL10 (fold regulation 39), IL18R1 (fold regulation 82.39), IL5 (fold regulation 20.4), LAG3 (fold regulation 19.88), MAP3K7 (fold regulation 4.07), TLR1 (fold regulation 6.45), and TLR6 (fold regulation 18.87). The serum levels of the four IgG subclasses were however statistically insignificant in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. Our findings provide insights into the adaptive immune dysfunction in CRC, offering a detailed profile of gene expression changes associated with T and B cell activation and antibody production. Understanding these dysregulations may enhance the development of targeted immunotherapies, potentially improving outcomes for CRC patients through more personalized immunomodulatory approaches.

TAMs are highly plastic and intricately linked to the antitumor activity and functionality of CD8+ T cells.

Modulation of several chief signaling pathways within TAMs can steer them towards either an immunoinflammatory or immunosuppressive state. This can be achieved indirectly through cancer therapies or by directly targeting TAMs. New detailed insights into the immunostimulatory reprogramming of TAMs inspire the design of novel combinatory strategies that can be extrapolated to bolster cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is characterized by a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that enables EOC progression and limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. In this study, we demonstrated that isogenic BRCA2-mutated PEO1 and BRCA2-wild type PEO4 EOC cells induced immunosuppressive TMEs through distinct mechanisms. PEO1 cells produced IFNγ-induced PD-L1 and expressed CD39 and CD73 for generating adenosine. Treatment with the adenosine antagonist CGS15943 reversed PEO1 cell-mediated suppression of effector T cell activation. In contrast, PEO4 cells secreted IFNγ-induced CXCL10 and promoted up-regulation of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Treatment with the CXCL10/CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 attenuated PEO4 cell-induced Tregs and decreased IL10 production. In vivo, administration of a monoclonal antibody against CXCR3 effectively hindered the progression of tumor ascites and prolonged survival in the p53(-/-) ID8 EOC syngeneic mouse model. Additionally, AMG487 treatment synergized with the VEGFA inhibitor bevacizumab, significantly reducing tumor ascites and extending mouse survival. Collectively, our results reveal that EOC leverages CXCL10-induced Tregs or adenosine signaling to dampen T cell-mediated anti-cancer immune responses. These findings suggest that targeting CXCL10/CXCR3 and adenosine signaling could effectively counter immunosuppression of EOC, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for improving patient outcomes.

        <tr id="Introduction Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a recently characterized subset of lymphocytes with critical effector and regulatory functions. Based on distinct phenotypic markers and cytokine secretion profiles, ILCs are classified into three subtypes: ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) is characterized by heightened cytokine levels and dysregulated inflammatory responses, potentially affecting immune cell composition. In this study, we aimed to assess the frequency and absolute number of ILCs in the BM and peripheral blood (PB) of healthy individuals (HI) and compare them to those in MDS-BM. Methods ILC subsets were identified and quantified using multiparameter flow cytometry and histological analysis of BM and PB samples. Results ILC1 populations were consistently detected in all PB and BM samples. In contrast, ILC2 and ILC3 subsets were present in both BM and PB of healthy individuals but were largely absent in MDS-BM samples. Additionally, our findings suggest the existence of a potential maturation trajectory for BM-resident ILCs. Discussion These data indicate a disruption in the ILC maturation continuum within the MDS-affected BM compared to healthy BM, potentially contributing to the immunopathogenesis of MDS.">

        <tr id="Regulatory immune cells are pivotal in maintaining immune homeostasis and modulating immune responses to prevent pathologies. While T regulatory cells (Tregs) are extensively recognized for their immunosuppressive roles, emerging subsets of regulatory cells, including regulatory CD8+ cells (CD8+Tregs) regulatory B cells (Bregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory dendritic cells (DCregs), regulatory innate lymphoid cells (ILCregs), and regulatory natural killer cells (NKregs), are garnering increased attention. This review delves into the phenotypic characteristics, mechanisms of action, and immune-regulatory functions of these lesser-known but crucial immune cell subsets. The review provides a comprehensive examination of each cell type, detailing their origins, unique functionalities, and contributions to immune homeostasis. It emphasizes the complex interplay among these cells and how their coordinated regulatory activities influence immune responses in diverse pathological and therapeutic contexts, including autoimmunity, cancer immunotherapy, chronic inflammation, and transplant tolerance. By unraveling these mechanisms, the review outlines novel therapeutic avenues, such as targeting these regulatory cells to modulate immune activity and enhance precision medicine approaches. The future of immunotherapy and immune modulation lies in leveraging the expanded knowledge of these regulatory immune cells, presenting challenges and opportunities in clinical applications.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are a diverse population of immune cells that play a central role in tumor immunity and have emerged as critical mediators in cancer immunotherapy. This review explores the phenotypic and functional diversity of TILs—including CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells—and their dynamic interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). While TILs can drive tumor regression, their activity is often hindered by immune checkpoint signaling, metabolic exhaustion, and stromal exclusion. We highlight TIL recruitment, activation, and polarization mechanisms, focusing on chemokine gradients, endothelial adhesion molecules, and dendritic cell-mediated priming. Special emphasis is placed on preclinical models that evaluate TIL function, including 3D tumor spheroids, organoid co-cultures, syngeneic mouse models, and humanized systems. These provide valuable platforms for optimizing TIL-based therapies. Furthermore, we examine the prognostic and predictive value of TILs across cancer types, their role in adoptive cell therapy, and the challenges of translating preclinical success into clinical efficacy. Emerging technologies such as single-cell sequencing, neoantigen prediction, and biomaterial platforms are transforming our understanding of TIL biology and enhancing their therapeutic potential. Innovative strategies—ranging from genetic engineering and combination therapies to targeted modulation of the TME—are being developed to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve TIL persistence, infiltration, and cytotoxicity. This review integrates current advances in TIL research and therapy, offering a comprehensive foundation for future clinical translation. TILs hold significant promise as both biomarkers and therapeutic agents, and with continued innovation, they are poised to become a cornerstone of personalized cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis represent established therapies for many cancers. However, resistance occurs in most patients due to complex immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment. NK cells can play effector roles in tumor control, but their impact on T-cell dysfunction and ICB efficacy remains controversial. Through genetic and antibody-mediated NK cell depletion, we found that a subset of tumor-associated NK cells plays a negative role in ICB sensitivity; they further impede CD8+ T-cell differentiation toward a CD69+ BCL2+ EOMES+ GZMB+ TIM3- GITR- phenotype. Mechanistically, the retinoic acid receptor α-dependent differentiation program in CD8+ T cells is hindered by tumor-infiltrating NK cells via competition for IFNα and IL-2. Finally, we observed that lower frequencies of NK cells correlate with better clinical responses to ICBs in patients with cancer. These findings suggest potential avenues for enhancing CD8+ T cell-centered immunotherapy by targeting regulatory NK cells.


SIGNIFICANCE
Although NK cells are traditionally viewed as antitumor effectors, our study uncovers their unexpected suppressive role in CD8+ T cell-based immunotherapy. By competing for cytokines, they disrupt retinoic acid receptor α-driven CD8+ T-cell differentiation and limit ICB efficacy. Clinically, reduced NK cell presence is associated with an enhanced immunotherapy response. See related article by Pozniak et al. p. XX.">

        <tr id="Pulmonary fibrosis is an interstitial lung disease characterized by chronic progressive fibrosis. It is associated with fibrocyte proliferation and collagen deposition, leading to severe, irreversible lung function decline. Despite extensive research, the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis are complicated and have no effective treatment. During the formation of pulmonary fibrosis, immune dysregulation by inflammatory cell infiltration is the key driver of pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, single-cell sequencing analysis of silicosis mice showed that various cells in the alveolar immune microenvironment are involved in forming pulmonary fibrosis, such as macrophages, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, etc. Among them, T cell subpopulations in silicosis mice were significantly activated, indicating that T lymphocyte subsets play an essential role in the process of pulmonary fibrosis. More and more pulmonary clinical studies show that T lymphocytes in the lung immune microenvironment play an important and multifaceted role. This article summarizes the role of CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells in pulmonary fibrosis. This article provides some new insight into the potential therapy target that can delay the process of pulmonary fibrosis by regulating the proportions of different subpopulations of T lymphocytes and some related signaling pathways.">

        <tr id="Neoantigen-reactive peripheral blood lymphocytes (NeoPBL) are tumor-specific T cells found at ultra-low frequencies in the blood. Unlike tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), NeoPBL exist in a favorable less dysfunctional phenotypic state in vivo, but their rarity has precluded their effective use as cell therapy. Leveraging a priori knowledge of bona fide neoantigens, we combined high-intensity neoantigen stimulation with bead extraction of neoantigen peptide-pulsed target cells to enable the enrichment of NeoPBL to frequencies comparable to ex vivo cultured TIL over a 28-day period. Throughout this process, NeoPBL demonstrate specific reactivity against autologous tumor organoids and maintain memory-like features, including elevated expression of CD28 and TCF7. We additionally demonstrate that NeoPBL reactivity is polyclonal, encompassing multiple clonotypes that are detectable within in vivo TIL populations, underscoring physiological specificity for the targeted neoantigens. This streamlined process yields clinically relevant cell doses and enables identification and expansion of blood-derived neoantigen-specific TCRs. By potentially avoiding additional surgical risks and protracted delays of TIL and individualized TCR-engineered methods, the NeoPBL platform may have clinical and practical advantages. Ultimately, NeoPBL combines intrinsic cell fitness, minimal invasiveness and rapidity to potentially facilitate personalized adoptive cell therapy for cancer.">

Progress in immunopharmacology, aided by single-cell analytics, increasingly highlights immune complexity and functional heterogeneity. Conventional categories contain diverse subsets, including various T cells (helper, regulatory, memory) and B cells (plasma, memory, regulatory). Innate immune cells like macrophages, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells also exist in various functional states. These subsets exhibit distinct pharmacological response profiles that are often obscured by bulk analyses. This review explores the differential responses of critical immune cell subsets within the gastric cancer tumor microenvironment to current therapeutic modalities, encompassing cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecular targeted agents, and immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. We delve into the molecular processes underlying subset-specific drug effects, potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance linked to specific immune cell states, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment on immune subset pharmacology. Furthermore, we discuss the application and potential of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems specifically engineered to target distinct immune cell subpopulations, aiming to enhance immunomodulatory efficacy, reshape subset repertoires favorably, overcome resistance, and minimize toxicity for more precise and effective treatment of advanced gastric cancer.">

To address this, we perform multi-site global proteomics alongside matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. We order the protein expression profiles using an unbiased pseudotime analysis, recapitulating clinical observations of metastatic progression, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlates with immune cell infiltration, the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to counterbalance γδ T cell abundance, and an increased abundance of exhausted CD8⁺ T cells. The accumulation of Tregs at metastatic sites correlates with SNX8 expression, a critical regulator of the STING pathway. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruit Tregs via MHC class II, fostering an inflammatory phenotype with limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Together, our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with both localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC.">

Myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are involved in the development and progression of immune aplastic anemia (AA). We used a murine model of BMF to explore the effects of CSF-1R inhibition on immune pathophysiology. Hematopoiesis, immune cell populations, and gene expression were assessed by flow cytometry, cytokine analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing. CSF-1R inhibition with the small molecule PLX3397 intensified BMF in CByB6F1 mice, enhancing inflammation and macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. This was accompanied by increased leukocyte apoptosis, a reduction in CD11b+ myeloid cells, and worsened animal survival. In contrast, the JAK-inhibitor baricitinib attenuated BMF, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, and decreasing CD8+ T cell infiltration of bone marrow. Single-cell RNA analysis revealed upregulation of M1 signature genes in both murine BMF and also AA human samples. In patients with severe AA, there was a shift towards an M1-like monocyte phenotype, correlating with increased inflammatory cytokine expression and altered MDSC populations. These findings highlight the role of myeloid-derived cells in BMF and suggest that M1 macrophages, with defective MDSC function, contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression. Targeting macrophage polarization or MDSCs offers alternative therapeutic strategies in immune-mediated BMF.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Human polymorphonuclear-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) consist of circulating low-density neutrophils (LDNs) characterized by the ability to inhibit T-cell responses. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the mature fraction of PMN-MDSCs (i.e. mPMN-MDSCs) exerts more potent immunosuppressive functions than its immature counterpart. More recently, we defined a specific gene signature of mPMN-MDSCs from cancer patients and G-CSF-treated donors (GDs) by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments. In this study, by performing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments of circulating mPMN-MDSCs from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we identified a major scRNA-seq cell cluster (arbitrarily named NSCLC c6) specifically displaying immunosuppressive and protumor transcriptomic features. Then, by analyzing publicly available scRNA-seq datasets from human tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), we uncovered three TAN clusters (arbitrarily named TAN c6-c8) that were found to share with NSCLC c6 several common genes and transcription factor (TF) regulons associated with response to hypoxia, positive regulation of angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, by performing scRNA-seq experiments of GD mPMN-MDSCs, we uncovered four scRNA-seq cell clusters (arbitrarily named GD c4-c7) that were enriched for the same genes and pathways characterizing NSCLC c6 and TAN c6-c8 cells. Altogether, these data uncover that human circulating mPMN-MDSCs and TANs from different cancer types share scRNA-seq cell clusters with transcriptomic similarities, supporting the notion that they might be strictly related.">

        <tr id="Background Tumors often evade immune surveillance by limiting T cell infiltration. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells is associated with a favorable response to immunotherapy. While BIN1 is recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment in NSCLC has yet to be fully clarified. Methods To investigate the relationship between BIN1 expression and CD8+T cell infiltration in NSCLC, we performed a comprehensive data analysis utilizing clinical information from NSCLC patients. BIN1 expression levels in NSCLC tissues were evaluated, and their correlation with CD8+T cells infiltration and patient survival outcomes was examined. Loss-of-function strategies targeting BIN1 were applied in syngeneic NSCLC mouse models to assess its functional significance. Tumor growth was monitored, and immune cell populations were analyzed in terms of frequency and functionality through mass cytometry and flow cytometry techniques. Cytokine secretion was profiled using multiplex assays. Additionally, RNA sequencing, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, and molecular docking were employed to confirm direct interactions between BIN1 and cytokine-encoding genes. Finally, the regulatory role of BIN1 in ferroptosis in NSCLC cells were explored using metabolomics analysis, ROS measurement, and MDA detection. Results We observed that BIN1 expression is downregulated in NSCLC tumor tissues, with its reduced expression strongly associated with advanced disease progression and poor prognosis. Bioinformatics analysis of immune infiltration in human NSCLC samples revealed a positive correlation between BIN1 expression in NSCLC tissues and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Furthermore, the prognostic impact of BIN1 on NSCLC patients is strongly linked to the level of CD8+ T cell infiltration. In syngeneic mouse models, the knockout of BIN1 in NSCLC cells significantly inhibited CD8+ T cell infiltration and impaired their cytotoxic function, facilitating tumor immune evasion. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that BIN1 directly interacts with G3BP1, and its knockout stabilizes G3BP1. This, in turn, promotes STAT1 degradation and reduces the secretion of T cell-recruiting chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL5. Finally, our findings reveal that BIN1 influences ferroptosis in NSCLC cells through the G3BP1/STAT1/GSH pathway, thereby regulating NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Conclusion This study highlights the crucial role of the BIN1/G3BP1/STAT1/CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte signaling pathway in the progression of NSCLC and its mechanisms of immune evasion. This fundings lay a foundation for the development of BIN1-targeted therapies aimed at improving tumor immunogenicity and transforming immunologically “cold” NSCLC into a more responsive disease.

Residing in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in tumor progression by regulating diverse signaling pathways. Notably, accumulating evidence has confirmed that TAMs interplay with various cellular components within the TME directly or indirectly to maintain the dynamic balance of the M1/M2 ratio and shape an immunosuppressive TME, consequently conferring immune evasion and immunotherapy tolerance. Detailed investigation of the communication network around TAMs could provide potential molecular targets and optimize ICI therapies. In this review, we systematically summarize the latest advances in understanding the origin and functional plasticity of TAMs, with a focus on the key signaling pathways driving macrophage polarization and the diverse stimuli that regulate this dynamic process. Moreover, we elaborate on the intricate interplay between TAMs and other cellular constituents within the TME, that is driving tumor initiation, progression and immune evasion, exploring novel targets for cancer immunotherapy. We further discuss current challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need to decode TAM-TME interactions and translate preclinical findings into clinical breakthroughs. In conclusion, while TAM-targeted therapies hold significant promise for enhancing immunotherapy outcomes, addressing key challenges—such as TAM heterogeneity, context-dependent plasticity, and therapeutic resistance—remains critical to achieving optimal clinical efficacy.">

This study aimed to phenotype peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from emergency department (ED) patients with suspected bacterial infection and correlate the results with microvascular changes. Methods This prospective observational study included 49 adult ED patients with suspected infection and 17 healthy controls. Capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions were measured by sublingual microscopy, while peripheral blood immune cell subsets were analyzed by deep flow cytometry. Results Network visualization of 72 diIerentially regulated parameters revealed specific changes in diIerent immune cell subsets. Innate immune changes included a functional diversion of monocytes towards pathogen defense and tissue repair, whereas adaptive immune changes included the development of CD4+ T cells with Th2-profile and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Unsupervised clustering revealed two distinct immune endotypes: E1 with a suppressed immune response and higher disease severity, and E2 with an enhanced immune response and lower disease severity. Patients showed significant reductions in capillary density and glycocalyx dimensions, which were neither correlated in magnitude nor associated with endotypes. There was a strong association between damaged glycocalyx and several monocyte and T-cell subsets. This association was not observed for capillary density. Discussion We demonstrate that glycocalyx damage is associated with a unique immunological signature, distinct from functional capillary density. These findings provide a strong basis for future studies of immune dysregulation and microvascular dysfunction in infection.">

 Background:
 Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that engage in direct cytotoxic responses against malignant cells and promote pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironments. While studies have predominantly focused on conventional NK cell subsets, recent findings uncovered adaptive and tissue-resident (TR) subsets with unique functional properties. The influence of distinct NK cell subsets on tumor immunobiology and clinical outcomes remains unknown.
 Methods:
 Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of primary, therapy-naïve tumors from 276 patients across 14 cancer types, as well as 39 patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), was accessed through publicly available datasets. We employed systematic computational analyses to phenotype and examine intra-tumoral NK cells. Gene signatures for NK cell subsets were applied to bulk RNA-sequencing from 212,105 tumor samples to delineate their associations with clinical outcomes using the Caris CODEai database.
 Results:
 Six main subsets of NK cells were identified in solid tumors, including conventional CD56
 dim
 and CD56
 bright
 NK cells, alongside adaptive, TR adaptive, TR CD56
 bright
 , and TR CD56
 bright
 /adaptive subsets. Across cancer, TR adaptive NK cells emerged as the most prognostic subset, with high infiltration conferring significantly longer overall survival (HR[95% CI] = 0.68[0.66-0.69], p < 0.001) than conventional CD56
 dim
 and CD56
 bright
 subsets. This was also observed in cohorts of head and neck, non-small cell lung, and esophageal cancers, particularly those treated with ICB. Notably, elevated TR adaptive NK cell infiltration was more prognostic than high tumor mutational burden in these settings. This was most apparent in ICB-treated head and neck cancers (HR = 0.48[0.41-0.57], p < 0.001 vs HR = 0.90[0.76-1.04], p = 0.16). Additionally, TR adaptive NK cells were strongly correlated to the infiltration of CD8
 +
 T cells and B cells in tumors. Underlying these observations, our scRNA-seq analyses demonstrated that TR adaptive NK cells exhibit the highest immunomodulatory activity of all subsets, expressing high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (
 CCL3
 ,
 CXCL13
 , and
 IFNG
 ) and low levels of immunosuppressive cytokines (
 TGFB1
 ). Mechanistically, this activity was linked to the upregulation of transcription factors associated with NK cell activation, function, and persistence and downregulation of genes related to stress response and exhaustion. Interestingly, scRNA-seq from paired pre- and post-ICB-treated tumors revealed a unique expansion of cytotoxic
 GZMB
 + TR adaptive NK cells after treatment.
 Conclusions:
 TR adaptive NK cells represent a novel subset of NK cells that may drive anti-tumor immune responses, particularly in the context of ICB treatment. Features of this unique population may be harnessed to design more effective NK cell-based therapies against solid tumors.

This review explores the complex interactions between CAFs and dendritic cells (DCs), essential antigen-presenting cells that activate immune responses. CAFs impair DC maturation and function by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, reducing their ability to present antigens and stimulate T cells, thus promoting an immunosuppressive environment favorable to tumor growth. Additionally, CAFs contribute to the differentiation of tolerogenic DCs, fostering regulatory T cells (Tregs) that further suppress antitumor immunity. This review examines the molecular mechanisms underlying CAF-DC crosstalk and discusses potential therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring DC functionality. Targeting the CAF-driven immunosuppressive network offers promising opportunities to enhance the efficacy of DC-based vaccines and immunotherapies, paving the way for improved cancer treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, essential components of the innate immune system, exhibit remarkable plasticity in the tumor microenvironment, shifting between anti-tumoral (N1) and pro-tumoral (N2) phenotypes. This functional dichotomy is particularly significant in breast cancer, where N1 neutrophils contribute to tumor suppression by enhancing cytotoxicity and immune activation, while N2 neutrophils promote tumor progression through immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The tumor microenvironment, driven by factors such as TGF-β, IL-6, and hypoxia, orchestrates this polarization, profoundly influencing disease progression and therapeutic outcomes. The interplay between neutrophil polarization and breast cancer immunotherapy presents both challenges and opportunities. Pro-tumoral N2 neutrophils often hinder the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies by suppressing T-cell function and facilitating tumor immune evasion. Conversely, strategies to reprogram neutrophils toward the N1 phenotype, including TGF-β inhibitors, CXCR2 antagonists, and epigenetic modulators, show promise in restoring anti-tumoral activity. Novel approaches, such as nanoparticle-mediated delivery of neutrophil-targeting agents, further expand the potential for precision immunotherapy by selectively modulating neutrophil phenotypes.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are the first line of defense in nonspecific immunity (innate immunity) and interact with other immune cells to participate in specific defense mechanisms (adaptive immunity). Studies have shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) mediates tumor development and recruits neutrophils into tumors to become tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), an important part of TME, and achieve extended lifespan. TANs can be differentiated into the antitumor or protumor phenotype, and play an important role in tumor occurrence, proliferation and recurrence, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, cell necrosis, and so on. Here, we summarize the TAN origin and subtypes found through Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in different types of tumors in recent literature, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their antitumor and protumor effects on tumors. We focus on the interaction between TANs and immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory TME, as well as signal pathways such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) associated with TAN phenotype transition. Based on the summarized mechanisms, we focus on the potential application and latest strategies of TAN-based immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and combination therapy in the preclinical study and clinical trials of tumors. The discussion on promising therapy encompasses five key areas: inhibition of the tumor-promoting effect of TANs, enhancement of the antitumor effect of TANs, targeting the interaction between TANs and the TME, reprogramming of TANs, and drug delivery carriers. Finally, we discuss the potential of TANs and their related markers as emerging biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) represent a promising therapeutic approach in viral infection management. However, their interaction with viruses remains poorly understood. MSCs can support antiviral immune responses and act as viral reservoirs, potentially compromising their therapeutic potential. Innate immune system recognition of viral pathogens involves pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which activate mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). MAVS triggers antiviral pathways like IRF3 and NF-κB, leading to interferon (IFN) production and pro-inflammatory responses. This study explores the antiviral response in umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) through targeted stimulation with influenza A virus-derived 5′triphosphate-RNA (3p-hpRNA), a RIG-I agonist. By investigating MAVS activation, we provide mechanistic insights into the immune response at the molecular level. Our findings reveal that 3p-hpRNA stimulation triggers immune activation of the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways through MAVS. Subsequently, this leads to the induction of type I and III IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Critically, this immune activation occurs without compromising mitochondrial integrity. UC-MSCs retain their capacity for mitochondrial transfer to recipient cells. These results highlight the adaptability of UC-MSCs, offering a nuanced understanding of immune responses balancing activation with metabolic integrity.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Most exhaustion studies have focused on CD8+ T cells. Here, we demonstrated reciprocal growth inhibition of CD4+ T cells and colorectal cancer cells, which induced the expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 in CD4+ T cells. The accelerated exhaustion of CD4+ T cells was evidenced by the reduced secretion of several cytokines, including IL-2, IFN-γ, or TNFα, and elevated secretion of CXCL family chemokines. Progressive expression of PD-L1, CTLA4, and IDO1 exhaustion markers occurred concomitantly with tumor growth in vivo in a mouse model. The pattern of CD4+ T cell exhaustion was analogous to that observed in CD8+ T cells, although with altered dynamics. The PD-L1-high phenotype can be induced by co-culture with tumor cells and is mediated by secreted factors in addition to cell contact. Our findings revealed that IFN-γ receptor knockout T cells exhibited PD-L1 protein expression when cultured with tumor cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is not fully dependent on IFN-γ. The TIL population undergoing exhaustion due to persistent antigen stimulation in the presence of cancer cells gradually acquires an immunosuppressive phenotype. The accumulation of inhibitory signals exerted by both cancer cells and T cells, which had converted to a suppressive phenotype, accelerated T cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Despite their synovial enrichment Regulatory T cells (Treg) fail to alleviate the joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This indicates their functional impairment in the synovial milieu of RA patients.


RESULTS
Here, we demonstrate that deficit in PD-1 pathway incapacitates the synovial Treg cells and engaging PD-1 restores their suppressive function (IL-10, TGF-β secretion) which in turn suppressed the synovial inflammatory T cells (IFN-γ+, IL-17+ TNF-α+). We also showed deficit in programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression on RA synovial macrophages contributes to impaired Treg cell function.


CONCLUSION
Rejuvenating synovial Treg cell function via PD-1 engagement may be a potential strategy to ameliorate the synovial inflammation in RA patients.">

        <tr id="Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing immune-mediated disorder characterized by intestinal inflammation and epithelial injury. The underlying causes of IBD are not fully understood, but genetic factors have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, including CTLA-4, an essential negative regulator of T cell activation. However, establishing a direct link between CTLA-4 and IBD has been challenging due to the early lethality of CTLA-4 knockout mice. In this study, we identified zebrafish Ctla-4 homolog and investigated its role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by generating a Ctla-4-deficient (ctla-4-/-) zebrafish line. These mutant zebrafish exhibited reduced weight, along with impaired epithelial barrier integrity and lymphocytic infiltration in their intestines. Transcriptomics analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation-related genes, disturbing immune system homeostasis. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis indicated increased Th2 cells and interleukin 13 expression, along with decreased innate lymphoid cells and upregulated proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, Ctla-4-deficient zebrafish exhibited reduced diversity and an altered composition of the intestinal microbiota. All these phenotypes closely resemble those found in mammalian IBD. Lastly, supplementation with Ctla-4-Ig successfully alleviated intestinal inflammation in these mutants. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the pivotal role of Ctla-4 in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Additionally, they offer substantial evidence linking CTLA-4 to IBD and establish a novel zebrafish model for investigating both the pathogenesis and potential treatments.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered cell therapy represents a landmark advancement in cancer immunotherapy. While αβ CAR-T therapy has demonstrated remarkable success in hematological malignancies, its efficacy in solid tumors remains constrained mainly by factors such as antigen heterogeneity, immunosuppressive microenvironments, and on-target/off-tumor toxicity. To overcome these limitations, emerging CAR platforms that utilize alternative immune effectors, including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and γδ T lymphocytes, are rapidly gaining traction. This review systematically analyzes the mechanistic advantages of CAR-NK, CAR-M, and CAR-γδ T cell therapies, while critically evaluating persistent challenges in clinical translation, including limited cell persistence, manufacturing scalability, and dynamic immune evasion mechanisms. We further discuss innovative strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy through some viable strategies. By bridging fundamental immunology with translational engineering, this work provides a roadmap for developing CAR therapies capable of addressing the complexities of solid tumor eradication.">

We generated mice lacking the Zn-dependent transcription factor Metal-responsive Transcription Factor 1(MTF1ΔIEC) in intestinal epithelial cells. MTF1ΔIEC mice exhibited altered metal homeostasis and acute susceptibility to Zn supplementation. Transcriptional and cellular analyses revealed increased inflammatory immune responses to microbes in MTF1ΔIEC mice. Mechanistically MTF1 deletion resulted in the loss of Tuft cell lineages compromising barrier function against commensal microbes and pathogens. Ex vivo experiments demonstrated that at a cellular level, Zn treatment skewed the cellular composition from proliferating to differentiated cells. Specifically, we show that Zn sensing via MTF1 is required for IL-13 dependent induction of Tuft cells. Our findings underscore critical role of Zn in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis through differentiation of specialized cell lineages, highlighting importance nutrient sensing in the constantly remodeling epithelial barrier.">

        <tr id="Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression heavily relies on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In the ccRCC TME, the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) drive a self-perpetuating cycle of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance through diverse interactions between cells and molecules. Furthermore, heterogeneous CAFs facilitate tumor growth through metabolic reprogramming and modulate immune suppression by driving the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which promote a multilayered immunosuppressive network. In addition, CAFs reshape the mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM), hinder the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and further exacerbate immune escape. Moreover, CAF-derived exosomes can confer resistance to chemoradiation therapy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) secreted by CAFs synergizes with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to facilitate adaptive resistance to targeted therapy. Emerging therapeutic strategies—including fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted CAR-T cells and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) inhibitors—can partially reverse this immunosuppressive property. Combination therapies employing immune checkpoint inhibitors and VEGF antagonists exhibit promising synergistic effects, although the clinical translation remains hampered by CAF heterogeneity, dual functional roles, and the lack of specific biomarkers. Future studies should integrate single-cell sequencing and spatial multi-omics techniques to comprehensively analyze the spatio-temporal dynamic heterogeneity of CAF subpopulations and develop precision treatment strategies based on molecular subtyping, aiming to break the vicious cycle of “CAF-TME-resistance” in ccRCC.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant tumor and stands as the fourth leading contributor to cancer-related fatalities on a global scale. The specific link between CD2 Associated Protein (CD2AP) expression and the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear, and further exploration is needed to understand its potential role in immune response and as a target for immunotherapy in GC. Utilizing RNA sequencing data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for a pan-cancer analysis, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out to determine the expression pattern and immunological involvement of CD2AP. Systematic association of CD2AP with immunological features within the stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) TME was subsequently performed, encompassing factors like cancer immunity cycles, immune checkpoints, immunomodulators, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs). We found that CD2AP was enhanced expression in the TME of a variety of malignancies. CD2AP contributes to forming a stromal reduced TME in GC and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. It was observed that patients with elevated levels of CD2AP, along with high scores on their CD4, CD20, and CD57 immune markers, tended to experience the most favorable prognosis. Furthermore, an IRS was constructed to accurately assess the prognosis of STAD patients. Since CD2AP was associated with the formation of stromal reduced TME in STAD, the expression of CD2AP can improve the effect of immunotherapy of STAD. CD2AP could emerge as a novel prognostic biomarker for STAD, offering a fresh avenue for molecular targeted therapy.

These soluble signaling molecules regulate key processes, including immune modulation, tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and resistance to therapy. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) promote survival pathways, chemoresistance, and immune evasion, while anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 further suppress effective anti-tumor immunity. Targeting cytokine signaling pathways has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Advances in monoclonal antibody therapies, signal transduction inhibitors, and cytokine-neutralizing agents aim to disrupt the pro-tumorigenic effects of cytokines within the TME. Additionally, integrating cytokine modulation with immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapy enhances anti-tumor immune responses. These approaches are complemented by novel therapeutics designed to mitigate resistance to conventional treatments, such as chemotherapies, which are often driven by persistent cytokine-mediated signaling.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Introduction The regulation of immune responses to promote tolerance to the fetus is critical for successful pregnancy. An understudied aspect of this process is the initiation of regulation pre-conception via exposure to semen. Our study aimed to understand how semen impacts recipient dendritic cells (DCs) and their subsequent role in shaping CD4 T cell differentiation. Methods Monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) were exposed to semen extracellular vesicles (SEV) or vesicle-depleted semen plasma (VDSP). Phenotypic and functional markers were analyzed using flow cytometry. We also exposed epithelial sheets from vaginal tissue to SEV and VDSP, and measured the number and marker expression of emigrating cells. Finally, we tested how SEV- or VDSP-exposed DCs altered CD4 T cell differentiation by co-culturing exposed MoDCs or tissue emigrated cells with autologous naïve CD4 T cells. Results MoDCs exhibited a significant increase of CD141, CD1a, CD38, and ILT4 expression when exposed to SEV or VDSP. A unique feature of semen-treated MoDCs was expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a potent contributor to the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs). SEV but not VDSP significantly increased the emigration of intraepithelial DCs. Additionally, SEV significantly enhanced the expression of multiple immunoregulatory markers in the emigrated DCs. After co-culture, we observed significantly more FOXP3+ Tregs expressing high levels of TIGIT in the groups that were initially exposed to SEV. Discussion These findings indicate that exposure to SEV induces a tolerogenic program in DCs that can direct differentiation of a unique memory Treg subset, primed for expansion and presumably destined to support a successful pregnancy.">

        <tr id="Malignant tumors represent a significant threat to human health. Among the various therapeutic strategies available, cancer immunotherapy—encompassing adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and immune checkpoint blockade therapy—has emerged as a particularly promising approach following surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and molecular targeted therapies. This form of treatment elicits substantial antigen-specific immune responses, enhances or restores anti-tumor immunity, thereby facilitating the control and destruction of tumor cells, and yielding durable responses across a range of cancers, which can lead to the eradication of tumor lesions and the prevention of recurrence. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), a subset of ACT, are characterized by their heterogeneity and are found within tumor tissues, where they play a crucial role in mediating host antigen-specific immune responses against tumors. This review aims to explore recent advancements in the understanding of TILs biology, their prognostic implications, and their predictive value in therapeutic contexts.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Recent studies have shown that Erythroid progenitor cells exhibit a distinct immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory phenotype associated with the response to bacteria. Methods: The objective of this study was to comprehensively explore the traits of human bone marrow Erythroid cells through protein–protein interaction network analysis using cytokine secretion analysis, and single-cell immunoproteomic analysis using flow cytometry, as well as the re-analysis of publicly available human and mouse bone marrow Erythroid-cell transcriptomic data. Results: Our protein–protein interaction network analysis of human bone marrow Erythroid-cell protein-coding genes identified enrichment in the immune response to lipopolysaccharide, with Calprotectin and Cathepsin G being the main factors. We then mapped the Calprotectin to the CD45+ Erythroid cells of both humans and mice via the analysis of the publicly available scRNA-seq data. Additionally, we observed that human bone marrow Erythroid cells secrete cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1b, IL-8, and IL-18, which are also mainly involved in the immune response to lipopolysaccharide. We also found that human and mouse bone marrow Erythroid-cell conditional media inhibit bacterial growth in vitro. Discussion: These findings suggest that both human and mouse bone marrow CD45+ Erythroid cells possess the potential to combat pathogenic microbes and thus play a role in innate antimicrobial immunity. Conclusions: CD45+ Erythroid cells are a potent immunoregulatory cell population in both humans and mice.">

        <tr id="Introduction Prolonged viral infections often lead to lymphocyte exhaustion, marked by heightened inhibitory receptor expression like PD-1, compromising host defense mechanisms. The unexplored potential of chemical checkpoint inhibitors in rejuvenating immune responses prompted our investigation. Methods We focused on CCT007093, a Wip1 inhibitor, screened for its distinctive capacity to simultaneously decrease PD-1 and FcγRIIB expression in B cells. Results In this study, we harnessed a murine model of immune exhaustion induced by chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection using hydrodynamic injection. Treatment with CCT007093 resulted in decreased levels of PD-1 expression, resulting in reduced percentages of PD-1+/hi CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in circulation, spleen, and liver. The expression levels of PD-1 and FcγRIIB, along with the percentages of PD-1+/hi and FcγRIIB+/hi CD19+ B cells in these tissues, were similarly diminished. Moreover, intrahepatic lymphocytes treated with CCT007093 displayed heightened responsiveness to ex vivo activation. Consequently, mice treated with CCT007093 exhibited significantly reduced serum HBsAg levels compared to vehicle-treated mice. Our detailed analyses, spanning promoter and transcriptome evaluations, uncovered p65 NF-κB as the primary activator of T cells and B cells, while Ying Yang 1 (YY1) emerged as the key regulator, orchestrating the down-regulation of PD-1 and FcγRIIB gene transcription in response to CCT007093. Discussion Our study highlights the prowess of chemical checkpoint inhibitors, exemplified by CCT007093, in alleviating immune exhaustion in HBV-infected mice, particularly by enhancing adaptive immunity.">

        <tr id="Mouse models serve as a means of examining immune changes when genes of interest are knocked out (KO). One group of immune gene-producing cells that have been identified is type 2 innate lymphoid cells (Ilc2). These cells are involved in the production of Th2 equivalent immune responses and signal cytokine production during the resolution of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis parasite infection in mice lungs. However, many questions about Ilc2 activity in the gut remain. To study this, retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα)-deficient mice were infected with adult N. brasiliensis and arranged into four treatment groups. Ten days post-infection (dpi), mouse ileum tissue was extracted for RNA-Seq. The RORα-deficient mice showed little change in gene expression at 10 dpi (N = 51) when compared to the WT mice at 10 dpi (N = 915), displaying dysregulation within the mouse gut. Based on the results, the gene expression in the gut of Ilc2-deficient mice denoted that the inability to craft Ilc2 cells left the mice unable to mount classical helminth immune responses involving humoral, mast cell, and antibody Th2-driven reactions. Overall, the results showed the importance of Ilc2 in the gut during N. brasiliensis infections and the effect that the lack of these cells had on immunity.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, and despite improvements in treatment options such as surgery and radiotherapy, its survival rate remains low. With increased research in immunotherapy, antibodies against various immune checkpoints like programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) have been shown to be effective against a wide range of tumors. Nonetheless, survival benefits gained by HNSCC patients remain limited. T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3), an emerging immune checkpoint molecule, is found to be expressed in HNSCC and is involved in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). TIM-3 is significant in the initiation and progression of HNSCC by modulating effector T cells, innate immune cells, and other components of the immune system. Inhibiting TIM-3 can restore T cell function and enhance the immune response against HNSCC, making it a promising immunotherapeutic target for this disease. This article reviews the expression of TIM-3 in HNSCC and its immunomodulatory mechanism and briefly introduces the combined application and development prospects of TIM-3 as a potential immunotherapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Introduction The prognostic management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a challenge for clinicians. This study aims to construct a novel risk model for AML patient through comprehensive analysis of scRNA and bulk RNA data to optimize the precise treatment strategies for patients and improve prognosis. Methods and Results scRNA-seq classified cells into nine clusters, including Bcells, erythrocyte, granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP), hematopoietic stem cell progenitors (HSC/Prog), monocyte/macrophagocyte (Mono/Macro), myelocyte, neutrophils, plasma, and T/NK cells. Functional analysis demonstrated the important role of inflammation immune response in the pathogenesis of AML, and the leukocyte transendothelial migration and adhesion in the process of inflammation should be noticed. ssGSEA method identified four core cells including GMP, HSC/Prog, Mono/Macro, and myelocyte for subsequent analysis, which contains 1,594 marker genes. Furthermore, we identified AML-associated genes (2,067genes) and DEGs (1,010genes) between AML patients and controls usingGSE114868dataset. After performing intersection, univariate Cox, and LASSO analysis, we obtained a prognostic model based on the expression levels of five signature genes, namely, CALR, KDM1A, SUCNR1, TMEM220, and ADM. The prognostic model was then validated by two external datasets. Patients with high-risk scores are predisposed to experience poor overall survival. Further GSEA analysis of risk-model-related genes revealed the significant differences in inflammatory response between high-and low-risk groups. Conclusion In conclusion, we constructed an inflammation related risk model using internal scRNA data and external bulk RNA data, which can accurately distinguish survival outcomes in AML patients.">

        <tr id="Abstract The small intestine is essential for digestion, nutrient absorption, immune regulation, and microbial balance. Its epithelial lining, containing specialized cells like Paneth cells and tuft cells, is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Paneth cells produce antimicrobial peptides and growth factors that support microbial regulation and intestinal stem cells, while tuft cells act as chemosensors, detecting environmental changes and modulating immune responses. Along with immune cells such as intraepithelial lymphocytes, innate lymphoid cells, T cells, and macrophages, they form a strong defense system that protects the epithelial barrier. Disruptions in this balance contribute to chronic inflammation, microbial dysbiosis, and compromised barrier function—key features of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and metabolic syndromes. Furthermore, dysfunctions in the small intestine and immune cells are linked to systemic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders. Recent research highlights promising therapeutic strategies, including modulation of epithelial and immune cell functions, probiotics, and gene editing to restore gut health and address systemic effects. This review emphasizes the pivotal roles of small intestinal epithelia and immune cells in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, their involvement in disease development, and emerging treatments for intestinal and systemic disorders.">

        <tr id="Introduction Acute rejection is a critical complication after liver transplantation, contributing significantly to transplant dysfunction and recipient mortality. Yin Yang 1 (YY1), a zinc-finger transcription factor, has an undefined role in liver allograft acute rejection, despite its broad expression and regulatory potential in immune responses. Methods To investigate YY1's role, we used an MHC Class II-mismatched rat liver transplantation model. Allografts were harvested on post-transplant days 5 and 10 for YY1 expression analysis in inflammatory cells around recipient liver central veins. In vitro, dendritic cells (DCs) were transfected to overexpress YY1, and their surface markers (CD80, CD86, MHC II) and cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-6) were assessed. Naïve CD4+ T cells were co-cultured with YY1-overexpressing DCs to evaluate their polarization towards inflammatory phenotypes (IL-17, IFN-γ production). Results YY1 expression was elevated in inflammatory cells of allografts on days 5 and 10 post-transplant, correlating with increased serum transaminases and inflammatory cytokines. YY1-overexpressing DCs showed heightened expression of CD80, CD86, and MHC II, along with augmented TNF-α and IL-6 production. These YY1-activated DCs drove naïve CD4+ T cells to produce higher levels of IL-17 and IFN-γ, indicating polarization towards a proinflammatory Th17/Th1 phenotype. Discussion YY1 promotes DC activation and naïve T cell polarization towards inflammatory phenotypes, thereby contributing to acute rejection in liver transplantation. Targeting YY1 may offer a therapeutic strategy to mitigate acute rejection and improve transplant outcomes. Further research is warranted to explore YY1's regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic potential in liver transplantation.">

        <tr id="Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that expand aberrantly in cancer and exhibit potent immunosuppressive properties. They contribute to tumor progression through both immunological and nonimmunological mechanisms. Immunologically, MDSCs suppress antitumor responses by inhibiting effector cells such as T cells and NK cells, facilitating immune evasion. Nonimmunologically, they promote tumor growth and metastasis through processes such as the epithelial‒mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and premetastatic niche formation. MDSC accumulation is closely linked to accelerated tumor progression, including resistance to both immunotherapies and conventional treatments, making these cells critical therapeutic targets. Clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of MDSC‐targeted strategies to improve treatment efficacy. However, challenges remain in achieving specificity and effectiveness in MDSC‐targeted therapies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of their biology. This review summarizes the origin, classification, and biological characteristics of MDSCs, their dual roles in tumor progression, and their clinical significance. We also discuss recent advances in clinical and preclinical studies, including both traditional targeted therapies and emerging innovative strategies. By integrating current findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective on the role of MDSCs in cancer and valuable insights for advancing cancer treatment and drug development.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cells in human circulation, play a crucial role in innate immunity. One of their key defense mechanisms is the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), web-like structures composed of chromatin and antimicrobial proteins that help capture and neutralize pathogens. While previous studies have identified a limited set of NET-associated proteins, the comprehensive proteomic landscape of NETs induced by different stimuli remains largely unexplored. In this study, we used data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry to analyze the proteomic composition of NETs induced by five distinct stimuli: β-glucan, lipopolysaccharide, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium, resiquimod, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome bunyavirus. Across all conditions, we identified 5,868 NET-associated proteins, revealing significant stimulus-dependent differences in protein composition. Notably, differentially expressed proteins were detected in each condition, highlighting unique proteomic signatures that may reflect distinct immune responses.

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and associated receptors remains poorly characterized. We applied a single-cell multi-omics approach (CITE-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy donors, before and after in vitro TNF stimulation. Using integrated analysis of surface protein expression and transcriptomic data, we focused on phenotypic and transcriptional changes in dendritic cell populations. DCs from RA patients exhibited elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, indicative of an inflammatory phenotype, and showed marked responsiveness to TNF. Upon stimulation, RA-derived DCs upregulated genes involved in antigen presentation (CD83, LAMP3), lymph node migration (CCR7, ADAM19), and inflammation (TRAF1, IL24) whereas such activation was absent in healthy controls. Our data reveal a TNF-responsive, pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in dendritic cells from RA patients and underscore the relevance of the TNF receptor profile in shaping DC function. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of RA and identify dendritic cells as potential targets for personalized immunomodulatory therapy.">

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-(L)1 pathways have revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since last decade. However, the efficacy is still limited because the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) restricts ICI-primed T cell immunity. Therefore, it is quite crucial to block the potential mechanisms in inducing immunosuppression to improve ICI efficacy. Immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) 5 is an important immunosuppressive molecule expressed in a wide range of myeloid cells and predicts tumor progression. Our group was the first to report ILT5 expression in solid tumor cells (colorectal cancer). However, the expression and function of ILT5 in NSCLC are still unknown.
 Methods:
 ILT5 expression in NSCLC tissues and tumor cell lines was determined by PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. The impact of tumor-derived ILT5 on T-cell phenotypes and functions was evaluated using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. ILT5-regulated downstream signals and molecules were determined by RNA sequencing, PCR, western blotting, and flow cytometry. Tumor transplantation and immunotherapeutic models were established in C57/BL6 and NSG mice to explore the effect of ILT5 on tumor progression and the synergies of ILT5 blockade with ICIs.
 Results:
 ILT5 is highly expressed in NSCLC cells, predicting poor patient survival. ILT5 induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion rather than senescence and apoptosis in the TME. Mechanistically, ILT5 upregulated PD-L1 through the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn increased PD-1 expression in CD8
 +
 T cells and induced their exhaustion. PIR-B (ILT5 orthlog in mice) overexpression in mice induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion and tumor growth in vivo, while PIR-B knockdown had the opposite effect. More importantly, inhibition of ILT5 synergistically enhanced the tumoricidal effect of PD-1 inhibitor in NSCLC immunotherapeutic models.
 Conclusions:
 Enriched ILT5 expression in NSCLC cells induces CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion via activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR-PD-L1 pathway. ILT5 inhibition synergistically enhanced the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor. Our findings identifies a novel mechanism for tumor immunosuppression and develops a promising strategy for improving ICI efficacy.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis is characterized by CNS infiltration of auto-reactive immune cells that drive both acute inflammatory demyelination and chronic progressive axonal and neuronal injury. Expanding evidence implicates CD8+ anti-neural T cells in the irreversible neurodegeneration that underlies progression in multiple sclerosis, yet therapies specifically targeting this cell population are limited. CD8+ T cells from patients with MS exhibit increased engagement of the pentose phosphate pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway reduced glycolysis, glucose uptake, NADPH production, ATP production, proliferation, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in CD8+ T cells activated by ligation of CD3 and CD28. Pentose phosphate pathway inhibition also prevented CD8+ T cell-mediated antigen-specific neuronal injury in vitro and in both an adoptive transfer-based cuprizone model of demyelination and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Notably, transcriptional profiling of CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients with MS indicated increased pentose phosphate pathway engagement, suggesting that this pathway is involved in CD8+ T cell-mediated injury of axons and neurons in the demyelinated CNS. Inhibiting the pentose phosphate pathway disrupts CD8+ T cell metabolic reprogramming and effector functions, suggesting that such inhibition may serve as a therapeutic strategy to prevent neurodegeneration in patients with progressive MS.">

        <tr id="Numerous studies have demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry a variety of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which can be taken up by neighboring cells or transported to distant sites via bodily fluids, thereby facilitating intercellular communication and regulating multiple cellular functions. Within the tumor microenvironment, EV-ncRNA, on the one hand, regulate the expression of PD-L1, thereby influencing tumor immune evasion, promoting tumor cell proliferation, and enhancing tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis in vivo. On the other hand, these specific EV-ncRNAs can also modulate the functions of immune cells (such as CD8 + T cells, macrophages, and NK cells) through various molecular mechanisms, inducing an immunosuppressive microenvironment and promoting resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Therefore, delving into the molecular mechanisms underlying EV-ncRNA regulation of immune checkpoints presents compelling therapeutic prospects for strategies that selectively target EV-ncRNAs. In this review, we elaborate on the cutting-edge research progress related to EV-ncRNAs in the context of cancer and dissect their pivotal roles in the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway. We also highlight the promising clinical applications of EV-ncRNAs in anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, bridging basic research with practical clinical applications. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are integral to the frontline defense against pathogenic bacterial and fungal invasions. Beyond their traditional roles, these cells are increasingly recognized for their dualistic contributions to the pathology of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as their complex involvement in cancer progression. Neutrophils interact with different disease states, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Within tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) exhibit a functional dichotomy, capable of either fostering or impeding tumor growth and metastasis. This binary functional potential of TANs, under certain conditions, suggests a reversible state that could transition from tumor-promoting to tumor-eradicating phenotypes. Despite the critical implications of such functional plasticity, systematic studies of TAN behavioral shifts in the context of cancer immunotherapy remain scarce. Herein, we review recent advancements in the understanding of TANs within the TME, highlighting their binary regulatory effects on solid tumors. Leveraging the latest insights from experimental and clinical research, this review elucidates the complex roles of TANs in tumor development and explores their molecular interactions as potential therapeutic targets. The elucidation of these mechanisms holds promise for novel cancer treatment strategies, aiming to improve patient outcomes by manipulating the tumor-promoting or -suppressing functions of TANs.">

        <tr id="Background Dendritic cells (DCs) derived extracellular vesicles represent a promising vehicle for the activation of adaptive immunity, demonstrating significant potential in the development of cancer nanovaccines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of a functional DCs-derived extracellular vesicles in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Methods A pre-modification strategy was employed to overexpress XCL1 in dendritic cells, enabling their extracellular vesicles to highly express XCL1 protein. In vitro experiments, prostate cancer-bearing mouse models, and OVA-expressing prostate cancer mouse models demonstrated that dendritic cells efficiently internalize extracellular vesicles derived from XCL1-overexpressing mature dendritic cells (DEXXCL1), thereby enhancing the chemotaxis, activation, and antigen-presenting capacity of cDC1 cells. When combined with the immunogenic cell death effect induced by cisplatin, this approach significantly increased the number and cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells, improved the tumor microenvironment, and effectively suppressed prostate cancer tumor growth. Results The coding sequence of XCL1 successfully inserted upstream of the PDGFR transmembrane domain and transfected into dendritic cells, enabling their extracellular vesicles to highly express XCL1 protein. Extracellular vesicles derived from XCL1-overexpressing mature dendritic cells not only exhibited high XCL1 expression, but were also enriched with chemokine receptor CCR7 and MHC I molecules on their surface. This nanovaccines enhanced the uptake of extracellular vesicles by dendritic cells, recruited cDC1 cells within the tumor tissue, and significantly improved their antigen-presenting capacity. When combined with the immunogenic cell death effect induced by cisplatin, which generates a large amount of tumor-associated antigen STEAP1, this strategy effectively enhanced the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of CD8+T cells. Moreover, it reduced the proportion of regulatory T cells and immunosuppressive factors, thereby reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment. This approach effectively inhibited tumor growth in mice and prolonged their survival. These findings demonstrate the strong synergistic effects of the nanovaccines and cisplatin in promoting antitumor immunity. Conclusions A novel nanovaccines induces potent antitumor immune responses and, in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, effectively remodels the tumor immune microenvironment. This approach offers a new strategy and preclinical evidence for the immunotherapy of “cold tumors” prostate cancer.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) represent a heterogeneous group of malignant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) disorders characterized by cytopenia, ineffective hematopoiesis, as well as the potential to progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The pathogenesis of MDS is influenced by intrinsic factors, such as genetic insults, and extrinsic factors, including altered bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) composition and architecture. BMM is reprogrammed in MDS, initially to prevent the development of the disease but eventually to provide a survival advantage to dysplastic cells. Recently, inflammation or age-related inflammation in the bone marrow has been identified as a key pathogenic mechanism for MDS. Inflammatory signals trigger stress hematopoiesis, causing HSPCs to emerge from quiescence and resulting in MDS development. A better understanding of the role of the BMM in the pathogenesis of MDS has opened up new avenues for improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the disease. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current knowledge regarding the significance of the BMM to MDS pathophysiology and highlights recent advances in developing innovative therapies.">

        <tr id="INTRODUCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is driven by abnormal type-I and -II interferon activation, affecting a variety of immunocompetent cells. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modulate inflammation but often lack consistent potency. We developed HXB-319, an MSC-based therapy targeting inflammatory pathways in SLE. Previously, HXB-319 was shown to reduce alveolar hemorrhage in an SLE model. Here, we report its effects in a model of SLE that progresses to end stage kidney disease.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
SLE-like disease was induced via intraperitoneal (IP) pristane injection in female BALB/cJ mice, followed by treatment with naïve MSCs or HXB-319. Over 9 months, survival and proteinuria were monitored. Upon euthanasia, kidneys were analyzed for histopathology and gene expression, splenocytes for immune subsets by flow cytometry, and serum for autoantibodies, growth factors and cytokines.


RESULTS
HXB-319 significantly altered plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4+PD-L1+ cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ RORγt+ (Th17 cells) subsets. HXB-310 lowered IFN-γ (p< 0.001), IL-17A (p=0.01), BAFF (p<0.05), and anti-dsDNA (p<0.05), compared to untreated mice. HXB-319, but not naïve MSCs, significantly improved survival, halted progression of kidney disease and stabilized proteinuria (all p < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
HXB-319 demonstrates potential for mitigating SLE associated glomerulonephritis, improving survival and reducing proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis.">

        <tr id="Background Patients living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLWH) develop accelerated liver fibrosis, but the exact mechanism remains unknown. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is the cornerstone for liver fibrosis and influenced by multiple factors, such as viral infection, hepatocellular injury, chronic immune activation, gut mucosal barrier dysfunction, and microbial translocation. Unlike gram-negative bacterial products, the impact of gram-positive microbial products in Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) associated liver inflammation and fibrosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a major gram-positive bacterial component, on HSCs in the context of HIV-1 infection. Methods Human HSCs were isolated from the livers of both non-HIV and HIV-infected patients undergoing hepatic resection. The inflammatory responses of HSCs to LTA stimulation were measured by ELISA before or after HIV-1BaL ex vivo expision. Western blotting, ChIP-qPCR and RNA-seq were used to reveal the mechanisms contributing to the IL-8 response to LTA stimulation and HIV-1BaL exposure in HSCs. Results While LTA stimulation modestly increased IL-8 production in HSCs, this effect was significantly amplified in HIV-1-infected HSCs. Elevated IL-8 levels were detected in HIV-1+ liver sections, and IL-8 treatment of cultured HSCs significantly increased α-SMA and COL1A1 expression, supporting IL-8 as a key inflammatory driver of liver fibrosis in HIV-1+ individuals. Transcriptomic analyses implicated histone acetylation as a regulator of the enhanced IL-8 response of HSCs to LTA in HIV-1 infection. Consistent with this, treatment with Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, further increased the IL-8 response in HIV-1-infected HSCs. ChIP-qPCR confirmed that histone H4K5 acetylation facilitated IL-8 promoter transactivation, rendering HIV-1-infected cells more responsive to LTA. Conclusions HIV-1 infection sensitizes HSCs to LTA stimulation, leading to an amplified IL-8 response mediated through histone acetylation that may accelerate liver fibrosis progression in PLWH. As microbial translocation persists despite effective antiretroviral therapy, these findings underscore the need for targeted strategies to mitigate liver fibrosis in HIV-1 infected HIV-1+ individuals.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized cancer treatment by enabling durable responses. However, most patients showed resistance and limited efficacy. Elucidating mechanisms of resistance is imperative to extend the clinical utility of ICBs. Emerging evidence highlights cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), particularly TGFβ-activated myofibroblastic CAFs, as key orchestrators of immunosuppressive TMEs and ICBs resistance. These CAFs drive T-cell exclusion preventing intratumoral T cells from engaging cancer cells. This review explores the role of TGFβ signaling in CAFs in driving immune evasion and therapy resistance. While targeting TGFβ or CAFs directly has shown limited inconsistent results, downstream molecules in TGFβ-activated CAFs, including induced TGFβ (βig-h3), endocytic receptor 180 (Endo180), leucine-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15), and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), emerge as promising therapeutic targets to counteract T-cell exclusion and restore immunotherapy sensitivity.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The thymus exhibits constitutive activation of nearly all major inflammatory pathways, including sterile MyD88‐dependent signaling and interferon production by mTECs, the presence of cellular and molecular components of type 1, type 2, and type 3 responses, as well as sustained B cell activation. The reasons for the existence of such a complex constitutively active inflammatory network at the site of T cell development—where the initial pathogen encounter is unlikely—have remained enigmatic. We propose that this inflammatory thymic ‘ecosystem’ has evolved to promote immunological tolerance to ‘inflammatory self’—endogenous molecules absent from most peripheral tissues at steady state but upregulated during pathogen invasion. The spatial and temporal overlap with pathogen presence makes the discrimination of the inflammatory self from pathogen‐derived molecules a unique challenge for the adaptive immune system. The frequent occurrence of diseases associated with autoantibodies against proinflammatory cytokines underscores the persistent risk of these molecules being misidentified as foreign. Their abundant representation in the thymus, therefore, is likely to be critical for maintaining tolerance. This review explores current insights into the thymic inflammatory network, its cellular and molecular constituents, and their role in the induction of T cell tolerance.">

        <tr id="Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are ectopic lymphoid structures that form in non-lymphoid tissues in response to chronic inflammatory stimulation. Structurally and functionally resembling lymph nodes, TLS are primarily composed of B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and other immune cell populations. Critically, TLS serve as direct sites for initiating anti-tumor immune responses. Within tumors, TLS facilitate the accumulation of immune cells—particularly effector subsets such as cytotoxic T cells and antibody-producing B cells—in the tumor microenvironment, thereby establishing a localized hub for both cellular and humoral immunity. This localized immune activation correlates with improved patient prognosis and enhanced responses to immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the organization, formation drivers, detection markers, and the interplay between TLS and tumor-associated genes. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of TLS as biomarkers for immunotherapy efficacy and their translational clinical applications.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in supporting acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell survival, proliferation, and drug resistance through various mechanisms, including the release of soluble factors, direct cell-cell interactions, and the creation of a leukemia-supportive niche. Conversely, MSCs also demonstrate potential inhibitory effects on AML, including the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and the modulation of immune responses. These contrasting effects highlight the complexities of MSC-AML interactions and emphasize the need for further research to understand their therapeutic potential fully. Targeting MSCs represents a promising avenue for AML treatment. Strategies aimed at modifying MSC-mediated support of AML cells, such as inhibiting pro-survival signaling pathways, disrupting the leukemia-supportive niche, and enhancing the immune-stimulatory functions of MSCs, could offer novel therapeutic approaches. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of current research. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the dual effects of MSCs in AML, to identify biomarkers that predict patient response to MSC-targeted therapies, and to develop strategies to overcome potential challenges associated with MSC-based interventions. In conclusion, understanding the multifaceted role of MSCs in AML pathogenesis is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic approaches. By harnessing the potential of MSCs and targeting their interactions with AML cells, we can explore novel strategies to improve treatment outcomes and enhance the overall management of this challenging hematological malignancy. This review underscores the intricate relationship between MSCs and AML within the bone marrow microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) are a group of hematological malignancies originating from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), characterized by distinct clinical and/or molecular heterogeneity across different MDS subtypes. This review elucidates the pathogenesis of MDS from two main perspectives: the bone marrow microenvironment and recurrent genetic abnormalities. Abnormal bone marrow microenvironment initiates aberrant innate immune response in HSCs, with quantitative and/or functional alterations of immune cells that collectively establish an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and abnormal bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells that support and promote the progression of MDS. In addition, this review synthesizes current evidence on the biological functions and pathogenic mechanisms of frequently mutated genes in MDS. Furthermore, emerging therapies based on the pathogenesis of MDS are evaluated and summarized. In summary, aberrant innate immune responses promote pyroptosis of HSCs and acquisition of recurrent genetic abnormalities, resulting in the transformation of HSCs into MDS blasts; the immunosuppressive milieu (especially in higher-risk MDS) facilitates immune evasion of MDS blasts, ultimately leading to disease progression. Future research should focus on the interplay between different genetic abnormalities and immune dysregulation, coupled with the development of novel therapies targeting multiple nodes of the pathogenic network, to overcome current challenges in the treatment of MDS.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells, serving as pivotal mediators of innate immunity, play an important role in antitumor immunity. Immune checkpoint can be expressed on the surface of NK cells and meticulously regulates their activation states and effector functions through complex signaling networks. In recent years, tumor immunotherapy strategies focusing on NK cell immune checkpoints have demonstrated remarkable advancements. This review systematically elucidates the expression profiles, signaling pathways, and the immune checkpoint molecule regulatory mechanisms localized on the NK cell membrane (e.g., NKG2A, KIRs, and TIGIT) or intracellularly (e.g., BIM, Cbl-b, and EZH2) during tumor immune evasion. Particular attention is devoted to dissecting the regulatory mechanisms through which these immune checkpoint molecules influence NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion, proliferative capacity, and tunable modulation of NK cell immune checkpoint expression by diverse factors within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, this review comprehensively summarizes preclinical advancements in NK cell immune checkpoint blockade strategies, including single checkpoint blockade, combinatorial checkpoint approaches, and their integration with conventional therapeutic modalities. Additionally, emerging therapeutic advancements, such as gene-editing technologies and chimeric antigen receptor-NK (CAR-NK) cell therapy, are evaluated for their prospective applications in immunotherapy based on NK cells. By thoroughly elucidating the molecular regulatory networks underlying NK cell immune checkpoints and their mechanisms of action within the complex tumor microenvironment, this review aims to provide critical theoretical insights and translational foundations to foster the development of innovative tumor immunotherapy strategies, improvement of combination therapies, and realization of personalized precision medicine.">

        <tr id="Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus infection affecting half of the world’s population for which therapies are lacking. The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who develop severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. These signatures are exacerbated in patients with overweight/obesity compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic potential compared to non-SD. Using transcriptional and proteomics approaches we show decreased type-I Interferon responses in SD, suggesting defective innate immunity may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional T and NK-cell signatures underpin dengue pathogenesis and may represent novel targets for immunomodulatory therapy in dengue.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that plays a pivotal role in tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion. Recent advancements have highlighted the intricate interplay between immune cell infiltration patterns, immune checkpoint dysregulation, and metabolic reprogramming in driving HNSCC immune escape. Despite these insights, significant challenges remain, including the incomplete understanding of specific immune evasion pathways and the lack of personalized therapeutic strategies. To address these gaps, this review introduces a novel “Trinity” regulatory network of immune evasion in HNSCC, encompassing: (1) metabolic reprogramming-mediated immune checkpoint modulation, (2) stromal cell-driven immune dysfunction, and (3) epigenetic remodeling fostering immune tolerance. This framework provides a theoretical foundation for the development of multi-targeted combination therapies and offers innovative strategies to overcome immune evasion. Additionally, this review systematically synthesizes the current understanding of the relationship between the HNSCC microenvironment and immune escape, with a focus on emerging immunotherapeutic approaches such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapy. Leveraging cutting-edge single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we elucidate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the HNSCC immune landscape and propose a new paradigm of “lineage plasticity-driven immune adaptation.” These insights not only advance our understanding of HNSCC biology but also pave the way for the development of precision immunotherapies aimed at improving patient survival and quality of life. By integrating multidisciplinary perspectives, this work underscores the importance of targeting the TME to achieve durable clinical responses and overcome immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC.">

Using an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS, we report that Mac-1 on myeloid cells is key to disease development. Our data reveal that myeloid-specific Mac-1 significantly increases EAE severity and hinders disease regression. Loss of Mac-1 increases Gr-1+ cells in peripheral tissues and the CNS and preferably accelerates the transition of Ly6Chi monocytes from a pro-inflammatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in a disease stage–dependent manner. Mechanistically, our results demonstrate that Mac-1 suppresses interferon-γ production and prevents monocytes from acquiring immunosuppressive functions by reducing the expression of iNOS, IDO, and CD84. Administration of a NOS-specific inhibitor in Mac-1–deficient EAE mice abolishes disease regression. These insights could help develop Mac-1–targeting strategies for better treatment of MS.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory B cell (Breg), known for its immunosuppressive properties through the provision of IL-10, plays a critical role in the control of inflammatory diseases. Although Breg has been discovered for over two decades in mammals, its existence in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the differentiation mechanism and functional profiles of teleost CD25L+ Breg to gain insights into the origin and evolution of Breg. Methods Flow cytometry, RNA-seq, qPCR, morphological analysis, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, recombinant IL-35 stimulation, cell co-culture in Transwell system were performed to reveal the phenotypic features, differentiation mechanism and suppressive functions of teleost CD25L+ Breg. To elucidate the immunoregulatory role of CD25L+ Breg in vivo, bacterial infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models were established in teleost fish. Systemic and local inflammatory responses were assessed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, histological analysis, and cytokine measurements. Results Phenotypically, we identified a unique IgM+CD25L+ B cell subset, termed CD25L+ B cells, characterized by their capacity to produce IL-10 and IL-12p35 in a cold-blooded vertebrate, the grass carp. Mechanistically, IL-35 stimulation induced the differentiation of CD25L− B cells into CD25L+ B cells, promoting the production of IL-35 and IL-10 via STAT3 activation. Functionally, teleost CD25L+ B cells served as a conventional Breg subtype that exerted its immunosuppressive functions on effector T cells and neutrophils via cell contact or cytokine delivery. Upon bacterial infection, CD25L+ Breg increased earlier than CD25L+ Treg and produced IL-10. In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD model, Breg frequency and IL-10 levels increased significantly during IBD remission, and Breg adoptive transfer could prevent IBD development and contribute to intestinal tissue repair. Conclusions These novel findings reveal that fish have evolved Breg with specialized anti-inflammatory functions, providing evolutionary insights into the phylogenetic origin and functional conservation of Breg from fish to mammals.

        <tr id="T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, also known as signal 1, plays a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of T cells. The question of whether TCR signaling exerts a deterministic role in T cell fate determination is an area of active investigation. It has been particularly challenging to address this question due to the complexities associated with genetic manipulation of TCR signaling components, which often disrupts thymic T cell development or impairs T cell activation upon TCR engagement. Recent study demonstrates that the TCR-Lck/Fyn axis directly induces STAT3 phosphorylation and synergizes with pro-inflammatory cytokines to optimize STAT3 phosphorylation during Th17 cell differentiation. Additionally, the TCR-Lck/Fyn-AKT/mTOR axis negatively regulates Treg cell differentiation. In CD8+ T cells, persistent high-affinity antigen stimulation drives differentiation along the exhaustion pathway, while acute infection or intermediate antigen levels promote differentiation into effector and memory T cells, although the underlying mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. Collectively, these studies provide compelling evidence that TCR signaling has a deterministic impact on T cell fate. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding how TCR signaling shapes T cell fate determination.">

Mitochondrial transfer is becoming recognized as an important immunomodulatory mechanism used by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to influence immune cells. While effects on T cells and macrophages have been documented, the influence on B cells remains unexplored. This study investigates the modulation of B lymphocyte fate by MSC-mediated mitochondrial transfer.


METHODS
MSCs labelled with MitoTracker dyes or derived from mito::mKate2 transgenic mice were co-cultured with splenocytes. Flow cytometry assessed mitochondrial transfer, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, apoptosis and mitophagy. Glucose uptake was measured using the 2-NBDG assay. RNA sequencing analysed gene expression changes in CD19+ mitochondria recipients and nonrecipients. Pathway analysis identified affected processes. In an LPS-induced inflammation model, mito::mKate2 MSCs were administered, and B cells from different organs were analysed for mitochondrial uptake and phenotypic changes. MSC-derived mitochondria were also isolated to confirm uptake by FACS-sorted CD19+ cells.


RESULTS
MSCs transferred mitochondria to CD19+ cells, though less than to other immune cells. Transfer correlated with ROS levels and mitophagy induction. Mitochondria were preferentially acquired by activated B cells, as indicated by increased CD69 expression and glycolytic activity. Bidirectional transfer occurred, with immune cells exchanging dysfunctional mitochondria for functional ones. CD19+ recipients exhibited increased viability, proliferation and altered gene expression, with upregulated cell division genes and downregulated antigen presentation genes. In vivo, mitochondrial acquisition reduced B cell activation and inflammatory cytokine production. Pre-sorted B cells also acquired isolated mitochondria, exhibiting a similar anti-inflammatory phenotype.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings highlight mitochondrial trafficking as a key MSC-immune cell interaction mechanism with immunomodulatory therapeutic potential.">

        <tr id="Influenza-associated bacterial super-infections in the lung lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Nearly all people have pre-existing memory to influenza virus, which can protect against subsequent infection in the lung. This study explored the role B cells play in protection against bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae) super-infection with previous heterotypic influenza memory. B cell deficiency resulted in an increased inflammatory lung environment and lung tissue injury during super-infection. Loss of B cells increased populations of memory CD8+ T cells in the lung and these CD8+ T cells were transcriptionally and functionally distinct from WT mice. Use of antibody-deficient mouse models showed that this phenotype was specifically due to loss of antibody production from B cells. Passive immunization with influenza-antibody serum in B cell deficient mice rescued the CD8+ T cell phenotype. CD8+ T cell depletion and lethal super-infection challenge experiments showed that the cytotoxic memory CD8+ T cells from B cell deficient mice protect against super-infection bacterial burden and mortality. These findings provide insight into the importance of B cells for regulating immune responses against infection.">

Additionally, this study seeks to explore the cytotoxicity of these T cells against autologous tumor organoids, providing theoretical and experimental evidence for the feasibility of this model as a platform for adoptive cell immunotherapy in head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods HNCO single cells were co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) collected and isolated from patients with HNC. The culture supernatant was collected and assayed for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α). The expression of T cell activation markers cluster of differentiation (CD)137 and CD107a was measured by flow cytometry to confirm tumor specificity and cytotoxicity. Additionally, the optimal effector-to-target (E/T) ratio was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and HNCO killing was quantified by fluorescent labeling. Results Of the 27 successfully established HNCO-T cell co-culture systems, 81.48% induced the in vitro differentiation and tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell expansion capable of mediating the killing of mature HNCOs.

        <tr id="Understanding the dynamics of the tumor-immune ecosystem is crucial for advancing neoadjuvant strategies in cancer treatment. This study investigated alterations in the tumor-immune microenvironment related to the response to preoperative combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty patients underwent combination therapy. Biopsy or surgical specimens were obtained before and after treatment. Single-cell-based, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry and image cytometry were employed to assess changes in immune cell densities and profiles. Three distinct immune profiles were identified: hypo-, lymphoid-, and myeloid-inflamed. Significant decreases in tumor volume and increases in CD45+ cells and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) scores were observed in the hypo- and lymphoid-inflamed groups, whereas the myeloid-inflamed group showed minimal changes. After treatment, increased calreticulin expression in tumor cells, together with increased lymphoid cell lineages, was observed in non-recurrent cases. The myeloid-inflamed group exhibited higher expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2, suggesting the presence of a hypoxic and metastasis-promoting environment. Spatial analysis revealed that responders had a high infiltration of T cells within tumor cell nests, whereas non-responders had fewer T cells, with β-catenin expression in cancer cells. Upregulated lymphocyte activation gene 3 in the myeloid-inflammation group, and PD-L1 dynamics suggest potential targets for further therapy. These findings highlight the need for targeted neoadjuvant strategies based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are key effectors in the antitumor immune response. However, their function is commonly suppressed in tumors in the form of exhausted CTL. Understanding mechanisms of suppression and of therapeutics to overcome them is of substantial basic and translational importance yet hindered by limited access to large numbers of exhausted CTL in vitro. Methods Here we use three-dimensional tissue culture to generate primary human CTL with suppressed function. Using functional assays, a 21-antibody flow cytometry panel and determination of calcium signaling and CTL tumor cell couple maintenance, we have characterized their phenotype. Results We show that these cells closely resemble exhausted CTL from tumors. For a better understanding of in vitro human primary CTL as key tools in therapeutic development, before and after induction of suppression, we have determined the dependence of CTL function on methodology of generation, antigen dose, and affinity across two T–cell receptors and multiple tumor cell lines. As a further determination of their phenotype, we have investigated the morphology and subcellular F-actin distributions of CTL as key regulators of effector function. Primary human CTL formed cell couples with tumor target cells even in the absence of antigen. Yet, the gradual stabilization of such cell couples was associated with increasing CTL effector function. Induction of suppression substantially destabilized CTL tumor cell couples. Conclusion This comprehensive characterization of the phenotype of in vitro primary human CTL, including a suppressed state, should facilitate their use in basic research, the development of CTL-targeting therapeutics and the determination of their mechanism of action.">

        <tr id="Bronchiectasis is a chronic airway disease characterized by dysbiosis, persistent inflammation, and permanent structural airway damage. Neutrophilic inflammation is a key pathogenic feature, as indicated by enhanced neutrophil-derived proteases and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), associated with poor prognosis. However, recent studies have identified an eosinophilic endotype in up to 30% of patients, characterized by higher levels of type 2 (T2) cytokines and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). The role of T helper (Th) cells in the dysregulated inflammatory environment of bronchiectasis remains unclear. Evidence suggests that persistent bacterial infection can skew adaptive immunity from Th1 toward Th2 response, while the airway microbiome-IL-17 axis is also a critical regulator of chronic inflammation. T regulatory (Treg) cells have been shown to play a protective role against excessive chronic inflammation by modulating the function of several types of effector cells, including the Th17 subset. However, the capacity of this subset to delay or prevent disease progression remains to be determined Microbial dysbiosis, with loss of diversity and increased quantity of bacterial pathogens, may also be important for disease progression, and emerging evidence indicates that distinct inflammatory endotypes associate with specific microbiota alterations, especially in severe disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the immune cells and cytokine signaling that are involved in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Additionally, we present the main endotypes of bronchiectasis and explore the relationships between the type of inflammation and alterations in microbiota, as well as the potential benefits of targeting specific pathophysiological mechanisms for the management of bronchiectasis. This review also examines how bacterial infection can shift adaptive immunity from Th1 toward Th2 responses, the role of the airway microbiome-IL-17 axis in chronic inflammation and the potential protective role of Treg cells against excessive inflammation. Novel therapeutic strategies are highlighted, with focus on targeting specific cytokine signaling pathways and restoring Th17/Treg balance These developments underscore a shift toward precision medicine in bronchiectasis, emphasizing the importance of identifying specific inflammatory endotypes to tailor treatment strategies effectively.">

Our findings reveal that all three mDC subsets are relatively increased and activated in muscle of IBM patients and correlate with IBM-specific inflammatory markers.

 Background:
 Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is typically reversible in CAR-T therapy, while hyperinflammatory syndromes like macrophage activation-like syndrome (MAS-L) and high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IEC-HS) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early interventions are critical for improving outcomes. We aim to analyze clinical cytokine assays and cellular phenotypes early in hyperinflammatory syndromes to identify profiles for severe cases to inform management decisions.
 Methods:
 This study included 113 CAR-T patients (pt) (September 2019-March 2024) with cytokine profiles (CP) performed at the second tocilizumab dose or with suspected hyperinflammatory states (CP1), followed by assessments at 24 hours (CP24) and 48 hours (CP48). 52 pts consented to blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cell immune phenotyping at pre-treatment (pre-LD) and day 1 for PB.
 Results:
 Among the 113 pts, CRS pts (N=74), when compared to MAS-L(N=19) & IEC-HS (N=20) at CP1, had lower levels of TNF (median in pg/mL; 31, 62.9, 47.7) , IL-18 (794, 1353, 2011), and MCP-1 (689, 2722, 2485.5). While MAS-L and IEC-HS had similar CP1 profiles, CP24 and CP48 differed between them: TNF & MCP-1 levels decreased in MAS-L but remained elevated or increased in IEC-HS. IL-18 was stable in MAS-L but increased steadily daily in IEC-HS. Infections were more frequent in IEC-HS (CRS: 43%; MAS-L: 58%; IEC-HS: 85%; p=0.002). Notably, patients who died with persistent
 E. faecium
 bacteremia had higher IL-18 in CP48. In the 52 pts with cell phenotypes available by flow, 33 had CRS, 18 MAS-L and 8 IEC-HS. The correlation between cell phenotypes and cytokine levels showed that elevated TNF at CP1 correlated with increased non-classical monocytes in pre-LD BM and higher NK and NK-T cells in pre-LD PB. Similarly, elevated IL-18 CP48 levels correlated with increased CD8 T-cells, NK-T cells, and intermediate monocytes in pre-LD PB, as well as increased NK cells at both pre-LD and day 1 (Table).
 Conclusions:
 We report distinct cytokine profiles in IEC-HS early in the inflammatory course post-CAR-T therapy. These elevated cytokines correlate with specific immune cell subsets, including BM-resident monocytes, intermediate monocytes with heightened cytokine trafficking and inflammatory capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility for identifying potential biomarkers for early risk stratification and targeted interventions.

In response to serum starvation, tumor cells upregulate cholesterol biogenesis pathways as a compensatory mechanism. Our study reveals the critical role of cholesterol reduction in mediating serum starvation-induced enhancement of anti-tumor immune response, highlighting the importance of plasma membrane composition in determining tumor cell response to TCR-T cell killing.

        <tr id="The nucleoside analogue 6-thio-2'-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG, also known as THIO) is a telomere-targeting agent with important clinical potency. It can selectively kill telomerase-positive tumor cells. We previously reported that THIO could successfully induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in multiple mouse tumor cell lines. In this study, we further explored the potential impact of THIO on remodeling the tumor microenvironment, regulating anti-tumor immune responses, and its possible synergistic effects with other therapeutic methods, such as tumor vaccines. Our results showed that THIO could also induce ICD in various human tumor cell lines. The induction of ICD in tumor cells promoted the migration and maturation of antigen-presenting cells. Administration of THIO significantly inhibited the growth of established CT26 and TC-1 tumors in mice. Meanwhile, it enhanced the anti-tumor CTL response and reduced the levels of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in both the spleen and tumor tissues. Additionally, THIO had a direct inhibitory effect on the proliferation and differentiation of MDSCs. Moreover, when combined with bacterial biomimetic vesicles or a nanovaccine, such as THIO with BBV or different Q11-tumor antigen peptide nanofibers, it exhibited enhanced anti-tumor effects and immune responses compared to monotherapy in either “immune hot” TC-1 tumors or “immune cold” B16-F10 tumors. In summary, THIO has the ability to remodel the tumor microenvironment, exert a specific killing effect on tumor cells, and effectively cooperate with tumor vaccines. This broadens the anti-tumor mechanisms of THIO and provides a promising strategy for improving anti-tumor immunotherapies.

        <tr id="Introduction The pathogenesis of biliary atresia (BA) is unclear to date and no therapies targeting immune regulatory pathways exist. Here we characterized potent effector liver tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (Trm) and monocytic cells in children with advanced BA and an age-matched control group to gain insight into BA pathogenesis and immunologic regulation. Methods Liver explants from 18 children with biliary atresia and 10 with metabolic disease and normal histology were analyzed ex vivo by multicolor flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Cytokines and cytotoxic mediators were quantified by intracellular staining and bead-based arrays in culture supernatant. Results The frequency of CD103+CD69+CD8+ Trm cells and CD14+CD16+ monocytes was significantly higher in BA than in the control group. In BA, T cells showed elevated expression of CD103, CD69, CD39 and production of TNF-α and Granzyme-B ex vivo, which could be reproduced in vitro by allowing cell-contact with monocytes. Conclusions Cytotoxic CD8+ Trm cells and intrahepatic monocytes might contribute to tissue destruction in BA. Therapies targeting Trm cells or the TNF-α signaling pathway could be explored to delay progression to cirrhosis in BA.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

        <tr id="Cancer cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating antigen presentation, allowing them to escape detection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and resist immunotherapy. Dendritic cells (DCs), one of the potent antigen-presenting cells in cancer immunity, are essential for initiating adaptive immune responses. Unfortunately, DC functions are disrupted by the tumor microenvironment. Suppressive cytokines, for instance, can impair DC maturation, reduce antigen-presenting capacity, or induce DC apoptosis. A novel strategy against such challenges is reprogramming cancer cells into DC-like cells. By inducing transcription factors, cancer cells can be directed to develop a DC phenotype, which is characterized by enhanced antigen-presenting markers, co-stimulatory molecules, and an increased ability to prime naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, showing enhanced immune activation and tumor regression. However, limitations remain, including reprogramming efficiency, tumor heterogeneity, and safety issues that require further refinement. This review provides fundamental knowledge about DC in the tumor microenvironment and cell fate reprogramming, recent advances in reprogramming cancer cells into DCs, and eventually discusses perspectives for translating this approach into clinical settings.

        <tr id="Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) results from high-dose ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, with bone marrow (BM) being highly susceptible due to its proliferative activity. BM injury causes pancytopenia, leading to infections, anemia, and bleeding. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold promise for ARS treatment because of their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative properties. However, challenges such as replicative senescence, poor survival, and engraftment in irradiated microenvironments limit their efficacy. This study evaluated rapamycin-preconditioned placenta-derived MSCs (rPD-MSCs) in a mouse ARS model. Rapamycin was selected for preconditioning due to its ability to induce autophagy and modulate cytokine secretion. We assessed rapamycin-dependent modulation of autophagy-related genes and proteins, as well as hematopoietic cytokines secretion in PD-MSCs, and evaluated morphological changes in blood and BM at 7 and 21 days post-irradiation in ICR/CD1 mice. Preconditioning with rapamycin alters the secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3LG) in PD-MSCs without affecting cell viability. rPD-MSCs better enhance hematopoietic recovery, restore bone marrow cellularity, and increase peripheral blood cell counts by elevating the secretion of hematopoietic cytokines compared to non-preconditioned cells. These results highlight rapamycin preconditioning as a promising strategy to enhance MSCs therapeutic potential for ARS, supporting further preclinical and clinical exploration.">

        <tr id="The autoimmune response driving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) destruction in immune-mediated aplastic anemia (AA) remains incompletely understood. We previously identified a disease-specific immune cell network involving T-, B-, and myeloid cells. However, the interactions within this network, the interaction with the microenvironment and the chronological events in AA development, remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to characterize the changes occurring during disease development and to define the interactions between potential autoreactive cells and their target. Using imaging mass cytometry, we analyzed bone marrow (BM) biopsies from AA patients at diagnosis and after treatment with horse-derived anti-thymocyte globulin (hATG), and six controls. Within the hypocellular BM architecture, we identified lymphoid-dominant 'immune hotspots' with high densities of pro-inflammatory lymphocytes, and macrophage-enriched hotspots that additionally contained activated macrophages in proximity to progenitors. These immune hotspots potentially represent sites where the active immune response resulting in HSPC destruction takes place. In BM regions depleted of progenitors, effector cells with a differentiated phenotype remain. Our data indicate that HSPC destruction in AA is mediated by coordinated interactions among specific immune cell subpopulations. As the immune response progresses and HSPCs are depleted, the immune composition shifts, with activated T- and B-cells differentiating into terminally differentiated T-cells and plasma cells. In patients with normalizing BM post-hATG treatment, most immune hotspots were depleted, underscoring their potential pathogenic role. Collectively, our study visualizes the complex interactions among immune cell subpopulations and, for the first time, reveals the order of events in the immune-mediated pathogenesis of AA.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key players in the immune system, exhibiting remarkable plasticity that allows them to influence cancer progression in opposing ways. Their polarization into M1 or M2 subtypes dictates their impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME). M1 macrophages, characterized by pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor functions, release cytokines that enhance immune responses and promote tumor destruction. Conversely, M2 macrophages support tumor growth by facilitating angiogenesis, immune suppression, and tissue remodeling, thereby creating a favorable environment for cancer progression. Further classification of M2 macrophages into subtypes M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d underscores their diverse roles in tumor development, metastasis, and immune evasion. Given their crucial role in shaping the TME, macrophages have become a major focus in cancer research. Recent therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram macrophages, shifting their phenotype from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressive. By targeting macrophage polarization, researchers seek to develop novel immunotherapies that enhance treatment efficacy, improve patient outcomes, and combat therapy resistance in cancer.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown limited efficacy against solid tumors because of poor tissue penetration, constrained activity, and early exhaustion due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although stimulatory cytokines can counteract immune suppression, their systemic administration entails risk of toxicities and counter-regulatory responses. Here, we leveraged a population of tumor-associated TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs) to release interferon-α (IFN-α) and/or orthogonal interleukin-2 (oIL2) at the tumor site. Targeted cytokine delivery rescued CAR T cell functionality against the clinically relevant tumor antigen B7-homolog 3 (B7-H3) in an orthotopic, CAR T cell-refractory, immunocompetent mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM) named mGB2 that recapitulates pathological features of the human disease. Immunophenotypic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that inhibition of premature terminal exhaustion and induction of effector and memory states featuring activation of signaling pathways and transcriptional networks putatively boosted CAR T cell antitumor activity. Furthermore, IFN-α, especially when combined with private oIL2 signaling to CAR T cells, elicited potent endogenous T cell responses against multiple tumor-associated antigens, leading to delayed GBM growth and prolonged mouse survival even with tumors expressing B7-H3 in only a fraction of cells. These data suggest that the combination of TEM-based cytokine delivery and CAR T cells may have synergistic effects and support the further study of this approach for the treatment of patients with GBM.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) are pivotal cell populations involved in the immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, there has been little success in large-scale clinical trials of myeloid cell modulators. We aim to investigate potential molecular targets for TIMs and disclose the underlying mechanism. Using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we analyzed 24 spontaneous HCC tissues from mouse. Orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor models were established with or without anti-SIRPα antibody treatment. Patient-derived tumor xenografts model (PDX) was used to identify the CD47-SIRPα axis blocked therapy. In 24 murine spontaneous HCC tissues, we observed that the proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) plus macrophages accounts for 40–90% of TIMs and SIRPα was highly expressed in TIMs, especially in macrophages and MDSCs. Through in vivo experiments, we showed that anti-SIRPα therapy inhibited tumor growth, accompanied by increased CD8+ T cells infiltration and decreased TIMs including MDSCs and macrophages. We found that anti-SIRPα inhibited immunosuppressive function, migration and PD-L1 expression of myeloid cells. In a series of in vivo experiments, we demonstrated the anti-tumor and immune-active effect of SIRPα-blocked therapy. Mechanistically, anti-SIRPα inhibited the immunosuppressive function and PD-L1 expression of TIMs through downregulating PI3K/AKT signaling in myeloid cells. At last, anti-SIRPα enhanced the antitumor effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy in orthotopic and spontaneous murine models. Together, SIRPα blocked therapy reversed the immunosuppressive TIME, which provides a promising therapeutic rationale for increasing the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in treating HCC.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is driven by systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This study aims to characterize the immune landscape in ACLF and identify potential therapeutic targets.


APPROACH AND RESULTS
We employed single-cell RNA sequencing, visium spatial sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis to profile immune cells in ACLF livers compared to acute liver failure (ALF), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and controls. ACLF livers exhibited a distinct immune signature with increased neutrophils, particularly CCL4+ subsets, which drive unresolved inflammation by recruiting additional neutrophils and inflammatory CD14+S100A9+ monocytes. Resident Kupffer cells were reduced, and monocytes differentiated into TREM2+ macrophages with an M1-like pro-inflammatory phenotype, exacerbating inflammation. Additionally, lymphoid cells showed significant dysfunction, with reduced NK cells and relatively expanded T cells exhibiting diminished cytotoxicity or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Cell-cell communication analysis identified the ANXA1-FPR1 axis as a key interaction between T cells and myeloid cells, serving as a negative feedback mechanism to dampen inflammation. Plasma and hepatic ANXA1 levels were elevated in ACLF patients, correlating with disease severity. In preclinical model, the ANXA1 peptide Ac2-26 improved liver function, reduced inflammation, and promoted macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. In vitro, Ac2-26 inhibited CCL4-mediated monocyte chemotaxis and M1 polarization, effects partially blocked by the FPR1 inhibitor Randialic acid B. Mechanically, Ac2-26 activated AMPK and inhibited mTOR signaling.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings provide a comprehensive immune profile in ACLF and highlight ANXA1 as a potential therapeutic target for resolving immune dysregulation and improving outcomes in ACLF.">

        <tr id="Abrogating the immunoevasive role of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) represents a critical yet still elusive challenge in cancer treatment. Progress in this area has been hampered by both technological limitations and incomplete understanding of TIME-dependent immunoevasion mechanisms. We hypothesize that the immune-evasive role of TIME subpopulations—including regulatory T cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and tumor-associated macrophages—is critically mediated by hyperconnected Master Regulator Checkpoint (MRC) modules whose aberrant activity, as induced by paracrine signals, can be abrogated or modulated either genetically or pharmacologically. MRCs are primarily composed of transcription and co-transcription factors, acting downstream of surface receptors and signal transduction cascades to control the transcriptional identity and, ultimately, the phenotype of individual TIME subpopulations. Pharmacological inhibition of subpopulation-specific MRC proteins can thus help reprogram the TIME and potentially abrogate or modulate its immunosuppressive state. This paradigm shift, away from single ligand/receptor targeting, is supported by recent algorithmic, experimental, and clinical advances allowing systematic identification of MRCs and their pharmacological modulators using systems immunology-based approaches. Refocusing the deployment of existing tools and experimental methods that have proven successful in tumor cell contexts to identify and validate MRC-targeting agents capable of remodeling the immunosuppressive cell states of the tumor microenvironment can potentially pave the road to novel combination therapy synergizing with immune checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Glycosylation controls immune evasion, tumor progression, and metastasis. However, how tumor cell sialylation regulates immune evasion remains poorly characterized. ST6GalNAc-I, a sialyltransferase that conjugates sialic acid to the glycans in glycoproteins, was overexpressed in an aggressive-type KPA (KrasG12D/+ Trp53R172H/+ Ad-Cre) lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) model and patient samples. Proteomic and biochemical analysis indicated that ST6GalNAc-I mediated NECTIN2 sialylation in LUAD cells. ST6GalNAc-I–deficient tumor cells cocultured with T cells were more susceptible to T cell–mediated tumor cell killing, indicating a key role for NECTIN2 in T cell dysfunction. Mice injected with St6galnac-I–knockdown syngeneic cells showed reduced lung tumor incidence and Nectin2/Tigit-associated immunosuppression. ST6GalNAc-I–deficient cells exhibited reduced P-DMEA metabolite levels, while administration of P-DMEA promoted LUAD cell proliferation via MUC5AC. MUC5AC interacted and colocalized with PRRC1 in the Golgi, suggesting a potential role for PRRC1 in MUC5AC glycosylation. Mice injected with ST6GalNAc-I/MUC5AC-deficient cells (human LUAD) exhibited reduced lung tumor incidence, angiogenesis, and liver metastases. Mechanistically, ST6GalNAc-I/MUC5AC regulates VCAN-V1, a key factor in tumor matrix remodeling during angiogenesis and metastasis. These findings demonstrate that ST6GalNAc-I–mediated sialylation of NECTIN2/MUC5AC is critical for immune evasion and tumor angiogenesis. Targeting this pathway may prevent LUAD development and/or metastasis.">

        <tr id="Background Cerebral malaria (CM), a fatal neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is partially driven by neuronal injury. Emerging evidence highlights exosomes as vital mediators of mast cell–neuron interactions in neurological disease progression. While mast cells and their exosomes were previously shown to exacerbate experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) severity, the specific role of mast cell-derived exosomes in CM-associated neuronal injury remains unclear. Methods Exosomes were isolated from resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated P815 mast cells (denoted as RE and AE, respectively) and characterized. These exosomes were administered to ECM mice and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected red blood cell (iRBC)-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells to investigate their functional impact and mechanisms. Results Both RE and AE exhibited spherical morphology (20–100 nm diameter) and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81). Compared to infected controls, RE and AE treatments significantly reduced survival time, increased ECM incidence, and exacerbated brain pathology, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, RE and AE administration elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and IL-1β) and increased numbers of neurons expressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1, XBP-1). Notably, AE treatment induced higher morbidity/mortality rates, more severe neuronal injury, and greater ER stress marker expression than RE. In vitro, RE-treated iRBC-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells showed higher GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 mRNA levels than AE-treated cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed three downregulated miRNAs (miR-330-3p, miR-185-5p, and miR-379-5p) and six upregulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-187-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-192-5p) in AE versus RE, all previously implicated in targeting GRP78, CHOP, or XBP-1. Conclusions Mast cell-derived exosomes, particularly those from activated cells (AE), exacerbated ECM neuronal injury through partial activation of ER stress pathways.

        <tr id="Abstract Cervical cancer progression is not solely driven by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection but is profoundly influenced by the local immune microenvironment, particularly chronic cytokine imbalances. Unlike the acute cytokine storms observed in infections or sepsis, cervical cancer is characterized by a persistent, low-grade, “smoldering inflammatory response” that fuels tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8 sustain a tumor-supportive milieu, promoting angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and resistance to apoptosis, while immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β dampen anti-tumor immune responses and facilitate immune escape. This review explores chronic cytokine dysregulation in cervical cancer, examining how the prolonged, dysregulated cytokine network shapes the tumor microenvironment, remodels stromal interactions, and influences immune cell recruitment and function. We highlight key cytokines involved in these processes and discuss their clinical significance as potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Understanding these sustained inflammatory processes is critical because they represent a distinct biological landscape compared to acute inflammatory reactions and offer unique windows for therapeutic intervention. The paper reviewed emerging therapeutic strategies targeting these chronic cytokine pathways, including cytokine blockade, immune modulation, and combination approaches integrating immunotherapies or nanomedicine. Addressing chronic cytokine dysregulation holds promise for improving cervical cancer management and patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="The immune system plays a major role in pulmonary fibrosis (PF), a devastating lung disease with limited treatment options. Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immune cells with remarkable immunosuppressive functions. We hypothesized that their anti‐inflammatory activity may dampen PF by inhibiting inflammation and its transition to fibrosis. Here, we studied the emergence of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)‐ and monocytic (M)‐MDSCs in a murine model of PF. We assessed immunological, histopathological, and clinical changes at days 3, 7, 14, and 21 following bleomycin challenge. A comprehensive overview of the role of MDSCs during the acute lung injury and chronic phase of pulmonary fibrosis is provided, along with the effects of MDSCs adoptive transfer and depletion. Inflammation and fibrosis increased over a period of 21 days after bleomycin administration. In the lung, the number of PMN‐MDSCs increased, while M‐MDSCs decreased over the time following bleomycin challenge. Especially, M‐MDSCs showed enhanced suppressive activity on day 3 following bleomycin challenge. Adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs attenuated inflammation and fibrosis development. However, depletion of PMN‐MDSCs did not lead to an exacerbation of PF. Our results suggest that adoptive transfer of PMN‐MDSCs can ameliorate the inflammatory responses and thus the development of fibrosis in a bleomycin‐induced pulmonary fibrosis model.">

        <tr id="The role of extracellular vesicles has been extensively studied in physiological and pathological conditions, and growing evidence has pinpointed them as key players in tumor progression, regulation of the metastatic niche, and modulation of anti-tumor immune responses. Indeed, a dynamic transfer of extracellular vesicles between cancer cells and immunological or non-immunological cells homing in the tumor microenvironment exists, and the balance between their release by cancer cells and by normal cells determines cancer progression. Here, we focused on the role of extracellular vesicles in the dysregulation of the bone marrow environment in pediatric tumors such as acute leukemias and neuroblastomata, whose poor prognosis is strictly related to the involvement of such anatomical site. Acute leukemias arise from bone marrow progenitors, whereas approximately 50% of neuroblastoma patients have bone marrow metastases at diagnosis. Thus, here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the bone marrow dysregulation in pediatric acute leukemias and neuroblastomata with particular emphasis on the involvement of extracellular vesicles.">

This single-cell transcriptomic and flow cytometry analyses revealed distinct activation and transition patterns among neutrophils, macrophages, T cells, and B cells. Neutrophils exhibited early transcriptional remodeling enriched in inflammatory and interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling pathways. Cross-species integration identified a conserved IFNγ-driven transition toward il8⁺ neutrophils. Furthermore, recombinant interleukin-8 (IL8) enhanced antibacterial responses in tilapia and human neutrophils, while inhibition of STAT1 reduced IL8 expression. IL8 stimulation increased phagocytosis and  reactive oxygen species (ROS） production, supporting its role in neutrophil-mediated bacterial clearance. Together, this findings establish IFNγ-IL8 as a conserved mechanism in vertebrate immunity and a potential target for antibacterial therapies.">

        <tr id="Mechanisms by which mucosal regeneration is abrogated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are still under investigation, and a role for an intestinal stem cell (ISC) defect is now emerging. Herein, we report an abnormal ISC death that occurs in Crohn’s disease, which exacerbates colitis, limits ISC-dependent mucosal repair, and is controlled through the death factor Transmembrane protein 219 (TMEM219). Large alterations in TMEM219 expression were observed in patients with Crohn’s disease, particularly in those with active disease and/or those who were nonresponders to conventional therapy, confirming that TMEM219 signaling is abnormally activated and leads to failure of the mucosal regenerative response. Mechanistic studies revealed a proapoptotic TMEM219-mediated molecular signature in Crohn’s disease, which associates with Caspase-8 activation and ISC death. Pharmacological blockade of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 binding/signal with the recombinant protein ecto-TMEM219 restored the self-renewal abilities of miniguts generated from patients with Crohn’s disease in vitro and ameliorated DSS-induced and T cell-mediated colitis in vivo, ultimately leading to mucosal healing. Genetic tissue-specific deletion of TMEM219 in ISCs in newly generated TMEM219fl/flLGR5cre mice revived their mucosal regenerative abilities both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that a TMEM219-dependent ISC death exacerbates colitis and that TMEM219 blockade reestablishes intestinal self-renewal properties in IBD.">

        <tr id="Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection. B-1a cells play a crucial role in maintaining immuno-physiologic homeostasis. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin G (Siglec-G) regulates B-1a cell’s behavior and function. Trogocytosis is the process by which one cell acquires portions of another cell’s plasma membrane and cytoplasm through direct contact. During sepsis, neutrophils accumulate in the lungs and serosal cavities, while B-1a cells decrease. We hypothesized that neutrophil-mediated trogocytosis causes B-1a cell depletion in sepsis, and that targeting this process could preserve B-1a cells and attenuate sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Sepsis was induced in mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Twenty hours after CLP, B-1a cells (CD19+B220lo/-CD23-CD5+) in the pleural and peritoneal cavities were quantified, and neutrophil engulfment of B-1a cells as well as trogocytosis were assessed. We also examine the interaction between Siglec-G and the “don’t-eat-me” signal receptor, CD47. Our data showed that B-1a cell numbers and frequencies in the pleural and peritoneal cavities were significantly decreased in sepsis. Neutrophils co-cultured with B-1a cells significantly increased B-1a cell internalization via trogocytosis. We observed a strong binding interaction between Siglec-G and CD47, which facilitates neutrophil-mediated trogocytosis by compromising CD47 function. We discovered a novel 11-aa therapeutic peptide, named Compound 11 (C11), derived from the CD47 region interacting with Siglec-G. C11 effectively preserved B-1a cell populations, significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, alleviated ALI, and improved survival in sepsis. Our findings highlight the Siglec-G/CD47 axis on B-1a cells as a key regulator of neutrophil-mediated B-1a cell depletion. Targeting this pathway with C11 represents a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate immune dysregulation and improve sepsis outcomes.">

Myeloid cells, including macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils, play pivotal roles in shaping the ovarian tissue microenvironment and regulating inflammatory responses. However, a comprehensive understanding of the roles of these cells in the ovarian aging process is lacking. To bridge this knowledge gap, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and flow cytometry analysis to functionally characterize CD45+ CD11b+ myeloid cell populations in young (3 months old) and aged (14-17 months old) murine ovaries. Our dataset unveiled the presence of five ovarian macrophage subsets, including a Cx3cr1lowCd81hi subset unique to the aged murine ovary. Most notably, our data revealed significant alterations in ANNEXIN and TGFβ signaling within aged ovarian myeloid cells, which suggest a novel mechanism contributing to the onset and progression of aging-associated inflammation and fibrosis in the ovarian tissue.">

However, detailed single-cell transcriptomic data on the bone microenvironment of PMOP patients are lacking.

Single-cell RNA sequencing of bone marrow cells from 10 PMOP patients and 10 controls (93 867 cells) was performed, complemented by histological validation and in vitro modulation of key pathways. The findings revealed elevated expression of cytokines and chemokines in specific cell subpopulations, including hematopoietic stem cells, B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and erythroid cells, which are likely to contribute to the promotion of osteoclastogenesis. Enhanced differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts was linked to elevated B cell communication. Furthermore, three monocyte subsets (THBS1+ with CCL20+, or LRP1+, or C1QA+) exhibited osteoclastogenic potential, associated with the activation of the NOD-like receptor pathway. Targeting THBS1 significantly reduced bone loss in PMOP mouse models. This study provides a detailed characterization of bone marrow cell heterogeneity in postmenopausal women, offering insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting PMOP.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVES
Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is a chronic childhood disease classically attributed to innate immune cell dysregulation. This study aimed to elucidate the role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), including natural killer (NK) cells and helper-ILCs (hILCs), in sJIA during clinically inactive disease (CID) through phenotypic and functional analysis.


METHODS
Peripheral ILCs from children with sJIA during CID receiving IL-1 inhibitors (n=40) were analyzed by flow cytometry and compared to 23 healthy children (HC) and 22 patients with unrelated autoinflammatory diseases on IL-1 inhibitors. Plasma proteomic profiling was also performed.


RESULTS
sJIA patients showed a significant reduction in circulating NK cell frequencies compared to HC, with an increased proportion of CD56bright NK cells. While overall hILC frequencies were comparable to HC, ILC1s were increased, whereas ILC precursors (ILCPs) were reduced. ILC1 frequency correlated positively with IL-18 plasma levels, while ILC2 frequency correlated negatively. Functional assessments revealed that NK cells from sJIA patients had variable IFN-γ production upon IL-18/IL-12 stimulation, inversely correlating with IL-18 levels. Additionally, hILCs from these patients showed a specific impairment in IFN-γ production despite normal IL-13 production, potentially linked to decreased IL-18 receptor α (IL-18RA) expression in ILC1s. Proteomic analysis confirmed IL-18 as the most upregulated cytokine in sJIA plasma.


CONCLUSION
sJIA patients in CID exhibit significant innate immune abnormalities, including altered ILC subset distribution and impaired IFN-γ production, strongly associated with IL-18 levels. These findings suggest ongoing immune dysregulation despite clinical remission, underscoring a potential role for ILCs and cytokine interaction in sJIA pathogenesis.">

While Tregs are well known for their immune suppressive activity toward the adaptive immune system, less is known about their regulatory activity toward the innate compartment. We showed in human and mouse lung cancer, that chemotherapy transiently reduced Treg number and switched the mononuclear phagocyte (MP) landscape toward a pro-inflammatory signature but also an increased TGFβ-expressing TAM accumulation over time. Preventing Treg recovery further increased the recruitment of monocytes and limited TGFβ expression upon TAM differentiation, demonstrating that Tregs dampen the pro-inflammatory status of the MP compartment induced by chemotherapy and promote tumor relapse. Anti-TNFR2 antibody treatment during the Treg recovery phase affected the direct interaction between Tregs and MPs, increased the pro-inflammatory signature of the MPs and improved survival in the mouse model. Targeting the crosstalk between tumor-associated Tregs and the MP compartment limits the reconstitution of an anti-inflammatory environment following chemotherapy and improves therapeutic outcome.">

Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of colonic mucosal tissue to build a cellular and molecular model for MC. Our results show that in MC, there is a substantial expansion of tissue CD8+ T cells, likely arising from local expansion following T cell receptor engagement. Within the T cell compartment, MC is characterized by a shift in CD8 tissue-resident memory T cells towards a highly cytotoxic and inflammatory phenotype and expansion of CD4+ T regulatory cells. These results provide insight into inflammatory cytokines shaping MC pathogenesis and highlight notable similarities and differences with other immune-mediated intestinal diseases, including a common upregulation of IL26 and an MC-specific upregulation of IL10. These data help identify targets against enteric T cell subsets as an effective strategy for treatment of MC.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how B cell depleting therapies modulate the immune landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16+ monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. This was accompanied by increases in TNFα messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNFα treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion induced changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT+ regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4+ T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different cell-type specific reprogramming as a result of B cell depletion treatment in MS.">

        <tr id="While immune checkpoint inhibition (CPI) has reshaped cancer treatment, the majority of cancer patients do not benefit from this approach, which can also cause immune-related adverse events. Induction of IFNγ responses is thought be necessary for anti-tumor immunity, but growing evidence also implicates IFNγ as a tumor-intrinsic mediator of CPI resistance. CPI-induced IFNγ mediates activation-induced cell death in T cells as an immune-intrinsic mechanism of resistance. In this study, we show that transient block of IFNγ signaling through administration of the JAK1 inhibitor ABT-317 enhances anti-tumor T cell responses with CPI in pre-clinical models. Importantly, sequential but not concomitant ABT-317 treatment led to significantly reduced toxicity and improved tumor efficacy. Sequential treatment reduced activation-induced T cell death and enhanced expansion of tumor-reactive T cell subsets with increased effector function in vivo and ex vivo. Only CPI in combination with ABT-317 also enhanced memory responses by protecting mice from tumor rechallenge. These results demonstrate that JAK inhibition within a discrete time window following CPI addresses an immune-intrinsic mechanism of therapeutic resistance.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms driving immune evasion in early-stage I high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Our findings revealed a highly immunosuppressive HGSOC microenvironment, characterized by abundant infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Trajectory analysis uncovered differentiation pathways of naïve Tregs, which underwent either activation and proliferation or transcriptional instability. The predicted Treg-cell interaction network, including crosstalk within tumor cells, facilitates Treg mobility and maturation while reinforcing their immunosuppressive function and persistence in the tumor. Moreover, their interactions with immune cells likely inhibit CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting cells, supporting tumor immune escape. Additionally, more immunogenic tumor conditions, marked by IFNγ production, may contribute to Treg destabilization. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of Tregs in early immune evasion of HGSOC and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting their activity and differentiation fate.">

        <tr id="The functional plasticity of tumor-infiltrating B (TIL-B) cells spans from anti-tumor responses to non-canonical immune suppression. Yet, how tumor microenvironment (TME) influences TIL-B development is still underappreciated. Our current study integrated single cell transcriptomics and BCR (B cell receptor) sequencing to profile TIL-B phenotypes and clonalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using trajectory and gene regulatory network analysis, we were able to characterize plasma cells, memory and naïve B cells within the HCC TME and further revealed a downregulation of BCR-signaling genes in plasma cells and a subset of inflammatory TNF+ memory B cells. Within the TME, non-switch memory B cell subset acquires an age-associated B cell phenotype (TBET+, CD11c+) and expressed higher levels of PD-L1, CD25 and granzyme B. We further demonstrated that the presence of HCC tumor cells could confer suppressive functions on peripheral blood B cells which in turn, dampen T cell co-stimulation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent novel mechanisms of non-canonical immune suppression in HCC. While previous studies identified atypical memory B cells in chronic hepatitis and across several solid cancer types, we further highlighted their potential role as regulatory B cells (Bregs) within both the TME and peripheral blood of HCC patients.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade can facilitate tumor clearance by T cells, resulting in long term patient survival. However, the capacity of exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex), present during chronic antigen exposure, to form memory after antigen clearance remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single cell RNA/T cell receptor sequencing and ATAC-sequencing on antigen-specific T cells after the clearance of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. These data revealed the formation of a robust population of memory CD8+ T cells that transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally resemble central memory T cells (Tcm) that form after clearance of acute infection. To lineage trace the origin and memory recall response of Tex-derived memory clones, we utilized T cell receptor sequencing over the course of primary infection and rechallenge. We show that chronic Tcm are a clonally distinct lineage of Tex derived from progenitor exhausted cells, persist long-term in the absence of antigen, and undergo rapid clonal expansion during rechallenge. Finally, we demonstrate that αPD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade after chronic LCMV infection preferentially expands clones which form Tcm after clearance. Together, these data support the concept that chronically stimulated T cells form bona fide functional memory T cells through an analogous differentiation pathway to acutely stimulated T cells, which may have significant implications for enhancing immune memory to cancer through checkpoint blockade and vaccination.">

        <tr id="How IRF7 promotes autoimmune B cell responses and systemic autoimmunity is unclear. Analysis of spontaneous SLE-prone mice deficient in IRF7 uncovered the IRF7 role in regulating autoimmune germinal center (GC), plasma cell (PC) and autoantibody responses and disease. IRF7, however, was dispensable for foreign antigen driven GC, PC and antibody responses. Competitive bone marrow (BM) chimeras highlighted the importance of IRF7 in hematopoietic cells in spontaneous GC and PC differentiation. Single-cell-RNAseq of SLE-prone B cells indicated IRF7 mediated B cell differentiation through GC and PC fates. Mechanistic studies revealed that IRF7 promoted B cell differentiation through GC and PC fates by regulating the transcriptome, translation, and metabolism of SLE-prone B cells. Mixed BM chimeras demonstrated a requirement for B cell-intrinsic IRF7 in IgG autoantibody production but not sufficient for promoting spontaneous GC and PC responses. Altogether, we delineate previously unknown B cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms of IRF7-promoted spontaneous GC and PC responses, loss of tolerance, autoantibody production and SLE development. Summary Fike et al. describe previously unknown mechanisms by which IRF7 controls autoimmune B cell and autoantibody responses. Mechanistic studies guided by single-cell-RNAseq and ChIPseq reveal that IRF7 promotes B cell differentiation through germinal center and plasma cell fates by regulating the transcriptome, translation, and metabolism of lupus-prone B cells.">

        <tr id="Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) show only modest response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, motivating ongoing efforts to identify approaches to boost efficacy. Using an immunocompetent mouse model of TNBC, we investigated combination therapy with an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy antibody plus balixafortide, a cyclic peptide inhibitor of CXCR4. Cell-based assays demonstrated that balixafortide functions as an inverse agonist, establishing a mode of action distinct from most compounds targeting CXCR4. Combination anti-PD-1 plus balixafortide significantly reduced growth of orthotopic tumors and extended overall survival relative to single agent therapy or vehicle. Adding balixafortide to anti-PD-1 increased numbers of tertiary lymphoid structures, a marker of local tumor immune responses associated with favorable response to immunotherapy in TNBC. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed that combination anti-PD-1 plus balixafortide reduced T cell exhaustion and increased markers of effector T cell activity. Combination therapy also reduced signatures of immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tumors. MDSCs isolated from mice treated with anti-PD-1 plus balixafortide showed reduced inhibition of T cell proliferation following ex vivo stimulation. These studies demonstrate that combining inhibition of CXCR4 with anti-PD-1 to enhances responses to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in TNBC, supporting future clinical trials.

        <tr id="Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by dysregulated humoral immunity, leading to the generation of autoreactive B cells that can differentiate both within and outside of lymph node (LN) follicles. Methods Here, we employed spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging to investigate the follicular immune landscaping and the in situ transcriptomic profile in LNs from SLE individuals. Results Our spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed robust type I IFN and plasma cell signatures in SLE compared to reactive, control follicles. Cell deconvolution revealed that follicular T cell subsets are mainly affected by the type I IFN fingerprint of SLE follicles. Dysregulation of TFH differentiation was documented by i) the significant reduction of Bcl6hi TFH cells, ii) the reduced cell density of potential IL-4 producing TFH cell subsets associated with the impaired transcriptomic signature of follicular IL-4 signaling and iii) the loss of their correlation with GC-B cells. This profile was accompanied by a marked reduction of Bcl6hi B cells and an enrichment of extrafollicular CD19hiCD11chiTbethi, age-associated B cells (ABCs), known for their autoreactive potential. The increased prevalence of follicular IL-21hi cells further reveals a hyperactive microenvironment in SLE compared to control. Discussion Taken together, our findings highlight the altered immunological landscape of SLE follicles, likely fueled by potent inflammatory signals such as sustained type I IFN and/or IL-21 signaling. Our work provides novel insights into the spatial molecular and cellular signatures of SLE follicular B and TFH cell dynamics, and points to druggable targets to restore immune tolerance and enhance vaccine responses in SLE patients.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are critical mediators of antiviral immunity, yet their role in lymphoid tissues—key reservoirs of HIV persistence—remains poorly defined. Here, we uncover a distinct cytotoxic signature of tonsil-resident NK cells essential for targeting HIV-infected CD4⁺ T cells. Using a human tonsillar model of HIV infection and extracellular matrix-based functional assays, we identify a subset of NK cells co-expressing CD69, CD49a, CD103, and the adaptive marker NKG2C as potent effectors against autologous HIV-infected tissue CD4⁺ T cells. Both CD16⁺ and CD16⁻ NK subsets exhibited cytotoxic antiviral activity. However, HIV infection induced profound functional alterations in these NK cells, including dysregulated expression of CD9, TRAF2, ITGA1, suggesting disrupted activation, signaling, and tissue residency. Functional assays corroborated a significant impairment in the cytotoxic capacity, indicating HIV-driven NK cell dysfunction. Intriguingly, a subset of immature CD16⁻CD69⁺ NK cells underwent functional reprogramming, transitioning into a migration-competent, and metabolically primed state, driven by the upregulation of NUMAI, LCP1, SLC38A1, MT-ND2, NUMA1, MYH9, and CD44. Functional assays confirmed this transition, revealing changes in the expression of immune checkpoint receptors and a gain of cytotoxic function in these reprogrammed cells. These findings advance our understanding of NK cell biology in HIV infection and highlight novel avenues for NK-cell-based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Background The bone marrow (BM) niche contains non-hematopoietic elements including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and bone marrow endothelial cells (BMEC) which provide mechanical support, and control hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation. Although it is known that multiple myeloma (MM) cells interact closely with the BM microenvironment, little is known about the impact of MM on non-hematopoietic niche-forming cells. Methods To address the role of the niche in MM pathogenesis, we utilized the 5TGM1 murine model. During the asymptomatic precursor stage of the model, we isolated the rare non-hematopoietic cells and performed single cell RNA sequencing. Using in-silico methods we characterized the individual cellular components of the niche, their relative abundance and differentiation state before and after exposure to MM cells as well as their intercellular interactions. Results MM engraftment increased the abundance of MSC-lineage cells, BMECs and enhanced endothelial to mesenchymal transition. An inflammatory and oxidative stress signal was identified together with polarization of MSC differentiation away from osteocyte formation towards adipocytes which provide growth factors that are known to support MM expansion. BMEC differentiation was polarized towards sinusoidal endothelial cells with a pro-angiogenic/pro-inflammatory phenotype. Conclusions MM cells impact the BM niche by generating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment with MSC differentiation being changed to generate cell subsets that favor MM growth and survival. In order to induce remission and improve long-term outcome for MM patients these inflammatory and oxidative stress signals need to be reduced and normal niche differentiation trajectories restored.

        <tr id="Background Myocarditis is a common inflammatory heart disease in children and young adults, with fulminant myocarditis (FM) being the most severe form due to its rapid onset and high mortality rate. However, the precise pathological immune subsets and molecular change in myocarditis, particularly FM, remain unknown. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of pediatric peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the acute and recovery phases of FM. A viral myocarditis (MC) mouse model was established using CVB3. Deletion and adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells, as well as blockade of CXCR4, were conducted in vivo. CD8+T cells were sorted and cultivated in vitro, then stimulated with CXCL12 and CXCR4 antagonists to investigate the mechanism of CD8+T cell overactivation. Results CD8+T cells show significant activation, amplification, enhanced cytotoxicity, and increased chemotactic ability in FM. Deletion of CD8+T cells alleviates myocardial injury and improves cardiac function in MC mice, while adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells from MC mice aggravates myocardial inflammation and injury. The transcriptomic analysis reveals elevated CXCR4 expression in CD8+T cells in acute FM. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis drives the overactivation and cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells. In vivo treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist effectively reduces CD8+T cell accumulation in the heart, alleviates myocardial inflammation, and improves cardiac function in MC mice. Conclusions These findings provide deeper insights into the immune landscape of pediatric FM, uncovering a novel role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in driving CD8+T cell responses in myocarditis. Furthermore, they highlight the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis as a promising therapeutic target for myocarditis treatment.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) depends on restoring immune recognition of cancer cells that have evaded immune surveillance. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) is associated with immune-poor, so-called cold tumors whereas loss of its signaling promotes DNA misrepair that could stimulate immune response. Methods We analyzed transcriptomic data from IMvigor210, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and Tumor Immune Syngeneic MOuse data sets to evaluate the predictive value of high βAlt, a score representing low expression of a signature consisting of TGFβ targets and high expression of genes involved in error-prone DNA repair. The immune context of βAlt was assessed by evaluating tumor-educated immune signatures. An ICB-resistant, high βAlt preclinical tumor model was treated with a TGFβ inhibitor, radiation, and/or ICB and assessed for immune composition and tumor control. Results We found that a high βAlt score predicts ICB response yet is paradoxically associated with an immune-poor tumor microenvironmentcancer in both human and mouse tumors. We postulated that high βAlt cancers consist of cancer cells in which loss of TGFβ signaling generates a TGFβ rich, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, preclinical modeling showed that TGFβ inhibition followed by radiotherapy could convert an immune-poor, high βAlt tumor to an immune-rich, ICB-responsive tumor. Mechanistically, TGFβ inhibition increased activated natural killer (NK) cells, which were required to recruit lymphocytes to respond to ICB in irradiated tumors. NK cell activation signatures were also increased in high βAlt, cold mouse and human tumors that responded to ICB. Conclusions These studies indicate that loss of TGFβ signaling competency and gain of error-prone DNA repair identifies a subset of cold tumors that are responsive to ICB. Our mechanistic studies show that inhibiting TGFβ activity can convert a high βAlt, cold tumor into ICB-responsive tumors via NK cells. A biomarker consisting of combined TGFβ, DNA repair, and immune context signatures is a means to prospectively identify patients whose cancers may be converted from cold to hot with appropriate therapy.">

        <tr id="Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), either due to inherited or somatic mutation, is prevalent in colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers. While anti-PD-1 therapy is utilized in both local and advanced disease, up to 50% of MMRd CRC fail to respond. Using animal and human models of MMRd, we determined that interactions between MHC+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and TCF+ BHLHE40+ PRF1+ T cell subsets are associated with control of MMRd tumor growth, during anti-PD-1 treatment. In contrast, resistance is associated with upregulation of TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, and PD-1 expression on T cells, and infiltration of the tumor with immunosuppressive TREM2+ macrophages and monocytes. By combining anti-PD-1 with anti-LAG3/CTLA4/TREM2, up to 100% tumor eradication was achieved in MMRd CRC and remarkably, in >70% in MMRp CRC. This study identifies key T cell and macrophage subsets mediating the efficacy of immunotherapy in overcoming immune escape in both MMRd and MMRp CRC settings. Highlights Anti-PD-1 therapy leads to the accumulation and colocalization of MHCI/II+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and DCs with TCF+ CCL5+ T cells that have high TCR diversity. Resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy involves multiple T cell checkpoints, TREM2+ macrophages, IL1B+ TREM1+ monocytes and neutrophils, and IFITM+ tumor cells. Simultaneous blockade of PD-1, LAG3, CTLA-4 and TREM2 dramatically prevents progression of both MMRd and MMRp tumors. Combination therapy completely eliminates tumors by leveraging MHC+ macrophage, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell interactions, facilitating durable anti-tumor effects.">

        <tr id="Introduction The tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, with tumor-associated macrophages significantly influencing immune suppression and tumor growth. Colorectal cancers (CRC) classified as Consensus Molecular Subtype 4 (CMS4) and triple-negative breast cancers subsets are particularly characterized by a mesenchymal phenotype, immune exclusion, and extensive macrophage infiltration. This study aimed to investigate how targeting cancer cell stemness with specific inhibitors could modulate macrophage polarization in CRC in vitro and breast cancer in vivo, potentially shifting the immune balance from pro-tumor M2-like to anti-tumor M1-like macrophages. Methods We used four stemness inhibitors—salinomycin, SB-431542, JIB-04, and napabucasin—each targeting different pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β, histone demethylation, and STAT3, respectively), to evaluate their effects on CMS4 CRC cell lines (HCT116 and SW620) and human peripheral blood-derived macrophages in an indirect co-culture model. Results Our results showed that CMS4 CRC cell lines induced distinct macrophage polarization patterns, with HCT116 promoting M2-like macrophages and SW620 leaning toward M1-like profile. Notably, the combination of stemness inhibitors reduced stemness markers (CD133, CD44) in colorectal cancer cells and shifted macrophage polarization toward an M1-like phenotype, particularly in co-culture with HCT116. In vivo studies using the syngeneic immunocompetent EO771 breast cancer mouse model demonstrated that combination of stemness inhibitors increased the M1/M2 macrophage ratio. Conclusions Our study highlights the dual potential of stemness inhibitors to target both cancer cells and the immune microenvironment. These findings offer promising strategies for enhancing favorable immunomodulation in mesenchymal-like colorectal tumors.">

        <tr id="Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is characterized by immune dysregulation that facilitates chronic infection. Objective: To investigate the role of T cells in the immunopathology of CL by characterizing the immune landscape of skin lesions using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods: We performed scRNA-seq to profile T cells from PBMC and skin lesions of CL patients. Results: We analyzed the transcriptional profile of distinct populations of CD4+ and CD8+ migratory T cells in CL lesions. CD8+ resident T cells displayed expression of exhaustion markers and were categorized into progenitor, transitional, and terminal stages, with HAVCR2 (TIM-3) identified as a potential driver of dysfunction. Compared to psoriasis and healthy skin, CL lesions showed a reduced frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), potentially linked to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased apoptosis. We also detected double-negative (DN) gd T cells, suggesting their potential role in antigen presentation via MHC class II through TGF-b signaling. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into immune evasion mechanisms in CL, identifying TIM-3, Treg modulation, and the functional role of DN gd T cells as distinct potential targets for future immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) play a crucial role in tumor progression and immune regulation. However, the functional heterogeneity of CAFs remains unclear. Here, we identify antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAF), characterized by high MHC II expression, in gastric cancer (GC) tumors and find that apCAFs are preferentially located near tertiary lymphoid structures. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that apCAFs promote T cell activation and enhances its cytotoxic and proliferative capacities, thereby strengthening T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, apCAFs facilitate the polarization of macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. These polarized macrophages, in turn, promote the formation of apCAFs, creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies anti-tumor immune responses. Notably, baseline tumors in immunotherapy responders across various cancer types exhibit higher levels of apCAFs infiltration. This study advances the understanding of CAFs heterogeneity in GC and highlights apCAFs as a potential biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in pan-cancer.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) including stromal cells that influence resistance to therapy. Recent studies have revealed that stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are heterogeneous in origin, gene expression, and function. Antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs), are defined by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II expression and can activate effector CD4+ T cells that have the potential to contribute to the anti-cancer immune response, but also can induce regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. Whether apCAFs promote or restrain the antitumor response remains uncertain. Using tumor clones of the KPC murine PDAC model differing in sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), we found that immunosensitive (sKPC) tumors were characterized by higher immune cell and apCAF infiltration than resistant (rKPC) tumors. IMC analysis showed proximity of apCAFs and CD4+ T cells in both sKPC and rKPC tumors implicating interaction within the TME. apCAF-depleted sKPC tumor-bearing mice had diminished sensitivity to ICB. apCAFs from both sKPC and rKPC tumors activated tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells and induced Treg differentiation. However, transcriptomic analysis showed that Tregs induced by apCAFs were overexpressed for immunosuppressive genes in rKPCs relative to sKPCs, and that this is associated with differential chemokine signaling from apCAFs depending on tumor origin. Together these data implicate apCAFs as important mediators of the antitumor immune response, modulation of which could facilitate the development of more effective anti-tumor immune based approaches for PDAC patients.">

        <tr id="Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) substantially limits long-term survival following lung transplantation. To identify potential targets for CLAD prevention, T cells from explanted CLAD lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes, as well as diseased and nondiseased controls were isolated and single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing were performed. TCR sequencing revealed a clonally expanded population of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) with high cytotoxic potential, including upregulation of KLRK1, encoding the co-receptor NKG2D. These cytotoxic CD8+ TRMs accumulated around the CLAD airways and had a 100-fold increase in clonal overlap with lung-draining lymph nodes when compared with non-CLAD lungs. Using a murine model of orthotopic lung transplantation, we confirmed that cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation was due to chronic rejection and not transplantation alone. Furthermore, blocking NKG2D in vivo attenuated the airway remodeling following transplantation and diminished airway accumulation of CD8+ T cells. Our findings support NKG2D as a potential therapeutic target for CLAD, affecting cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation.">

        <tr id="The constrained cross-talk between myeloid cells and T cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) restricts cancer immunotherapy efficacy, whereas the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase renowned for mitochondrial quality control, has emerged as a regulator of immune response. Here, we show that both systemic and macrophage-specific ablations of Parkin in mice lead to attenuated tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5–dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment and Park2−/− signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor. Our findings uncover Parkin’s involvement in suppressing macrophage antigen presentation for coordinating the cross-talk between macrophages and T cells.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion by cancer cells involves reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) via communication with non-malignant cells. However, resistance-promoting interactions during treatment remain lesser known. Here we examine the composition, communication, and phenotypes of tumor-associated cells in serial biopsies from stage II and III high-risk estrogen receptor positive (ER+ ) breast cancers of patients receiving endocrine therapy (letrozole) as single agent or in combination with ribociclib, a CDK4/6-targeting cell cycle inhibitor. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses on longitudinally collected samples show that in tumors overcoming the growth suppressive effects of ribociclib, first cancer cells upregulate cytokines and growth factors that stimulate immune-suppressive myeloid differentiation, resulting in reduced myeloid cell- CD8 + T-cell crosstalk via IL-15/18 signaling. Subsequently, tumors growing during treatment show diminished T-cell activation and recruitment. In vitro, ribociclib does not only inhibit cancer cell growth but also T cell proliferation and activation upon co-culturing. Exogenous IL-15 improves CDK4/6 inhibitor efficacy by augmenting T-cell proliferation and cancer cell killing by T cells. In summary, response to ribociclib in stage II and III high-risk ER +  breast cancer depends on the composition, activation phenotypes and communication network of immune cells.">

        <tr id="Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown unprecedented success in a subset of immunogenic tumors, however a host of patients with advanced solid tumors fail to respond well or at all to immunotherapy. Refractory tumors commonly display a tumor microenvironment (TME) rich in immunosuppressive macrophages (M2-like) that suppress adaptive immunity and promote tumor progression. The ability to reprogram macrophages in the TME into an immune-active state holds great promise for enhancing responses to ICIs. Lucicebtide (previously referred to as ST101) is a peptide antagonist of the transcription factor C/EBPβ, a key activator of the transcriptional program in immunosuppressive macrophages. Here we show that lucicebtide exposure reprograms human immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype, restores cytotoxic T cell activation in immunosuppressed co-culture assays in vitro, and further increases T-cell activity in M1-like/T cell co-cultures. In immunocompetent, macrophage-rich triple-negative breast and colorectal cancer models, lucicebtide induces repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype and suppresses tumor growth. Lucicebtide synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy and overcomes resistance to checkpoint inhibition in anti-PD-1-refractory tumors, but in vivo responses are impaired by systemic macrophage depletion, indicating that macrophage reprogramming is integral to lucicebtide activity. These results identify lucicebtide as a novel immunomodulator that reprograms immunosuppressive macrophage populations to enhance anti-tumor activity and suggests its utility for combination strategies in cancers with poor response to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality but heterogeneity in patient responsiveness remains. Thus, greater understanding of the immunologic factors that dictate response to immunotherapy is critical to improve patient outcomes. Here, we show that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is elevated in the setting of melanoma in humans and mice and plays a functional role in inhibiting the CD8+ T cell response. Surprisingly, the tumor itself is not the major cellular source of Fgl2. Instead, we found that macrophage-secreted Fgl2 dampens the CD8+ T cell response through binding and apoptosis of FcγRIIB+CD8+ T cells. This regulation was CD8+ T cell autonomous and not via an antigen-presenting cell intermediary, as absence of Fcgr2b from the CD8+ T cells rendered T cells insensitive to Fgl2 regulation. Fgl2 is robustly expressed by macrophages in 10 cancer types in humans and in 6 syngeneic tumor models in mice, underscoring the clinical relevance of Fgl2 as a therapeutic target to promote T cell activity and improve patient immunotherapeutic response.">

For this reason, the variety of preclinical and clinical studies to modulate the activity of these cells have been conducted, however without successful outcome to date. In this review, pro-tumor activity of myeloid cells, myeloid cell-specific therapeutic targets, in vivo studies on myeloid cell re-polarization and the impact of myeloid cells on immunotherapies/genetic engineering are addressed.

Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1–/– mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1–/– animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng–/– mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1–/– animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction Alterations of the adaptive immune system have been shown to impact bone healing and may result in impaired healing in some patients. Apart from T cells, B cells are the key drivers of adaptive immunity. Therefore, their role in age-associated impairments of bone healing might be essential to understand delays during the healing process. B cells are essential for bone formation, and their dysfunction has been associated with aging or autoimmune diseases. But whether age-associated changes in B cell phenotypes are involved in bone regeneration is unknown. Methods Here, we aimed to characterize the role of immune aging in B cell phenotypes during the early inflammatory phase of bone healing. By comparing non-immune experienced with young and immune experienced mice we aimed to analyze the effect of gained immune experience on B cells. Our single cell proteo-genomics analysis quantified thousands of transcriptomes of cells that were isolated from post osteotomy hematoma and the proximal and distal bone marrow cavities, and enabled us to evaluate cell proportion, differential gene expression and cell trajectories. Results While the B cell proportion in young and non-immune experienced animals did not significantly change from 2 to 5 days post osteotomy in the hematoma, we found a significant decrease of the B cell proportion in the immune experienced mice, which was accompanied by the decreased expression of B cell specific genes, suggesting a specific response in immune experienced animals. Furthermore, we detected the most extensive B cell differentiation block in immune-experienced mice compared to non-immune experienced and young animals, predominantly in the transition from immature to mature B cells. Discussion Our results suggest that the pronounced impairment of B cell production found in immune experienced animals plays an important role in the initial phase leading to delayed bone healing. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches may be able target the B cell differentiation defect to retain B cell functionality even in the immune experienced setting, which is prone to delayed healing.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Curative responses to immunotherapy require the generation of robust systemic immunity with limited toxicity. Recruitment of T cell populations such as precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex) from lymphoid tissues to tumors is a hallmark of effective treatment. However, the ability to efficiently induce this recruitment is lacking in current immunotherapy approaches. Furthermore, systemic administration of immunotherapies frequently results in dose-limiting toxicities, yielding an inadequate therapeutic window for eliciting durable responses. Methods In this investigation, we evaluated the safety and antitumor efficacy of locally administered interleukin 12 (IL-12) using a clinically translatable cytokine delivery platform (NCT05538624) to identify Tpex recruitment capabilities at tolerable cytokine doses. Results We show IL-12 cytokine factories can effectively treat a broad spectrum of cancer types. Single-cell RNA sequencing data suggests that the antitumor efficacy seen in our studies was due to retinal pigmented epithelial cells-mIL12 treatment inducing differentiation of Tpex cells within the tumor microenvironment. When administered in combination with checkpoint therapy, IL-12 cytokine factory treatment generated systemic abscopal immunity, preventing subcutaneous tumor outgrowth in 8/9 mice with colorectal cancer and lung metastasis in mice with melanoma. Furthermore, this platform was well tolerated in a non-human primate without signs of toxicity. Conclusions Our new immunotherapy approach provides a robust strategy for inducing Tpex recruitment and systemic immunity against a range of solid peritoneal malignancies, many incurable with current immunotherapy strategies. Notably, these features were achieved using IL-12, and by leveraging our technology, we avoided the toxicities that have prevented the translation of IL-12 to the clinic. Our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of IL-12 cytokine factories.">

        <tr id="Abstract The activation and infiltration of immune cells are hallmarks of ischemic stroke. However, the precise origins and the molecular alterations of these infiltrating cells post‐stroke remain poorly characterized. Here, a murine model of stroke (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion [p‐MCAO]) is utilized to profile single‐cell transcriptomes of immune cells in the brain and their potential origins, including the calvarial bone marrow (CBM), femur bone marrow (FBM), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This analysis reveals transcriptomically distinct populations of cerebral myeloid cells and brain‐resident immune cells after stroke. These include a novel CD14+ neutrophil subpopulation that transcriptomically resembles CBM neutrophils. Moreover, the sequential activation of transcription factor regulatory networks in neutrophils during stroke progression is delineated, many of which are unique to the CD14+ population and underlie their acquisition of chemotaxis and granule release capacities. Two distinct origins of post‐stroke disease‐related immune cell subtypes are also identified: disease inflammatory macrophages, likely deriving from circulating monocytes in the skull, and transcriptionally immature disease‐associated microglia, possibly arising from pre‐existing homeostatic microglia. Together, a comprehensive molecular survey of post‐stroke immune responses is performed, encompassing both local and distant bone marrow sites and peripheral blood.">

        <tr id="Significance Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate T cell immunity. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt)-expressing APCs are heterogenous regulators of T cell tolerance but their subtypes and lineage relationships are ill-defined. We report that RORγt+ dendritic cells (DCs) are evolutionarily conserved, exhibit wide tissue distribution and reconcile various RORγt+ APC populations known to promote peripheral T cell tolerance. We show that RORγt+ DCs can sense pathogens, migrate to lymph nodes, activate naïve CD4+ T cells, and accumulate in demyelinating neuroinflammation with a proinflammatory phenotype. Thus, RORγt+ DCs have a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment. This highlights their therapeutic potential and their affiliation with DCs.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are successful in treating many cancers but may cause immune-related adverse events. ICI-mediated myocarditis has a high fatality rate with severe cardiovascular consequences. Targeted therapies for ICI myocarditis are currently limited. METHODS: We used a genetic mouse model of PD1 deletion (X1MRL/Pdcd1−/−) along with a novel drug-treated ICI myocarditis mouse model to recapitulate the disease phenotype. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing, single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing, and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes on immune cells isolated from MRL and MRL/Pdcd1−/− mice at serial time points. We assessed the impact of macrophage deletion in MRL/Pdcd1−/− mice, then inhibited CXCR3 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3) in ICI-treated mice to assess the therapeutic effect on myocarditis phenotype. Furthermore, we delineated the functional and mechanistic effects of CXCR3 blockade on T-cell and macrophage interactions. We then correlated the results in human single-cell multiomics data from blood and heart biopsy data from patients with ICI myocarditis. RESULTS: Single-cell multiomics demonstrated expansion of CXCL (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand) 9/10+CCR2+ macrophages and CXCR3hi (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 3 high-expressing) CD8+ (cluster of differentiation) effector T lymphocytes in the hearts of MRL/Pdcd1−/− mice correlating with onset of myocarditis development. Both depletion of CXCL9/10+CCR2+ (C-C motif chemokine receptor) macrophages and CXCR3 blockade, respectively, led to decreased CXCR3hi CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the heart and significantly improved survival. Transwell migration assays demonstrated that the selective blockade of CXCR3 and its ligand, CXCL10, reduced CXCR3+CD8+ T-cell migration toward macrophages, implicating this interaction in T-cell cardiotropism toward cardiac macrophages. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte apoptosis was induced by CXCR3hi CD8+ T cells. Cardiac biopsies from patients with confirmed ICI myocarditis demonstrated infiltrating CXCR3+ T cells and CXCL9+/CXCL10+ macrophages. Both mouse cardiac immune cells and patient peripheral blood immune cells revealed expanded TCRs (T-cell receptors) correlating with CXCR3hi CD8+ T cells in ICI myocarditis samples. CONCLUSIONS: These findings bring forth the CXCR3-CXCL9/10 axis as an attractive therapeutic target for ICI myocarditis treatment, and more broadly as a druggable pathway in cardiac inflammation.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxicity is a cornerstone of immune defense, critical for combating tumors and infections. This process relies on the coordinated action of granzymes and pore-forming proteins, with Granzyme B (GZMB) and Perforin (PRF1) being key markers and the most widely studied molecules pertaining to cytotoxicity. However, other human granzymes and cytotoxic components remain underexplored, despite growing evidence of their distinct, context-dependent roles. Natural Killer Cell Granule Protein 7 (NKG7) has recently emerged as a crucial cytotoxicity regulator, yet its expression patterns and function are poorly understood. Using large publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing atlases, we performed a comprehensive profiling of cytotoxicity across immune subsets and tissues. Our analysis highlights NKG7 expression as a strong marker of cytotoxicity, exhibiting a strong correlation with overall cytotoxic activity (r = 0.97) and surpassing traditional markers such as Granzyme B and Perforin in reliability. Furthermore, NKG7 expression is notably consistent across diverse immune subsets and tissues, reinforcing its versatility and robustness as a cytotoxicity marker. These findings position NKG7 as an invaluable tool for evaluating immune responses and a reliable indicator of cytotoxic functionality across biological and clinical contexts.">

        <tr id="Background Tumor immune evasion extends beyond T cells, affecting innate immune elements like natural killer cells (NK) and macrophages within the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME). Nevertheless, translational strategies to trigger collaboration of NK cells and macrophages to initiate sufficient anti-tumor cytoxicity remain scarce and are urgently needed. Methods In this study, TCGA datasets was used to confirm the prognosis value of the expression level of NLR family pyrin domain containing 4 (NLRP4) in NSCLC and the tumor tissues microarray was used to further check its clinical-relevance at protein-level. Subsequently, a tumor cell line with stable NLRP4 overexpression was established and subcutaneous tumor models in C57BL/6J mice were used to validate the anti-tumor characteristics of NLRP4. After analyzing the tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence, we further validated our findings through co-culture transwell assays and TCGA analysis. Utilizing bulk-RNA sequencing, proteomics, and mass spectrometry of mouse tumor tissues, we innovatively identified the downstream pathways of NLRP4 and verified them through co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and Western blot (WB) experiments. Results NLRP4 could trigger a distinct anti-tumor ecosystem organized by TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1 in lung cancer, discovered in TCGA analysis and verified in murine model. NLRP4-eco exerted tumor-suppression capacity through chemokine reprogramming including CCL5 and CXCL2. Meanwhile, the cytoxicity of NK could be facilitated by iNOS+M1. Mechanistically, NLRP4 stimulated PI3K/Akt-NF-kB axis through suppression of the activity of PP2A. Besides, knockdown of CCL5 and blockade of CXCL2-CXCR2 axis abolished chemotaxis of TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1 respectively, as well as for LB-100, a PP2A inhibitor. Conclusion Altogether, we delineated NLRP4’s unexplored facets and discovered an NLRP4-driven anti-tumor ecosystem composed of TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1. Finally, targeting PP2A by its inhibitor successfully mimicked the anti-tumor capacity of the overexpression of NLRP4.

        <tr id="Immune cell engagers (ICEs) are an emerging class of immunotherapies designed to harness the immune system’s anti-tumor potential through precise targeting and activation of immune effector cells. By engaging T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and phagocytes, ICEs overcome challenges such as immune evasion and MHC downregulation, addressing critical barriers in cancer treatment. T-cell engagers (TCEs), led by bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), dominate the field, with innovations such as half-life-extended BiTEs, trispecific antibodies, and checkpoint inhibitory T-cell engagers driving their application in hematologic and solid malignancies. NK cell engagers (NKCEs) and phagocyte cell engagers (PCEs) are rapidly progressing, drawing on NK cells’ innate cytotoxicity and macrophages’ phagocytic abilities to target tumors, particularly in immunosuppressive microenvironments. Since the FDA approval of Blinatumomab in 2014, ICEs have transformed the oncology landscape, with nine FDA-approved products and numerous candidates in clinical trials. Despite challenges such as toxicity, resistance, and limited efficacy in solid tumors, ongoing research into advanced platforms and combination therapies highlights the growing potential of ICEs to provide personalized, scalable, and effective cancer treatments. This review investigates the mechanisms, platforms, research trends, and clinical progress of ICEs, emphasizing their pivotal role in advancing precision immunotherapy and their promise as a cornerstone of next-generation cancer therapies.">

        <tr id="Although immune therapy has seen significant advances, the majority of breast and other solid tumors do not respond or quickly develop de novo resistance. One factor driving resistance is highly immune suppressive myeloid cells (MCs) such as macrophages. Previous work has established clinical links between cholesterol and cancer outcome, and that MC function can be regulated through disruption in cholesterol metabolism. Thus, we screened for proteins that were expressed in MCs, involved in cholesterol homeostasis and whose expression was associated with survival; we identify the cholesterol efflux protein ABCA1. Preclinical studies revealed that ABCA1 activity resulted in increased anti-cancer functions of macrophages: enhanced tumor infiltration, decreased angiogenic potential, reduced efferocytosis, and improved support of CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, different AKT isoforms are involved, through both PI3K dependent and independent mechanisms. Assessment of human blood and breast tumors revealed correlations between ABCA1 in macrophages and angiogenic potential, VEGFA, and CD8 T cell abundance and activity, highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings. The culmination of the effects of ABCA1 on MC function were demonstrated through increased tumor growth and metastasis in mice with MC specific knockout of ABCA1. Therefore, modulating ABCA1 activity within MCs may represent a novel approach to immune therapy.">

        <tr id="Pharmacologic activation of the innate immune response is being actively being pursued for numerous clinical purposes including enhancement of vaccine potency and potentiation of anti-cancer immunotherapy. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) represent especially useful targets for these efforts as their engagement by agonists can trigger signaling pathways that associate with phenotypes desirable for specific immune outcomes. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an ER-resident PRR reactive to cyclic dinucleotides such as those synthesized endogenously in response to cytosolic dsDNA. STING activation leads to transient generation of type I interferon (IFN-I) and proinflammatory responses that augment immunologically relevant effects including antiviral responses, antigen presentation, immune cell trafficking, and immunogenic cell death. In recent years engineered cyclic dinucleotides and small molecules have been discovered that induce STING and safely confer clinically useful outcomes in animal models such as adjuvanticity of anti-microbial vaccines and tumor clearance. Unfortunately, clinical trials examining the efficacy of STING agonists have thus far failed to satisfactorily recapitulate these positive outcomes and this has prevented their translational advancement. A likely relevant yet perplexingly under investigated aspect of pharmacologic STING activation is the diversity of molecular and immune responses that associate with chemical properties of the agonist. Based on this, a comparative survey of these was undertaken using unrelated STING-activating molecules to characterize the molecular, innate, cellular, and immune outcomes they elicit. This was done to inform and direct future studies aimed at designing and selecting agonists appropriate for desired clinical goals. This revealed demonstrable differences between the agonists in potency, transcriptomes, cytokine secretion profiles, immune cell trafficking, and antigen-directed humoral and cell mediated immune responses. As such, this work illustrates that phenotypes deriving from activation of a protein target can be linked to chemical properties of the engaging agonist and thus heightened scrutiny is necessary when selecting molecules to generate specific in vivo effects.">

For this reason, recent therapeutic algorithms include immunotherapeutic agents that target such cell populations for the treatment of patients with a variety of solid tumors. In contrast to solid tumors, such immunotherapeutic strategies failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this reason, the study of immunophenotypic and molecular changes in cytotoxic effector cell populations in patients with such disorders would provide the necessary evidence for the development of novel immunotherapies. In this review, we provide an overview of experimental studies describing the modulation of CD8+ T cell populations in patients with myeloid neoplasms, focusing on whether and how specific cell phenotypes are linked to disease progression and treatment.">

        <tr id="Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective treatment for aggressive hematologic malignancies. However, the risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a significant barrier to allo-HSCT. GVHD is a debilitating condition with high mortality rates and current therapeutic options for GVHD are limited, with corticosteroids being the standard treatment. However, the adverse effects of steroids make prolonged use difficult, necessitating the development of safer therapies. IL-35-producing B-cells (i35-Bregs) have emerged as critical regulators of immunity during autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated whether i35-Bregs immunotherapy can suppress and mitigate GVHD. Methods: We administered a single dose of i35-Bregs (1.5×106) to mice undergoing allo-HSCT and monitored disease severity and survival of GVHD mice over 90 days post-transplantation. We discovered that i35-Bregs secrete exosomes containing membrane-bound IL-35 (i35-Exosomes) and investigated whether ex-vivo generated i35-exosomes can be used as stand-alone immunotherapy for GVHD. i35-Breg-induced expression of cytokines or checkpoint proteins (PD-1, LAG-3, CTLA-4) was analyzed by Flow cytometry, ELISA, and RNA-seq analysis. Characterization of membrane-bound IL-35 was by Proximity ligation assay (PLA), immunohistochemistry/Confocal microscopy and Alpha Fold-Multimer modeling. Results: A single dose of 1.5×106 i35-Breg reduced severity of GVHD and prolonged GVHD survival, with more than 70% i35-Breg-treated mice surviving beyond day-90 post-transplantation while observing 100% mortality among untreated mice by day-45. Contrary to the view that IL-35 is secreted cytokine, we show here that i35-Bregs mitigate GVHD via membrane-bound IL-35 and by secreting i35-exosomes. Furthermore, i35-Bregs or ex-vivo generated i35-exosomes induce alloreactive T-cells to upregulate checkpoint proteins associated with T-cell exhaustion and anergy, inhibiting alloreactive responses and propagating infectious-tolerance mechanisms that suppress GVHD. Importantly, i35-Bregs or i35-exosomes suppresses GVHD by increasing bystander lymphocytes coated with immunosuppressive i35-exosomes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that i35-Bregs and i35-exosomes play a critical role in mitigating GVHD. The combination of i35-Breg and i35-exosome immunotherapy may be an effective strategy for treating GVHD and other inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Bona fide Kupffer cells (KCs) are prenatally seeded and show unique functional and immunophenotypic features among tissue macrophages. They are considered as terminally differentiated, and adaptability in disease is attributed to recruited, monocyte-derived KCs. Here, we investigated the extent of KC plasticity and the impact of origin in mycobacterial infections that target macrophages and can persist for months. Fate-mapping combined with high-resolution imaging revealed the emergence of a unique, infection specific KC subset which downregulated the signature markers CLEC4F and VSIG4 (“KClow”). KClow were derived from bona fide KCs and located exclusively to granuloma cores. In contrast, monocyte-derived macrophages were contained at the granuloma borders and contributed to this tissue reaction. ATAC and single-cell RNA sequencing identified a specific signature of KClow with high antimycobacterial activity and specialization to a hypoxic microenvironment. Despite their fundamental deviation from the classical KC phenotype, KClow showed remarkable adaptability, and were capable to return to a homeostatic-like KC state. Accordingly, mycobacterial infections unmask KCs as highly plastic cells, capable of responding to extreme environmental changes.">

        <tr id="In many solid tumours, including gastric cancer (GC), the beginning and progression of the tumour are closely correlated with the tumour microbiome. Here, we show the changes in the gastric microbiota and their influence on immune regulation and the promotion of GC progression through 16s rRNA sequencing and single cell RNA sequencing. Streptococcus lutetiensis (S. lutetiensis) was found to be enriched in the tumour tissues of GC patients. Further analysis using single-cell sequencing and flow cytometry showed that S. lutetiensis notably affects the antitumour immunity by suppressing IL17 signalling and reducing the population of CD8+IL17A+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells by activating Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response. Mouse models confirm S. lutetiensis promotes GC progression by impairing immune responses in CD8+IL17A+TRM cells, suggesting it as a potential GC prognosis indicator and immunotherapy target, highlighting the microbiome's role in cancer progression.">

        <tr id="Heatstroke is associated with immune system disturbances, which was similar to sepsis and aseptic inflammation. This study characterized the immune landscape of heatstroke and compared it to sepsis or aseptic inflammation in order to identify heatstroke-specific characteristics. We prospectively recruited 40 patients with heatstroke as well as the same number of age- and sex-matched healthy controls, patients with sepsis, or cardiopulmonary bypass-induced aseptic inflammation. Blood from the four groups was collected to perform spectral flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing and protein chip assay to compare the profiles of T cells, B cells, monocytes, and natural killer cells. In patients with heatstroke, the relative abundance of TLR4+ monocyte was significantly higher than in the other three groups, and activation of antigen presentation and inhibition of chemotaxis were observed in monocytes high expressing TLR4. Both heatstroke and sepsis were characterized by lymphopenia and T cell exhaustion, with T cell exhaustion in particular potentially associated with death and organ injury in heatstroke. The decreased cytotoxic activity of NK cells was also observed in heatstroke. In conclusion, our study described the immunological characteristics of heatstroke, which provided the theoretical basis for exploring the immunotherapy of heatstroke.">

        <tr id="The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has revolutionized cancer treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes. However, resistance remains a critical challenge. This study aimed to comparatively elucidate immunophenotypic changes in syngeneic mouse models sensitive (MC-38) or resistant (LLC1) to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. In the sensitive MC-38 model, anti-PD-1 therapy increased dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, while decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment. Enhanced expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I/II) and costimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86) was observed on tumor-associated DCs and macrophages. Tumor-infiltrating CD4+T, CD8+T, regulatory T, NK, and NKT cells also significantly increased. Importantly, treatment boosted lymphocyte cytotoxic potential, with perforin identified as a key marker of efficacy. Notably, perforin expression in CD4+T and NKT cells strongly negatively correlated with tumor volume. In contrast, the resistant LLC1 model exhibited minimal immunophenotypic changes upon treatment. These findings highlight critical immune modifications induced by anti-PD-1 therapy, particularly the role of perforin, and the DC/MDSC ratio in predicting therapeutic outcomes. This research offers valuable insights into potential predictive biomarkers and informs strategies to overcome resistance, emphasizing the complex interplay between anti-PD-1 treatment and the tumor microenvironment, ultimately aiming to improve immunotherapy response rates.">

        <tr id="T cells play diverse roles in cancer immunology, acting as tumor suppressors, cytotoxic effectors, enhancers of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and immune suppressors; providing memory and surveillance; modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME); or activating innate immune cells. However, cancer cells can disrupt T cell function, leading to T cell exhaustion and a weakened immune response against the tumor. The expression of exhausted T cell (Tex) markers plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune landscape of multiple cancers. Our aim was to systematically investigate the role of known T cell exhaustion (Tex) markers across multiple cancers while exploring their molecular interactions, mutation profiles, and potential implications for immunotherapy. The mRNA expression profile of six Tex markers, LAG-3, PDCD1, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CXCL13, and LAYN was investigated in pan-cancer. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), and other repositories, we characterized the differential expression of the Tex markers, their association with the patients’ survival outcome, and their mutation profile in multiple cancers. Additionally, we analyzed the effects on cancer-related pathways and immune infiltration within the TME, offering valuable insights into mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and progression. Finally, the correlation between their expression and sensitivity to multiple anti-cancer drugs was investigated extensively. Differential expression of all six markers was significantly associated with KIRC and poor prognosis in several cancers. They also played a potential activating role in apoptosis, EMT, and hormone ER pathways, as well as a potential inhibitory role in the DNA damage response and RTK oncogenic pathways. Infiltration of different immune cells was also found to be associated with the expression of the Tex-related genes in most cancer types. These findings underline that the reviving of exhausted T cells can be used to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.">

Its impact on the distribution and molecular phenotypes of the bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) needs attention and, more importantly, in co-morbid conditions like diabetes and tuberculosis (DM-TB). In this study, total bone marrow cells were harvested at 3 w.p.i., from the low aerosol dose (100-120 CFU) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv infected control and NA-STZ induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice. The bone marrow cells were differentiated into BMDMs, and CD11c, CD11b and F4/80 marker expressions were monitored using flow cytometry. BMDMs stimulated with Mtb H37Rv lysate were subjected to global transcriptome profiling to identify the perturbed metabolic and molecular landscape. The BMDMs of the DM-TB comorbid mice showed low CD11c, CD11b and higher F4/80 expression. The macrophages of the DM group showed a skewed pro-inflammatory response, characterized by perturbed complement response, NF-kB pathway and fatty acid metabolism, whereas macrophages of the DM-TB group showed deregulated ceramide and amino acid metabolism. Macrophages from the DM and DM-TB group stimulated with Mtb H37Rv lysate, showed a deregulated transcript signature that impacts humoral response. The dampened immune response observed in the DM-TB group macrophages highlights the importance of identifying novel targets for developing tailored drugs for comorbid conditions.">

        <tr id="Invariant Natural Killer T (NKT) cells represent a unique subset of innate-like T cells that express both NK cell and T cell receptors. These cells are rapidly activated by glycolipid antigens presented via CD1d molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages, or through cytokine-dependent mechanisms. Their ability to produce a wide range of cytokines and express costimulatory molecules underscores their critical role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. B cells, traditionally recognized for their role in antibody production, also act as potent APCs due to their high expression of CD1d, enabling direct interactions with iNKT cells. This interaction has significant implications for humoral immunity, influencing B cell activation, class-switch recombination (CSR), germinal center formation, and memory B cell differentiation, thus expanding the conventional paradigm of T cell–B cell interactions. While the influence of iNKT cells on B cell biology and humoral responses is well-supported, many aspects of their interaction remain unresolved. Key questions include the roles of different iNKT cell subsets, the diversity of APCs, the spatiotemporal dynamics of these interactions, especially during early activation, and the potential for distinct glycolipid ligands to modulate immune outcomes. Understanding these factors could provide valuable insights into how iNKT cells regulate B cell-mediated immunity and offer opportunities to harness these interactions in immunotherapeutic applications, such as vaccine development. In this review, we examine these unresolved aspects and propose a novel perspective on the regulatory potential of iNKT cells in humoral immunity, emphasizing their promise as a target for innovative vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="B cells are essential components of the immune response, primarily recognized for their ability to produce antibodies. However, emerging research reveals their important roles in regulating immune responses and influencing tumor development, independent of antibodies. The connection between tumor progression and alterations in the tumor microenvironment is well-established, as immune infiltrating cells can enhance the survival of tumor cells by modifying their surroundings. Despite this, the majority of studies have focused on T cells and macrophages, creating a gap in our understanding of B cells. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) represent a crucial subpopulation that plays a significant role in maintaining immune balance. They may have a substantial impact on tumor immunity by negatively regulating tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This paper reviews the existing literature on Bregs, examining their development, phenotypes, functions, and the mechanisms through which they exert their regulatory effects. Furthermore, we highlight their potential interventional roles and prognostic significance in cancer therapy. By addressing the current gaps in knowledge regarding Bregs within tumors, we hope to inspire further research that could lead to innovative cancer treatments and improved outcomes for patients.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in engineered adaptive immune cell therapies, current options for innate immune cell therapies are sparse. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a neutrophil progenitor-based cell therapy. Murine conditionally-immortalized neutrophil progenitors (NPs) overcome the hurdles of alternative cell therapies by engrafting in the unconditioned host and substantially contributing to the host neutrophil population. Here we demonstrate the therapeutic value of NPs using a murine model of the primary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Those with CGD are highly susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus because of genetic mutations that impair neutrophil antimicrobial function. We find that the prophylactic treatment of CGD mice with transfused NPs rescue them from an otherwise lethal S. aureus pulmonary infection. In investigating the mechanisms behind the improved clearance of S. aureus and survival of CGD mice, our data suggests that the antimicrobial function of host CGD neutrophils is rescued by the presence of donor-derived wild-type neutrophils. We also observe that survival is improved to >50% in the CGD model when mice receive NPs post-infection. This work highlights the application of NPs to improving outcomes to acute bacterial infection in CGD, demonstrating the translational potential of conditionally-immortalized myeloid progenitors as a cellular therapy.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a serious threat to global health, with rising incidence and mortality rates. Therapeutic options for advanced HCC are quite limited, and the overall prognosis remains poor. Recent advancements in immunotherapy, particularly immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting anti-PD1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4, have facilitated a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, demonstrating substantial survival benefits across various cancer types, including HCC. However, only a subset of HCC patients exhibit a favorable response to ICB therapy, and its efficacy is often hindered by the development of resistance. There are many studies to explore the underlying mechanisms of ICB response. In this review, we compiled the latest progression in immunotherapies for HCC and systematically summarized the sophisticated mechanisms by which components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) regulate resistance to ICB therapy. Additionally, we also outlined some scientific rationale strategies to boost antitumor immunity and enhance the efficacy of ICB in HCC. These insights may serve as a roadmap for future research and help improve outcomes for HCC patients.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are effective in clinical settings; however, they present immune-related adverse effects and financial burden. Although dose reduction of ICIs may mitigate these limitations, it could compromise therapeutic efficacy. Using two adjuvants (poly(I:C) and LAG-3-Ig) combined with three neoantigen peptides (Comb), we examined whether Comb could enhance the efficacy of reduced dose of αPD-1 monoclonal antibody (RD-αPD-1 mAb), which has limited efficacy. In a murine colorectal cancer model using an MC38 cell line, Comb addition to RD-αPD-1 mAb enhanced treatment efficacy. Analysis of the tumour microenvironment (TME) in mice treated with Comb using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed decreased macrophages with highly expressing immunosuppressive genes and increased plasmacytoid dendritic cells with highly expressing antigen-presenting genes. A potent infiltration of CD8+ tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) with an effector profile was only observed in RD-αPD-1 mAb with Comb. Additionally, single-cell T cell receptor repertoire analysis underscored an oligoclonal expansion of CD8+ TILs following treatment with RD-αPD-1 mAb with Comb. This novel immune drug combination may be a promising strategy for reducing αPD-1 mAb dosage while preserving antitumour efficacy through modulating the TME.">

        <tr id="In the last two decades, novel and promising cell-based therapies have populated the treatment landscape for haematological tumors. However, commonly exploited T and NK cell-based therapies show limited applicability to solid tumors. This is mainly given by the impaired tumor trafficking capability and limited effector activity of these cells within a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Myeloid cells spontaneously home to tumors and can thus be reprogrammed and/or engineered to directly attack tumor cells or locally and selectively deliver therapeutically relevant payloads that may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy against difficult-to-access solid tumors. In the context of myeloid cell-based therapies, adoptive transfer of monocytes has often been overshadowed by infusion of differentiated macrophages or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite their promising therapeutic potential. Here, we summarize the recent improvements and benefits of using monocytes for the treatment of solid tumors, their current clinical applications and the challenges of their use as well as some possible strategies to overcome them.">

        <tr id="Standard treatment options for B cell malignancies include immunochemotherapies and/or targeted therapies, which often provide temporary disease remission. However, many patients do not achieve complete remission with these treatments, develop resistance, and eventually experience disease relapse. New immunomodulatory treatments, such as T cell-based therapies, show promise in treating various types of blood cancers, including B cell malignancies. However, their effectiveness is often limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and altered function of patient-derived T cells. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to restore immune balance and function in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ibrutinib is being studied as adjuvant or combinatorial therapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells or T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies for the treatment of B cell malignancies. Current evidence suggests that ibrutinib could be beneficial when used before, during, or after CAR T cell administration, potentially providing higher complete response rates and reduced toxicity. In conclusion, existing evidence strongly supports the combined use of ibrutinib and T cell therapies. However, additional clinical trials are needed to further validate the effectiveness of this treatment strategy in patients with various B cell malignancies.">

        <tr id="Toll-like receptors (TLR) are phylogenetically conserved mediators of innate immunity that are essential for establishing adaptive immune responses against invading pathogens. TLR7 is an endosomal receptor expressed predominantly in myeloid and B cells. Activation of TLR7 induces Type I interferon and proinflammatory responses; therefore, targeting TLR7 is a promising strategy for antitumor therapy. Although the use of bacterial components to trigger innate immune responses in cancer patients started a century ago, the effectiveness of systemic TLR agonists has been rather underwhelming in clinical trials, partly due to nonspecific immune activation leading to safety and tolerability issues. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) constitute a proven therapeutic modality amenable to systemic administration with limited toxicity concerns via a targeted delivery platform. We generated TLR7 agonist–antibody conjugates that recognize tumor antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Generated ADCs demonstrated robust activity in in vitro tumor antigen-presenting cell (APC) coculture systems as indicated by dose-dependent upregulation of PD-L1 and CD86 on macrophages. TLR7 agonist-ADC provided superior tumor growth control compared to intravenously (IV) administrated free TLR7 agonist. Treatment with TLR7 agonist-ADC led to prolonged activation of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with minimum immune activation in the periphery. Systemic and tissue exposure studies demonstrated tumor-specific free drug release by targeted ADC treatment. In summary, the TLR7 agonist-ADC can potentially activate immune cells in the TME to generate tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses, making it an attractive approach for precision cancer therapy.">

        <tr id="Despite an initial response to platinum-based chemotherapy, most patients with extensive stage of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) have a poor prognosis due to recurrence. Additionally, the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors is more modest than non-small cell lung cancer. Natural killer (NK) cells can directly eliminate cancer cells without prior sensitization; this is largely governed by inflammatory cytokines, which serve as killing signals to cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether the combination of NK cells plus atezolizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the protein programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), has a synergistic effect against SCLC. NK cells were expanded and activated using irradiated K562 feeder cells in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2/IL-15/IL-21/41BB ligand for 14 days. Expanded and activated NK cells (eNK) were combined with atezolizumab and used to treat SCLC cells in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The results revealed increased PD-L1 expression in SCLC cells after the eNK challenge. eNK cells plus atezolizumab demonstrated increased cytotoxicity toward target SCLC cells, as evidenced by increased interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α production, and higher levels of SCLC stem cell (CD44+CD90+) suppression. Combined treatment with eNK and atezolizumab more effectively inhibited SCLC tumor growth and significantly prolonged the survival of treated mice. Our findings revealed that combining eNK with atezolizumab strongly increased cytotoxicity, significantly inhibited SCLC tumor growth, and prolonged the survival of treated mice. These results provide a framework for developing a more advanced immunotherapeutic modality for future clinical trials for patients with SCLC.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT People living with HIV (PLWH) exhibit accelerated aging, characterized by systemic inflammation, termed “inflammaging.” While T-cell expansion is prevalent in PLWH, its connection to inflammaging remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the TCRβ repertoire of 257 healthy controls (HC) and 228 PLWH, revealing pronounced T cell clonal expansion in PLWH. The expansion was only partially reversed following antiretroviral therapy (ART) and closely associated with ART duration, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio. TCR-based age modeling showed a continuous accelerated trajectory of aging in PLWH, especially in younger individuals, in stark contrast to the nonlinear aging acceleration pattern seen in HC. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA combined TCR sequencing and in vitro experiments, we identified GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the primary population driving clonal expansion and maintenance in PLWH. These cells are characterized by high cytotoxicity and low exhaustion and are activated by interleukin-15 (IL-15) in vitro. Notably, GNLY+CD8+ T cells predominantly express the pro-inflammatory 15 kDa form of granulysin(GNLY). The supernatant from IL-15-stimulated CD8+ T cells induces monocytes to secrete inflammatory factors and disrupts the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells, which can be partially restored by the anti-GNLY antibodies. These findings identify GNLY+CD8+ T cells as the central drivers of persistent clonal expansion, highlighting their crucial role for mitigating inflammaging in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors include targeting additional immunosuppressive compartments in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Inhibitory macrophages (Mφ) can be one of the most abundant immune cells in the TME associated with poor prognosis. However, to date, selective Mφ depletion strategies as a cancer immunotherapy have not been successful in clinical trials. Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure (MARCO) is one of a family of class-A scavenger receptors expressed by Mφ in the TME and is one of the most upregulated transcripts in dendritic cells (DC) following their ex vivo uptake of dead tumor cells. The clinical significance of MARCO expression in the TME is not fully understood. Methods The therapeutic potential of targeting MARCO by an anti-murine MARCO (ED31, clone ED31) monoclonal antibody, which inhibits ligand-binding to MARCO, was explored in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) in C57BL/6J mice bearing B16F10 or Pan02 tumors. The mechanism by which ED31 impacts the TME was investigated by flow cytometry in the different treatment arms. The contribution of Mφ was assessed by both in vivo depletion and in vitro functional assays. Chemokine production was measured by a bead-based multiplex assay. Results ED31 enhanced antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4, but not of anti-PD-1. Analysis of the TME revealed that adding ED31 to anti-CTLA-4 substantially increased immune cell infiltration, including mature conventional DC recruitment, that was due to a switch to M1-pattern chemokines by Mφ. Mφ depletion completely abrogated both the increase in immune cell infiltration and chemokine production, and abolished the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy. Conclusions Targeting MARCO as an additional checkpoint in the TME can offer a strategy to improve the antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 through a mechanism involving Mφ reprogramming rather than their depletion.">

The precise role of T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), an emerging immunosuppressive receptor, in ECCA, and its impact on CD8+ T cell exhaustion (Tex) remains unclear. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) isolated from ECCA. We found that TIGIT was significantly overexpressed in TOX+CD8 T cells. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated that increased TIGIT expression was associated with poorer patient survival. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that TIGIT+CD8+ T cells exhibited decreased TNF-α, IFN-γ, and TCF-1 expression, accompanied by elevated PD-1 and TIM-3 expression compared to TIGIT−CD8+ T cells. In the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, the anti-TIGIT treatment group demonstrated reduced tumor weight, enhanced CD8 frequency, and an increased IFN-γ proportion compared to the PBS treatment group. The TIGIT antibody-treated group exhibited a notably higher fraction of GRZB, and anti-TIGIT treatment led to elevated TCF-1 protein levels and decreased protein levels of TOX1 and NR4A1. Moreover, TIGIT+CD8 T cells from TILs appear to be in a state of exhaustion with low potential killing capacity in ECCA, as shown by scRNA-seq. Taken together, the present study underscores the significant role of TIGIT in ECCA, contributing to T cell exhaustion and a compromised CD8+ T cell immune response. Targeting TIGIT presents a promising therapeutic avenue to enhance the CD8+ T-cell response, thereby potentially improving ECCA therapeutic benefits.">

        <tr id="Background
 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a critical treatment for hematologic disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, and specific immune deficiencies. Despite its efficacy, challenges such as engraftment failure and delayed neutrophil regeneration remain significant barriers. These complications lead to prolonged cytopenia, increased risks of infections and other complications, and elevated morbidity and mortality rates. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to play essential roles in supporting hematopoiesis, the precise mechanisms and interactions between MSCs and other cellular components in HSCT require further investigation. Methods To address these challenges, we explored the combined infusion of allotype-cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and activated T cells from the same donor along with third-party MSCs. The study assessed the effects of this triple-cell therapy on neutrophil differentiation and function ex vivo and in vivo. Using a respiratory infection model, we evaluated the accumulation of human neutrophils, cytokine secretion (IL-6 and IL-8), bacterial clearance, and overall survival compared to control groups. Results The triple-cell therapy demonstrated a significant improvement in the differentiation of human HSCs into neutrophils both in ex vivo and in vivo. In the respiratory infection model, this approach resulted in enhanced accumulation of human neutrophils, increased secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, superior bacterial clearance, and reduced mortality rates compared to the control group. These findings highlight the synergistic interplay between allo-HSCs, MSCs, and activated T cells in promoting neutrophil production and function. Conclusions Our study presents a novel therapeutic strategy combining allo-HSCs, activated T cells, and third-party MSCs to enhance neutrophil production and functionality post-transplantation. This approach not only accelerates neutrophil regeneration but also improves resistance to infections, offering a promising avenue to overcome engraftment challenges in HSCT.">

        <tr id="Introduction Hematogenous disseminated tuberculosis (DTB) has an unclear etiology that likely involves multiple factors. Understanding the underlying immunological characteristics of DTB is crucial for elucidating its pathogenesis. Methods We conducted single-cell RNA transcriptome and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on samples from seven DTB patients. Additionally, we integrated and analyzed data from two published profiles of latent TB infection, three active TB cases, and two healthy controls. Results Our analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of inflammatory immune cells (e.g., monocytes and macrophages) in DTB patients, along with a notably lower abundance of various lymphocytes (including T cells, B cells, and plasma cells), suggesting that lymphopenia is a prominent feature of the disease. T cell pseudotime analysis indicated a decrease in the expression of most hypervariable genes over time, pointing to T cell functional exhaustion. Furthermore, a marked absence of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells was observed in the peripheral blood of DTB patients. In the TCR repertoire, specific polymorphisms (TRAV9-2, TRAV13-1, TRBV20-1, and TRBV5-1) and dominant clones (TRAJ49, TRBJ2-7, and TRBJ2-1) were identified. Analysis of the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) showed that the most frequent combination was TRAV1-2/TRAJ33, with the motif “CAAMD” being significantly reduced in DTB patients. Discussion These findings suggest that lymphopenia and T cell exhaustion, along with unique TCR signatures, may play critical roles in DTB pathogenesis. The reduced “CAAMD” motif and altered TCR clonotypes provide novel insights into the complex cellular dynamics associated with the disease, potentially offering new avenues for targeted immunological interventions.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT CD8+ tissue‐resident memory T cells (TRM) are strategically located in peripheral tissues, enabling a rapid response to local infections, which is different from circulating memory CD8+ T cells. Their unique positioning makes them promising targets for vaccines designed to enhance protection at barrier sites and other organs. Recent studies have shown a correlation between CD8+ TRM cells and favorable clinical outcomes in various types of cancer, indicating their potential role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, the dual nature of CD8+ TRM cells presents challenges, as their inappropriate activation may lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review highlights significant advancements in the field, focusing on the differentiation pathways and phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8+ TRM cells across different tissues and disease states. We also review their protective roles in various contexts and the implications for vaccine development against infections and treatment strategies for tumors. Overall, this comprehensive review outlines the common features of CD8+ TRM cell differentiation and biological functions, emphasizing their specific characteristics across diverse tissues and disease states, which can guide the design of therapies against infections and tumors while minimizing the risk of autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (NATI) significantly prolonged outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Residual tumor cells that survive NATI represent high-risk cell populations with metastatic potential and usually evade immunosurveillance by NK cells. Using an 82-protein panel, we here profiled single-cell membrane proteomics of CD56+ (NCAM1+) NK cells from tumor, peri-cancerous tissue, as well as peripheral blood from 28 TNBC patients post-NATI of residual cancer burden II/III. Unsupervised clustering resulted in several distinct clusters: 2 tumor-infiltrating NK (TINK) clusters with divergent functions of immune activation (TNFRSF7+) and suppression (SELL+); 2 immuno-suppressive peri-cancerous clusters; and 1 periphery-specific cluster. Considering the contradiction of the 2 TINK clusters, we further tested cytokine functions of SELL + and TNFRSF7 + TINKs by single-cell secreting proteomics using a 32-cytokine panel. Consistently, SELL + TINK clusters were characterized by immuno-suppressive secretion patterns (IL10+). A low proportion of SELL + TINK cluster and low proportion of IL10 + secreting SELL + TINK cluster (single-cell secreting proteomics) were both associated with better progression-free survival time. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 15 patients during 16-month follow-up. Overall, we identified a distinct immuno-suppressive TINK cell group, featuring IL10 + secreting and SELL expression with a strong relation to poor survival prognosis in TNBC patients post-NATI.

        <tr id="Purpose of review Mucosal-associated invariant T-cells (MAIT) have been associated with lung cancer and pulmonary infections. The treatment of patients with cancer or infections includes host-directed therapies (HDTs). MAIT play a role in shaping the ‘milieu interne’ in cancer and infections and this review addresses the biology of MAIT in pulmonary pathophysiology. Recent findings MAIT represent an attractive target for therapy in pulmonary malignancies and infections. T-cells are often difficult to exploit therapeutically due to the diversity of both T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and its ligandome. MAIT-cells are restricted by the major histocompatibility complex class I-related gene protein (MR1) that presents nondefined tumor-associated targets, bacterial products, vitamin and drug derivates. Due to their plasticity in gene expression, MAIT are able to conversely switch from IFN-γ to IL-17 production. Both cytokines play a key role in protective immune responses in infections and malignancies. MAIT-derived production of interleukin (IL)-17/TGF-β shapes the tumor micro-environment (TME), including tissue re-modelling leading to pulmonary fibrosis and recruitment of neutrophils. MAIT contribute to the gut-lung axis associated with clinical improved responses of patients with cancer to checkpoint inhibition therapy. MAIT are at the crossroad of HDTs targeting malignant and infected cells. Clinical presentations of overt inflammation, protective immune responses and tissue re-modeling are reviewed along the balance between Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 responses associated with immune-suppression or protective immune responses in infections. Summary MAIT shape the TME in pulmonary malignancies and infections. Drugs targeting the TME and HDTs affect MAIT that can be explored to achieve improved clinical results while curbing overt tissue-damaging immune responses.">

        <tr id="LPIN3 has emerged as a key factor in a variety of malignancies, although its precise role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. By analyzing the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we discovered that the expression pattern of LPIN3 and the relevant makeup of the immune microenvironment were immensely diverse among tumors. LPIN3 is abundantly expressed in CRC and may enhance tumor growth by activating the β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, we discovered that LPIN3 might reduce tumor antigen presentation signals, hence suppressing CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, high expression of LPIN3 predicts decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration and effector function via bioinformatics analysis. Indeed, CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity as well as CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation in vivo were strengthened by LPIN3 knockdown. To sum up, our results highlight the part that LPIN3 plays in driving the progression of CRC by regulating β-catenin signaling and CD8+ T cell activity.

        <tr id="Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi infections range from asymptomatic (AS) to severe visceral leishmaniasis (VL). One of the manifestations is an atypical non-ulcerated cutaneous leishmaniasis (NUCL), which occurs in some locations of Central America with few cases of VL. We conducted a transcriptomic analysis of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) on blood samples from NUCL, AS, VL patients from Amapala, Honduras, and healthy controls. RNA-seq revealed a similar perturbation of gene expression in NUCL and AS. Eight gene signatures of CMI were found in NUCL involved in CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration, reactive oxygen species generation, PD-1 receptor ligand, inflammasome assembly, chemotaxis, complement receptor and suppressor immune cell infiltration. NUCL was distinguished from VL by its up-regulation of differently expressed genes (DEGs) related to T lymphocyte exhaustion, adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes, and down-regulation of oxidative stress genes. In contrast, VL exhibited up-regulated DEGs involved in antigen cross-presentation, and similar to VL from Brazil, down-regulated DEGs involved in innate immunity. Corroborating the transcriptome findings, both the Leishmanin skin test, and the immunopathology of NUCL skin lesion defined NUCL as a proinflammatory condition, intermediate between the AS and VL clinical outcomes. That condition may be the underlying element for the benign nature of the NUCL.">

        <tr id="Introduction The immunological profiles of CD4+ T lymphocytes (TLs) from patients with hematological malignancies differ between patients who have and have not received transfusions. There may be several reasons for these differences, including the presence of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from plasma membrane budding and present in the platelet concentrates. Indeed, EVs can modulate the immune system through interactions with many immune cells, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Methods We therefore investigated how interactions with CD41a+ EVs cause immune cells to change phenotype and function. CD41a+ EVs were cultured with TLs, B lymphocytes, and monocytes. Given the potential involvement of monocytes in leukemia progression, we performed a new original multi-omics study to confirm the protein changes and gene activation observed following interaction with CD41a+ EVs Results The CD41a+ EVs had immunomodulatory effects on all these cell types but this effect depended on the numbers of EVs. CD4+ TLs required large numbers of CD41a+ EVs for activation, whereas monocytes were the most sensitive. With the new multi-omics technique, we confirmed the direct effects of CD41a+ EVs on protein phenotype and gene activation. Conclusion Transfusion EVs should be considered during the immunological follow-up of patients after transfusion to detect immunological effects on malignant hemopathies, and during the development of new immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe condition characterized by extensive lung inflammation and increased alveolar-capillary permeability, often triggered by infections or systemic inflammatory responses. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based therapy holds promise for treating ARDS, as MSCs manifest immunomodulatory and regenerative properties that mitigate inflammation and enhance tissue repair. Primed MSCs, modified to augment specific functionalities, demonstrate superior therapeutic efficacy in targeted therapies compared to naive MSCs. This study explored the immunomodulatory potential of MSCs using mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays and co-culture experiments with M1/M2 macrophages. Additionally, RNA sequencing was employed to identify alterations in immune and inflammation-related factors in primed MSCs. The therapeutic effects of primed MSCs were assessed in an LPS-induced ARDS mouse model, and the underlying mechanisms were investigated through spatial transcriptomics analysis. The study revealed that MSCs primed with IFN-γ and IL-1β significantly enhanced the suppression of T cell activity compared to naive MSCs, concurrently inhibiting TNF-α while increasing IL-10 production in macrophages. Notably, combined treatment with these two cytokines resulted in a significant upregulation of immune and inflammation-regulating factors. Furthermore, our analyses elucidated the mechanisms behind the therapeutic effects of primed MSCs, including the inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, modulation of immune and inflammatory responses, and enhancement of elastin fiber formation. Signaling pathway analysis confirmed that efficacy could be enhanced by modulating NFκB and TNF-α signaling. In conclusion, in early-phase ARDS, primed MSCs displayed enhanced homing capabilities, improved lung function, and reduced inflammation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Targeted therapies leveraging the innate immune system are emerging as promising cancer treatments. The mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) plays a crucial role in initiating innate immune responses, but its clinical use is limited by the risk of uncontrolled activation and systemic toxicity. To address this, we developed a novel therapeutic agent, the truncated interferon activation switch (TRIAS), combining MAVS truncates with a tumor antigen-targeting single-chain variable fragment (scFv). This design ensures antigen-dependent, controlled activation. Lentiviral delivery of TRIAS induced significant antitumor responses, including complete tumor regression in some cases. Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis further confirmed that tumor cells were the predominant population expressing the transgene. TRIAS-expressing tumor cells exhibited enhanced antitumor activity, likely due to increased cytokine release and upregulated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, enabling tumor cells to function as antigen-presenting cells. This activated other immune cells, driving adaptive immune responses. Additionally, TRIAS promoted a proinflammatory shift in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In conclusion, TRIAS was validated as an innovative immunotherapeutic agent with MAVS-like immune-activating properties and tightly controlled mechanisms, offering a safer and more effective approach for clinical cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Bladder cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease associated with high mortality if not diagnosed early. BC is classified into non-muscle-invasive BC (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive BC (MIBC), with MIBC linked to poor systemic therapy response and high recurrence rates. Current treatments include transurethral resection with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy for NMIBC and radical cystectomy with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy for MIBC. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in cancer progression, metastasis, and therapeutic efficacy. A comprehensive understanding of the TME’s complex interactions holds substantial translational significance for developing innovative treatments. The TME can contribute to therapeutic resistance, particularly in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies, where resistance arises from tumor-intrinsic changes or extrinsic TME factors. Recent advancements in immunotherapy highlight the importance of translational research to address these challenges. Strategies to overcome resistance focus on remodeling the TME to transform immunologically “cold” tumors, which lack immune cell infiltration, into “hot” tumors that respond better to immunotherapy. These strategies involve disrupting cancer-microenvironment interactions, inhibiting angiogenesis, and modulating immune components to enhance anti-tumor responses. Key mechanisms include cytokine involvement [e.g., interleukin-6 (IL-6)], phenotypic alterations in macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, and the plasticity of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Identifying potential therapeutic targets within the TME can improve outcomes for MIBC patients. This review emphasizes the TME’s complexity and its impact on guiding novel therapeutic approaches, offering hope for better survival in MIBC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Adenosine accumulated in the tumor microenvironment functions as an immune-modulating factor, exerting immunosuppressive actions via adenosine A2A/A2B receptor (A2AR/A2BR) in various immune cell types. CD73, a key enzymatic regulator responsible for adenosine production, is frequently overexpressed in diverse cancers, and its overexpression is associated with reduced responsiveness to conventional anti-cancer drug treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Despite numerous therapeutic applications of IL-2 in cancer immunotherapy, the relationship between the CD73-adenosine axis and IL-2-based immunotherapy remains largely unexplored. Methods To evaluate the effect of CD73 blockade on IL-2 signaling of CD8+ T cells, we screened novel CD73 antibodies using human single-chain variable fragment phage library and immunized Alpaca phage library. To optimize targeting to CD73-expressing cells and reinvigorate the antitumor effect of IL-2 in adenosine-rich microenvironment, we engineered a novel bifunctional GI-αCD73/IL-2v fusion protein. Functionality of GI-αCD73/IL-2v fusion protein was assessed in the in vitro cell-based assays and the in vivo tumor-bearing mouse model or cynomolgus monkey. Results IL-2-induced increase in proliferation of CD8+ T cells was not observed under adenosine-rich microenvironment. We demonstrated that the functional impairment of IL-2 signaling in CD8+ T cells in these conditions can be reversed by our anti-CD73 antibody (GI-αCD73). Furthermore, GI-αCD73/IL-2v fusion protein significantly restored the impaired proliferation of CD8+ T cells and consequently enhanced tumor cell killing under adenosine-mediated immunosuppression, surpassing the combined treatment of GI-αCD73 and Fc-IL-2v. These synergistic effects were attributed to the enhanced delivery of the IL-2v component of GI-αCD73/IL-2v to IL-2Rβγ on CD73-expressing CD8+ T cells through a cis-binding mechanism. GI-αCD73/IL-2v elicited a potent antitumor effect in both the human CD73 knock-in (hCD73 KI) mouse model and the humanized mouse model. In non-human primates, GI-αCD73/IL-2v exhibited excellent tolerability while inducing robust and durable expansions of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Conclusions GI-αCD73/IL-2v bispecific protein is a novel and potent immunocytokine with significant antitumor immunity through cis-binding on CD8+ T cells.">

        <tr id="Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinical condition. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKI have not been fully elucidated, and effective treatment options remain limited. Studies have shown that immune cells play a critical role in AKI, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) being one of the most important immunosuppressive lymphocytes. Tregs proliferation can attenuate AKI, whereas depletion exacerbates kidney injury. Given that endothelial cells (ECs) are the initial cells that interact with immune cells when they invade the tissue parenchyma, ECs are closely associated with immune reactions. Methods and results In this study, P-selectin binding peptide-extracellular vesicles (PBP-EVs) that target and repair ECs are engineered. Transcriptome sequencing reveals that PBP-EVs reduce the expression of inflammatory genes in AKI mice. Using high-resolution intravital two-photon microscopy (TPM), an increased recruitment of Tregs in the kidneys of AKI Foxp3-EGFP transgenic mice following PBP-EVs treatment is observed, as well as significant Lgr5+ renal stem cell proliferation in AKI Lgr5-CreERT2; R26mTmG mice. Additionally, PBP-EVs treatment result in reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, pathological damage and fibrosis of AKI mice. Upon depletion of Tregs in Foxp3-DTR transgenic mice, we observe diminished therapeutic effect of PBP-EVs on AKI. Conclusions The experimental results indicate that PBP-EVs can promote the repair and regeneration of AKI by mitigating endothelial cell damage and subsequently modulating Tregs and the immune microenvironment. These findings provide novel insights and strategies for the treatment of AKI. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-025-06268-x.">

        <tr id="The body’s innate immune system plays a pivotal role in identifying and eliminating cancer cells. However, as the immune system ages, its functionality can deteriorate, becoming dysfunctional, inefficient, or even inactive—a condition referred to as immunosenescence. This decline significantly increases the risk of malignancies. While the pro-cancer effects of T-cell aging have been widely explored, there remains a notable gap in the literature regarding the impact of aging on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. This review seeks to address this gap, with emphasis on these cell types. Furthermore, although certain cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have demonstrated efficacy across a broad spectrum of cancers, elderly patients are less likely to derive clinical benefit from these treatments. In some cases, they may even experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While senolytic strategies have shown promise in exerting anti-cancer effects, their adverse reactions and potential off-target effects present significant challenges. This review aims to elucidate the pro-cancer effects of immunosenescence, its implications for the efficacy and safety of ICIs, and potential anti-aging treatment strategies. In addition, optimizing anti-aging therapies to minimize adverse reactions and enhance therapeutic outcomes remains a critical focus for future research endeavors.">

        <tr id="Tumors often arise in chronically inflamed, and thus immunologically highly active niches. While immune cells are able to recognize and remove transformed cells, tumors eventually escape the control of the immune system by shaping their immediate microenvironment. In this context, macrophages are of major importance, as they initially exert anti-tumor functions before they adopt a tumor-associated phenotype that instead inhibits anti-tumor immune responses and even allows for sustaining a smoldering inflammatory, growth promoting tumor microenvironment (TME). Type I interferons (IFNs) are well established modulators of inflammatory reactions. While they have been shown to directly inhibit tumor growth, there is accumulating evidence that they also play an important role in altering immune cell functions within the TME. In the present review, we focus on the impact of type I IFNs on anti-tumor responses, driven by monocytes and macrophages. Specifically, we will provide an overview of tumor-intrinsic factors, which impinge on IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, like the presence of nucleic acids, metabolites, or hypoxia. We will further summarize the current understanding of the consequences of altered IFN responses on macrophage phenotypes, i.e., differentiation, polarization, and functions. For the latter, we will focus on macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing and phagocytosis, as well as on how macrophages affect their environment by secreting cytokines and directly interacting with immune cells. Finally, we will discuss how type I IFN responses in macrophages might affect and should be considered for current and future tumor therapies.">

 Natural killer (NK) cells are crucial constituents of innate immunity, playing a vital role in the early defense against viral infections and cancer. Their antiviral capabilities stem from direct cytotoxic activity against infected cells and immunoregulatory functions that modulate adaptive immune responses. In the context of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), NK cells contribute to controlling viral replication and limiting excessive inflammatory responses.



 This review highlights the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity, focusing on their interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). We discuss potential sources of NK cells for adoptive transfer therapy, critical factors influencing their therapeutic efficacy, and considerations for clinical translation in COVID-19 treatment.



 Various NK cell sources for adoptive therapy are discussed, including peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetically engineered NK cells. Key factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of NK cell-based therapies are analyzed, including cytokine modulation, NK cell subset selection, and delivery methods.



 Understanding the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity and the factors that influence the success of adoptive NK cell therapy can inform the design of more effective immunotherapies for COVID-19 patients. Strategies for improving NK cell function, such as genetic modification and optimizing therapy protocols, are highlighted to enhance therapeutic outcomes.



 NK cells neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by releasing cytotoxic granules, inhibiting replication, and modulating inflammation. They originate from peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetic engineering. Therapeutic strategies include adoptive transfer, cytokine modulation, and optimized delivery. Inflammation is controlled, reducing excessive immune responses.

        <tr id="Background Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) initiates secondary injuries that worsen neurological damage and hinder recovery. While peripheral immune responses play a key role in stroke outcomes, clinical results from immunotherapy have been suboptimal, with limited focus on T-cell dynamics. Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) offer therapeutic potential due to their immunomodulatory properties. They can regulate immune responses and reduce neuroinflammation, potentially enhancing recovery by fostering a pro-regenerative peripheral immune environment. However, the effect of UMSCs on T-cell dynamics in AIS remains underexplored. This study investigates T-cell dynamics following AIS and examines how UMSCs may mitigate immune dysregulation to develop better treatment strategies. Methods AIS patients (NIHSS scores 0–15) were recruited within 72 h of stroke onset, with peripheral blood samples collected on Day 0 (enrollment) and Day 7. T-cell compartments were identified by flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine levels were quantified using a cytometric bead array (CBA). Mitochondria in UMSCs were labeled with MitoTracker. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients were isolated, treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cocultured with UMSCs in both direct contact and Transwell systems. Flow cytometry, CBA, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect T-cell compartments, gene expression markers for helper T (Th) cell differentiation, cytokine profiles, mitochondrial transfer, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA in UMSCs was depleted. The effects of UMSCs and mitochondria-depleted UMSCs on ischemic stroke mice were compared through behavioral assessments and analysis of the peripheral immune microenvironment. Results In AIS, T-cell compartments underwent a phenotypic shift from naïve to effector or memory states, with a specific increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells, leading to alterations in T-cell-mediated immune functions. In an ex vivo co-culture system, LPS stimulation further amplified these disparities, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in T cells. Notably, UMSCs restored mitochondrial function and reversed the shift in T-cell compartments through mitochondrial transfer. Critically, UMSC treatment significantly improved both neurological deficits and peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke mice, whereas mitochondria-depleted UMSCs failed to produce this effect. Conclusions Our comprehensive insights into the key attributes of T-cell compartments in acute ischemic stroke and the immune regulatory mechanisms of UMSCs provide a crucial theoretical foundation for understanding peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke and the therapeutic potential of UMSC treatment.

        <tr id="Abstract Checkpoint inhibitors have led to remarkable benefits in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet response rates remain below expectations. High-dimensional analysis and mechanistic experiments in clinical samples and relevant NSCLC models uncovered the immune composition of lung cancer tissues, providing invaluable insights into the functional properties of tumor-infiltrating T cells and myeloid cells. Among myeloid cells, type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) stand out for their unique ability to induce effector CD8 T cells against neoantigens and coordinate antitumoral immunity. Notably, lung resident cDC1 are particularly abundant and long-lived and express a unique tissue-specific gene program, underscoring their central role in lung immunity. Here, we discuss recent insights on the induction and regulation of antitumoral T cell responses in lung cancer, separating it from the tissue-agnostic knowledge generated from heterogeneous tumor models. We focus on the most recent studies dissecting functional states and spatial distribution of lung cDC1 across tumor stages and their impact on T cell responses to neoantigens. Finally, we highlight relevant gaps and emerging strategies to harness lung cDC1 immunostimulatory potential.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background A subset of CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic activity has been identified, and these cells exert their effects by expressing perforin and granzymes. Despite the progress made in characterizing cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in various diseases, the status of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the underlying mechanisms involved in promoting intratumoral cytotoxic CD4+ T-cell activation remain unclear. Methods We used flow cytometry to examine the phenotypic and functional properties of CD4+GzmB+ T cells in the peripheral blood and tumor tissues of patients with NSCLC. Loss-of-function analyses and RNA sequencing were used to identify the underlying mechanisms involved in the effects of interleukin (IL)-15 on the restoration of CD4+GzmB+ T-cell function in vitro. A patient-derived lung cancer explant model and an animal model were used to verify the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors on CD4+GzmB+ T-cell activation. Results In patients with NSCLC, impaired cytolytic function of tumor-infiltrated granzyme B (GzmB)-expressing CD4+ T cells was restored by IL-15 through activation of the AKT-FOXO1-T-bet axis. Moreover, IL-15 stimulation increased solute carrier family 7 member 5 (SLC7A5) expression in CD4+GzmB+ T cells in an Protein Kinase B (AKT)-dependent manner, and inhibition of SLC7A5 abrogated the effect of IL-15 on CD4+GzmB+ T cells. Additionally, we showed that the immune checkpoint molecules programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and CD85j were mutually exclusively expressed in CD4+GzmB+ T cells and that dual targeting of PD-1 and CD85j enhanced the effector function of CD4+GzmB+ T cells by activating the AKT pathway. Notably, tumor cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II and IL-15 determine the effectiveness of CD4+GzmB+ T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity in response to immunotherapy. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating CD4+GzmB+ T cells fail to eliminate tumors. Dual blockade of PD-1 and CD85j alongside IL-15 restores the effector function of CD4+GzmB+ T cells and drives CD4+GzmB+ T-cell transformation in the tumor microenvironment to combat MHC-II-expressing tumors.">

        <tr id="In the progression of gastric cancer (GC), various cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME) exhibit upregulated expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), leading to impaired T-cell function and evasion of immune surveillance. Infection with H. pylori and EBV leads to increased PD-L1 expression in various cell types within TME, resulting in immune suppression and facilitating immune escape of GC cells. In the TME, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), M1-like tumor-associated macrophages (MI-like TAM), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to the upregulation of PD-L1 expression in GC cells. Conversely, mast cells, M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (M2-like TAM), and tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) exhibit elevated levels of PD-L1 expression in response to the influence of GC cells. Together, these factors collectively contribute to the upregulation of PD-L1 expression in GC. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the cellular expression patterns of PD-L1 in GC and the underlying molecular mechanisms.

        <tr id="Adult stem cell therapy holds great promise for treating decompensated liver cirrhosis on the basis of animal studies, despite uncertainty about its clinical therapeutic efficacy and unclear underlying mechanisms. Here, we investigated the role of follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1), a profibrotic and proinflammatory matricellular protein, in inflammation-related heterogeneity in stem cell therapy. Our results showed that a high level of circulating FSTL1 is significantly correlated with therapeutic response in patients with cirrhosis. FSTL1 facilitated MSC-mediated early recruitment of Ly6C+ inflammatory macrophages within 24 h postinfusion, which was essential for the empowerment of MSCs and subsequent Ly6C−CX3CR1+ macrophage remodelling at 48 h postinfusion. Fstl1 deficiency abrogated early macrophage recruitment and effective Ly6C−CX3CR1+ macrophage accumulation, resulting in the poor antifibrotic effect of MSCs in mice. Whereas, recombinant FSTL1 protein restored the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in CCl4-injured Fstl1+/− mice. Mechanistically, host FSTL1 enhanced rapid recycling of CCR2 to the membrane via activation of the CD14/TLR4/NF-κB/ATP6V1G2 axis, leading to early recruitment of Ly6C+ monocytes /macrophages. Taken together, our findings revealed that FSTL1 is a critical regulator of the fibrotic immune microenvironment and facilitates subsequent stem cell therapy. These data suggest that FSTL1 could serve as a predictive biomarker of stem cell therapy response in patients with liver cirrhosis.">

        <tr id="Background Arginine metabolism in tumors is often shunted into the pathway producing pro-tumor and immune suppressive polyamines (PAs), while downmodulating the alternative nitric oxide (NO) synthesis pathway. Aiming to correct arginine metabolism in tumors, arginine deprivation therapy and inhibitors of PA synthesis have been developed. Despite some therapeutic advantages, these approaches have often yielded severe side effects, making it necessary to explore an alternative strategy. We previously reported that supplementing sepiapterin (SEP), the endogenous precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4, the essential NO synthase cofactor), could correct arginine metabolism in tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and induce their metabolic and phenotypic reprogramming. We saw that oral SEP treatment effectively suppressed the growth of HER2-positive mammary tumors in animals. SEP also has no reported dose-dependent toxicity in clinical trials for metabolic disorders. In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that a long-term administration of SEP to individuals susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumor would protect them against tumor occurrence. Methods We administered SEP, in comparison to control DMSO, to MMTV-neu mice susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumors for 8 months starting at their pre-pubertal stage. We monitored tumor onsets to determine the rate of tumor-free survival. After 8 months of treatment, we grouped animals into DMSO treatment with or without tumors and SEP treatment with or without tumors. We analyzed blood metabolites, PBMC, and bone marrow of DMSO vs. SEP treated animals. Results We found that a long-term use of SEP in animals susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumors effectively suppressed tumor occurrence. These SEP-treated animals had undergone reprogramming of the systemic metabolism and immunity, elevating total T cell counts in the circulation and bone marrow. Given that bone marrow-resident T cells are mostly memory T cells, it is plausible that chronic SEP treatment promoted memory T cell formation, leading to a potent tumor prevention. Conclusions These findings suggest the possible roles of the SEP/BH4/NO axis in promoting memory T cell formation and its potential therapeutic utility for preventing HER2-positive breast cancer.

        <tr id="Breast cancer (BRCA) is a common malignant tumor, and its immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in disease progression. In this research, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing technologies, combined with in vivo and in vitro experiments, to thoroughly investigate the immunological functions and mechanisms of FOLR2+ macrophages in BRCA. Our findings demonstrate a significant enhancement in the interaction between FOLR2+ macrophages and CD8+ T cells within the tumor tissues of BRCA patients. FOLR2 is closely associated with T cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment of BRCA patients, particularly with CD8+ T cells. By secreting CXCL9 and engaging with CXCR3, FOLR2+ macrophages can activate the functionality of CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting cancer cell apoptosis. Further animal experiments confirm that FOLR2+ macrophages activate CD8+ T cells through the CXCL9-CXCR3 axis, exhibiting an antitumor immunity effect in BRCA. FOLR2+ macrophages play a crucial role in antitumor immunity in BRCA through the CXCL9-CXCR3 axis.

        <tr id="Background Resistance to both naturally occurring anti-cancer immunity and to immunotherapy is common in patients with aggressive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recent studies indicate a role of loss of the HLA class-I antigen presentation machinery (APM) protein β-2-microglobulin in acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockers. However, the mechanisms, functional consequences and therapeutic potential of APM defects in NSCLC remain poorly understood. Methods Using multiplexed immunofluorescence, we spatially mapped CD8+ effector Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) and the APM components TAP1 and TAP2 in 819 baseline/pre-treatment NSCLCs from patients treated with and without PD-1 axis blockers in 4 independent cohorts. The impact of TAP1/2 silencing in lung cancer cells using siRNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 was studied using transcriptomic analysis, phosphoprotein arrays, ATAC-sequencing, measurement of surface HLA-peptide complexes and in vitro tumor-antigen specific T-cell killing. We established autologous co-cultures of tumor and immune cells from primary human NSCLCs to study the functional impact of IL4Rα and/or PD-1 blockade using monoclonal antibodies. A high-throughput drug screen supported the identification of compounds able to increase TAP2 expression in NSCLC cells. Results We identified cancer cell selective TAP2 protein downregulation in 42.4% of treatment naïve NSCLCs associated with reduced sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockers. TAP1 downregulation occurred in 24.4% of lung tumors without survival impact. Silencing of TAP2 in lung cancer cells altered key intracellular immunomodulatory pathways, limited sensitivity to proinflammatory cytokines, reduced the levels of surface peptide-HLA complexes and protected malignant cells from tumor antigen-specific T-cell killing via SOCS1 upregulation. TAP2 loss in human NSCLCs was associated with reduced TAP2 promoter chromatin accessibility and elevated IL-4 IL-4 expression. Treatment with IL-4 reduced TAP2 levels and the chromatin accessibility of the TAP2 gene promoter in NSCLC cells and reproduced all the functional consequences of TAP2 loss. In intact human NSCLC, IL-4 IL-4 transcripts were detected in intratumoral myeloid cells and IL-4Rα blockade increased human NSCLC cell killing by autologous TILs. Epigenetic modulators and other drugs with known anti-cancer activity increased TAP2 expression and its function in lung cancer cells. Conclusions Our study reveals previously unrecognized functions of TAP2 beyond antigen presentation and establishes a reversible multi-cellular axis mediating adaptive immune evasion and immunotherapy resistance with clinical potential.

        <tr id="Brain metastases (BMs) are a relatively common and severe complication in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), significantly affecting patient prognosis. Metastatic tumor cells can alter the brain tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote an immunosuppressive state, characterized by reduced infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), diminished expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and changes in other proinflammatory factors and immune cell populations. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, play a pivotal role in modulating the central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment through interactions with metastatic cancer cells, astrocytes, and infiltrating T cells. The M2 phenotype of microglia contributes to immunosuppression in BM via the activation of signaling pathways such as STAT3 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. Recent advances have enhanced our understanding of the immune landscape of BMs in NSCLC, particularly regarding immune evasion within the CNS. Current immunotherapeutic strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promise for NSCLC patients with BM, demonstrating intracranial activity and manageable safety profiles. Future research is warranted to further explore the molecular and immune mechanisms underlying BM, aiming to develop more effective treatments.">

        <tr id="Liver metastasis (LM) poses a significant challenge in cancer treatment, with limited available therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Understanding the dynamics of tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune interactions is crucial for developing effective treatments. We find that WNT11 promoted CD8+ T-cell exclusion and suppression, which was correlated with poor prognosis in LM. Mechanistically, WNT11-overexpressing tumor cells directly reduce CD8+ T-cell recruitment and activity by decreasing CXCL10 and CCL4 expression through CAMKII-mediated β-catenin/AFF3 downregulation. WNT11-overexpressing tumor cells promote immunosuppressive macrophage polarization by inducing IL17D expression via the CAMKII/NF-κB pathway, which result in CD8+ T-cell suppression. Moreover, CAMKII inhibition increases the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in mouse model of LM. Serum expression of WNT11 is identified as a potential minimally invasive biomarker in the management of colorectal cancer-LM with immunotherapy. Our findings highlight WNT11/CAMKII axis as a critical regulator of the TME and a promising target for immunotherapy in patients with LM.">

        <tr id="Background Our team has previously found that the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) plays a more significant anti-tumor role in host immune cells than in tumor cells. Although STING is necessary for CD8 + T cells to exert immunological activity, its effect on CD8 + T cells remains debatable. In this study, we used both in vitro and in vivo models to explore the metabolic effects of STING on CD8 + T cells. Methods Peripheral blood lymphocytes were procured from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy to investigate the correlation between STING expression levels, CD8 + T-cell subsets, and immunotherapy efficacy. STING knockout (STING-KO) mice were used for in vivo studies. RNA-seq, seahorse, flow cytometry, electron microscopy, qPCR, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and immunoprecipitation were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms of STING in regulating CD8 + T cell function. Results We discovered that the expression level of STING in immune cells exhibited a significant correlation with immunotherapy efficacy, as well as with the proportion of central memory CD8 + T cells. Moreover, we found that the loss of the STING gene results in a reduction in the number of mitochondria and a change in the metabolic pathway selection, thereby inducing excessive glycolysis in CD8 + T cells. This excessive glycolysis generates high levels of lactate, which further inhibits IFN-γ secretion and impacts memory T cell differentiation. Correcting the glycolysis disorder partially restored function and IFN-γ secretion, rescued the central memory CD8 + T subset, and improved immunotherapy in STING-KO mice. This provides a new treatment strategy for patients with low STING expression and a poor response to immunotherapy. Conclusion Intrinsic STING of CD8 + T cells affects their function through the HK2/Lactate/IFN-γ axis and affects memory differentiation by regulating glycolysis.

        <tr id="Myeloid cells are a major component of immune cells infiltrating tumors, interacting with each other, with tumor cells and other stromal cells, and demonstrating a prominent plasticity. Neutrophils, as a population of such cells, contribute to cancer progression via multiple mechanisms, including stimulation of angiogenesis and the regulation of adaptive immune responses. Importantly, neutrophils were demonstrated to be associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with different kinds of cancer, including head and neck cancer, renal cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma or melanoma. Enrichment of neutrophils was also associated with metastases in various tumor entities. 
Activity of neutrophils strongly depends on the cytokines or growth factors present in the microenvironment. Since these cells are highly plastic and their functionality can be easily altered, they are ideal target for anti-tumor therapies. Since we observe that elevated STAT3 is associated with pro-tumoral activity of neutrophils, we tested here the approach to functionally reprogram these cells by the inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway. We could show that such STAT3 inhibition solely in neutrophils led to decreased tumor growth and metastasis in cancer, which was accompanied by a significant expansion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Comprehensive multiparameter analyses of tumors and TDLNs revealed a significant enrichment of CD8+ T cell subsets with strongly cytotoxic activity, which effectively killed cancer cells in vitro. These findings provide novel insights in therapeutic avenues and suggest neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition as a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health concern due to its poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options, particularly in advanced stages. Tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), plays a key role in tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. TAMs exhibit plasticity, shifting between pro-inflammatory M1 and immunosuppressive M2 phenotypes, with the latter predominating in GC and contributing to poor outcomes. Recent therapeutic advancements focus on targeting TAMs, including inhibiting M2 polarization, reprogramming TAMs to M1 phenotypes, and combining TAM-targeted approaches with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Innovations in nanotechnology, metabolic reprogramming, and targeting key pathways such as interleukin-6 and C-C motif ligand 2/C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 further enhance these strategies. However, challenges remain, including the spatial and functional heterogeneity of TAMs within the TME and the need for selective targeting to avoid disrupting immune homeostasis. Ongoing research on TAM origins, functions, and interactions within the TME is crucial for developing precise and effective therapies. These advances hold promise not only for improving outcomes in GC but also for addressing other cancers with similarly complex microenvironments.">

        <tr id="Relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains a challenging disease with a dismal prognosis. Despite the revolutionary impact of CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19)-T cell therapy, >50% of patients relapse within a year. Both leukemia cell-intrinsic factors favoring immune escape and poor CAR-T cell persistence contribute significantly to clinical failure. Moreover, the expression of immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) and their ligands within the complex bone marrow (BM) microenvironment may contribute to leukemia progression and therapy resistance. Here, we comprehensively characterized the expression of ICRs and their ligands in leukemic blasts, T cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from B-ALL BM samples at diagnosis (n=47) and relapse (n=38), comparing them with age-matched healthy BM controls. Our findings reveal a significant upregulated expression of TIM-3 in T cells, and its ligand galectin-9 in both blasts and MSCs throughout disease progression. The expression levels of galectin-9 in B-ALL blasts and TIM-3 in CAR19-T cells negatively correlate with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that galectin-9 impairs CAR19-T cell homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Notably, an engineered TIM-3-Fc decoy receptor, delivered either by primary T cells co-administered with CAR19-T cells or via a bicistronic all-in-one CAR19-TIM-3-Fc construct, improved the anti-leukemia efficacy and persistence of CAR19-T cells in B-ALL patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, CAR19-TIM-3-Fc-T cell treatment promotes the in vivo expansion of both transduced and bystander effector and memory T cells, as determined by spectral flow cytometry. Collectively, these potent and persistent TIM-3-Fc decoy-armored CAR19-T cells offer a promising therapeutic strategy for R/R B-ALL patients.">

In the urinary tract, TRM cells play critical roles in defending against infections, mediating tumor immunity, and influencing the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Their therapeutic potential is immense, with promising avenues for vaccine development, enhanced cancer immunotherapy, and targeted treatments for chronic inflammation. However, challenges remain in harnessing their protective roles while minimizing their pathological effects, particularly in immunosuppressive or inflammatory microenvironments. This review explores the diverse roles of TRM cells in urinary tract diseases, including infections, cancer, and chronic inflammation, and discusses therapeutic strategies and future directions for leveraging TRM cells to improve clinical outcomes. By advancing our understanding of TRM cell biology, we can develop innovative interventions that balance their immune-protective and regulatory functions.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Head and neck cancer (HNC) is an aggressive disease that often evades the immune system, making it difficult to treat. This study investigates how Axl, a protein overexpressed on tumor cells, contributes to the immune escape strategies of HNC by decreasing the number of immune cells within the tumor. Using mouse models, we show that removing Axl slows tumor growth by reducing the number of immune-suppressing cells and increasing immune cells that can kill tumors, such as natural killer (NK) cells. We found that Axl prevents NK cells from working properly by modulating signals that attract, activate, or inhibit them. By blocking Axl, tumors are more vulnerable to immune-mediated killing. These findings suggest that targeting Axl could improve treatments for HNC by increasing immune cell invasion within the tumor, providing a new way to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Significant advancements have been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of type 2 immunity in allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), food and drug allergies, and atopic dermatitis (AD). Type 2 immunity has evolved to protect against parasitic diseases and toxins, plays a role in the expulsion of parasites and larvae from inner tissues to the lumen and outside the body, maintains microbe-rich skin and mucosal epithelial barriers and counterbalances the type 1 immune response and its destructive effects. During the development of a type 2 immune response, an innate immune response initiates starting from epithelial cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), including dendritic cells and macrophages, and translates to adaptive T and B-cell immunity, particularly IgE antibody production. Eosinophils, mast cells and basophils have effects on effector functions. Cytokines from ILC2s and CD4+ helper type 2 (Th2) cells, CD8 + T cells, and NK-T cells, along with myeloid cells, including IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, initiate and sustain allergic inflammation via T cell cells, eosinophils, and ILC2s; promote IgE class switching; and open the epithelial barrier. Epithelial cell activation, alarmin release and barrier dysfunction are key in the development of not only allergic diseases but also many other systemic diseases. Recent biologics targeting the pathways and effector functions of IL4/IL13, IL-5, and IgE have shown promising results for almost all ages, although some patients with severe allergic diseases do not respond to these therapies, highlighting the unmet need for a more detailed and personalized approach.">

        <tr id="CD19 and CXCR4 are pivotal regulators of B-cell activation and migration, respectively. Specifically, CXCR4 signaling critically influences the dissemination of various malignant B cells through constitutive activation and aberrant expression. This study explores the interaction between CD19 and CXCR4 signaling in the context of B-cell lymphomas, particularly focusing on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM). We assessed the roles of CD19 in survival and CXCL12-induced migration by using knockout (KO) cells of DLBCL and WM origin alongside evaluating the impact of CD19 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our results highlight that CD19 is important for survival and CXCL12-induced migration, and mAbs variably increase CXCL12-induced migration and enhance ADCC. Additionally, we demonstrate that the endogenous peptide inhibitor of the CXCR4 (EPI-X4) derivative JM#21 effectively inhibits CD19-mediated migration enhancement and promotes ADCC, thereby augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of CD19 mAb-based immunotherapy in lymphoma models. Our study underscores the potential of targeting both CD19 and CXCR4 to refine therapeutic strategies for treating B-cell malignancies, suggesting a synergistic approach could improve clinical outcomes in WM treatment.">

        <tr id="The pivotal role of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) in the field of dendritic cell (DC)-based tumor immunotherapies has been gaining increasing recognition due to their superior antigen cross-presentation abilities and essential role in modulating immune responses. This review specifically highlights the C-type lectin receptor family 9 member A (Clec9a or DNGR-1), which is exclusively expressed on cDC1s and plays a pivotal role in augmenting antigen cross-presentation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses while simultaneously mitigating off-target effects. These effects include the enhancement of the cDC1s cross-presentation, reducing autoimmune responses and systemic inflammation, as well as preventing the non-specific activation of other immune cells. Consequently, these actions may contribute to reduced toxicity and enhanced treatment efficacy in immunotherapy. The exceptional ability of Clec9a to cross-present dead cell-associated antigens and enhance both humoral and CTL responses makes it an optimal receptor for DC-based strategies aimed at strengthening antitumor immunity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular characterization, expression, and signaling mechanisms of Clec9a. Furthermore, it discusses the role of Clec9a in the induction and functional activation of Clec9a+ cDC1s, with a particular focus on addressing the challenges related to off-target effects and immune tolerance in the development of tumor vaccines. Additionally, this review explores the potential of Clec9a-targeted approaches to enhance the immunogenicity of tumor vaccines and addresses the utilization of Clec9a as a delivery target for specific agonists (such as STING agonists and αGC) to enhance their therapeutic effects. This novel approach leverages Clec9a’s capacity to improve the precision and efficacy of these immunomodulatory molecules in tumor treatment. In summary, this review presents compelling evidence positioning Clec9a as a promising target for DC-based tumor immunotherapy, capable of enhancing the efficacy of vaccines and immune responses while minimizing adverse effects.">

        <tr id="Introduction Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy has shown success in treating hematological malignancies, but its effectiveness against solid tumors is hindered by T cell exhaustion. During in vitro expansion, tonic signaling induced by CAR expression contributes to CAR-T cell exhaustion, which can be mitigated by inhibiting calcium signaling. Given that sodium citrate can chelate calcium ions and inhibit calcium signaling, in this study, we investigated whether sodium citrate could reduce exhaustion and enhance CAR-T cell function. Methods We constructed anti-CD70 CAR-T cells and cultured them in the presence of sodium citrate. The characteristics and functionality of sodium citrate-pretreated CAR-T cells were assessed through in vitro and in vivo experiments. To further validate our observation, we also treated anti-mesothelin (MSLN) CAR-T cells with sodium citrate and detected the phenotypes and anti-tumor function of CAR-T cells. Results We found that sodium citrate-pretreated anti-CD70 CAR-T cells exhibited reduced exhaustion, increased memory T cell proportions, and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, sodium citrate treatment improved the in vivo persistence of CAR-T cells and prevented tumor recurrence. These beneficial effects were also observed in anti-MSLN CAR-T cells. Transcriptomic and metabolite analyses revealed that sodium citrate inhibited calcium signaling, mTORC1 activity, and glycolysis pathways, thus modulating T cell exhaustion and differentiation. Discussion Our findings suggest that sodium citrate supplementation during CAR-T cell expansion could be a promising strategy to improve CAR-T therapy for solid tumors by preventing exhaustion and promoting memory T cell formation.">

The TME plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulating processes such as cancer cell migration, proliferation, tumor vascularization, and the modulation of anti-cancer immune responses. 2 Effects of the TME are partially mediated by secreted factors, including exosomes, metabolites, cytokines, chemokines, and a remodeled extracellular matrix produced by CAFs, which profoundly in ﬂ uence cancer progression. 2 Numerous studies revealed that the TME plays a pivotal role in modulating anti-cancer immune responses, either promoting or suppressing these processes in a manner that appears highly context-dependent. 3 Effective immune responses against cancer cells basically involve three different key mechanisms. (i) tumor-antigen-speci ﬁ c CD8 + T cells are activated in draining lymph nodes and then (ii) recruited into the tumor.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The differentiation of naive follicular B cells into either the germinal center (GC) or extrafollicular (EF) pathway plays a critical role in shaping the type, affinity, and longevity of effector B cells. This choice also governs the selection and survival of autoreactive B cells, influencing their potential to enter the memory compartment. During the first 2–3 days following antigen encounter, initially activated B cells integrate activating signals from T cells, Toll‐like receptors (TLRs), and cytokines, alongside inhibitory signals mediated by inhibitory receptors. This integration modulates the intensity of signaling, particularly of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which plays a central role in guiding developmental decisions. These early signaling events determine whether B cells undergo GC maturation or differentiate rapidly into antibody‐secreting cells (ASCs) via the EF pathway. Dysregulation of these signaling pathways—whether through excessive activation or defective regulatory mechanisms—can disrupt the balance between GC and EF fates, predisposing individuals to autoimmunity. Accordingly, aberrant PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling has been implicated in the defective selection of autoreactive B cells, increasing the risk of autoimmune disease. This review focuses on the signaling events in newly activated B cells, with an emphasis on the induction and regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. It also highlights gaps in our understanding of how alternative B cell fates are regulated. Both the physiological context and the implications of inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) and complex autoimmune conditions will be discussed in this regard.">

        <tr id="Tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (Trm) constitute a distinct population of non-circulating memory T cells1–5 vastly exceeding the number of circulating T cells5, and play a pivotal role in protective immunity against pathogens6–8. How to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm remains an important challenge. Whether Trm contribute also to immune control of tumors or just correlate with an unrelated process linked to clinical outcome has not been unequivocally established9,10, and phenotypic markers such as co-expression of CD69 and CD103 or CD49a integrins commonly used to monitor tumor infiltrating Trm do not unambiguously define this subset. Here we tested the hypothesis that transient downregulation of KLF2, the most conserved feature of Trm ontogeny4,11,12, will promote the differentiation of vaccine activated CD8+ T cells into Trm and enhance antitumor immunity. We show that 4-1BB antibody targeted delivery of a KLF2 siRNA to tumor bearing mice led to the downregulation of KLF2 in vaccine activated CD8+ T cells and the accumulation of phenotypically defined intratumoral CD69+CD103+ and CD69+CD49a+ CD8+ T cells which correlated with enhanced control of tumor growth. This study could serve as the foundation of a broadly applicable and clinically useful way to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm and provides direct evidence that intratumoral CD8+CD69+CD103+ and CD8+CD69+CD49a+ cells are indeed Trm and that Trm contribute to tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Originally identified for its involvement in bone remodeling, accumulating data emerged in the past years indicating that receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) actually acts as a multifunctional soluble molecule that influences various physiological and pathological processes. Regarding its role in carcinogenesis, while direct effects on tumor cell behavior have been precisely characterized, the impact of the RANKL/RANK system (and its inhibition) on the intratumoral immune landscape remains unclear. Methods After various in silico/in situ/in vitro analyses, the immunotherapeutic efficacy of RANKL blockade (alone and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)) or doxorubicin/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy) was investigated using different syngeneic mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (4T1, 67NR and E0771). Isolated from retrieved tumors, 14 immune cell (sub)populations, along with the activation status of antigen-presenting cells, were thoroughly analyzed in each condition. Finally, the impact of RANKL on the functionality of both dendritic cells (DC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) was determined. Results A drastic tumor growth inhibition was reproductively observed following RANKL inhibition. Strikingly, this antitumor activity was not detected in immunocompromised mice, demonstrating its dependence on the adaptive immune responses and justifying the diverse enriched signatures linked to immune cell regulation/differentiation detected in RANKLhigh-expressing human neoplasms. Interestingly, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (but not PD-1 checkpoint inhibition) potentiated the anticancer effects of RANKL blockade by priming effector T cells and increasing their infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, we highlighted that RANKL indirectly promotes regulatory T cell differentiation and suppressive function by inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway on antigen-presenting cells. Conclusions Taken together, this study provides insight into the role of RANKL/RANK axis in immune tolerance, demonstrates the significant impact of RANKL-dependent impairment of T cell–DC/pDC crosstalk on tumor development and, ultimately, supports that this ligand could be an interesting actionable target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, necessitating innovative treatments. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are primary immunosuppressive effectors that foster tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. They are broadly categorized into proinflammatory M1 and tumor-promoting M2 phenotypes, with elevated M2 infiltration correlating with poor prognosis. Strategies aimed at inhibiting TAM recruitment, depleting TAMs, or reprogramming M2 to M1 are therefore highly promising. Key signaling pathways, such as CSF-1/CSF-1R, IL-4/IL-13–STAT6, TLRs, and CD47-SIRPα, regulate TAM polarization. Additionally, macrophage-based drug delivery systems permit targeted agent transport to hypoxic regions, enhancing therapy. Preclinical studies combining TAM-targeted therapies with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors have yielded improved responses and prolonged survival. Several clinical trials have also reported benefits in previously unresponsive patients. Future work should clarify the roles of macrophage-derived exosomes, cytokines, and additional mediators in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These insights will inform the design of next-generation drug carriers and optimize combination immunotherapies within precision medicine frameworks. Elucidating TAM phenotypes and their regulatory molecules remains central to developing novel strategies that curb tumor progression and ultimately improve outcomes in lung cancer. Importantly, macrophage-based immunomodulation may offer expanded treatment avenues.">

        <tr id="Introduction Burn-induced sepsis is a critical clinical challenge marked by systemic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and high mortality. Macrophage-driven inflammatory pathways are central to sepsis pathogenesis, while immune cell metabolic reprogramming plays a key role in both sepsis and cancer progression. Methods Bioinformatics analyses using GEO, TCGA, and GTEx datasets identified MLIP-modulated genes linked to immune responses and prognosis. In vitro, LPS-stimulated HUVEC cells were used to study MLIP’s effects on inflammation and macrophage function through cell viability, ROS levels, cytokine expression, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence assays. Results MLIP-modulated genes were associated with immune-related metabolic pathways in both sepsis and cancer. Epigenetic analysis showed MLIP expression is regulated by promoter methylation and chromatin accessibility. Prognostic analyses revealed MLIP’s impact on survival outcomes across cancer types. In vitro, MLIP reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and macrophage hyperactivation. Conclusions MLIP regulates immune-metabolic dynamics in burn-induced sepsis, influencing macrophage activity and oxidative stress. Its role in metabolic reprogramming suggests MLIP as a potential therapeutic target linking immune modulation and cancer progression. Further research on MLIP’s role in immune evasion and tumor metabolism may inform novel therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were first recognized over twenty years ago as a key immunomodulatory cell population. Since their initial identification, a growing body of literature points to the importance of MDSC as a heterogeneous, immunosuppressive cell population and as a therapeutic target in adults with cancer. MDSC are potent suppressors of T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells and can be helpful or harmful to the host depending on the pathophysiology. For example, MDSC are beneficial in pregnancy and prevent spontaneous abortion by promoting maternal-fetal tolerance. Increased MDSC are also associated with improved outcomes in patients with graft vs. host disease by decreasing T cell-driven inflammation. However, MDSC can also be harmful and are known to be pathologic in adults with cancer and chronic infections by promoting tumor escape and impairing pathogen clearance, respectively. Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of MDSC and their immune suppression effects in adults, much less is known regarding the role of MDSC in children. Research investigating MDSC in children lags significantly behind adult studies. In fact, while over 5,000 publications on PubMed discuss MDSC in immune regulation, fewer than 50 of these publications focus specifically on their role in children. This review aims to summarize the existing literature on the role of MDSC in children and identify important directions for future research, including targeting these cells in the pediatric population to improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Inflammation, a hallmark of cancer, has been associated with tumor progression, transition into malignant phenotype and efficacy of anticancer treatments in cancer. It affects all stages of cancer, from the initiation of carcinogenesis to metastasis. Chronic inflammation induces immunosup-pression, providing an environment conducive to carcinogenesis, whereas acute inflammation induces an antitumor immune response, leading to tumor suppression. Solid tumors have an inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) containing cancer cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and soluble molecules, which plays a key role in tumor progression and therapy response. Both cancer cells and stromal cells in the TME are highly plastic and constantly change their phenotypic and functional properties. Cancer-associated inflammation, the majority of which consists of innate immune cells, plays an important role in cancer cell plasticity, cancer progression and the development of anticancer drug resistance. Today, with the combined used of advanced technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial molecular imaging analysis, the pathways linking chronic inflammation to cancer have been largely elucidated. In this review article, we highlighted the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in cancer-associated inflammation and its effects on cancer progression and treatment response. We also comprehensively review the mechanisms linking chronic inflammation to cancer in the setting of GI cancers.">

In a murine model of sepsis that recapitulates immune alterations observed in patients, here we demonstrate that PD-L1+CD44+B220LowCD138+IgM+ regulatory plasma cells are induced in spleen and regulate ex vivo proliferation and IFNɣ secretion induced by stimulation of T splenocytes. This effect is mediated both by cell-cell contact through increased PD-L1 expression on plasma cells and by production of a soluble factor. These observations are recapitulated in three cohorts of critically ill patients with bacterial and viral sepsis in association with increased mortality. Our findings thus reveal the function of regulatory plasma cells in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced immune alterations, and present a potential therapeutic target for improving immune cell function impaired by sepsis.">

These specialized fibroblasts have been identified across various tissues and diseases, where they play context-dependent roles, either amplifying immune dysregulation or contributing to immune homeostasis. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the origins, activation, and functions of antigen-presenting fibroblasts.

        <tr id="Detecting antigen-specific lymphocytes is crucial for immune monitoring in the setting of vaccination, infectious disease, cancer, and autoimmunity. However, their low frequency and dispersed distribution across lymphoid organs, peripheral tissues, and blood pose challenges for reliable detection. To address this issue, we developed a strategy exploiting the functions of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) to concentrate target circulating immune cells in the skin and then sample these cells non-invasively using a microneedle (MN) skin patch. TRMs were first induced at a selected skin site through initial sensitization with a selected antigen. Subsequently, these TRMs were restimulated by intradermal inoculation of a small quantity of the same antigen to trigger the alarm and immune recruitment functions of these cells, leading to accumulation of antigen-specific T cells from the circulation over several days. In mouse models of vaccination, we show that application of MN patches coated with an optimized hydrogel layer for cell and fluid sampling to this skin site allowed effective isolation of thousands of live antigen-specific lymphocytes as well as innate immune cells. In a human subject with allergic contact dermatitis, stimulation of TRMs with allergen followed by MN patch application allowed the recovery of diverse lymphocyte populations that were absent from untreated skin sites. These results suggest that TRM restimulation coupled with microneedle patch sampling can be used to obtain a window into both local and systemic antigen-specific immune cell populations in a noninvasive manner that could be readily applied to a wide range of disease or vaccination settings.">

Aging diminishes naive T cells, reducing potential diversity and leading to lymph node contraction. Here, we revealed that this decline occurs earlier in males, resulting in significant sex differences in immunity during middle age. Earlier in life, naive CD8 T cells in males become virtual memory cells prone to premature senescence. Due to androgen-driven thymic atrophy in males, naïve CD8 T cells are insufficiently replenished. Therapeutic thymus rejuvenation via testosterone ablation restored naive CD8 T cells in lymph nodes of middle-aged male mice, leading to enhanced tumor recognition. These findings show the crucial role of sex and age on lymph node T cell repertoires and suggest potential strategies to restore immune function in males during aging.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial disease involving genetic and environmental factors, including viral infection. We investigated the impact of interferon alpha (IFN-α), a cytokine produced during the immune response to viral infection or the presence of un-edited endogenous double-stranded RNAs, on human β-cell physiology. Intravital microscopy on transplanted human islets using a β-cell-selective reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosensor (RIP1-GRX1-roGFP2), revealed a subset of human β-cells that acutely produce ROS in response to IFN-α. Comparison to Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP) phenotypic data revealed that healthier donors had more ROS accumulating cells. In vitro IFN-α treatment of human islets similarly elicited a heterogenous increase in superoxide production that originated in the mitochondria. To determine the unique molecular signature predisposing cells to IFN-α stimulated ROS production, we flow sorted human islets treated with IFN-α. RNA sequencing identified genes involved in inflammatory and immune response in the ROS-producing cells. Comparison with single cell RNA-Seq datasets available through the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP) showed that genes upregulated in ROS-producing cells are enriched in control β-cells rather than T1D donors. Combined, these data suggest that IFN-α stimulates mitochondrial ROS production in healthy human β-cells, potentially predicting a more efficient antiviral response.">

The adaptive immunity needs specific lymph organs such as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which are highly correlated with improved survival outcomes in many cancers. In recent years, with increasing attention on the TLS in tumor microenvironment, TLSs have emerged as a novel target for anti-tumor therapy. Excitingly, studies have shown the contribution of TLSs to the adaptive immune responses. However, it is unclear how TLSs to form and how to more effectively defense against tumor through TLS formation. Recent studies have shown that the inflammation plays a critical role in TLS formation. Interestingly, studies have also found that gut microbiota can regulate the occurrence and development of inflammation. Therefore, we here summarize the potential effects of gut microbiota- mediated inflammation or immunosuppression on the TLS formation in tumor environments. Meanwhile, this review also explores how to manipulate mature TLS formation through regulating gut microbiota/metabolites or gut microbiota associated signal pathways for anti-tumor immunity, which potentially lead to a next-generation cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Colon cancer (CC) remains a primary contributor to cancer-related fatalities worldwide, driven by difficulties in early diagnosis and constrained therapeutic options. Recent studies underscore the importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME), notably tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in fostering malignancy progression and therapy resistance. Through their inherent plasticity, TAMs facilitate immunosuppression, angiogenic processes, metastatic spread, and drug tolerance. In contrast to M1 macrophages, which promote inflammatory and tumoricidal responses, M2 macrophages support tumor expansion and dissemination by exerting immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic influences. Consequently, manipulating TAMs has emerged as a potential avenue to enhance treatment effectiveness. This review outlines the origins, polarization states, and functions of TAMs in CC, highlights their role in driving tumor advancement, and surveys ongoing efforts to target these cells for better patient outcomes. Emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating TAM functions - including depletion strategies, reprogramming approaches that shift M2-polarized TAMs toward an M1 phenotype, and inhibition of key signaling pathways sustaining TAM-mediated immunosuppression-are currently under active investigation. These approaches hold promise in overcoming TAM - induced resistance and improving immunotherapeutic efficacy in CC.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In the tumor microenvironment (TME), hypoxia stands as a significant factor that modulates immune responses, especially those driven by T cells. As T cell-based therapies often fail to work in solid tumors, this study aims to investigate the effects of hypoxia on T cell topo-distribution in the TME, gene expression association with T cell states, and clinical responses in melanoma.


METHODS
To generate detailed information on tumor oxygenation and T cell accessibility, we used mathematical modeling of human melanoma tissue microarrays that incorporate oxygen supply from vessels, intratumoral diffusion, and cellular uptake. We created tumor maps and derived plots showing the fraction of CD4 and CD8 T cells against the distance to the nearest vessel and oxygen pressure. To assess their function and transcriptional changes caused by hypoxia, effector T cells were generated and cultured under hypoxia (0.5% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen). The T cell hypoxia-transcriptional signature was compared against datasets from msigDB, iATLAS (clinical trials of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)), ORIEN AVATAR (real-world melanoma patients treated with ICIs), and a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.


RESULTS
We made three specific observations: (1) in melanoma T cells preferentially accumulated in oxygenated areas close to blood vessels (50-100 µm from the vasculature in the regions of high oxygen availability) but not in hypoxic areas far from blood vessels. (2) Our analysis confirmed that under hypoxia, T cell functions were significantly reduced compared with normoxic conditions and accompanied by a unique gene signature. Furthermore, this hypoxic gene signature was prevalent in resting and non-activated T cells. Notably and clinically relevant, the hypoxic T cell gene set was found to correlate with reduced overall survival and reduced progression-free survival in melanoma patients, which was more pronounced in non-responder patients undergoing ICI therapy. (3) Finally, compared with a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating T cells, our hypoxia signature aligned with a population of cells at a state termed stress response state (TSTR).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study highlights the critical role of hypoxia in shaping T cell distribution and its correlation with clinical outcomes in melanoma. We revealed a preferential accumulation of T cells in oxygenated areas. Moreover, hypoxic T cells develop a distinct hypoxic gene signature prevalent in resting, non-activated T cells and TSTR that was also associated with poorer outcomes, particularly pronounced among non-responders to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that detect pathogenic and damage-associated molecular patterns, activating caspase-1, pyroptosis, and the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18Within the tumor microenvironment, inflammasomes like NLRP3 play critical roles in cancer initiation, promotion, and progression. Their activation influences the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity by modulating immune cell recruitment, cytokine secretion, and T-cell differentiation. While inflammasomes can contribute to tumor growth and metastasis through chronic inflammation, their components also present novel therapeutic targets. Several inhibitors targeting inflammasome components- such as sensor proteins (e.g., NLRP3, AIM2), adaptor proteins (e.g., ASC), caspase-1, and downstream cytokines- are being explored to modulate inflammasome activity. These therapeutic strategies aim to modulate inflammasome activity to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve clinical outcomes. Understanding the role of inflammasomes in cancer immunity is crucial for developing interventions that effectively bridge innate and adaptive immune responses for better therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can address an unmet clinical need for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but its effect is often modest in the setting of high tumor burden. In this study, we postulated that strategies to lower the AML apoptotic threshold will augment T cell killing of AML cells. BH3 mimetics, such as venetoclax, are a clinically approved class of compounds that predispose cells to intrinsic apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins. We explored the anti-leukemic efficacy of BH3 mimetics combined with WT1-specific CD8+ T cells on AML cell lines and primary samples from patients with a diverse array of disease characteristics to evaluate if lowering the cellular apoptotic threshold via inhibition of anti-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins can increase leukemic cell sensitivity to T cell therapy. We found that the combination approach of BH3 mimetic and CD8+ T cells led to significantly increased killing of established AML lines as well as of adverse-risk primary AML leukemic blast cells. In contrast to the hypothesis that enhanced killing would be due to combined activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, our data suggests that CTL-mediated killing of AML cells was accomplished primarily through activation of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This highly effective combinatorial activity due to convergence on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was conserved across multiple AML cell lines and primary samples, suggesting that mitochondrial priming may represent a novel mechanism of optimizing adoptive cell therapy for AML patients.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has made significant advancements over the past few decades, with immune checkpoint and cytokine-based drugs being successfully implemented in clinical settings. Nonetheless, the effective and safe clinical application of these therapies is hindered by critical issues, such as severe toxicity to healthy tissues due to on-target off-tumor effects. In this study, we have developed a novel immunogene therapy characterized by high tumor selectivity and safety in vivo, effectively mitigating the off-tumor effects associated with current antibody-based immune checkpoint therapies. We engineered a gene expression vector that is specifically activated by NF-κB activity to co-express artificial microRNAs targeting two key immune checkpoints (PD-L1 and CD47) and cytokine IL-15. This vector is capable of selectively and effectively down regulating the expression of PDL1 and CD47 while over expressing IL-15 just exclusively in cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Through this mechanism, both adaptive and innate immune responses can be simultaneously activated and enhanced via the transfection of this vector. The in vivo administration of this vector via recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) demonstrated significant antitumor activity, high tumor selectivity, and safety in murine models. Consequently, this vector may offer a potential more effective and safer alternative to the current immune checkpoint inhibitors in future clinical applications.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction In type 2 diabetes (T2D), beta cell failure is often associated with islet inflammation driven by the innate immune response, with macrophages playing a significant role. However, the composition and phenotype of lymphoid immune cells in the islets of individuals with T2D have not been extensively studied. This study aims to characterize and compare the presence, phenotype, and frequency of islet-associated lymphocytes—specifically T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells—in patients with T2D and non-diabetic organ donors. Research design and methods Multicolor flow cytometry was employed to detect NK, B, and T cells in dissociated pancreatic islets from 13 T2D and 44 non-diabetic donors. The frequencies and phenotypes of T cell subsets were determined using markers for memory differentiation status and tissue-resident T cells. The frequencies of alpha and beta cells were assessed by flow cytometry, and the insulin secretion level was measured by ELISA. Results In both T2D and non-diabetic islets, CD3(+) T cells were the predominant lymphocytes, mainly central and effector memory phenotypes, with a bias toward CD8(+) T cells expressing canonical residency markers (CD69 and CD103). The frequencies of CD19(+) B cells and CD3(−) CD16(+) CD56(+) NK cells were low in both groups. The proportions of these immune and beta cells were similar between T2D and non-diabetic donors. However, T2D donors had a higher proportion of glucagon-producing alpha cells and significantly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared with non-diabetic individuals. Conclusions In T2D islets, resident CD8(+) T cells with a central memory phenotype dominate the lymphoid immune cell population, similar to non-diabetic donors. These findings provide the first insights into the memory T cell composition in human pancreatic islets in T2D, suggesting that the diabetic condition does not significantly alter the lymphoid landscape of pancreatic islets.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has brought hope for patients with cancer and showed promising results and a high cure rate in various types of hematological malignancies. However, cellular therapy can lead to profound immunodeficiency of the innate and adaptive immune systems, whether at the systemic or at the local cellular immune response, which is a major predisposing risk factor for invasive opportunistic infection, including fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogens. The role of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and their antigen specificity in humans remains largely unknown, but Tregs have been implicated in a wide range of modulating viral and fungal infections. Though there have been many advancements regarding the use of CAR T-cells in treating hematological malignancies, the intricate and homeostatic role of Tregs in influencing therapeutic outcomes and infection risk remains underexplored. Most published literature on this topic focuses on the role of Treg in the immunosuppression necessary for successful CAR T-cell therapy rather than the dual function of Treg in immunosuppression and immune recovery. We intend to bridge this gap with a specific focus on the contribution of Tregs in the modulation of CAR T-cell efficacy and their role in opportunistic infections after therapy. In this review, we described the potential role and dynamics of Tregs following CAR T-cell therapy, offering an expanded understanding of their impact on patient outcomes and highlighting areas for future research.">

        <tr id="Tumor-specific CD8+ T cells play a pivotal role in anti-tumor immunity. Here, we review the heterogeneity of CD8+ T cell subsets during tumor progression. While both acute and chronic viral infections induce distinct CD8+ T cell responses, chronic responses are also observed during tumor development. Chronic immune responses have traditionally been considered to represent a dysfunctional state of CD8+ T cells, whereas the identification of TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells has highlighted their importance in anti-tumor immunity. During tumor progression, TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells differentiate into cytotoxic Tim-3+ terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells through mechanisms that remain largely unknown. We recently identified CD69 as an important regulator of chronic CD8+ T cell responses and showed that blocking CD69 function, either through the administration of anti-CD69 antibody (Ab) or genetic knockout, enhanced the generation of cytotoxic Tim-3+ terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells in both tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) and the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby enhancing the anti-tumor immune response. These findings suggest that CD69 is an attractive therapeutic target that controls the chronic anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cell therapy has emerged as a promising alternative to CAR T cell therapy, offering significant advantages in terms of safety and versatility. Here we explore the current clinical landscape of CAR NK cells, and their application in hematologic malignancies and solid cancers, as well as their potential for treating autoimmune disorders. Our analysis draws from data collected from 120 clinical trials focused on CAR NK cells, and presents insights into the demographics and characteristics of these studies. We further outline the specific targets and diseases under investigation, along with the major cell sources, genetic modifications, combination strategies, preconditioning- and dosing regimens, and manufacturing strategies being utilized. Initial results from 16 of these clinical trials demonstrate promising efficacy of CAR NK cells, particularly in B cell malignancies, where response rates are comparable to those seen with CAR T cells but with lower rates of severe adverse effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). However, challenges remain in solid tumor applications, where only modest efficacy has been observed to date. Our analysis reveals that research is increasingly focused on enhancing CAR NK cell persistence, broadening their therapeutic targets, and refining manufacturing processes to improve accessibility and scalability. With recent advancements in NK cell engineering and their increased clinical applications, CAR NK cells are predicted to become an integral component of next-generation immunotherapies, not only for cancer but potentially for immune-mediated diseases as well.

        <tr id="Purpose The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is often dysfunctional and complex, contributing to tumor metastasis and drug resistance. This study investigates the use of mRNA-based cancer agents as promising tools to combat and reverse refractory TIME conditions. Methods We optimized and engineered an mRNA cancer agent encoding double tandemly repeated sequences of the T cell costimulator Oxford 40 ligand (diOX40L). The diOX40L mRNAs were encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for effective delivery. The research explored its safety and antitumor effects through a series of in vivo and in vivo experiments. Results Our results demonstrate that diOX40L mRNAs efficiently express increased levels of OX40L proteins. The optimized diOX40L mRNA cancer agent generated potent immune costimulatory signals within the TIME, leading to decreased tumor growth and improved survival compared to the original sequence agent. OX40L expression in subcutaneous tumors promoted CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation, resulting in heightened IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion and robust immune responses. Combination therapy involving PD-1 antibodies and diOX40L substantially enhanced antitumor efficacy, with increased infiltration of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Discussion In conclusion, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of the optimized diOX40L mRNA cancer agent in cancer treatment and its potential as an innovative alternative to protein-based therapies. The study underscores the significance of mRNA-based agents in modulating the immune microenvironment and enhancing antitumor responses.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), are often chronic with no cures. An underlying commonality of autoimmune diseases is immune-mediated inflammation. Control of inflammation is achieved by steroids and disease-modifying therapies, which can result in severe side-effects. CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Treg), are essential to controlling autoimmune responses and are considered a strong therapeutic target with minimal side effects. To that end, we leveraged our identification of B cell IgD low (BDL) B cells that control Treg homeostatic levels in the mouse spleen in a GITRL-dependent manner to demonstrate that overexpression of GITRL by BDL using a B cell-specific GITRL transgene (tg) was sufficient to increase endogenous Treg numbers and attenuate the disease severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model of MS. To determine whether increased GITRL expression by BDL could be a therapeutic strategy, WT mice were transplanted with bone marrow from GITRLtg mice. After reconstitution, GITRL expression was increased on BDL, Treg numbers were significantly elevated, and EAE was dramatically attenuated. These cumulative data further demonstrate that GITRL is a functional receptor on BDL and its overexpression in B cells is a therapeutic strategy to increase endogenous Treg numbers for treating autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="Introduction. Immune memory is a tool of the adaptive immune system that allows it responding quickly and effectively to repeated contact with an antigen. The role of memory cell populations in the recurrence and progression of immune-dependent diseases is shown. 
Aim. To determine the trend in memory T-cell populations depending on the effectiveness of biological therapy (BT) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis (PS). 
Materials and methods. Four hundred fifty children with immunosuppressive diseases (ISD) were examined during different periods of administration of biological drugs: IBD — 162 children (infliximab /adalimumab), MS — 116 children (interferon β1α — IFNβ1α), PS — 172 children (adalimumab). The effectiveness of BT was assessed using clinical activity indices and functional methods. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry to determine populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell: central (TCM), effector (TEM), and terminally differentiated (TEMRA). Statistical data processing was carried out in the Statistica 16.0 program, using the Mann–Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation analysis (p < 0.05). In the SPSS version 25 software, ROC analysis was performed in the efficiency–inefficiency separation model. 
Results. In all forms of pathology, changes in the content of memory T-cells have been established depending on the activity of inflammation. In IBD and PS patients, with an increase in the indices of disease activity, a decrease in the levels of CD4+ naive T-cells (TNAIVE) and an increase of TCM were detected. In MS patients with active foci, an MRI scan showed a decrease in the percentage of naive CD8+ T-cells (TcytNAIVE) and an increase in the population of CD8+ TEM. The content of TNAIVE populations decreased with age, and memory T-cells increased in patients with all the studied forms of pathology. In patients with BT efficacy, a high content of TNAIVE populations and a low content of TCM were found compared with the levels in patients with insufficient BT efficacy. Thresholds have been determined for IBD, MS, and PS patients, which make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT. An increase in the levels of TNAIVE and TcytNAIVE makes it possible to predict the presence of a BT effect, an increase in the levels of TCM, CD4+ TEM, and CD8+ ТEMRA make it possible to predict the absence or insufficient effect of BT. 
Conclusion. The activity of the inflammatory process is reflected in the differentiation of populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells. With the effectiveness of BT, the number of TNAIVE increases with a decrease in the number of TCM and TEM in patients with immune-dependent diseases, regardless of the form of pathology and the drug used. Threshold values for memory T-cells populations make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT.">

        <tr id="South Africa has the highest HIV prevalence globally, often co-occurring with helminth infections in impoverished regions. The coexistence of these infections leads to immunological interactions, potentially enhancing oncogenesis by upregulating immune checkpoint molecules (ICs) among other effects. Notably, most ICs are overexpressed in cancer and correlated with its progression. Helminth infections trigger Th2-type immunity, increasing immunosuppressive M2 macrophages, regulatory T cells, and associated IC molecules. PD-L2 is reported to contribute to Th2-type immunity induced by helminth infections. Similarly, TIM-3, elevated during chronic viral infections, induces a similar immunosuppressive profile. CTLA-4 and PD-1 impact T-cell function by interacting with CD28, crucial for T-cell function. CD28 is downregulated in chronic infections and cancer. This study investigated the impact of HIV-helminth co-infection on co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecule profiles associated with antitumor immunity. Using 78 serum samples collected from March 2020 to May 2021, participants were categorized into uninfected control (no HIV and helminth infections), HIV-infected, helminth-infected, and HIV-helminth co-infected groups. Multiplex immune regulatory molecule assay analysis was conducted. The data were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis and adjusted for confounders (age, gender, BMI, ART, supplements, and other chronic diseases). The uninfected control group was used as the baseline reference group for analysis. HIV-infected individuals had higher PD-1 (adjusted β = 0.12, p = 0.034) and TIM-3 (adjusted β = 23.15, p = 0.052) levels, with the latter showing a trend toward significance. However, lower CD28 levels (adjusted β = −651.95, p = 0.010) were observed. Helminth-infected individuals had higher TIM-3 levels (adjusted β = 20.98, p = 0.020). The co-infected group had higher PD-1 (unadjusted β = 0.18, p = 0.0046) and PD-L2 (adjusted β = 7.95, p = 0.033) levels. A significant decrease in CD28 profile was observed across all infected groups: HIV-infected (adjusted β = −651.95, p = 0.010), helminth-infected (adjusted β = −674.32, p = 0.001), and co-infected (adjusted β = −671.55, p = 0.044). The results suggest that HIV-helminth co-infections alter immune checkpoint markers, potentially increasing cancer risk by promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment that hinders anti-cancer immunity. CD28’s downregulation underscores immune inefficiency in chronic diseases. Addressing these co-infections is crucial for improving HIV care and potentially reducing cancer risks through targeted strategies.">

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone cancer. 30-40% of all OS patients develop tumor recurrence, almost exclusively in the form of lung metastasis, which is associated with a dismal 20% 5-year survival rate. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are a critical cell type within the lung TME, which promote immune suppression, drug resistance, and tumor cell survival. Prior work shows tumor cells can co-opt fibroblasts to a pro-tumorigenic phenotype via exosome mediated intercellular communication. Currently, the mechanisms by which OS exosomes modulate resident lung fibroblast function has not been evaluated. To investigate this, we isolated exosomes from a panel of 6 OS cell lines. We assessed the uptake and response of human donor-derived primary lung fibroblasts (LF's; n=4) to OS exosome treatment in vitro via flow cytometry, confocal fluorescent microscopy, proliferation assays, phospho-kinase array, multiplex cytokine analysis and RNA-sequencing. We observed that LFs efficiently take up OS exosomes, which is associated with induction of MAPK pathway activation, fibroblast proliferation and significantly enhanced secretion of IL-6, CXCL8 and CCL2 compared to untreated LFs. RNA-seq of exosome treated LFs confirmed these responses and revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to cytokine secretion, proliferation, immune cell chemotaxis, migration, proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators. Finally, in an exosome-educated lung fibroblast-OS co-culture model, exosome educated LFs conferred significantly increased OS cell survival and proliferation as compared to untreated fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest OS-derived exosomes can induce a hallmark, CAF-like inflammatory phenotype in lung fibroblasts providing valuable insights into mechanisms that may promote recurrent OS lung metastasis.">

        <tr id="In the initial phase of infections, prior to the development of the follicular antibody response, an extrafollicular B cell response develops in lymphoid organs, with activation of cells displaying B cell receptors with low affinity to the different epitopes of the invading pathogen. To evaluate if this response allows early protection in the murine host, we investigated its role during infection with Sylvio X10/4 (a low virulence Trypanosoma cruzi parasite) of CD28KO mice, a mouse strain that does not develop a follicular antibody response, in parallel with infected C57BL/6 mice (used as control). We observed that T. cruzi infection allowed CD28KO mice to survive for a long period of time, ranging from a few weeks to almost a year. However, the CD28KO mice showed higher levels of subpatent parasitemia than C57BL/6 mice, as well as more intense and long-lasting inflammatory infiltrates in the heart. Following the CD28KO mice throughout the infection, we found a significant reduction in the number of CD8+ T cells in the spleen, but not CD4+ T cells, as well as a strong fluctuation in the number of B cells. Meanwhile, although the production of IFN-γ in the spleen was not affected by CD28 deficiency, a reduction in IL-2 production was observed in anti-CD3 stimulated CD4+ T cells from infected CD28KO mice. Regarding the humoral response, after confirming that the T follicular helper (TFH) cells and germinal center B cells (GC-B) were absent in the infected CD28KO mice, we demonstrated that the extrafollicular antibodies, present in CD28KO infected mice, allowed an early protection in the murine host, since the transfer of serum from chronic CD28KO mice to naïve CD28KO mice, which were infected with T. cruzi 24 hours later, promoted a significant reduction in parasitemia. These results demonstrate that low-affinity anti-T cruzi extrafollicular antibodies contribute to the control of circulating parasites, allowing Sylvio X10/4-infected CD28KO mice to survive for a long time.

Upregulation of LILRB2 in tumors is significantly associated with a poorer tumor phenotype, increased tolerance to certain therapeutic drugs, tumor immune escape and shorter patient overall survival time. Therefore, LILRB2 can be utilized as a novel biomarker to predict the prognosis of patients with solid malignant tumors, and targeting LILRB2 may be an effective strategy for targeted cancer therapy.

        <tr id="Metabolic reprogramming within the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in driving drug resistance in gastrointestinal cancers (GI), particularly through the pathways of fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis. Cancer cells often rewire their metabolism to sustain growth and reshape the TME, creating conditions such as nutrient depletion, hypoxia, and acidity that impair antitumor immune responses. Immune cells within the TME also undergo metabolic alterations, frequently adopting immunosuppressive phenotypes that promote tumor progression and reduce the efficacy of therapies. The competition for essential nutrients, particularly glucose, between cancer and immune cells compromises the antitumor functions of effector immune cells, such as T cells. Additionally, metabolic by-products like lactate and kynurenine further suppress immune activity and promote immunosuppressive populations, including regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages. Targeting metabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis presents new opportunities to overcome drug resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes in GI cancers. Modulating these key pathways has the potential to reinvigorate exhausted immune cells, shift immunosuppressive cells toward antitumor phenotypes, and enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies and other treatments. Future strategies will require continued research into TME metabolism, the development of novel metabolic inhibitors, and clinical trials evaluating combination therapies. Identifying and validating metabolic biomarkers will also be crucial for patient stratification and treatment monitoring. Insights into metabolic reprogramming in GI cancers may have broader implications across multiple cancer types, offering new avenues for improving cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="TRIMELVax is an innovative immunotherapeutic vaccine for malignant melanoma, which combines heat shock-conditioned human melanoma cell lysates with a mollusk hemocyanin as an adjuvant. Preclinical studies demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing tumor growth and improving survival in mice with melanoma and colorectal tumors. However, the precise immunological mechanisms behind its anti-tumor effects have remained unclear. We focused on understanding how TRIMELVax induces inflammation at the injection site, recruits innate immune cells, triggers DC migration to draining lymph nodes, and affects tumor microenvironment and growth. To achieve this, C57BL/6 mice were injected in the footpad with TRIMELVax, PBS, or control vaccines, and then the skin and the popliteal lymph node were harvested for qPCR or FACS analysis. Results showed that TRIMELVax rapidly induced a specific pattern of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a differential acute innate immune response in the injection site. Neutrophils, type 1 macrophages, monocytes, cDC1, Langerhans cells, and monocyte derived-DCs were recruited to the footpad, while type 2 macrophages decreased. This early inflammation facilitated a superior migration of cDC1 and a new subtype of antigen-presenting neutrophils to the draining lymph node compared to controls. Depleting neutrophils before vaccination reduced DC migration, especially cDC1, to the draining lymph node and suppressed TRIMELVax's ability to control tumor growth, demonstrating that vaccine-induced neutrophils play a fundamental role in TRIMELVax's mechanism of action. At the tumor microenvironment level, it was observed that TRIMELVax induces a more intense infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes than controls, with a low level of exhaustiveness and greater cytotoxic capacity. A phase I clinical trial in twenty nivolumab-refractory patients showed that TRIMELVax is well tolerated with no grade 3-5 side effects and induces a Delayed-Type hypersensitivity reaction against melanoma antigens after four doses of the vaccine with an impact on disease stability and patient survival. In summary, TRIMELVax triggers a rapid and potent activation of the innate immune system, which seems crucial for a more effective adaptive immune response against aggressive melanoma tumors. These results underscore the promise of TRIMELVax as a potential immunotherapeutic approach for melanoma treatment.">

        <tr id="Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is broadly produced by various cell types, particularly immune cells, and functions as a key modulator of innate and adaptive immunity. Increasing evidence has linked MIF to the pathogenesis of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We previously showed that the global deletion of Mif in the TCL1 transgenic mouse model for CLL significantly delayed disease development leading to longer overall survival of the knockout mice. In this study, we demonstrated that adaptive transfer of murine CLL cells failed to establish disease in Mif-deficient recipients due to impaired homing of leukemic cells into the spleens, indicating that host-derived Mif is essential for leukemic infiltration and expansion. To identify the most relevant source of Mif in CLL, we generated two CLL mouse strains with B-lymphoid- or myeloid-lineage-specific Mif deletion. In contrast to the global Mif knockout, neither conditional Mif knockout significantly altered CLL progression, illustrating that the cellular source of Mif is less critical than its systemic presence in the tissue environment. Taken together, these in vivo findings indicate that MIF plays a relevant role in CLL pathogenesis, acting independently of its specific cellular origin. Highlights CLL cells failed to establish disease in Mif-deficient hosts due to impaired tissue homing Conditional deletion of Mif in B lymphoid- or myeloid cells did not significantly impact CLL progression in vivo Systemic MIF is critical for CLL pathogenesis, independent of its cellular source">

        <tr id="Gliomas are incurable malignancies notable for having an immunosuppressive microenvironment with abundant myeloid cells, the immunomodulatory phenotypes of which remain poorly defined1. Here we systematically investigate these phenotypes by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility, spatial transcriptomics and glioma organoid explant systems. We discovered four immunomodulatory expression programs: microglial inflammatory and scavenger immunosuppressive programs, which are both unique to primary brain tumours, and systemic inflammatory and complement immunosuppressive programs, which are also expressed by non-brain tumours. The programs are not contingent on myeloid cell type, developmental origin or tumour mutational state, but instead are driven by microenvironmental cues, including tumour hypoxia, interleukin-1β, TGFβ and standard-of-care dexamethasone treatment. Their relative expression can predict immunotherapy response and overall survival. By associating the respective programs with mediating genomic elements, transcription factors and signalling pathways, we uncover strategies for manipulating myeloid-cell phenotypes. Our study provides a framework to understand immunomodulation by myeloid cells in glioma and a foundation for the development of more-effective immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="The battle against cancer has evolved over centuries, from the early stages of surgical resection to contemporary treatments including chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies. Despite significant advances in cancer treatment over recent decades, these therapies remain limited by various challenges. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a cornerstone of tumor immunotherapy, have emerged as one of the most promising advancements in cancer treatment. Although ICIs, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, have demonstrated clinical efficacy, their therapeutic impact remains suboptimal due to patient-specific variability and tumor immune resistance. Cell death is a fundamental process for maintaining tissue homeostasis and function. Recent research highlights that the combination of induced regulatory cell death (RCD) and ICIs can substantially enhance anti-tumor responses across multiple cancer types. In cells exhibiting high levels of recombinant solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) protein, glucose deprivation triggers a programmed cell death (PCD) pathway characterized by disulfide bond formation and REDOX (reduction-oxidation) reactions, termed “disulfidptosis.” Studies suggest that disulfidptosis plays a critical role in the therapeutic efficacy of SLC7A11high cancers. Therefore, to investigate the potential synergy between disulfidptosis and ICIs, this study will explore the mechanisms of both processes in tumor progression, with the goal of enhancing the anti-tumor immune response of ICIs by targeting the intracellular disulfidptosis pathway.">

While the prior represents about 5% of all CRCs, the latter represent 95% and are characterized by low immunogenicity. This study investigates bis-diethyldithiocarbamate (CuET), a novel anticancer compound, and its impact on the colorectal cancer tumor microenvironment (TME). CuET is shown to convert immunologically inactive tumors into hotbeds of antitumor immune responses, marked by increased lymphocyte infiltration, heightened cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) and T cells, and enhanced non-self recognition by lymphocytes. The potent anticancer cytotoxicity and in vivo safety and efficacy of CuET are established. In summary, CuET transforms the colorectal cancer TME, bolstering NK and T cell cytotoxicity and refining tumor cell recognition through non-classical activation via the NKG2D/NKG2DL axis. This study unveils a novel mechanism of action for CuET: a potent immunomodulator capable of turning cold tumors hot.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) cross-present tumor antigens to cognate T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs). ICAM-1 is a key adhesion molecule involved in the formation of diverse cell-cell contacts between immune cells as well as blood vessels and stromal cells. We have recently found that ICAM-1 expressed by lymph node DCs can stabilize antigen-dependent contacts with naïve CD8 T cells but is dispensable for CD8 T cell differentiation and proliferation into effector and memory lymphocytes generated in various models of vaccination and virus infections. To follow the role of DC ICAM-1 in CD8 proliferation and differentiation triggered by tumor expressed neoantigens, we orthotopically implanted breast cancer E0771 cells expressing the model OVA neoantigen in immunocompetent mice conditionally deleted of ICAM-1 expression in all CD11c expressing -conventional  DCs (cDCs), monocyte derived DCs (mDCs) and pDCs. Strikingly, in contrast to viral challenges, the tumor challenge drove naïve tumor-antigen specific CD8 differentiation almost exclusively into T-stem-like central memory T cells (TSL) with high expression of L-selectin (CD62L), PD-1, and the transcription factor TCF-1 implicated in T cell stemness and proliferative potential. Early CD8 activation and differentiation into these central memory T cells remained normal in these mice. This indicated that tumor antigen transfer by migratory DCs to lymph node DCs and its initial cross presentation to naïve T cells do not require ICAM-1 expression by all types of DCs. Furthermore, deletion of ICAM-1 selectively in XCR1 conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), specialized in tumor antigen uptake and cross priming of tumor specific T cells in tumor draining lymph nodes, did not impair early tumor specific CD8 activation and differentiation. Nevertheless, the maintenance of resident self-renewing stem-like tumor specific CD8 memory cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes was diminished in the absence of ICAM-1 expression by cDC1. We currently explore the possibility that ICAM-1 deficiency in these DCs impairs the stability of survival niches generated by Ag-specific CD8 TSL and cDC1. Our results highlight a specialized instructive role of cDC1 ICAM-1 in antigen dependent maintenance of a pool of lymph node stem-like tumor-specific lymphocytes. This pool is a main source of tumor specific CD8 T cells which egress the draining lymph nodes and home into primary tumors, where they differentiate into short-lived terminally differentiated effector T cells (CTLs) critical for tumor eradication.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background There is a need for noninvasive immunological biomarkers that can identify stable kidney allograft immune quiescence to inform individualized immunosuppression. Methods We conducted a cross‐sectional, pilot cohort study evaluating the relative abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to effector T‐cell (Teff) populations as a surrogate marker of long‐term graft tolerance. We obtained fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients, most with recent surveillance biopsies to identify the presence or absence of chronic inflammation. Tregs were sub‐phenotyped as naïve, memory, and activated Tregs (aTreg). Treg/Teff ratios were modeled for association with chronic inflammation and in the context of potential clinical features. Results Twenty‐seven patient samples were included on standard immunosuppression (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) with a mean age of 9.2 ± 5.0 years, at 30.2 ± 21.7 months posttransplant. The ratio of aTreg (FOXP3++CD45RA−) to Th17 cells (CD4+IL‐17+) was significantly greater in patients without inflammation than in patients with graft inflammation (p < 0.01). Similarly, there was a trend toward greater aTreg/CD4+ T cells and aTreg/CD8+ Teff in patients without inflammation (p = 0.05 and 0.09, respectively). There was no significant association for inflammation with naïve or memory Treg/Teff ratios. Multiple logistic regression with all three aTreg/Teff ratios modeled allograft inflammation with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–0.98). Conclusions The proportion of peripheral blood aTregs/Teff cells in this pilot cohort of stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients was associated with immune quiescence. These data support further investigation into aTreg/Teff monitoring to inform precision immunosuppressive treatment.">

        <tr id="Tumors employ a range of strategies to evade detection and eradication by the host’s immune system. These include downregulating antigen expression, altering antigen presentation processes, and inhibiting immune checkpoint pathways. etc. Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) represents a strategy that boosts anti-tumor immunity. This is achieved by amplifying or genetically engineering immune cells, which are either sourced from the patient or a donor, in a laboratory setting. Subsequently, these cells are reintroduced into the patient to bolster their immune response against cancer. ACT has successfully restored anti-tumor immune responses by amplifying the activity of T cells from patients or donors. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying tumor escape, including alterations in tumor cell antigens, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and modulation of immune checkpoint pathways. It further explores how ACT can avddress these factors to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, the review discusses the application of gene-editing technologies (such as CRISPR) in ACT, highlighting their potential to strengthen the anti-tumor capabilities of T cells. Looking forward, the personalized design of ACT, combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, is expected to significantly improve treatment outcomes, positioning this approach as a key strategy in the field of cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Intra-tumoral bacteria are pivotal in the initiation and progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), exerting a significant influence on tumor cell biology, immune responses, and the tumor microenvironment (TME). Different types and distribution of bacteria threaten the balance of metabolism and the immune environment of tumor cells. Taking advantage of this disrupted homeostasis, intra-tumoral bacteria stimulate the secretion of metabolites or influence specific immune cell types to produce inflammatory or chemokines, thereby influencing the anti-tumor immune response while regulating the level of inflammation and immunosuppression within the TME. Some intra-tumoral bacteria are used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in clinical practice. Based on the unique characteristics of bacteria, the use of engineered bacteria and outer membrane vesicles for drug delivery and biological intervention is a promising new therapeutic strategy. The presence of intra-tumoral bacteria also makes chemoradiotherapy tolerable, resulting in a poor treatment effect. However, due to the immune-related complexity of intra-tumoral bacteria, there may be unexpected effects in immunotherapy. In this review the patterns of intra-tumoral bacteria involvement in HNSCC are discussed, elucidating the dual roles, while exploring the relevance to anti-tumor immune responses in the clinical context and the prospects and limitations of the use of bacteria in targeted therapy.">

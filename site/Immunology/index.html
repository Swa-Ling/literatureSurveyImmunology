        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Gastrointestinal (GI) B cells and plasma cells (PCs) are critical to mucosal homeostasis and the host response to HIV-1 infection. Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Background Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a prevalent condition whose recurrence leads to multiple adverse effects. Previous studies on INS pathogenesis primarily focused on immune dysregulation, particularly T-cell changes and their correlation with cytokine shifts. Accumulating evidence suggests that B-cell dysfunction also plays a role. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and effective treatment strategies remains incomplete. Methods This study investigates changes in gene expressions and cellular interactions of immune cells at a single-cell level using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). And subsequently validated through quantitative PCR (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry. Results We identified seven main clusters using unsupervised clustering of 103,213 high-quality single cells. Through unsupervised clustering, patient-specific T cells (IFI44L + CD4 + T cells) that exhibited a pronounced elevation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is identified. Activation of ISGs and interferon (IFN)-related pathways are also observed in other clusters. Specifically, this study demonstrates that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role by promoting the interaction between B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and receptors on B cells. This interaction triggers the release of autoantibodies, thereby initiating INS pathogenesis. Furthermore, telitacicept has shown efficacy in treating pediatric patients with frequent relapse NS(FRNS). Conclusions Overall, our findings underscore the role of interferon and its related pathways in INS pathogenesis, providing novel therapeutic interventions for NS.

        <tr id="Chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are critical but unresolved drivers of disability accumulation in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Chronic active white matter lesions (CAL), identifiable radiologically as paramagnetic rim lesions (PRL), indicate progression-relevant chronic neuroinflammation. Using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) and T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood immune cells of 34 radiologically characterized adults with MS (17 untreated, 6 treated with B-cell-depletion) and 5 healthy controls. Coupled with proteomics, we found PRL-associated enrichment of interferon (IFN) signaling and upregulation of TCR signaling in CSF and blood. This was accompanied by clonal expansion of CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells, with the highly expanded clonal cells exhibiting T helper type 1 (TH1) and cytotoxic profiles. Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Advanced melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that has spread and cannot be surgically removed. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved survival for some patients by helping the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. However, reliable methods to predict which patients will benefit are still lacking. This study investigated whether analyzing both tumor and blood samples before treatment could help identify patients most likely to benefit from ICIs. By studying gene activity in tumors and immune cell types in the blood, we found that patients with low immune activity in their tumors had poorer outcomes. Conversely, those with higher levels of a specific immune cell type in their blood—PD-1+ effector memory CD4+ T-cell—tended to respond better to treatment. These findings suggest that combining both tumor and blood analysis could support more personalized and effective treatment decisions for patients with advanced melanoma.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant non-cancerous cell type in glioblastoma (GBM) and heavily influence GBM biology, contributing to tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, immune evasion, and neovascularization. Current in vitro models that utilize IL-4/IL-13 stimulation fail to capture the transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of TAMs observed in vivo. In this study, we utilize a serum-free indirect co-culture model with patient-derived xenolines to polarize primary human macrophages and characterize their molecular and functional phenotypes. We demonstrate that xenoline-polarized macrophages diverge from classical M1/M2 states and instead adopt transcriptional signatures reflective of TAM subsets identified from patients. Notably, macrophages polarized with the radiation-therapy selected xenoline, JX14P-RT, exhibited gene expression patterns enriched for interferon response and hypoxia, mirroring recurrent GBM samples. In contrast, JX14P TAMs showed enrichment in phagocytic gene sets. Functional validation of these phenotypes revealed discrepancies between the transcriptionally predicted and observed phenotypes, emphasizing the importance of integrating phenotypic validation in sequencing studies. Altogether, our findings establish xenoline-polarized macrophages as a useful alternative to traditional models that can be used to study immune-interactions in vitro.

        <tr id="Negative regulators of T cell function represent promising targets to enhance the intrinsic antitumor activity of CAR T cells against solid tumors. However, the endogenous immune ecosystem in solid tumors often represents an immunosuppressive therapeutic barrier to CAR T cell therapy, and it is currently unknown whether deletion of negative regulators in CAR T cells reshapes the endogenous immune landscape. To address this knowledge gap, we developed CAR T cells targeting B7-H3 in immune-competent osteosarcoma models and evaluated the intrinsic and extrinsic effects of deleting a potent negative regulator called Regnase-1 (Reg-1). Deletion of Reg-1 not only improved the effector function of B7-H3-CAR T cells but also endowed them with the ability to create a proinflammatory landscape characterized by an influx of IFNγ-producing endogenous T cells and NK cells and a reduction of inhibitory myeloid cells, including M2 macrophages. Thus, deleting negative regulators in CAR T cells enforces a non-cell-autonomous state by creating a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Background Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. The underlying mechanisms of ICANS remain incompletely understood and are unlikely to be explained by cytokine excess alone. Methods We analyzed paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from CAR T cell–treated patients who developed ICANS (n = 11) within 5–21 days post-infusion. ICANS severity was graded as follows: grade 1 (n = 3), grade 2 (n = 4), grade 3 (n = 1), and grade 4 (n = 3). Control samples were obtained from patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, functional neurological disorders, and multiple sclerosis. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry to profile immune cell populations and performed multi-modal spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence on postmortem choroid plexus and brain tissue from a patient with fatal grade 4 ICANS. Results We identified a distinct population of proliferating, cytotoxic T cells characterized by CXCR6 expression, enriched in CD4 + CAR T cells and predominantly localized in ICANS CSF. These CXCR6 + T cells were largely absent from control CSF samples. Spatial mapping of postmortem brain tissue revealed widespread infiltration of myeloid cells and a striking spatial association between CXCR6 + T cells and CXCL16-expressing myeloid cells in both the choroid plexus and brain parenchyma. Notably, CSF levels of CXCL16 positively correlated with ICANS severity across the cohort, from grade 1 to grade 4. Conclusions Our findings implicate the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the recruitment of cytotoxic CAR CD4 + T cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during ICANS. This interaction may be linked to neuroinflammatory processes and severity stratification in ICANS pathogenesis. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for exploring CXCL16/CXCR6 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity.

        <tr id="Although effective for immunologically hot tumors, immune checkpoint inhibitors minimally affect tumors that are not T cell inflamed, including breast cancer. An alternate strategy to combat immune cold breast tumors may be to reeducate innate immunity. This study identifies strategies to skew neutrophils to acquire tumoricidal properties. Systemic Toll-like receptor (TLR)–induced inflammation, concomitant with mitochondrial complex I inhibition in breast tumors, increases neutrophil cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells and independently of CD8+ T cell immunity. These therapy-entrained neutrophils enhance secretory granule production, increasing expression of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase machinery and inducing a respiratory burst. Moreover, systemic administration of TLR agonists elevates nuclear factor κB signaling in neutrophils to increase production of secretory granule and NADPH oxidase machinery components, whereas complex I inhibitors are required to potentiate oxidative damage. In summary, we describe a class of neutrophils, educated by the combined action of inflammatory mediators and metabolic inhibitors, having tumoricidal functions.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and associated receptors remains poorly characterized. We applied a single-cell multi-omics approach (CITE-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy donors, before and after in vitro TNF stimulation. Using integrated analysis of surface protein expression and transcriptomic data, we focused on phenotypic and transcriptional changes in dendritic cell populations. DCs from RA patients exhibited elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, indicative of an inflammatory phenotype, and showed marked responsiveness to TNF. Upon stimulation, RA-derived DCs upregulated genes involved in antigen presentation (CD83, LAMP3), lymph node migration (CCR7, ADAM19), and inflammation (TRAF1, IL24) whereas such activation was absent in healthy controls. Our data reveal a TNF-responsive, pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in dendritic cells from RA patients and underscore the relevance of the TNF receptor profile in shaping DC function. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of RA and identify dendritic cells as potential targets for personalized immunomodulatory therapy.">

        <tr id="CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has significantly advanced the treatment landscape for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL). However, up to 60% of patients do not achieve a complete response. To uncover determinants of therapeutic efficacy, we analyzed the infusion products of eight r/r DLBCL patients with distinct clinical responses to axicabtagene ciloleucel using single-cell transcriptomics. Compared to patients who exhibited progressive disease, infusion products of complete responders demonstrated enriched signatures of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Based on these findings, we developed a novel strategy to improve CD19-directed CAR T-cell treatment efficacy by incorporating IFN-I as an enhancer during the ex vivo manufacturing process. For both CD28- and 4-1BB-costimulated second-generation CARs, we found that low-strength IFN-I signaling enhanced CAR T-cell cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy. On the other hand, high-strength IFN-I signaling compromised cell viability and in vivo efficacy. Our low-strength IFN-I signaling approach leverages an existing FDA-approved pharmacologic agent and is compatible with current CAR constructs and manufacturing workflows. Together, our results establish IFN-I as a potent and costimulation-independent enhancer of CAR T-cell efficacy and provide a translationally feasible approach to enhance CAR T-cell therapies for r/r DLBCL.">

        <tr id="Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory CNS disease with heterogeneous manifestation. Prognostic markers for early classification of MS are currently under investigation. Higher diagnostic resolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has the potential to contribute significantly to patient stratification, which should be especially important for a subgroup of patients with high risk to convert to a progressive disease course. This study aimed to determine whether spectral flow cytometry of CSF cells could identify pathogenic CD4+ T cell subset in MS. Using a two-step approach, we designed a marker panel informed by publicly available transcriptomic datasets from early human MS and our own single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in acute and chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine MS model. Notably, chronic (‘phase’) markers such as Il7r and Ramp3 (associated with memory T cells), Itgb1 (integrin beta-1) and anti-apoptotic genes like Dnaja1, Hsph1 and Jun/AP-1 were enriched in EAE. These markers reflect pro-survival signalling and tissue-residency characteristics, including CXCR6, CD69 and Bhlhe40, which suggest an adaptation of CD4+ T cells towards persistent neuroinflammatory responses in chronic EAE. This phase-specific marker profile highlights CD4+ T cells as both indicators and contributors to disease progression in EAE. Translating these findings to MS datasets, we found an enrichment of phase-specific markers in CSF cells. Spectral flow cytometry in an independent MS cohort revealed distinct memory and effector T cell subsets, indicating unique CSF signatures in MS. This study underscores the heterogeneity and dynamic changes of CD4+ T cells detectable by spectral flow cytometry, enhancing diagnostic resolution of CSF cells and informing more precise therapeutic strategies for MS.">

        <tr id="Neuroinflammation plays a complex and context-dependent role in many neurodegenerative diseases. We identified a key pathogenic function of macrophages in a mouse model of a rare human congenital neuropathy in which SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, is activated by hypomorphic mutations in the axon survival factor NMNAT2. Macrophage depletion blocked and reversed neuropathic phenotypes in this sarmopathy model, revealing SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanisms as key drivers of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic subacute SARM1 activation on the peripheral nerve milieu using single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq). Our analyses reveal an expansion of immune cells (macrophages and T lymphocytes) and repair Schwann cells, as well as significant transcriptional alterations to a wide range of nerve-resident cell types. Notably, endoneurial fibroblasts show increased expression of chemokines (Ccl9, Cxcl5) and complement components (C3, C4b, C6) in response to chronic SARM1 activation, indicating enhanced immune cell recruitment and immune response regulation by non-immune nerve-resident cells. Analysis of CD45+ immune cells in sciatic nerves revealed an expansion of an Il1b+ macrophage subpopulation with increased expression of markers associated with phagocytosis and T cell activation/proliferation. We also found a significant increase in T cells in sarmopathic nerves. Remarkably, T cell depletion rescued motor phenotypes in the sarmopathy model. These findings delineate the significant changes chronic SARM1 activation induces in peripheral nerves and highlights the potential of immunomodulatory therapies for SARM1-dependent peripheral neurodegenerative disease.

        <tr id="Abstract Patients with lymphoma are at increased risk of severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, due to immune suppression. Using multidimensional spectral flow cytometry and serology, we characterized in-depth immune responses in 50 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated lymphoma patients across12 lymphoma subtypes, treated with anti-CD20 antibody (aCD20) ± chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. Compared to healthy control, aCD20±CT-treated patients exhibited distinct immune alterations, including elevated late-stage effector memory (EM3) CD4+, and terminally differentiated (EMRA) CD8+ T cells, reduced circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, and increased dysfunctional DN3 B cells. While B cell depletion was expected with aCD20 therapy, our data reveals broader immune dysregulation beyond B cell loss. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, aCD20±CT treated patients showed impaired vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses. In contrast, CT-only Hodgkin lymphoma patients maintained antibody responses comparable to healthy controls. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in aCD20±CT treated patients displayed fewer regulatory T cells, increased Th1 population, and more EMRA CD8+ T cells, suggesting a compensatory T-cell mediated immunity. Antibody response correlated positively with naïve T cell frequencies and transitional, classical memory, and DN2 B cell subsets. These findings inform the tailored development of vaccine strategies for immunocompromised patients to enhance protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral pathogens.">

        <tr id="Lupus nephritis is recognized as a common and severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus, without an optimal therapeutic strategy currently available. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold therapeutic promise, their efficacy varies substantially, likely due to their plasticity and capacity to adopt pro-inflammatory (MSC1) or anti-inflammatory (MSC2) functional states in response to different microenvironments. Here, we report for the first time that IL-27, via JAK1–STAT1 signaling, up-regulates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in MSCs, driving MSC differentiation toward an IDO-positive MSC2 phenotype with low immunogenicity. These IDO-positive MSC2 cells produce kynurenine and kynurenic acid, the metabolites of tryptophan, which bind to the intracellular aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This interaction stimulates an increase in the anti-inflammatory factor TSG-6 and induces the differentiation of regulatory T cells. Notably, IL-27-conditioned MSC2 demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy compared to conventional MSCs in a murine lupus nephritis model. In conclusion, this study revealed that IL-27 is a critical modulator of MSC immune plasticity and presented a novel therapeutic strategy utilizing IL-27-enhanced MSC2 for autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by multilayered dysregulation of immune cell homeostasis, spanning B cell effector dysfunction, T follicular helper (Tfh) cell hyperactivity, and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) tolerance breakdown. Advances in high-parameter immunophenotyping, single-cell multiomics profiling, and spatial multiomics have redefined SLE pathogenesis, revealing stage-specific immune network perturbations. These discoveries have propelled mechanism-driven therapeutic strategies, including CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy for B cell depletion, disruption of T–B cell synaptic signaling (CD40L inhibitors), and restoration of pDC tolerance (anti-BDCA2 antibodies). While patient heterogeneity poses challenges for universal therapeutic efficacy, emerging strategies integrating molecular endotyping and cellular biomarkers hold promise for overcoming these limitations. By aligning targeted therapies with the immunophenotypic signatures of individual patients, precision medicine approaches are expected to optimize treatment efficacy, minimize off-target effects, and ultimately enhance long-term clinical outcomes in SLE. This review synthesizes current insights into how immune cell perturbations contribute to SLE pathogenesis, modulate disease flares, and determine therapeutic refractoriness, with a critical synthesis of recent clinical trial outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play dual roles in cancer, either promoting or suppressing tumor progression, complicating therapeutic approaches. TAMs include recruited macrophages (recMacs), derived from circulating monocytes, and tissue-resident interstitial macrophages (IMs). We recently identified a heterogeneous population of chemokine-expressing IMs, including subsets that support tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) formation during lung inflammation. Here, we show that IMs can be either pro- or anti-tumorigenic, depending on the subset. Using Pf4ᶜʳᵉCx3cr1ᴰᵀᴿ mice to deplete CD206hi IMs expressing Cxcl13, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10, we demonstrate their essential role in TLS formation, lymphocyte recruitment, and tumor suppression in melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma. In contrast, Ccl2-expressing IMs promote tumor growth by recruiting pro-tumorigenic recMacs. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the distinct localization and chemokine profiles of these subsets. Finally, CCR5 blockade with the FDA-approved inhibitor Maraviroc during neoantigen vaccination improved tumor control by preventing the migration of immunosuppressive, antigen-presenting recMacs (moDCs). These findings support the development of macrophage-targeted therapies by identifying pro-tumorigenic subsets and recMac trafficking as actionable targets, while preserving macrophage populations that sustain anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Gliomas, particularly IDH-wildtype ones, are associated with poor prognosis, yet their immunological landscape remains uncertain. We analyzed RNA sequencing data from 55 glioma patients, estimating immune infiltration with CIBERSORTx and immune cell states via Ecotyper. IDH-wildtype gliomas showed significantly higher immune cell infiltration (p = 0.002), notably of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages, and a greater proportion of exhausted T cells compared to IDH-mutant gliomas. Clustering based on immune profiles revealed two groups. Cluster A, enriched for IDH-wildtype cases, exhibited heightened immune infiltration but also marked immunosuppression. Cluster B, which included both IDH-wildtype and mutant cases, showed lower levels of immune infiltration. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) cultured from IDH-wildtype tumors demonstrated limited expansion following anti-PD-1, a CSF1R inhibitor, or a STAT3 inhibitor treatment, without clear cluster-specific differences. Tumor-reactive TILs were mainly observed in cluster A. These findings highlight that IDH-wildtype gliomas have an immunosuppressive and heterogeneous microenvironment, potentially limiting responses to single-agent immunotherapies. A personalized, multi-targeted approach addressing multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms may be essential to improve immunotherapy outcomes in this aggressive glioma subgroup.">

        <tr id="Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) share features and regulatory pathways with normal stem cells, yet how the stem cell niche contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we identify CXCR4+ macrophages as a niche population enriched in normal mammary ducts, where they promote the regenerative activity of basal cells in response to luminal cell-derived CXCL12. CXCL12 triggers AKT-mediated stabilization of β-catenin, which induces Wnt ligands and pro-migratory genes, enabling intraductal macrophage infiltration and supporting regenerative activity of basal cells. Notably, these same CXCR4+ niche macrophages regulate the tumor-initiating activity of various breast cancer subtypes by enhancing TIC survival and tumor-forming capacity, while promoting early immune evasion through regulatory T cell induction. Furthermore, a CXCR4+ niche macrophage gene signature correlates with poor prognosis in human breast cancer. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in orchestrating interactions between niche macrophages, mammary epithelial cells, and immune cells, thereby establishing a supportive niche for both normal tissue regeneration and mammary tumor initiation.">

        <tr id="Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects various organs and systems, significantly impacting patients’ health and quality of life. Conventional drugs, including glucocorticoids and standard immunosuppressive drugs, may not be enough to achieve a satisfactory therapeutic outcome in some refractory SLE patients. The abnormal phenotype and function of macrophages participate in the development of SLE. The targeted delivery to reprogram macrophage in SLE has been a long-standing challenge. Apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) are essential for intercellular communications. This study aims to explore an effective and targeted treatment to SLE via macrophage reprogramming and Treg differentiation. In this work, we found that M2 macrophages-derived ApoBDs (M2-ApoBDs) could selectively target and localize to the spleen, where they were engulfed by splenic macrophages (phagocytic rate 73.4%). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the efferocytosis of M2-ApoBDs triggered transcriptional changes in M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages within the spleen, subsequently promoting the differentiation of Treg cells in vivo. Immunological experiments revealed that M2-ApoBDs prompted the reprogramming of M2 macrophages in vitro, which subsequently influenced Treg cell differentiation via ligand-receptor interactions. In SLE mice, M2-ApoBDs alleviated the disease progression, including 24-hours urinary protein, plasma creatinine, plasma C3 levels, and glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. These findings show that M2-ApoBDs can targeted-modulate macrophage polarization and Treg immune regulation, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for the effective treatment of SLE.

        <tr id="Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized ectopic lymphoid clusters of immune cells that develop in non-lymphoid tissue to promote antigen presentation, drive cytotoxic immune responses, and enhance humoral immunity via B cell clonal expansion. Their presence within the tumor microenvironment (TME) correlates with increased patient survival and an improved response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), positioning TLS as potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers. Despite the widespread use of ICIs across various cancers, their effectiveness remains limited in gynecological malignancies, including ovarian cancer (OC), a notably challenging disease characterized by poor responses to both single and combination ICI therapies. Interestingly, the infiltration of T cells into the OC TME is linked to enhanced progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), yet an immunosuppressive TME frequently impedes therapeutic efficacy, suggesting cell activity within localized immune niches can impact antitumor immunity. This review explores the roles of TLS, their maturity, functionality, identification, and related gene signatures; specific immune cells and cytokines that play a role in TLS formation and antitumor response; and other modifiable elements, including gut microbiota, that may drive improving OC survival by leveraging a TLS-driven antitumor response to bolster immunotherapy outcomes.">

        <tr id="Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is an effective treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, yet the mechanisms underlying immune reset and sustained remission remain incompletely understood. This study provides a longitudinal immune profiling of patients undergoing AHSCT, with a specific focus on immune reconstitution at two years post-AHSCT.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from 22 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients at baseline and multiple time points post-AHSCT. Immune reconstitution was characterized using high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) and flow cytometry to assess phenotypic changes in B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells.AHSCT led to profound alterations in immune cell populations. B-cell recovery was marked by a rapid expansion of naïve B cells, while memory B cells and plasmablasts remained depleted. Notably, patients with evidence of inflammatory disease activity (EIDA) post-AHSCT exhibited higher pre-transplant frequencies of non-switched IgD+IgM+ memory B cells, raising the possibility of a potential biomarker for treatment response. Myeloid-cell reconstitution showed a decline in classical monocytes and an increase in non-classical monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, potentially shifting the immune balance toward a more tolerogenic state. CD4 T-cell reconstitution demonstrated a shift from central memory (Tcm) to effector memory (Tem) phenotypes, with a selective depletion of polyfunctional Th1/Th17cells lacking PD-1 expression. Clusters enriched for PD-1+ Tem CD4 T cells appeared to differ between patients with and without EIDA. Furthermore, an increase in atypical naïve CCR7⁻CD62L⁻ CD4 T cells was observed in EIDA patients, raising questions about their role in the pathophysiology of MS. CD8 T-cell reconstitution followed a similar pattern, with a shift from a naïve/Tcm-dominant to a Tem-skewed population, albeit with substantial interpatient variability. Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells showed a sustained decrease, possibly reflecting microbiota alterations post-transplant.Taken together, these findings provide an exploratory characterization of immune reconstitution following AHSCT, highlighting candidate biomarkers and mechanisms that warrant validation in larger cohorts to guide patient stratification and monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.">

The TME, comprising tumour cells, immune cells, extracellular matrix, stromal cells, and co-existing microbes, orchestrates the immune phenotype of cancers, shaping disease progression and treatment outcomes. Immune-cell infiltration serves as a significant prognostic marker in various cancers, with higher rates correlating with improved prognosis. Recent discoveries have paved the way for immune checkpoint blockade therapies, which exhibit remarkable efficacy across multiple cancer types. However, understanding the nuanced contributions of different immune-cell populations to therapeutic responses remains a challenge.

        <tr id="The tumor landscape of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is refractory to conventional photon radiotherapy (RT) due to a fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that promotes chronic hypoxia and reduced immune surveillance. The radiobiological factors unique to carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT), such as high linear energy transfer (LET) and less dependence on oxygen, make it well-suited to overcome the PDAC TME. Here, we utilized clonal syngeneic KPC pancreatic tumor cell lines and tumors to examine this postulate and to identify underlying factors that impact the response of PDAC to CIRT. While KPC cell lines exhibited radiobiologic effectiveness (RBE) greater than 3, subcutaneous tumors in the mouse hind leg showed lower RBEs – 1.3 based on quintupling time – at a LET of 75 keV/μm. Four days after CIRT, we observed widespread transcriptomic changes in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME), suggesting increased infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells, elevated expression of anti-tumor T cell cytokines, MHC class I molecules, and co-stimulatory signals. Fewer immunologic changes were observed following photon irradiation. By seven days after CIRT, tumor-supportive transcriptomic programs characterized by pro-tumor cytokines, M2 macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) emerged, promoting resistance and limiting the durability of tumor growth delay. These findings suggest that CIRT may offer a favorable platform compared to conventional photon radiation therapy for combining with immunotherapies. Furthermore, these data highlight the risk of using in vitro survival data alone in treatment planning and indicate that underlying TME factors impact the response of PDAC in vivo.">

        <tr id="Dysregulation of T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cell homeostasis in germinal centers (GCs) can lead to antibody-mediated autoimmunity. While IL-1β modulates the GC response via IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 receptors on follicular T cells in animal models, its role in humans remains unclear. We analyzed Tfh and Tfr phenotypes in human secondary lymphoid organs (tonsils, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes) using flow cytometry, single-cell transcriptomics, and in vitro culture, comparing findings with samples from autoimmune patients. We observed organ-specific Tfh/Tfr phenotypes according to activation status and IL-1 receptor expression. An excess of IL-1R1 over IL-1R2 expression promoted a unique activated Tfr subset with Treg and GC-Tfh features. IL-1β signaling via IL-1R1 enhanced follicular T cell activation and Tfh-to-Tfr differentiation, while IL-1β inhibition upregulated IL-1R1, indicating a tightly regulated process. In autoimmune patients, high IL-1β and circulating Tfr levels correlated with increased autoantibody production, linking inflammation, IL-1β signaling, and Tfr/Tfh balance. Our findings highlight the critical role of IL-1β in follicular T cell activation and suggest that targeting IL-1β signaling in Tfh and Tfr cells could be a promising strategy for treating antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered immune cells, particularly CAR T lymphocytes and CAR natural killer (NK) cells, have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy. However, their therapeutic efficacy and safety can be influenced by the tumor microenvironment, particularly the presence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs are immunomodulatory cells which can alter the function of tumor-infiltrated immune cells in both supportive and suppressive ways. Results obtained in recently conducted experimental studies demonstrate that MSCs modulate proliferation, cytotoxicity, cytokine production and anti-tumor activity in CAR-expressing immune cells in both a juxtacrine and a paracrine manner. While MSCs can enhance CAR cell viability and persistence through trophic support, they may also impair cytotoxic function and promote an immunosuppressive phenotype under certain conditions. Understanding the dualistic nature of MSCs in CAR-based immunotherapy for malignant diseases is critical for optimizing clinical outcomes. Additionally, MSCs may serve as vehicles for targeted delivery of immunomodulatory agents, and should be considered as active components in the design of next-generation CAR-based immunotherapies. Accordingly, in this review article we emphasize molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in MSC-dependent modulation of CAR-expressing immune cells, paving the way for more efficient CAR-based immunotherapy for malignant diseases.">

        <tr id="Background: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) contribute to immune suppression observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MDSCs are immature myeloid cells that are hijacked during development and further reprogrammed by the tumor microenvironment (TME) to harbor immune-suppressive properties and inhibit T-cell functions. Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, including BRD4, are epigenetic modulators that regulate genes implicated in CLL pathogenesis and TME interactions. Previously, we investigated how the novel BET inhibitor OPN-51107 (OPN5) prevents CLL disease expansion, modulates T-cell immune function, and alters gene expression related to MDSCs. In turn, we hypothesize that BET proteins such as BRD4 regulate MDSC functions, and subsequent pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 will alleviate MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL. Methods: Utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model of CLL, we evaluated BRD4 protein expression in MDSCs derived from the bone marrow of transgenic and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. We then investigated the ex vivo functionality of OPN5-treated MDSCs, expanded from Eµ-TCL1 and WT bone marrow in MDSC-supportive medium. Finally, we conducted an in vivo study utilizing the Eµ-TCL1 adoptive transfer mouse model to determine the in vivo effects of OPN5 on MDSCs and other immune populations. Results: Through the course of this study, we found that MDSCs isolated from Eμ-TCL1 mice upregulate BRD4 expression and are more immune-suppressive than their WT counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrated ex vivo OPN5 treatment reverses the immune-suppressive capacity of MDSCs isolated from leukemic mice, evident via enhanced T-cell proliferation and IFNγ production. Finally, we showed in vivo OPN5 treatment slows CLL disease progression and modulates immune cell populations, including MDSCs. Conclusions: Altogether, these data support BET inhibition as a useful therapeutic approach to reverse MDSC-mediated immune suppression in CLL.">

        <tr id="PV001 / #50Poster Topic:AS01 - Adaptive ImmunityJuvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune condition which causes significant morbidity in children and young adults. While many aspects of immune dysfunction have been studied extensively in adult-onset SLE, there is limited and contradictory evidence of how cytotoxic CD8+T cells contribute to disease pathogenesis, and studies exploring cytotoxicity in JSLE are rare.Detailed characterization of peripheral blood CD8+T cells was undertaken in JSLE patients (n=44, median age 22 years and disease duration 9 years) and age/sex-matched healthy controls (HC, n=68, median age 20 years). Multiparameter flow cytometric immunophenotyping, RNA sequencing, serum metabolomic profiling, cell culture assays/functionalin vitrostudies, and mitochondrial morphology studies were performed.Frequencies of CD8+T cells expressing the cytotoxic mediator perforin and effector cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-α were reduced in JSLE vs HC, irrespective of treatment or disease activity. Transcriptomic and serum metabolomic analysis identified that upregulated type I IFN signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disturbances underpinned these observations (see Figure). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that alteration in these pathways lead to a deficiency in effector memory (EM) JSLE CD8+T cells, which are enriched for cytotoxic mediator-expressing cells, due to enhanced apoptosis of these cells selectively in JSLE vs HC.Figure.Transcriptomic analysis reveals upregulation of IFN-α responses and potential metabolic and mitochondrial disturbances in CD8+T cells in JSLE. (a) Volcano plot showing differences in gene expression from RNA sequencing of CD8+ T cells from JSLE (n=26) vs HC (n=29). Blue and red points represent statistically significant differentially expressed genes below the FDR adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05. Blue and red arrows indicate number of statistically significant downregulated and upregulated genes, respectively. (b) Bar plot showing -log10p values and enrichment ratios (ER) of summary enriched pathway GO BP ontology terms in CD8+ T cells in JSLE vs HC using the 147 significantly upregulated and 91 significantly downregulated genes (FDR adjusted p<0.05). Statistical significance of enrichment was determined using a p-value cut-off of 0.01 and a minimum enrichment score of 1.5. Terms highlighted in red and blue represent pathways of potential interest, derived from upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) genes in JSLE vs HC. (c) Word cloud representing all words taken from significantly enriched pathways in Metascape GO enrichment and GSEA analysis of DEGs in CD8+ T cells in JSLE vs HC. Text size indicates the frequency of the word.Cytotoxic capacity of CD8+T cells is diminished in JSLE due to a numerical deficiency in EM CD8+T cells, which is linked to mitochondrial defects, dysregulated type I IFN signaling, and increased apoptosis. Future studies are needed to understand the therapeutic implications of these findings.">

        <tr id="Background Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits low response rates to immunotherapies, with only about 15–25% of patients responding to monotherapy and 30–45% to combination therapy. This limited effectiveness is attributed to significant intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity, which affects the immunological activity of individual tumors and their regions, thereby influencing immunotherapy outcomes. Various biomarkers at the gene and protein expression levels have been identified to predict the response to immunotherapy in HNSCC. Methods In this study, we evaluated intertumor heterogeneity using a 27-gene expression signature to stratify tumors by their immunologic activity status. We investigated intertumor heterogeneity at the molecular and cellular level and further analyzed intratumor spatial heterogeneity within and across these subgroups by using spatial multiomics approaches. Results Immunologically active tumors showed increased interferon-γ and interferon-α signaling and upregulation of major histocompatibility complex-I signaling and genes involved in antigen presentation. Chemokines such as CXCL8 and CXCL9, which are crucial for immune cell recruitment, were differentially regulated. The spatial analysis revealed that active tumors tended to show higher autocorrelation of homogeneous regions with immune cell infiltration compared with inactive tumors. Proximity measures showed an increased colocalization of immune cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, T helper cells, and regulatory T cells, near tumor cells in active tumors. Despite this high immune infiltration, HNSCC often has an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which we observed as a colocalization of programmed cell death protein-1+ (PD-1+) cytotoxic T cells and cytotoxic T cells, indicating regional differences in active and exhausted cell ratios. Furthermore, upregulation of JAK-STAT3 signaling in active tumors was potentially associated with immune evasion. Conclusions The spatial analysis at multiple omics levels allowed for a detailed investigation of molecular and cell type markers to further distinguish between immunologically active and immunosuppressive microenvironments and their spatial heterogeneity. Our study demonstrates that, besides gene expression signatures, cell colocalization signatures can infer immunological activity in HNSCC, thus predicting immunotherapy response.">

        <tr id="Orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1, Nur77) plays a crucial role in regulating immune cell metabolism and function within the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus influencing cancer progression and serving as a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. A comprehensive review discussing the multifaceted roles of NR4A1 in immune cells and the exploitation of that knowledge for therapeutic development is lacking in the field. This review explores diverse functions of NR4A1 in tumor-associated immune cells, including T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. NR4A1 contributes to immune regulation by impacting cytokine production, cell differentiation, and immune cell exhaustion. We highlight how NR4A1 in immune cells within the TME may be either a positive (e.g., macrophages in colon cancer) or negative prognostic factor (e.g., T cells in melanoma), depending on the cancer and immune cell context. Additionally, this review also highlights potential therapeutic strategies targeting NR4A1, leading to its inhibition, activation, or degradation to restore immune cell function and enhance anti-tumor immunity. Such therapies could potentially improve patient outcomes by altering immune cell behaviors, blocking intrinsic tumor growth pathways, or via both mechanisms. However, the development of NR4A1-targeted therapies will be dependent on further research to better understand lineage-specific roles of NR4A1 and the underlying mechanisms across different cancer types and immune cells.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC), a leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits profound molecular heterogeneity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) features that limit therapeutic efficacy. This review elucidates the dual roles of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in GC progression. TLS, ectopic lymphoid organs formed under chronic inflammation, correlate with improved survival and immunotherapy sensitivity by fostering effector T/B cell interactions and antigen presentation. Conversely, immunosuppressive TME components like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) drive immune evasion via cytokine-mediated suppression and checkpoint activation (PD-1/PD-L1). CD8+ T cells exert context-dependent effects, with high infiltration reducing recurrence risk but paradoxically inducing exhaustion in PD-L1-rich microenvironments. Th17 and memory T cells further modulate disease through IL-17-driven angiogenesis and CD45RO+ immune memory dynamics. Multi-omics-based TLS scoring and combinatorial therapies emerge as promising strategies to overcome resistance.">

        <tr id="Inhaled fungal pathogens often generate granuloma-contained latent infections that can reactivate to cause invasive disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the inability to generate sterilizing immunity against latent infection remains poorly understood. Here, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics and flow cytometry to characterize the immune dynamics and cellular architecture of cryptococcal granulomas. Using fate mapping and murine genetic tools, we demonstrate that alternative activation of monocyte-derived myeloid cells by CD4+ T helper 2 cells antagonizes pulmonary fungal clearance during latent infection. In contrast to the prevailing view in the field, we find that alternatively activated myeloid cells are not an intrinsic replication niche for the fungus and more broadly, Cryptococcus predominantly resides in the extracellular environment. We propose a T helper 2 cell-myeloid circuit establishes a local immunosuppressive environment to drive extracellular fungal persistence, which could be leveraged as a new target for host-directed therapy to treat latent fungal infections.">

        <tr id="Unresolved inflammation and fibrosis are the two key features of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive form of steatotic liver disease that can evolve into cirrhosis and liver cancer. Although innate immunity has been well studied in MASH, the role of CD4⁺ T cells remains underexplored despite their potential to coordinate immune responses by providing help to other immune cells, promoting inflammation, or regulating immune activity through effector and regulatory subsets. To better understand the role of CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of MASH, we comprehensively characterized hepatic CD4+ T cells in murine and human MASH at a single-cell protein, transcriptional, and functional level. Mass cytometry and CITE-sequencing revealed a marked shift in intrahepatic CD4⁺ T-cell composition in MASH, with enrichment of Th1, regulatory, and cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cells. Similar phenotypic changes were mirrored in the peripheral blood and validated in human MASH samples. Functional assays demonstrated increased production of IFNγ and TNFα by hepatic CD4⁺ T cells, highlighting their proinflammatory effector activity. Transcriptomic profiling identified Tnfrsf4 (OX40) upregulation in hepatic CD4⁺ T cells during MASH. Therapeutic blockade of the OX40L-OX40 axis reversed hepatic fibrosis and improved histologic disease scores in mice with established MASH, and also decreased inflammatory markers in a human ex vivo liver model. Together, these studies provide a proteogenomic single-cell atlas for hepatic CD4⁺ T cells and uncover a CD4⁺ T cell-dependent immunopathogenic circuit as a promising immunotherapeutic target to alleviate MASH and liver fibrosis.">

        <tr id="Background Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapies represent a promising approach for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse, yet their efficacy is hindered by immunosuppressive factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in the tumor microenvironment. This study investigated the effects of TGF-β on NK cell cytotoxicity and migration using 2D and 3D co-culture models that mimic the leukemic microenvironment. Methods TGF-β production was evaluated in AML-derived leukemic cell lines and mesenchymal stromal cells (hTERT-MSCs) using ELISA. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to analyze global gene expression changes in TGF-β-treated primary human NK cells. NK cell cytotoxicity and migration were assessed in 2D monolayer and 3D spheroid co-cultures containing hTERT-MSCs and leukemic cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results Both leukemic cells and MSCs produced TGF-β, with increased levels observed in MSCs after co-culture with primary AML blasts. RNA sequencing revealed that TGF-β altered key gene pathways associated with NK cell cytotoxicity, adhesion, and migration, supporting its immunosuppressive role. In functional assays, TGF-β exposure significantly reduced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a time-dependent manner and impaired NK cell infiltration into 3D spheroids, particularly in models incorporating MSCs. Additionally, MSCs themselves provided a protective environment for leukemic cells, further reducing NK cell effectiveness in 2D co-cultures. Conclusion TGF-β suppresses both NK cell cytotoxicity and migration, limiting their ability to eliminate leukemic cells and infiltrate the bone marrow niche (BMN). These findings provide novel insights into TGF-β–mediated immune evasion mechanisms and provide important insights for the future design of NK-based immunotherapies and clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by pancytopenia and decreased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow, it can be either congenital or acquired, predominantly affecting adolescents and the elderly, with higher incidence in Asia compared to Europe and America. Current treatment options include allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or immunosuppressive agents, yet proximately a third of patients fail to reach long-term survival. AA is primarily driven by immune-mediated destruction of HSPCs, initiated by self-activated T cells. Early stages feature a Th1 response, which later shifts to Th17 and effector memory CD8+ T cells. Key cytokines including interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) play crucial roles in this immune dysregulation, influencing HSPCs and contributing to bone marrow failure. Furthermore, bone marrow macrophages (MΦ), particularly M1 subtype, are implicated in AA via the TNF-α/TNF-α receptor pathway, leading to T cell activating and subsequent HSPC damage. Interestingly, MΦ with high expression of IL-27Ra have been demonstrated to contribute to HSPC destruction in AA murine models. Beyond their role in thrombosis, platelets also participate in immune regulation. Some studies suggest that platelet may modulate T cell responses through mechanisms such as Akt-PGC1α-TFAM pathway or PF4-mediated activity, which could play a role in AA. However, direct evidence connecting platelet regulation to T cell-mediated HSPC damage is limited, and current research has largely focuses on CD8+ T cells. Moving forward, it is essential to investigate the interactions between platelets, CD4+ T cells, and mitochondrial energy metabolism. In this review, we propose that platelet-derived factors such as PF4 and TGFβ may activate mitochondrial pathways, influencing T cell activation and leading to HSPC destruction in AA. This hypothesis could provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of AA and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies (Highlight).">

        <tr id="Background Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-natural killer (NK) cell therapy has demonstrated safety and feasibility in clinical settings; however, limited efficacy due to intrinsic dysfunction and extrinsic suppression remains an unresolved issue. T cells provide multifaceted support to NK cell-mediated responses. Here, we aimed to design a novel CD19-targeted CAR-NK, engineered with secreted interleukin-15 and C-C motif chemokine ligand 21 (ie, 15×21 CAR-NK), capable of recruiting and cooperating with T cells. Methods We characterized 15×21 CAR-NK cells by performing experiments in vitro and in mouse models, and conducting RNA sequencing. Results 15×21 CAR-NK cells exhibit strong capabilities in cytotoxicity, cytokine production, effector molecule expression, and T-cell recruitment in vitro. Cooperation with T cells promoted efficient tumor-cell elimination, alleviated mutual exhaustion phenotypes, and enhanced the expression of effector molecules/receptors. The recruitment and cooperative effects also result in effective tumor control in mouse models. In addition, 15×21 CAR-NK cells strongly enrich the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway - a key intracellular signaling cascade that is associated with enhanced downstream pro-survival signaling, anti-apoptotic ability, mitochondrial function, and cytotoxicity. Conclusions Our study highlights the intrinsic advantages and extrinsic T-cell cooperative benefits of 15×21 CAR-NK cells, providing a promising strategy for NK-cell-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical sentinels of the immune system, serving as indispensable bridges between innate and adaptive immune responses. DCs are a heterogeneous population, with subsets playing specialized roles in immune defense, tolerance, or disease development. Among these, the recently redefined DC3 subset has gained attention for its unique features and potential roles in health and disease. This review focuses on the phenotypic, functional, and developmental diversity of DC subsets—primarily DC3s—and their contributions to cancer. The tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors is characterized by varying degrees of immune cell infiltration, including DCs. Within the TME, DCs play diverse roles, either promoting anti-tumor responses or facilitating immune evasion. Key subsets include conventional type 1 and type 2 DCs (cDC1s and cDC2s), as well as plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). DC3s share certain features with cDC2s and monocytes but are distinct in their phenotype, function, and ontogeny. Functionally, DC3s can prime and activate T cells, skewing CD4+ T cells towards Th17 and stimulating CD8+ T cells with a tissue-resident memory phenotype. In cancer, their presence correlates with diverse outcomes depending on the TME: DC3 presence is linked to increased survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and oropharyngeal cancer while in non-small-cell lung cancer and melanoma it is associated with immunosuppression. The emerging understanding of DC3s highlights the complexity of DC biology and its relevance to diseases. The dynamic immunomodulatory functions of DC3s open new avenues for developing targeted therapies against cancer and immune-mediated disorders.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines stimulate the immune system to target cancer antigens, representing a promising option for immunotherapy. However, clinical trials have demonstrated limited effectiveness, emphasizing the need for enhanced immune responses. Improving the production of DC vaccines, assessing their impact on immune components, and observing responses could improve the results of DC-based therapies. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) represent a heterogeneous population of innate immune components that generate cytokines and modulate the immune system, potentially enhancing immunotherapies. Recent research highlights the different functions of ILCs in cancer, demonstrating their dual capabilities to promote tumors and exhibit anti-tumor actions. DCs and ILCs actively communicate under physiological and pathological conditions, and the activation of ILCs by DCs or DC vaccines has been shown to influence ILC cytokine production and function. Gaining insights into the interaction between DC-activated ILCs and tumors is essential for creating exciting new therapeutic strategies. These strategies aim to boost anti-tumor immunity while reducing the support that tumors receive. This review examines the effect of DC vaccination on host ILCs, illustrating the complex relationship between DC-based vaccines and ILCs. Furthermore, it explores some exciting strategies to enhance DC vaccines, aiming to boost anti-tumor immune responses by fostering better engagement with ILCs.">

        <tr id="Targeting inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major unmet need. Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2LD) selectively increases regulatory T (Treg) cell numbers in patients with coronary artery disease. Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor analyses and show that IL-2LD clonally expands effector Treg cells in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The clonally expanded Treg cells upregulate key immunosuppressive and metabolic pathways and show an increased number of predicted ligand–receptor interactions. These Treg cells also display similar predicted antigen specificities, which cluster with published sequences specific to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. By tracking the T cell receptors of single cells over time, we identify an inflammatory polarization of the T cell compartment after myocardial infarction, which is restrained by IL-2LD. We identify BACH2 as a repressor of the Treg effector program. However, BACH2-mediated regulation is bypassed with IL-2LD. Overall, these results lend insight into the IL-2-driven clonal expansion program in human Treg cells, with important therapeutic implications for patients with cardiovascular and other immune-mediated diseases.">

This study compared the immunomodulatory effects of alpha-emitting (225Ac) and beta-emitting (177Lu) radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPT) using NM600 in murine prostate cancer models. Methods We assessed immunological changes in TRAMP-C1 and Myc-CaP tumor models treated with 225Ac-NM600 or 177Lu-NM600. Flow cytometry was used to profile immune cell populations, activation markers, and checkpoint molecules, while multiplex assays analyzed cytokine and chemokine expression. Results In general, 225Ac-NM600 elicited stronger immunomodulatory effects than 177Lu-NM600, including cell line dependent increased CD8/Treg ratios, activation of effector and memory T cells, and depletion of suppressive Tregs and MDSCs. The treatment elevated Th1 cytokines, pro-inflammatory chemokines, and checkpoint molecules like PD-1 on CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 on MDSCs, creating a more “hot” TME. Conclusion Alpha-emitting 225Ac-NM600 demonstrated superior ability to enhance antitumor immunity compared to beta-emitting 177Lu-NM600. These findings support the use of 225Ac-NM600 in combination with immunotherapies for advanced prostate cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) triggers a dynamic immune response involving macrophages, However, the functional heterogeneity of these cells and the mechanisms through which they promote repair remain unclear. Although the neuropeptide CGRP has been shown to modulate macrophage phenotypes in other pathological contexts, its role in ICH recovery and white matter repair remains unexplored. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of CD45 + cells from ICH mice (GSE167593 and GSE230414 datasets) identified macrophage subsets. Flow cytometry, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), behavioral assays, and immunofluorescence validated macrophage dynamics and white matter (WM) integrity. Bone marrow and skull analyses traced macrophage origins. The role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was tested via intraperitoneal administration in ICH mice, with outcomes assessed through transcriptomics, ultrastructural imaging, and functional recovery. Results scRNA-seq revealed sustained accumulation of THBS1 + macrophages post-ICH, correlating with WM repair and neurological recovery. These macrophages exhibited pro-repair and remyelination gene signatures (e.g., Arg1, Tgm2). Bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, particularly skull-resident populations, served as the primary source of THBS1 + macrophages. CGRP, elevated in meninges and bone marrow post-ICH, drove macrophage polarization toward THBS + phenotypes. CGRP administration expanded THBS1-positive macrophages in the bone marrow and brain, improving WM integrity (reduced radial diffusivity, higher fractional anisotropy) and sensorimotor function. Ultrastructural analysis confirmed enhanced myelin regeneration (lower g-ratio) in CGRP-treated mice. Conclusions This study identifies a neuroimmune axis wherein CGRP promotes bone marrow-derived THBS1 + macrophages to facilitate WM repair and functional recovery after ICH. Targeting CGRP-macrophage signaling offers a therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery in hemorrhagic brain injury.

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells are well recognized for their role in immune regulation; however, their role in tissue regeneration is not fully understood. This study demonstrates such a role of Tregs in a published preclinical murine model of spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis (PF) expressing a human PF related mutation in the Surfactant Protein-C (SP-C) gene (SFTPCI73T). Genetic crosses of SP-CI73T mice with Foxp3GFP and Foxp3DTR lines were utilized to study Treg behavior during PF development. We found that FoxP3+Tregs accumulate during the transition from inflammation to fibrogenesis, peaking at 21-28 days after mutant SftpcI73T induction localizing to both perivascular and distal fibrotic lung regions. Diphtheria toxin mediated ablation of Tregs at 17 days worsened fibrosis and increased levels of TGFβ and inflammatory cytokines. Tregs expressed Th2 markers (Gata3+) and elaborated factors including amphiregulin (Areg) and Osteopontin (Spp1). Reductionist experiments showed that lung Tregs enhanced organoid formation when co-cultured with alveolar epithelial cells and adventitial fibroblasts, an effect size mimicked using Areg and Spp1 in combination. Our findings demonstrate that immune-mesenchymal-epithelial signaling crosstalk is present in the distal lung wherein Tregs play a protective role by limiting fibrosis and promoting tissue repair, highlighting their broader function beyond immune modulation in lung injury. HIGHLIGHTS In a preclinical model of spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis, regulatory T cells (Tregs) were found to infiltrate the lung coincident with the resolution of early injury and transition to fibrogenesis. Depletion of Tregs at this transition worsened lung injury and enhanced fibrogenesis. Tregs recovered from the fibrotic lung are Type 2 skewed – GATA3+ and produce growth factors (e.g. Amphiregulin, Osteopontin) that promote lung tissue repair in ex vivo organoid models.">

        <tr id="Regulatory B cells (B regs) are immune cells that help suppress excessive inflammatory responses by interacting with other immune components. Among them, B-10 cells are known for their strong immunoregulatory function. This study focused on how B-10 cells influence macrophage phenotype and function through the PD-1 signaling pathway. To investigate this, B-10 cells derived from mouse spleens were co-cultured with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from either wild-type (WT) or PD-1 knockout (PD-1 KO) mice, using both direct contact and Transwell setups. The findings indicated that direct co-culture with B-10 cells significantly promoted the polarization of macrophages towards the anti-inflammatory M2 type, characterized by increased expression of surface markers (F4/80+, CD206+, CD163+), higher levels of PD-1, and upregulation of M2-related genes (IL-1ra, IL-10, Arg-1, IL-6, and CCL1). These macrophages also exhibited enhanced phagocytic activity and greater secretion of specialized pro-resolving mediator (SPMs) like RvD2 and 15-epi LXA4. In contrast, these effects were reduced when B-10 cells were cultured indirectly or when PD-1 was absent. These findings suggest that B-10 cells promote anti-inflammatory macrophage activity primarily through PD-1 signaling, offering insights into potential therapeutic approaches for controlling inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation (VCA) is an important therapeutic option for patients that incur debilitating injuries to the face or limbs. The complexity and immunogenicity of tissue types within VCA grafts pose unique challenges and necessitate the use of intensive immunosuppression; however, graft rejection remains a challenge in VCA. Methods Deep proteomic profiling and high dimensional analysis with cytometry time of flight were used to define the cell types and effector mechanisms elicited by VCA in BALB/c (H-2Kd) > C57BL/6 (H-2Kb) limb recipients. Spleen and cervical draining lymph nodes were collected post-transplant days 1, 3, 5, and 7 (n =4–6 mice/group/day). We identified dynamic, coordinated signatures in T cell and monocyte populations associated with VCA allograft rejection. Results In comparison to syngeneic transplant recipients, allogeneic recipients exhibited significant alterations in the immune cell populations within secondary lymphoid tissues. These changes included very early expansion of double-negative TCRβ- T cells, including IL-17A-producing γδ T cells, and patrolling monocytes. Subsequently, CD8+CD62L+ T cells and CD8+ effector/effector memory T cells (Teff/Tem), Ly6ChiCCR2hiCX3CR1low classical monocytes, CD4+ Teff/Tem, and CD8+CD25hiCCR7low Teff/Tem were increased by day 5. CD8+CD25hiCCR7low Teff/Tem with the highest expression of IFN-γ, perforin, and granzyme B were enriched by day 7. Conclusions High dimensional proteomic analysis reveals multiple innate and Teff/Tem subsets in acute rejection following VCA. In particular, IL-17A-producing γδ T cells and classical monocytes may be particularly important in initiating the alloimmune response in VCA recipients.">

        <tr id="Background The treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), a leading cause of mortality in patients with colorectal cancer, is complicated by type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to investigate the CRLM immune microenvironment in the context of T2D and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods A hyperglycemic CRLM mouse model was established. Seven single-cell RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed, including three peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) datasets (from healthy donors and T2D patients) and four datasets with 20 CRLM samples and matching PBMCs datasets, to explore the immune characteristics and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment in CRLM with concurrent T2D. Results CD8+T cells exhibited dysfunction and exhaustion in liver metastasis from patients with CRLM and T2D; the proportions of various CD4+T cell subpopulations were also altered, and the number of myeloid cells and their function was increased. Myeloid cells in CRLM from patients with T2D exhibited high expression levels of CCL3, which recruited peripheral blood monocytes expressing high levels of CCR1, leading to an accumulation of myeloid cells and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Recruited cells exhibited enhanced T cell communication abilities, indicating an augmented immunosuppressive capacity. In addition, CCR1 expression in peripheral blood monocytes from patients with CRLM was closely correlated with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, suggesting that CCR1 expression levels may predict immune cell phenotype and prognosis in patients with CRLM and T2D. Conclusions Our study revealed complex changes in the tumor microenvironment of patients with CRLM and T2D. In particular, a novel mechanism was identified by which hyperglycemia regulates immunosuppression: the CCL3–CCR1 signaling axis. This finding offers a novel potential therapeutic target for patients with CRLM and T2D and provides an important theoretical basis for the future prediction of the prognosis of these patients.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet its clinical efficacy remains limited to a subset of patients with specific tumor types. The present review provides a comprehensive analysis of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity from both local and systemic perspectives, with particular emphasis on CD8+ T cells as primary effectors. The review discusses how the complex trafficking between the tumor microenvironment (TME), surrounding lymphoid tissues and peripheral circulation creates multiple opportunities for tumors to evade immune surveillance. Within the TME, T-cell exclusion mechanisms, antigen specificity and the spectrum of T-cell exhaustion states, from progenitor exhausted T cells to terminally exhausted T-cell phenotypes, are reviewed. Beyond the local TME, the crucial roles of tumor-draining lymph nodes and tertiary lymphoid structures in maintaining sustainable antitumor immunity, as well as the significance of circulating T cells as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, are analyzed. This systemic perspective provides insights into the dynamic nature of antitumor immunity and suggests potential strategies for next-generation immunotherapies, including combination approaches targeting multiple immune compartments to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) immunotherapy has been revolutionized by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), yet response heterogeneity persists due to dynamic tumor-immune interactions. This review summarizes recent studies in understanding tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) biology, highlighting CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) as pivotal regulators of immune surveillance and suppression. We summarize emerging biomarkers such as TCR clonality, spatial distribution of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and exhaustion markers including PD-1, TCF1, and TIM-3, which predict immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy beyond PD-L1 expression. This review specifically describes radiotherapy-induced immunogenic remodeling and peripheral T cell dynamics as innovative strategies to monitor immune response and resistance mechanisms. By integrating results from single-cell omics and AI-driven spatial analysis, we propose multidimensional frameworks of TIL in NSCLC to overcome resistance and optimize immunotherapy combinations.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells have evolved to detect abnormalities in tissues arising from infection with pathogens, genomic damage, or transformation and respond rapidly to the production of potent proinflammatory and cytolytic mediators. While this acute proinflammatory response is highly efficient at orchestrating sterilizing immunity to pathogens in a matter of days, cellular transformation often avoids the innate detection mechanisms of NK cells. When cellular transformation results in malignancy, tumor cells and/or the tumor microenvironment can evolve additional mechanisms to circumvent NK cell responses, and cancer is now a dominant disease burden worldwide. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the combined relationship between malignancies and natural killer (NK) cells, learn from recent clinical efforts in therapeutically targeting natural killer (NK) cells in cancer and outline some emerging therapeutic concepts that aim to improve the innate immune response against cancer.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy shows limited success in pancreatic cancer, largely due to a low mutational burden and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here we hypothesized that pre-existing antiviral immunity can be redirected to control pancreatic tumors. Cytomegalovirus (CMV, a β-herpesvirus) was chosen, as the majority of the population is infected and it induces an extremely large/broad memory T cell response. Mice latently infected with murine CMV (MCMV) were orthotopically implanted with pancreatic cancer cells and treated with systemic injections of MCMV T-cell epitopes. The therapy promoted preferential accumulation of MCMV-specific T cells within pancreatic tumors, delaying tumor growth and increasing survival. Immunophenotyping and scRNAseq analyses showed these T cells were highly activated and cytotoxic, leading to increased tumor necrosis and caspase-3 activation. Finally, therapy was enhanced when combined with subtherapeutic doses of gemcitabine chemotherapy. Together, these results show that CMV-specific T cells can be repurposed to combat pancreatic cancer. Significance Our studies reveal that CMV-specific viral memory T cells can be re-directed to control a solid tumor normally refractory to immunotherapy via a simple, intravenous injection of T cell peptide epitopes. This mutation agnostic approach has significant potential for the development of “off-the-shelf” therapeutics by stimulating pre-existing antiviral memory and it is widely applicable due to the high prevalence of CMV.">

        <tr id="The central nervous system (CNS) includes a uniquely regulated immune response that supports homeostasis, response to injury, and response to pathogens. Recent work has shown that virus-associated immune responses in the CNS may contribute to neuronal injury and long-term outcomes such as neurocognitive decline. However, the fundamental mechanisms that regulate acute infiltration of immune cells from vascular compartments into the CNS are not well defined. Using an attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC83 (referred to as TC83) to inoculate using olfactory and intracranial injections, we show that infection in the CNS and olfactory pathways results in rapid infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as early as 3- and 5-days post-infection. CNS-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells exhibit a bystander, memory phenotype (CD49d+, Tbet+, NKG2D+, Eomes+), are cytotoxic, and are recruited independent of antigen specific responses. We show that infiltration of CD8+ bystander T-cells is supported by microglia and infiltrating macrophage expression of IL-15 and interferon expression in the CNS. These innate antiviral immune signals support activation of bystander CD8+ T-cells in the CNS that contribute to tissue injury independent of virus replication at early time points post-infection. These data support a mechanism by IL-15 stimulates bystander memory CD8+ T-cells to enter the CNS and contribute to injury independent of antigen-specific stimulation. Importance Prior studies have shown that virus infections in the respiratory and olfactory nerve pathways can result in long term injury in the brain. However, the mechanisms that link virus infection in the olfactory neurons and brain injury are not understood. We show that virus infection of olfactory neurons results in immune stimulation in the brain of resident immune cells to release a cytokine called IL-15 and interferon. This results in infiltration and activation of non-specific T-cells that cause injury of neurons in the brain. This may be an important mechanism by which respiratory viruses and other viruses cause inflammation and injury in the brain.">

        <tr id="Aging leads to a gradual decline in immune function, termed immunosenescence, which significantly elevates the susceptibility to infections, cancers, and other aging-related diseases. Recent advancements have shed light on the molecular underpinnings of immune aging and pioneered novel therapeutic interventions to counteract its effects. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-a type of multipotent stromal cells with regenerative potential, low immunogenicity, and strong immunomodulatory properties-are increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic option to reverse or alleviate immunosenescence-related dysfunction. This review systematically summarizes recent discoveries on how MSCs counteract immune aging, particularly their ability to rejuvenate aged immune cells and restore immune homeostasis. It also addresses key challenges, such as variations in MSC sources, donor variability, and the lack of standardized protocols, while proposing future directions to enhance therapeutic precision. Although preclinical and clinical studies highlight the potential of MSC-based strategies for delaying immunosenescence, critical issues remain unresolved, including long-term safety and efficacy, optimizing cell delivery systems, and elucidating context-specific mechanisms. Addressing these challenges will accelerate the development of MSC-based therapies to combat aging-associated immune decline.">

Chemotherapy is associated with side effects, such as damage to myeloid cells and a reduction in the number of immune cells in patients. In addition, tumor cells hijack the mitochondria of immune cells through tunnel nanotubes, thereby weakening immune ability. Methods: In this study the effects of direct mitochondria transplantation on cancer cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic sensitivity were determined, as well as anti-tumor immunity in in vitro and in vivo lung cancer models. Results: A combination of mitochondrial transplantation and cisplatin chemotherapy was shown for the first time to significantly improve immune infiltration of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and overcome the shortcomings of cisplatin chemotherapy, including damage to myeloid cells and a reduction in the number of immune cells. Conclusions: The findings of the current study provide valuable recommendations for enhancing immune infiltration and augmenting anti-tumor efficacy during chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC.

        <tr id="Innate immune memory, also called trained immunity, is a metabolic and epigenetically regulated process that enables innate immune cells to recalibrate their inflammatory reactivity in response to pathogenic or endogenous stimuli. In addition to its function in host defense, trained immunity contributes to diverse immune-mediated diseases. We discovered that complement component 1q (C1q) is an effective modulator of innate immune memory, potently suppressing the responsiveness of myeloid cells. We found that C1q leads to profound reprogramming of myeloid cell metabolism, particularly glycolysis, and exerts control over the transcriptional regulation of important metabolic and inflammatory genes. We corroborate our findings by identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms close to the C1q gene that are linked to induction of trained immunity by Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) or beta-glucan in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results reveal an immunomodulatory role for C1q and provide evidence of a molecular interaction between the complement system and innate immune memory.

        <tr id="Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest primary brain tumor in adults, where current therapies fail to meaningfully extend survival. Available animal GBM tumor models, especially therapy-resistant and recurrent ones with unique immunological aspects, are restricted, impeding innovative treatment research. To confront this critical obstacle we established a unique GBM mouse model that utilizes patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) within humanized mice. Methods We selected two immune-deficient mouse models to facilitate the reconstitution of myeloid lineage cells. After undergoing myeloablation, mice received CD34+ hematopoietic stem progenitor cells derived from human umbilical cord blood for humanization. Upon confirming the reconstitution of human blood cells, mice were xenografted with PDXs resistant to radiation. Tumor profiles and immune cell infiltration were analyzed via flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The findings were evaluated against scRNA-seq data from recurrent human GBM. Results A diverse range of human immune cells, including T, NK, and myeloid lineage cells, infiltrated PDX tumors in humanized mice. Notably, gene expression profiles in these immune cells resembled that of recurrent human GBM. Unlike conventional xenograft models, this model highlighted enhanced tumor diversity, particularly a high fraction of neural progenitor-like cells. Conclusions Our humanized GBM mouse model displayed an immune cell signature similar to recurrent GBM. This model is a valuable resource for analyzing the tumor immune landscape and assessing new therapies, particularly immunotherapies. By enabling effective evaluation of novel treatments, our model has the potential to significantly advance GBM research. Key Points A wide array of human immune cells infiltrates GBM-PDX tumors in humanized mice. The tumor heterogeneity of GBM-PDX is more evident in humanized mouse xenografts. Importance of the study Current GBM treatment development is primarily constrained by the absence of appropriate animal models that can enhance our understanding of human GBM biology and its immune dynamics. We created a specialized GBM mouse model using humanized mice with patient-derived xenografts resistant to radiation. Detailed immune cell analysis showed various human blood cells in the GBM-PDX derived from humanized mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered crucial T-cell subgroups, notably regulatory and exhausted T cells, which matched those observed in recurrent GBM patient tumors. Moreover, the model outperformed standard xenograft approaches in tumor heterogeneity, resembling the intricate diversity observed in recurrent GBM samples. Our humanized GBM mouse model provides a powerful platform to study the interactions between human tumors and immune cells. This tool will facilitate the discovery of immunosuppressive mechanisms and accelerate the assessment of immunotherapies applicable to various brain tumors.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer globally and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, following lung cancer. Despite the immune system’s capacity for tumor surveillance and elimination, CRC tumors can evade immune responses through complex mechanisms, ultimately escaping immune detection. T and B lymphocytes play a critical role in adaptive immunity against tumors, with T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, driving tumor elimination. Additionally, B cells contribute by producing tumor-specific antibodies, including various immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses that participate in immune modulation. However, the effectiveness of adaptive immunity in CRC is often limited due to tumor-driven immunosuppression. This study investigates the expression of T and B cell activation genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from CRC patients. A panel of 84 genes involved in T and B cell activation was analyzed to assess changes in expression using RT2 QPCR arrays. Additionally, we measured serum levels of the four IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) in CRC patients to explore possible alterations in humoral immunity. Compared to healthy controls, 5 genes were found to be downregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCL3 (fold regulation − 6.36), IL6 (fold regulation − 12.46), CSF2 (fold regulation − 7.50), CXCR3 (fold regulation − 3.01), and TNFSF14 (fold regulation − 4.90). Moreover, 13 genes were upregulated in PBMCs of all CRC patients’ groups; CCR3 (fold regulation 59.21), CD2 (fold regulation 3.07), CD27 (fold regulation 6.39), CD3G (fold regulation 4.15), CD8B (fold regulation 3.25), FAS (fold regulation 3.94), IL10 (fold regulation 39), IL18R1 (fold regulation 82.39), IL5 (fold regulation 20.4), LAG3 (fold regulation 19.88), MAP3K7 (fold regulation 4.07), TLR1 (fold regulation 6.45), and TLR6 (fold regulation 18.87). The serum levels of the four IgG subclasses were however statistically insignificant in CRC patients compared to healthy controls. Our findings provide insights into the adaptive immune dysfunction in CRC, offering a detailed profile of gene expression changes associated with T and B cell activation and antibody production. Understanding these dysregulations may enhance the development of targeted immunotherapies, potentially improving outcomes for CRC patients through more personalized immunomodulatory approaches.

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment is densely populated with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which exhibit various phenotypes at different stages of tumor progression. TAMs are highly plastic and intricately linked to the antitumor activity and functionality of CD8+ T cells. Tumor cells, TAMs and CD8+ T cells constitute a feedback loop that monitors the tumor immune surveillance. Modulation of several chief signaling pathways within TAMs can steer them towards either an immunoinflammatory or immunosuppressive state. This can be achieved indirectly through cancer therapies or by directly targeting TAMs. New detailed insights into the immunostimulatory reprogramming of TAMs inspire the design of novel combinatory strategies that can be extrapolated to bolster cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Rat post-mitotic septal neurons, engineered to reversibly proliferate and arrest under physiological conditions, can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine representative independent cDNA libraries were made to evaluate global arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses, e.g., upregulated interferon (β-IFN) RNA, that were previously identified in normal uninfected and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent (CJ) infected septal neurons. This reversible cell model encompassed a non-productive latent (CJ−) and a highly infectious (CJ + , 10 logs/gm) state. Arrest of normal uninfected neurons upregulated a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts and known neuronal differentiation transcripts (e.g., Neuregulin-1, GDF6 and Prnp). As expected, many activated IFN innate immune genes were simultaneously upregulated (e.g., OAS1, ISG20, CD80, cytokines, chemokines and complement) along with clusterin (CLU) that binds misfolded proteins. Arrest of latently infected CJ− cells induced even more profound global transcript differences. CJ+ cells markedly downregulated the anti-proliferative controls seen in arrested normal cells. CJ+ infection also suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ infection. In contrast, IFN and cytokine/chemokine pathways were strongly upregulated. Analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts, e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin). These data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection enhances and expands anti-viral responses; 3) non-productive latent infection can epigenetically imprint many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. This rare cell model of latent infection is fundamental for interrogating triggers of late onset disease that are also relevant for Alzheimer’s Disease. Peripheral human blood and intestinal myeloid cells that are latently infected may also be conditionally stimulated in vitro to produce CJ+ linked diagnostic transcripts.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly heterogeneous malignancy characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that plays a critical role in disease progression and therapeutic resistance. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including T lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, exhibit dual functions, either promoting or suppressing tumor growth depending on their phenotype and interactions within the TME. The presence of immune evasion mechanisms, such as the loss of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) expression, upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, and metabolic reprogramming (hypoxia-induced glycolysis and lactate accumulation), further contributes to immune suppression and poor treatment responses. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized the treatment of recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, response rates remain highly variable, underscoring the need for biomarker-driven patient selection and combinatorial therapeutic strategies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of immune cells in the TME of HNSCC, discusses the mechanisms underlying immune escape, and explores emerging immunotherapeutic and epigenetic-targeting approaches aimed at enhancing antitumor immune responses and improving clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are a diverse population of immune cells that play a central role in tumor immunity and have emerged as critical mediators in cancer immunotherapy. This review explores the phenotypic and functional diversity of TILs—including CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells—and their dynamic interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). While TILs can drive tumor regression, their activity is often hindered by immune checkpoint signaling, metabolic exhaustion, and stromal exclusion. We highlight TIL recruitment, activation, and polarization mechanisms, focusing on chemokine gradients, endothelial adhesion molecules, and dendritic cell-mediated priming. Special emphasis is placed on preclinical models that evaluate TIL function, including 3D tumor spheroids, organoid co-cultures, syngeneic mouse models, and humanized systems. These provide valuable platforms for optimizing TIL-based therapies. Furthermore, we examine the prognostic and predictive value of TILs across cancer types, their role in adoptive cell therapy, and the challenges of translating preclinical success into clinical efficacy. Emerging technologies such as single-cell sequencing, neoantigen prediction, and biomaterial platforms are transforming our understanding of TIL biology and enhancing their therapeutic potential. Innovative strategies—ranging from genetic engineering and combination therapies to targeted modulation of the TME—are being developed to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve TIL persistence, infiltration, and cytotoxicity. This review integrates current advances in TIL research and therapy, offering a comprehensive foundation for future clinical translation. TILs hold significant promise as both biomarkers and therapeutic agents, and with continued innovation, they are poised to become a cornerstone of personalized cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="This study investigates the interplay between cellular senescence and inflammation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We employed RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression changes in HUVECs subjected to replicative- or radiation-stress-induced senescence, and we compared these profiles with those of cells under acute or chronic TNFα-mediated inflammation. Our findings reveal that both senescence types exhibited significant upregulation of genes associated with epithelial- (or endothelial) mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inflammatory pathways, indicating a shared molecular response. Notably, chronic inflammation led to a pronounced EMT signature, while acute inflammation primarily activated classical inflammatory responses. Experimental validation confirmed reduced proliferation and increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in senescent and chronically inflamed cells and substantiated the upregulation of EMT marker genes. Additionally, we observed impaired wound healing capacity in senescent and chronically inflamed cells, highlighting the functional consequences of these cellular states. Our study underscores the critical role of inflammation in exacerbating senescence-related changes, contributing to the understanding of age-related cardiovascular pathologies. These insights may inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of aging and inflammation on endothelial function and cardiovascular health.">

Progress in immunopharmacology, aided by single-cell analytics, increasingly highlights immune complexity and functional heterogeneity. Conventional categories contain diverse subsets, including various T cells (helper, regulatory, memory) and B cells (plasma, memory, regulatory). Innate immune cells like macrophages, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells also exist in various functional states. These subsets exhibit distinct pharmacological response profiles that are often obscured by bulk analyses. This review explores the differential responses of critical immune cell subsets within the gastric cancer tumor microenvironment to current therapeutic modalities, encompassing cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecular targeted agents, and immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. We delve into the molecular processes underlying subset-specific drug effects, potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance linked to specific immune cell states, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment on immune subset pharmacology. Furthermore, we discuss the application and potential of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems specifically engineered to target distinct immune cell subpopulations, aiming to enhance immunomodulatory efficacy, reshape subset repertoires favorably, overcome resistance, and minimize toxicity for more precise and effective treatment of advanced gastric cancer.">

To address this, we perform multi-site global proteomics alongside matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. We order the protein expression profiles using an unbiased pseudotime analysis, recapitulating clinical observations of metastatic progression, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlates with immune cell infiltration, the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to counterbalance γδ T cell abundance, and an increased abundance of exhausted CD8⁺ T cells. The accumulation of Tregs at metastatic sites correlates with SNX8 expression, a critical regulator of the STING pathway. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruit Tregs via MHC class II, fostering an inflammatory phenotype with limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Together, our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with both localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC.">

Emerging evidence reveals that organ‐specific PMN formation precedes tumor cell arrival, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment conducive to metastatic colonization. Primary tumor‐derived factors interact with lung resident cells, promoting the recruitment of bone marrow‐derived cells and creating a favorable microenvironment for the migrating tumor cells. Despite progress, systematic integration of PMN's multilayered regulatory mechanisms—from mechanism to clinical application remains lacking. The review summarizes recent studies investigating the effects of PMN in the entire process of lung metastasis. Our discussion revolves primarily around extracellular vesicles, extracellular matrix remodeling, proinflammation, immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming. We emphasize the impact of various treatment strategies for primary tumors on the PMN in clinical practice, while also summarizing current diagnostic methods and exploring new therapeutic possibilities in the PMN. Finally, we propose a roadmap for future investigations into the lung PMN, highlighting prioritized research axes that bridge mechanistic discoveries with bench‐to‐bedside translation of PMN‐targeted interventions.">

Myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), are involved in the development and progression of immune aplastic anemia (AA). We used a murine model of BMF to explore the effects of CSF-1R inhibition on immune pathophysiology. Hematopoiesis, immune cell populations, and gene expression were assessed by flow cytometry, cytokine analysis, and single-cell RNA sequencing. CSF-1R inhibition with the small molecule PLX3397 intensified BMF in CByB6F1 mice, enhancing inflammation and macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. This was accompanied by increased leukocyte apoptosis, a reduction in CD11b+ myeloid cells, and worsened animal survival. In contrast, the JAK-inhibitor baricitinib attenuated BMF, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, and decreasing CD8+ T cell infiltration of bone marrow. Single-cell RNA analysis revealed upregulation of M1 signature genes in both murine BMF and also AA human samples. In patients with severe AA, there was a shift towards an M1-like monocyte phenotype, correlating with increased inflammatory cytokine expression and altered MDSC populations. These findings highlight the role of myeloid-derived cells in BMF and suggest that M1 macrophages, with defective MDSC function, contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression. Targeting macrophage polarization or MDSCs offers alternative therapeutic strategies in immune-mediated BMF.">

Residing in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in tumor progression by regulating diverse signaling pathways. Notably, accumulating evidence has confirmed that TAMs interplay with various cellular components within the TME directly or indirectly to maintain the dynamic balance of the M1/M2 ratio and shape an immunosuppressive TME, consequently conferring immune evasion and immunotherapy tolerance. Detailed investigation of the communication network around TAMs could provide potential molecular targets and optimize ICI therapies. In this review, we systematically summarize the latest advances in understanding the origin and functional plasticity of TAMs, with a focus on the key signaling pathways driving macrophage polarization and the diverse stimuli that regulate this dynamic process. Moreover, we elaborate on the intricate interplay between TAMs and other cellular constituents within the TME, that is driving tumor initiation, progression and immune evasion, exploring novel targets for cancer immunotherapy. We further discuss current challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need to decode TAM-TME interactions and translate preclinical findings into clinical breakthroughs. In conclusion, while TAM-targeted therapies hold significant promise for enhancing immunotherapy outcomes, addressing key challenges—such as TAM heterogeneity, context-dependent plasticity, and therapeutic resistance—remains critical to achieving optimal clinical efficacy.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the remarkable efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, only a subset of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients respond and many eventually progress, underscoring the need to develop novel combination therapies. The interaction between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex niche including cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), vascular cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Using fate mapping, we previously identified a novel subpopulation of resident vascular stem cells derived from vascular smooth muscle cells, designated AdvSca1-SM (vascular Adventitial location, Stem cell antigen-1 expression, SMooth muscle origin) cells. AdvSca1-SM cells are the predominant cell type responding to vessel wall dysfunction and their selective differentiation to myofibroblasts promotes vascular fibrosis. SMC-to-AdvSca1-SM cell reprogramming is dependent on SMC induction of the transcription factor KLF4, and KLF4 is essential for maintenance of the stem cell phenotype. The function of AdvSca1-SM cells in LUAD tumorigenesis has not been explored. Using an orthotopic immunocompetent mouse model of LUAD, we demonstrate that AdvSca1-SM cells are a major component of lung tumors, significantly contributing to cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Compared to AdvSca1-SM cells, CAFs have altered ECM gene expression with a reduction of a stemness signature. AdvSca1-SM-specific genetic ablation of Klf4 altered their phenotype resulting in inhibition of communication between cancer cells and CAFs, decreases in innate immunosuppressive populations, and increased T cell infiltration into the tumor. Targeting this population may represent a novel strategy to improve the response to immunotherapy.">

We found the leukemic stroma cells with high level of TGFβ1 secretion can determine TAMs toward M2-polarized subtype. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that bone marrow stromal cells with specific glycans, reduced bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) levels, in MDS/AML promoted M2-polarized subtype through the secretion of TGFβ1, which elevated PD-L1 expression and thereby impaired CD8+ T cell function.

Macrophages also greatly influence tumor progression by regulating the immune microenvironment. However, the role of polyamine metabolism in thyroid cancer macrophages remains understudied. This study explores the connection between polyamine metabolism and macrophages in thyroid cancer. Using the THCA dataset gene expression analysis and single‐cell data, we identified macrophage subpopulations. We assessed immune scores, matrix scores, immune checkpoint scores, and immune cell types using Bulk‐RNA data and the TIDE platform to predict immune checkpoint inhibitor responses. Clinical specimens validated our findings. Our results show a significant association between polyamine metabolism and the clinical and biological characteristics of thyroid cancer, including macrophage trajectory. Notably, macrophage subpopulations affected by polyamine metabolism have strong prognostic value, especially in immunotherapy patients. We found that changes in these subpopulations correlate with thyroid cancer development, and tumor tissue can regulate macrophage polyamine metabolism. This study provides new insights into how polyamine metabolism affects macrophages and the tumor microenvironment, influencing tumor growth and anti‐tumor immune responses in thyroid cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Aging is linked to various dysfunctions of the immune system, including the decline of its primary developmental source: the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. This decline leads to chronic inflammation, increased vulnerability to infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and reduced vaccine efficacy. As individuals age, the HSC niche undergoes significant changes, including greater adipocyte accumulation and alterations in the molecular microenvironment, which may influence the development and function of immune cells. Among these cells, the impact of the aging HSC niche on dendritic cell (DC) function is less understood. Heterochronic autologous HSC transplantation is a promising intervention to prevent age-related disorders, contributing to the extension of healthspan and longevity, however, several murine experiments failed to produce the expected results, which led us to presume that the problem lies within the old HSC niche. Therefore, we created in vitro models of young and old HSC niches and examined how these microenvironments affect the differentiation and maturation and functionality of BM-derived DCs (BMDCs). Results An analysis of the conditioned media from young and aged HSC niches revealed that the environment of aged niches exhibited an increased presence of adiponectin. This media was subsequently utilized in BMDC differentiation and maturation protocols, with their effects closely monitored. Our results indicate that the old HSC niche microenvironment promotes premature BMDC activation, characterized by elevated MHC class II expression and enhanced allostimulatory capacity of BMDCs at their immature stage. Additionally, LPS stimulation of BMDCs, used to induce DC maturation, significantly increased CD86 expression on BMDCs from the aged niche. However, these cells did not show superior allostimulatory capacity compared to their counterparts from the young niche environment. By analyzing the BMDC cytokine profile, we observed that when cultured in aged niche-conditioned media, the BMDCs secreted significantly higher levels of IL-6, indicating a heightened proinflammatory activation state. Conclusions Collectively, our findings suggest that aging-related changes within the HSC niche can considerably alter DC functionality by disrupting their normal development from BM precursors. These results emphasize the significance of this phenomenon and its implications for immunosenescence.

This review explores the complex interactions between CAFs and dendritic cells (DCs), essential antigen-presenting cells that activate immune responses. CAFs impair DC maturation and function by secreting cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, reducing their ability to present antigens and stimulate T cells, thus promoting an immunosuppressive environment favorable to tumor growth. Additionally, CAFs contribute to the differentiation of tolerogenic DCs, fostering regulatory T cells (Tregs) that further suppress antitumor immunity. This review examines the molecular mechanisms underlying CAF-DC crosstalk and discusses potential therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring DC functionality. Targeting the CAF-driven immunosuppressive network offers promising opportunities to enhance the efficacy of DC-based vaccines and immunotherapies, paving the way for improved cancer treatment outcomes.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are the first line of defense in nonspecific immunity (innate immunity) and interact with other immune cells to participate in specific defense mechanisms (adaptive immunity). Studies have shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) mediates tumor development and recruits neutrophils into tumors to become tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), an important part of TME, and achieve extended lifespan. TANs can be differentiated into the antitumor or protumor phenotype, and play an important role in tumor occurrence, proliferation and recurrence, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, cell necrosis, and so on. Here, we summarize the TAN origin and subtypes found through Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis in different types of tumors in recent literature, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their antitumor and protumor effects on tumors. We focus on the interaction between TANs and immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory TME, as well as signal pathways such as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) associated with TAN phenotype transition. Based on the summarized mechanisms, we focus on the potential application and latest strategies of TAN-based immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and combination therapy in the preclinical study and clinical trials of tumors. The discussion on promising therapy encompasses five key areas: inhibition of the tumor-promoting effect of TANs, enhancement of the antitumor effect of TANs, targeting the interaction between TANs and the TME, reprogramming of TANs, and drug delivery carriers. Finally, we discuss the potential of TANs and their related markers as emerging biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating symptom in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Fresh insights indicate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) may undergo neuron-like differentiation, potentially contributing to pain mechanisms. By examining the apolipoprotein E (APOE) together with the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), this study aims to clarify their joint function in modulating differentiation and how this interplay might be implicated in chronic pain associated with NPC. Through comprehensive analysis using TCGA-NPC transcriptomic datasets and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we assessed the molecular landscapes of both NPC-affected and healthy nasopharyngeal tissues. Differential gene expression and immune cell profiling identified macrophages as key players in the inflammatory response. Single-cell sequencing revealed a distinct subpopulation of neuron-like macrophages expressing neurogenesis-related genes. Macrophage-to-neuron-like cell transformation in response to NPC cells was examined through in vitro co-culture systems, highlighting the involvement of the APOE-TREM2 regulatory pathway. In vivo studies involved macrophage depletion and TREM2 knockdown in mouse models to evaluate the impact on chronic pain development. Infiltrating macrophages were significantly more abundant in NPC samples, with many exhibiting neuron-like features that were positively linked to high levels of WNT5 A expression. In vitro, NPC cells induced macrophage differentiation into neuron-like cells, a process regulated by TREM2 and APOE. TREM2 knockdown in macrophages resulted in a reduction of chronic pain behaviors in mouse models, highlighting the contribution of the APOE-TREM2 Axis to NPC-associated chronic pain. Our findings demonstrate that NPC cells promote macrophage reprogramming through the APOE-TREM2 Axis, leading to neuron-like differentiation and contributing to chronic pain in NPC patients. Targeting this pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies for managing chronic pain in NPC. Graphical Abstract 1. Neuron-like macrophages contribute to chronic pain in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) through the APOE-TREM2 axis. 2. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a unique subset of macrophages expressing neurogenesis-related genes in NPC tissues. 3. APOE-TREM2 signaling regulates the neuronal-like differentiation of macrophages, promoting pain-related pathways in NPC. 4. Targeting the APOE-TREM2 axis may offer novel therapeutic strategies for alleviating chronic pain in NPC patients.

Targeting the metabolism of tumors emerges an encouraging strategy to enhance the outcomes of tumor immunotherapy. We analyzed metabolic differences in lung cancer post-anti-PD-1 treatment using a single-cell RNA sequencing data (n = 15). Abnormal lipid metabolism is notable in patients with a non-major pathological response, and low RAN expression is linked to good immunotherapy response. RAN showed increased expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) versus normal lung tissues, correlating with worse prognosis, advanced staging, reduced immune cell activity, and greater sensitivity to common chemotherapeutic drugs. Knockdown of RAN caused G2/M phase arrest, inhibiting proliferation and clone formation in LUAD cells. RAN modifies lipid metabolism via nuclear p-AMPK output to aid tumor cells in resisting immunotherapy and reduces MHC-related molecule expression to evade CD8 + T cell detection. Combining Selinexor with immunotherapy might effectively counter immune tolerance and boost anti-tumor responses in LUAD.">

        <tr id="Severe burn injury induces long-lasting immune dysfunction, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. We hypothesized that burn injury leads to epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming of innate immune cells. Splenic F4/80⁺ macrophages were isolated from mice at days 2, 9, and 14 days post-20% contact burn injury. Targeted transcriptomics and MAPit single-molecule chromatin profiling were used to assess immune, metabolic, and epigenetic changes. Canonical pathway analysis was performed to infer functional shifts over time. Burn injury induced a biphasic response in macrophages. Early after injury (Day 2), there was broad transcriptional suppression and epigenetic silencing of inflammatory regulators, including Stat3, Traf6, and Nfkb1. Over time (Days 9 and 14), loci associated with anti-inflammatory mediators such as Il-10 and Socs3 exhibited progressive chromatin opening and transcriptional upregulation. Metabolic gene profiles revealed persistent suppression of mitochondrial and oxidative phosphorylation programs. Canonical pathway analysis demonstrated early IL-10 signaling activation with sustained suppression of classical macrophage activation pathways. Chromatin architecture changes included nucleosome sliding and ejection events, consistent with dynamic, locus-specific regulation. This work challenges the classical notion of burn-induced immune suppression as purely a consequence of systemic inflammation. Instead, we reveal a programmed and locus-specific epigenetic architecture that may shape macrophage immune and metabolic function long after the acute phase.">

Expression of inhibitory receptors is frequently detected on T cells from children with B-ALL at diagnosis and during therapy.

Despite their synovial enrichment Regulatory T cells (Treg) fail to alleviate the joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This indicates their functional impairment in the synovial milieu of RA patients.


RESULTS
Here, we demonstrate that deficit in PD-1 pathway incapacitates the synovial Treg cells and engaging PD-1 restores their suppressive function (IL-10, TGF-β secretion) which in turn suppressed the synovial inflammatory T cells (IFN-γ+, IL-17+ TNF-α+). We also showed deficit in programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression on RA synovial macrophages contributes to impaired Treg cell function.


CONCLUSION
Rejuvenating synovial Treg cell function via PD-1 engagement may be a potential strategy to ameliorate the synovial inflammation in RA patients.">

In the glioma microenvironment, these two types of macrophages tend to adopt a specialized activation state known as type 2 or M2 macrophages and play crucial roles in the progression of glioma. Methods To identify genes associated with GAMs, we intersected genes identified from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (specific to GAMs) with M2 macrophage module genes derived from weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Prognostic genes were screened using univariate Cox regression, multivariate Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis. These genes were used to construct and validate prognostic signatures and to delineate the immune landscape. During drug screening, Vorinostat exhibited the highest risk score and the lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The expression of the 14 prognostic genes was further investigated using a glioma cell-macrophage co-culture model. Results Fourteen prognostic genes (TREM2, GAL3ST4, AP1B1, SLA, CYBB, CD53, SLC37A2, ABI3, RIN3, SCIN, SIGLEC10, C3, PLEKHO2, and PLXDC2) were identified. The prognostic model constructed from these genes demonstrated robust predictive efficacy. Based on this model, Vorinostat was prioritized as a candidate therapeutic agent, and subsequent validation confirmed its significant inhibitory effects on the glioma microenvironment. Conclusion These findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms of GAMs in glioma, uncover the immunological landscape of the tumor microenvironment, and identify potential therapeutic targets and drug action mechanisms.">

        <tr id="Standing as the most aggressive form of primary malignant tumor, Glioblastoma (GBM) tumors with marked heterogeneity represents one of the enormous challenges in glioma treatment. Myeloid cells, which includes neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, microglia, and macrophages, play a pivotal role in the tumor microenvironment of GBM. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), T cells and natural killer (NK) cells exert anti-tumor functions, whereas myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can promote tumor progression by suppressing these immune responses. Therefore, MDSCs play a critical role in shaping the effectiveness of immunotherapy. TME has constrained the ability of traditional GBM treatment approaches to significantly enhance prognostic outcomes for patients. This category encompasses conventional therapies like surgical resection and radiation therapy, along with cutting-edge methodologies such as immunotherapy. Through extensive investigations into the dynamic interactions between the GBM microenvironment and neoplastic cells, both targeted treatment strategies and innovative immunotherapeutic modalities have emerged, offering promising new directions for clinical intervention. This review focuses on the interactions between GBM and myeloid cells (MCs), providing novel insights into the oncogenesis and progression of GBM.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a high-mortality cancer due to its aggressive nature and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which enables evasion of immune surveillance. Despite chemotherapy and targeted therapies, 5-year survival is ~ 30%, necessitating novel immunotherapies. AML suppresses cytotoxic T/NK cells by co-opting regulatory pathways, creating an “immune paradox.” Emerging strategies aim to disrupt this evasion. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 nivolumab and anti-CD47 magrolimab, combined with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), enhance T-cell activity and phagocytosis, especially in TP53-mutated AML. Therapeutic vaccines targeting leukemia-associated antigens (e.g., WT1, PRAME) via dendritic cell fusion show early success in prolonging remission. Combinatorial approaches, like HMAs with STING agonists or dual checkpoint blockade, target multiple immunosuppressive pathways to overcome resistance. Challenges include TME heterogeneity, therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells, toxicities (e.g., anemia, cytokine release syndrome), relapse from clonal evolution, and a lack of predictive biomarkers. Autologous therapies face economic and logistical hurdles, driving demand for scalable solutions. Advances in single-cell genomics, AI, and synthetic biology are identifying novel targets (TIM-3, TIGIT, VISTA) and improving patient stratification. Integrating these innovations may transform AML into a chronic condition, bridging preclinical potential to clinical impact. In this review, we aim to evaluate mechanisms, challenges, and future directions of immunotherapies in AML with highlighting ICIs and vaccination to improve therapeutic outcomes.">

In immature DCs, GSK-3β is continuously active, and its inhibition has been shown to enhance DC maturation and function. As a key upstream kinase of β-catenin, GSK-3 inhibition activates β-catenin in both human and murine DCs—a pathway traditionally linked to its immunomodulatory effects. However, our recent findings challenge this paradigm by uncovering β-catenin-independent, dual roles of GSK-3β in DCs. Our study reveals that while GSK-3β enhances DC-mediated cross-priming of CD8 T cells, it concurrently impairs the generation of memory CD8 T cells. These findings have significant implications for vaccine development and cancer immunotherapy, where both effective T-cell priming and durable memory responses are critical. This mini-review provides an in-depth analysis of mechanistic insights into GSK-3β’s paradoxical functions and discusses potential strategies to fine-tune GSK-3 activity for optimized immunotherapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Management of difficult-to-heal skin wounds presents a significant clinical challenge, particularly when associated with inflammatory skin disorders. The differentiation of stem cells into keratinocyte-like cells has been explored as a potential regenerative therapy. Ras-related protein (Rab) 7, a key regulator of membrane trafficking, influences the activity of several growth factors. In this study, the competitive Rab7 inhibitor, CID-1067700, was investigated for the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cell into keratinocyte-like cells. This treatment upregulated several epidermal markers, including P63, cytokeratin 5 and 14 and filaggrin, while downregulated the stem cell marker, vimentin. Microarray data showed upregulation of the anti-inflammatory gene HMOX-1, coupled with the downregulation of various inflammation-related pathways, such as TNF, chemokine, AGE-RAGE and IL-17 signalling cascades, as well as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. Gene set enrichment analysis predicted Ehmt2, an epigenetic regulator, to be the top activated upstream regulator, enhancing the transcriptional activity. Protein array analysis showed reduced secretion of several inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1α, IL-8, IL-17A, and IL-32, while enhancing the secretion of the epidermal growth factor. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that CID-1067700, as an additive to the differentiation media, not only enhances stem cell differentiation into keratinocyte-like cells, but also improves their anti-inflammatory properties. These combined regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties may offer significant therapeutic potential for patients with chronic skin wounds, particularly those with underlying inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression heavily relies on the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In the ccRCC TME, the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) drive a self-perpetuating cycle of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance through diverse interactions between cells and molecules. Furthermore, heterogeneous CAFs facilitate tumor growth through metabolic reprogramming and modulate immune suppression by driving the M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which promote a multilayered immunosuppressive network. In addition, CAFs reshape the mechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM), hinder the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and further exacerbate immune escape. Moreover, CAF-derived exosomes can confer resistance to chemoradiation therapy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) secreted by CAFs synergizes with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to facilitate adaptive resistance to targeted therapy. Emerging therapeutic strategies—including fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted CAR-T cells and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) inhibitors—can partially reverse this immunosuppressive property. Combination therapies employing immune checkpoint inhibitors and VEGF antagonists exhibit promising synergistic effects, although the clinical translation remains hampered by CAF heterogeneity, dual functional roles, and the lack of specific biomarkers. Future studies should integrate single-cell sequencing and spatial multi-omics techniques to comprehensively analyze the spatio-temporal dynamic heterogeneity of CAF subpopulations and develop precision treatment strategies based on molecular subtyping, aiming to break the vicious cycle of “CAF-TME-resistance” in ccRCC.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant tumor and stands as the fourth leading contributor to cancer-related fatalities on a global scale. The specific link between CD2 Associated Protein (CD2AP) expression and the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear, and further exploration is needed to understand its potential role in immune response and as a target for immunotherapy in GC. Utilizing RNA sequencing data acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for a pan-cancer analysis, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out to determine the expression pattern and immunological involvement of CD2AP. Systematic association of CD2AP with immunological features within the stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) TME was subsequently performed, encompassing factors like cancer immunity cycles, immune checkpoints, immunomodulators, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs). We found that CD2AP was enhanced expression in the TME of a variety of malignancies. CD2AP contributes to forming a stromal reduced TME in GC and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. It was observed that patients with elevated levels of CD2AP, along with high scores on their CD4, CD20, and CD57 immune markers, tended to experience the most favorable prognosis. Furthermore, an IRS was constructed to accurately assess the prognosis of STAD patients. Since CD2AP was associated with the formation of stromal reduced TME in STAD, the expression of CD2AP can improve the effect of immunotherapy of STAD. CD2AP could emerge as a novel prognostic biomarker for STAD, offering a fresh avenue for molecular targeted therapy.

These soluble signaling molecules regulate key processes, including immune modulation, tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and resistance to therapy. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) promote survival pathways, chemoresistance, and immune evasion, while anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 further suppress effective anti-tumor immunity. Targeting cytokine signaling pathways has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Advances in monoclonal antibody therapies, signal transduction inhibitors, and cytokine-neutralizing agents aim to disrupt the pro-tumorigenic effects of cytokines within the TME. Additionally, integrating cytokine modulation with immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapy enhances anti-tumor immune responses.

Disruption of the tightly regulated balance between immune activation and tolerance induction leads to the development and worsening of immune-related liver diseases. T cells play diverse crucial roles in the immune system, and they have long been known to induce inflammation through direct tissue damage by effector molecules and the recruitment of effector cells via chemokines. Additionally, T cells interact with B cells to induce autoantibodies, promoting tissue inflammation and dysfunction through the deposition of IgG and immune complexes in the tissues. Recent advances in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have elucidated the role of T cells in the progression and recovery of liver fibrosis. Moreover, comprehensive and unbiased information can now be obtained from small samples of human and mouse tissues, which advances our understanding of tissue-specific functions of T cells, including resident memory T cells, peripheral helper T cells, and tissue Tregs. However, significant unmet needs remain in the fields of immune-related liver diseases.

        <tr id="Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are a type of tissue-restricted memory T cells with terminal differentiation and a memory function. They exist in mucosal tissues for a long period. In the absence of disease, TRM cells promote essential inflammation, which reinforces the intestinal barrier and prevents bacterial translocation. However, in inflammatory or autoimmune environments, TRM cells are hyperactivated. This heightened activity causes the host to release excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in local immune imbalances and damage to the barrier, ultimately leading to tissue lesions. Numbers of studies have shown that TRM cells play a crucial role in the development and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), suggesting that targeted regulation of TRM cells homeostasis may be an important strategy for treating IBD. Here, we compiled the existing understanding of the role of TRM cells in IBD, with particular emphasis on the associated mechanisms and approaches for targeting TRM cells in IBD treatment. This review will serve as a foundation for a better understanding of IBD development and enhancing the effectiveness of clinical treatments for IBD.">

        <tr id="After acute lesions in the central nervous system (CNS), the interaction of microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating immune cells decides over their resolution or chronification. However, this CNS-intrinsic cross-talk is poorly characterized. Analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients as well as CNS samples of female mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, we identify microglia-derived TGFα as key factor driving recovery. Through mechanistic in vitro studies, in vivo treatment paradigms, scRNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9 genetic perturbation models and MRI in the EAE model, we show that together with other glial and non-glial cells, microglia secrete TGFα in a highly regulated temporospatial manner in EAE. Here, TGFα contributes to recovery by decreasing infiltrating T cells, pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage and neuron loss even at late disease stages. In a therapeutic approach in EAE, blood-brain barrier penetrating intranasal application of TGFα attenuates pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes and CNS infiltrating immune cells while promoting neuronal survival and lesion resolution. Together, microglia-derived TGFα is an important mediator of glial-immune crosstalk, highlighting its therapeutic potential in resolving acute CNS inflammation.">

        <tr id="Background Explosive tumor growth is characterized by rapid tumor growth in a short time period. Currently, there is no precise scientific definition for the condition, which is often accompanied with a poor clinical prognosis. Herein, we presented a study of a young patient with colon cancer who experienced explosive tumor growth. A clinical multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaborated with bioinformaticians to provide precise treatment and elucidate the biological mechanisms underpinning this growth. Methods A 28-year-old male patient diagnosed with colon cancer experienced explosive tumor growth. Peripheral bloods (PB) during immunotherapy were collected for immune cytokine analyses and flow cytometry assays on immune cell subsets. To further examine the underlying mechanisms of this explosive-growth, we conducted whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of samples taken at different time points. Results The patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. We implemented an immunotherapy and performed PB immune cytokine assays before, during, and after this therapy. Our observations suggested that immunotherapy may remodel interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling and enhance T cell-mediated immune responses. By exploring explosive tumor growth mechanisms, we observed that tumors had significantly less insertion and deletion (INDEL) mutations and INDEL-derived neoantigens. Additionally, they had deficient antigen presentation functions as characterized by decreased IFN-γ signaling activity. Conclusions Neoantigen loss and decreased IFN-γ signaling activity contributed to explosive tumor growth in this patient. Recovered IFN-γ signaling may lead to effective immunotherapy outcomes.

        <tr id="Background Organ transplantation is a life-saving option for end-stage organ dysfunction, but long-term graft survival is limited by unavoidable allograft rejection. While endometrial regenerative cells (ERCs) have been shown to alleviate acute rejection, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study explored whether ERC-derived exosomes contribute to this effect through CD73-mediated immunoregulation. Methods ERCs were pretreated with GW4869, an exosome inhibitor, to block exosome secretion, and CRISPR-Cas9-based CD73 knockout was performed to validate the role of CD73 in the ERC and ERC-exos. CD73 enzyme activity was measured using an AMP assay in vitro, whereas ATP, AMP, and adenosine levels were quantified using mass spectrometry in vivo. A murine allogeneic heart transplantation model (BALB/c to C57BL/6) was established to evaluate the immunoregulatory effects of ERC-exos in vivo. Graft tissues were analyzed by H&E staining, and immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analysis of the spleens were performed to assess graft rejection. In vitro, flow cytometry was used to examine CD4+ T-cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, and subsets. Adenosine receptor inhibitors were used to identify receptor-mediated CD73-exosome signaling, and the potential of combining CD73-expressing exosomes with rapamycin to promote long-term graft survival was explored. Results GW4869 reduces the ability of ERCs to inhibit CD4+ T-cell activation and proliferation in vitro and attenuates the ERC-mediated suppression of acute allograft rejection in vivo. ATP, AMP and ADO increase adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR) but not A2bR expression on CD4+ T cells. CD73-expressing ERC-derived exosomes (ERC-exos) metabolize AMP into adenosine, leading to the inhibition of CD4+ T-cell activation, proliferation, and Th1 differentiation in vitro. This regulatory effect is reversed by the A2a receptor inhibitor CPI444. Furthermore, CD73 depletion blocks ERC-derived exosome-mediated adenosine production and impairs the ability of these cells to inhibit CD4+ T-cell activation and proliferation in vitro, as well as attenuate acute cardiac allograft rejection in vivo. Finally, the combination of ERC-exos with rapamycin significantly prolonged allograft survival from 15 days with rapamycin monotherapy to 38 days. Conclusion CD73 expression is crucial for the ability of ERC-exos to generate adenosine to mitigate acute cardiac allograft rejection in mice. ERC-exos combined with rapamycin can prolong allograft survival. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13287-025-04398-z.">

        <tr id="Introduction: Recent studies have shown that Erythroid progenitor cells exhibit a distinct immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory phenotype associated with the response to bacteria. Methods: The objective of this study was to comprehensively explore the traits of human bone marrow Erythroid cells through protein–protein interaction network analysis using cytokine secretion analysis, and single-cell immunoproteomic analysis using flow cytometry, as well as the re-analysis of publicly available human and mouse bone marrow Erythroid-cell transcriptomic data. Results: Our protein–protein interaction network analysis of human bone marrow Erythroid-cell protein-coding genes identified enrichment in the immune response to lipopolysaccharide, with Calprotectin and Cathepsin G being the main factors. We then mapped the Calprotectin to the CD45+ Erythroid cells of both humans and mice via the analysis of the publicly available scRNA-seq data. Additionally, we observed that human bone marrow Erythroid cells secrete cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1b, IL-8, and IL-18, which are also mainly involved in the immune response to lipopolysaccharide. We also found that human and mouse bone marrow Erythroid-cell conditional media inhibit bacterial growth in vitro. Discussion: These findings suggest that both human and mouse bone marrow CD45+ Erythroid cells possess the potential to combat pathogenic microbes and thus play a role in innate antimicrobial immunity. Conclusions: CD45+ Erythroid cells are a potent immunoregulatory cell population in both humans and mice.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, and despite improvements in treatment options such as surgery and radiotherapy, its survival rate remains low. With increased research in immunotherapy, antibodies against various immune checkpoints like programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) have been shown to be effective against a wide range of tumors. Nonetheless, survival benefits gained by HNSCC patients remain limited. T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3), an emerging immune checkpoint molecule, is found to be expressed in HNSCC and is involved in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). TIM-3 is significant in the initiation and progression of HNSCC by modulating effector T cells, innate immune cells, and other components of the immune system. Inhibiting TIM-3 can restore T cell function and enhance the immune response against HNSCC, making it a promising immunotherapeutic target for this disease. This article reviews the expression of TIM-3 in HNSCC and its immunomodulatory mechanism and briefly introduces the combined application and development prospects of TIM-3 as a potential immunotherapeutic target.">

Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed that the cardiopulmonary vasculature is composed of diverse EC subpopulations, some of which exhibit specialized immunomodulatory properties. Evidence for immunomodulation includes distinct expression profiles associated with antigen presentation, cytokine secretion, immune cell recruitment, translocation, and clearance — functions critical for maintaining homeostasis in the heart and lungs. In cardiopulmonary diseases, ECs undergo substantial transcriptional reprogramming, leading to a shift from homeostasis to an activated state marked by heightened immunomodulatory activity.

        <tr id="Abstract The small intestine is essential for digestion, nutrient absorption, immune regulation, and microbial balance. Its epithelial lining, containing specialized cells like Paneth cells and tuft cells, is crucial for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Paneth cells produce antimicrobial peptides and growth factors that support microbial regulation and intestinal stem cells, while tuft cells act as chemosensors, detecting environmental changes and modulating immune responses. Along with immune cells such as intraepithelial lymphocytes, innate lymphoid cells, T cells, and macrophages, they form a strong defense system that protects the epithelial barrier. Disruptions in this balance contribute to chronic inflammation, microbial dysbiosis, and compromised barrier function—key features of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and metabolic syndromes. Furthermore, dysfunctions in the small intestine and immune cells are linked to systemic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and autoimmune disorders. Recent research highlights promising therapeutic strategies, including modulation of epithelial and immune cell functions, probiotics, and gene editing to restore gut health and address systemic effects. This review emphasizes the pivotal roles of small intestinal epithelia and immune cells in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, their involvement in disease development, and emerging treatments for intestinal and systemic disorders.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constitutes more than 90% of the primary tumor of the liver. Metabolic reprogramming is decisive in promoting HCC development. The new metabolic program drives the surrounding immune cells to an immune suppressive commitment, enabling tumor survival. The enhanced metabolic activity of cancer cells leads to competition for essential nutrients, depriving non-malignant cells of critical resources. Simultaneously, the accumulation of metabolic byproducts within the tumor microenvironment (TME) selectively favors innate immune responses while impairing adaptive immunity. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy underscore the importance of targeting both immune cell function and metabolic pathways. In this context, reprogramming the metabolism of effector and regulatory immune cells represents a promising therapeutic avenue. This review focuses on a relatively underexplored aspect of liver cancer immunology, the immunosuppressive role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) driven by metabolic alterations and how these mechanisms contribute to the suppression of effective anti-tumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the malignancies with the highest mortality rates, and outcomes are particularly poor in cases of liver metastasis. Early or recurrent metastatic PDAC significantly worsens patient outcomes and presents substantial clinical challenges. Checkpoint-based immunotherapy has largely been ineffective for most pancreatic cancer patients. This ineffectiveness is not well understood, as clinical trials often involve patients with advanced diseases, such as liver and peritoneal metastases, while most preclinical studies focus on primary tumors. Recent findings indicate that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) is a major obstacle to effective immunotherapy in PDAC, with the metastatic immune microenvironment differing significantly from that of primary tumors. This review explores the distinct immunosuppressive mechanisms at various stages of PDAC progression, including primary tumors, pre-metastatic niches, and metastatic sites. Myeloid cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), play pivotal roles in shaping the TME and suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Particular focus is placed on current clinical immunotherapy strategies targeting myeloid cells, and combinations with conventional chemoradiotherapy, considering contemporary knowledge and future trends. Advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics have provided deeper insights into the molecular intricacies and diversity of PDAC, revealing potential therapeutic targets. Innovative strategies targeting myeloid cells, including CD40 agonists and CSF-1R inhibitors, are being explored to reprogram the TME and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that expand aberrantly in cancer and exhibit potent immunosuppressive properties. They contribute to tumor progression through both immunological and nonimmunological mechanisms. Immunologically, MDSCs suppress antitumor responses by inhibiting effector cells such as T cells and NK cells, facilitating immune evasion. Nonimmunologically, they promote tumor growth and metastasis through processes such as the epithelial‒mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and premetastatic niche formation. MDSC accumulation is closely linked to accelerated tumor progression, including resistance to both immunotherapies and conventional treatments, making these cells critical therapeutic targets. Clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of MDSC‐targeted strategies to improve treatment efficacy. However, challenges remain in achieving specificity and effectiveness in MDSC‐targeted therapies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of their biology. This review summarizes the origin, classification, and biological characteristics of MDSCs, their dual roles in tumor progression, and their clinical significance. We also discuss recent advances in clinical and preclinical studies, including both traditional targeted therapies and emerging innovative strategies. By integrating current findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective on the role of MDSCs in cancer and valuable insights for advancing cancer treatment and drug development.">

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-(L)1 pathways have revolutionized the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since last decade. However, the efficacy is still limited because the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) restricts ICI-primed T cell immunity. Therefore, it is quite crucial to block the potential mechanisms in inducing immunosuppression to improve ICI efficacy. Immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) 5 is an important immunosuppressive molecule expressed in a wide range of myeloid cells and predicts tumor progression. Our group was the first to report ILT5 expression in solid tumor cells (colorectal cancer). However, the expression and function of ILT5 in NSCLC are still unknown.
 Methods:
 ILT5 expression in NSCLC tissues and tumor cell lines was determined by PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence. The impact of tumor-derived ILT5 on T-cell phenotypes and functions was evaluated using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. ILT5-regulated downstream signals and molecules were determined by RNA sequencing, PCR, western blotting, and flow cytometry. Tumor transplantation and immunotherapeutic models were established in C57/BL6 and NSG mice to explore the effect of ILT5 on tumor progression and the synergies of ILT5 blockade with ICIs.
 Results:
 ILT5 is highly expressed in NSCLC cells, predicting poor patient survival. ILT5 induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion rather than senescence and apoptosis in the TME. Mechanistically, ILT5 upregulated PD-L1 through the activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn increased PD-1 expression in CD8
 +
 T cells and induced their exhaustion. PIR-B (ILT5 orthlog in mice) overexpression in mice induced CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion and tumor growth in vivo, while PIR-B knockdown had the opposite effect. More importantly, inhibition of ILT5 synergistically enhanced the tumoricidal effect of PD-1 inhibitor in NSCLC immunotherapeutic models.
 Conclusions:
 Enriched ILT5 expression in NSCLC cells induces CD8
 +
 T cell exhaustion via activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR-PD-L1 pathway. ILT5 inhibition synergistically enhanced the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor. Our findings identifies a novel mechanism for tumor immunosuppression and develops a promising strategy for improving ICI efficacy.

        <tr id="Numerous studies have demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry a variety of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which can be taken up by neighboring cells or transported to distant sites via bodily fluids, thereby facilitating intercellular communication and regulating multiple cellular functions. Within the tumor microenvironment, EV-ncRNA, on the one hand, regulate the expression of PD-L1, thereby influencing tumor immune evasion, promoting tumor cell proliferation, and enhancing tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis in vivo. On the other hand, these specific EV-ncRNAs can also modulate the functions of immune cells (such as CD8 + T cells, macrophages, and NK cells) through various molecular mechanisms, inducing an immunosuppressive microenvironment and promoting resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Therefore, delving into the molecular mechanisms underlying EV-ncRNA regulation of immune checkpoints presents compelling therapeutic prospects for strategies that selectively target EV-ncRNAs. In this review, we elaborate on the cutting-edge research progress related to EV-ncRNAs in the context of cancer and dissect their pivotal roles in the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway. We also highlight the promising clinical applications of EV-ncRNAs in anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, bridging basic research with practical clinical applications. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The thymus exhibits constitutive activation of nearly all major inflammatory pathways, including sterile MyD88‐dependent signaling and interferon production by mTECs, the presence of cellular and molecular components of type 1, type 2, and type 3 responses, as well as sustained B cell activation. The reasons for the existence of such a complex constitutively active inflammatory network at the site of T cell development—where the initial pathogen encounter is unlikely—have remained enigmatic. We propose that this inflammatory thymic ‘ecosystem’ has evolved to promote immunological tolerance to ‘inflammatory self’—endogenous molecules absent from most peripheral tissues at steady state but upregulated during pathogen invasion. The spatial and temporal overlap with pathogen presence makes the discrimination of the inflammatory self from pathogen‐derived molecules a unique challenge for the adaptive immune system. The frequent occurrence of diseases associated with autoantibodies against proinflammatory cytokines underscores the persistent risk of these molecules being misidentified as foreign. Their abundant representation in the thymus, therefore, is likely to be critical for maintaining tolerance. This review explores current insights into the thymic inflammatory network, its cellular and molecular constituents, and their role in the induction of T cell tolerance.">

Structurally and functionally resembling lymph nodes, TLS are primarily composed of B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and other immune cell populations. Critically, TLS serve as direct sites for initiating anti-tumor immune responses. Within tumors, TLS facilitate the accumulation of immune cells—particularly effector subsets such as cytotoxic T cells and antibody-producing B cells—in the tumor microenvironment, thereby establishing a localized hub for both cellular and humoral immunity. This localized immune activation correlates with improved patient prognosis and enhanced responses to immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the organization, formation drivers, detection markers, and the interplay between TLS and tumor-associated genes. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of TLS as biomarkers for immunotherapy efficacy and their translational clinical applications.">

Conversely, MSCs also demonstrate potential inhibitory effects on AML, including the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and the modulation of immune responses. These contrasting effects highlight the complexities of MSC-AML interactions and emphasize the need for further research to understand their therapeutic potential fully. Targeting MSCs represents a promising avenue for AML treatment. Strategies aimed at modifying MSC-mediated support of AML cells, such as inhibiting pro-survival signaling pathways, disrupting the leukemia-supportive niche, and enhancing the immune-stimulatory functions of MSCs, could offer novel therapeutic approaches. However, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of current research. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the dual effects of MSCs in AML, to identify biomarkers that predict patient response to MSC-targeted therapies, and to develop strategies to overcome potential challenges associated with MSC-based interventions. In conclusion, understanding the multifaceted role of MSCs in AML pathogenesis is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic approaches. By harnessing the potential of MSCs and targeting their interactions with AML cells, we can explore novel strategies to improve treatment outcomes and enhance the overall management of this challenging hematological malignancy.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are functionally diverse stromal regulators that orchestrate tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance through dynamic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent advances in single‐cell multiomics and spatial transcriptomics have identified conserved CAF subtypes with distinct molecular signatures, spatial distributions, and context‐dependent roles, highlighting their dual capacity to promote immunosuppression or restrain tumor growth. However, therapeutic strategies struggle to reconcile this functional duality, hindering clinical translation. This review systematically categorizes CAF subtypes by origin, biomarkers, and TME‐specific functions, focusing on their roles in chemoresistance, maintenance of stemness, and formation of immunosuppressive niches. We evaluate emerging targeting approaches, including selective depletion of tumor‐promoting subsets (e.g., fibroblast activation protein+ CAFs), epigenetic reprogramming toward antitumor phenotypes, and inhibition of CXCL12/CXCR4 or transforming growth factor‐beta signaling pathways. Spatial multiomics‐driven combinatorial therapies, such as the synergistic use of CAFs and immune checkpoint inhibitors, are highlighted as strategies to overcome microenvironment‐driven resistance. By integrating CAF biology with translational advances, this work provides a roadmap for developing subtype‐specific biomarkers and precision stromal therapies, directly informing efforts to disrupt tumor‐stroma coevolution. Key concepts include spatial transcriptomics, stromal reprogramming, and tumor‐stroma coevolution, offering actionable insights for both mechanistic research and clinical innovation.">

 Background:
 Antitumor immunity has become a critical focus in improving Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) patient outcomes. Among various immune features, tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have emerged as crucial players in tumor immunity. Nevertheless, the specific role of B cells within TLS and their interaction with naive T cells in PSCC remain largely unclear. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the role of CD74⁺ B cells in TLS and their impact on immune regulation in PSCC.
 Methods:
 Spatial transcriptomics produced 519,608 cellular profiles from tumor samples of 18 patients. Additionally, scRNA-seq on tissues from 21 patients yielded 150,540 cells. Bulk RNA-seq was performed on tissues from 55 patients. TLS were identified and visualized using the DBSCAN algorithm, which clusters B cells, T cells, and DCs. Survival analyses were conducted to examine the association between TLS density and patient outcomes. Moreover, immune activity and cell infiltration were assessed via AUCell and CIBERSORT, while pseudotime analysis was used to explore dynamic gene expression changes during cell development. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis identified key signaling pathways, and intercellular signaling was analyzed through cell communication models.
 Results:
 TLS, accurately identified using the DBSCAN algorithm, were significantly associated with improved prognosis in PSCC patients (Internal cohort, n = 152, P < 0.01; External cohort, n=63, P < 0.05). The spatial distribution, a high density of B cells was observed within the TLS regions. Notably, CD74⁺ B cells were enriched within TLS, particularly during early developmental stages. Mapped the spatially in situ developmental trajectory of CD74⁺ B cells and uncovered the dynamic changes in gene expression throughout their maturation process, we observed that CD74⁺ B cells within the TLS of PSCC patients predominantly exhibited features of early developmental stages. In line with this, scRNA-seq data further validated these observations. These cells, through their HLA molecules, interacted with CD4/CD8 ligands on naive T cells, thereby activating critical transcription factors such as NFKB1, NFKB2, NFATC1, NFATC2, FOS, and RUNX1. This interaction ultimately amplified immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, patients with higher CD74⁺ B cell expression exhibited better responses to immunotherapy (pCR : P < 0.01and CR: P < 0.01) and underscoring the therapeutic relevance of these cells.
 Conclusions:
 By activating naive T cells through antigen presentation, CD74⁺ B cells within TLS significantly enhance local immune responses in PSCC. Thus, CD74⁺ B cells not only serve as a promising biomarker but also represent a potential therapeutic target, providing novel insights into the immunological mechanisms underlying PSCC progression and response to immunotherapy.

        <tr id="Simple Summary The management of HNC is a major global challenge, with chemo-radiotherapy resistance and a low 5-year survival rate. Recently, the FDA has approved anti-PD1/PDL1-based immunotherapies for the better management and longer survival of HNC patients. However, immune-escaping mechanisms mitigate the antitumoral effect of anti-PD-1/PD-L1-based therapies. Dysregulated miRNAs are increasingly recognized as key players in immune evasion mechanisms through the modulation of several immune signaling pathways that are essential for antitumor immune responses. In this study, we aimed to identify miRNAs whose dysregulation is closely associated with immune-escaping mechanisms and lower survival rates in HNC patients. The present study found some key miRNAs that are associated with lower survival rates and immune evasion mechanisms. Targeting the identified miRNAs can help modulate immune evasion mechanisms and possibly enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies, including other immune checkpoint therapies in HNC.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory B cell (Breg), known for its immunosuppressive properties through the provision of IL-10, plays a critical role in the control of inflammatory diseases. Although Breg has been discovered for over two decades in mammals, its existence in non-mammalian vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the differentiation mechanism and functional profiles of teleost CD25L+ Breg to gain insights into the origin and evolution of Breg. Methods Flow cytometry, RNA-seq, qPCR, morphological analysis, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, recombinant IL-35 stimulation, cell co-culture in Transwell system were performed to reveal the phenotypic features, differentiation mechanism and suppressive functions of teleost CD25L+ Breg. To elucidate the immunoregulatory role of CD25L+ Breg in vivo, bacterial infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) models were established in teleost fish. Systemic and local inflammatory responses were assessed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, histological analysis, and cytokine measurements. Results Phenotypically, we identified a unique IgM+CD25L+ B cell subset, termed CD25L+ B cells, characterized by their capacity to produce IL-10 and IL-12p35 in a cold-blooded vertebrate, the grass carp. Mechanistically, IL-35 stimulation induced the differentiation of CD25L− B cells into CD25L+ B cells, promoting the production of IL-35 and IL-10 via STAT3 activation. Functionally, teleost CD25L+ B cells served as a conventional Breg subtype that exerted its immunosuppressive functions on effector T cells and neutrophils via cell contact or cytokine delivery. Upon bacterial infection, CD25L+ Breg increased earlier than CD25L+ Treg and produced IL-10. In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD model, Breg frequency and IL-10 levels increased significantly during IBD remission, and Breg adoptive transfer could prevent IBD development and contribute to intestinal tissue repair. Conclusions These novel findings reveal that fish have evolved Breg with specialized anti-inflammatory functions, providing evolutionary insights into the phylogenetic origin and functional conservation of Breg from fish to mammals.

        <tr id="Compelling clinical evidence strongly indicates that anti-angiogenesis therapeutics including Bevacizumab, a humanised anti-VEGF mAb, can alleviate the resistance to immunotherapy. We explored the direct modulation of Bevacizumab on endothelial cell (EC) immune response including surface expression of adhesion and MHC molecules and EC-elicited proliferation of immune cells under inflammatory conditions. Flow cytometry showed that addition of VEGF inhibited TNF-α stimulation of expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on HUVECs, whereas Bevacizumab enhanced this TNF-α-stimulated expression. The presence of MHC Class I on HUVECs was decreased by VEGF and increased by TNF-α, respectively. Bevacizumab reversed VEGF downregulation and promoted TNF-α upregulation of MHC class I expression, suggesting that anti-VEGF treatment can boost the endothelial immunological reaction, a prerequisite for immune cell trafficking. Functionally, real-time monitoring of the proliferation of human PBMCs co-cultured on HUVEC monolayers over 3 days showed opposing effects on the proliferation of PBMCs between VEGF and TNF-α. Consistently, Bevacizumab antagonised VEGF suppression and sensitized TNF-α activation of PBMC growth over the time course. In line with these findings, Bevacizumab increased the surface expression of CD69 on VEGF-treated T cells collected from PBMCs after 3-day co-cultures with HUVECs. Furthermore, the proliferation of CD3+, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was promoted via Bevacizumab. Collectively, this study demonstrates that targeting VEGF can enhance the immune response of ECs required for T cell recruitment. Our findings provide insights to a deeper understanding of increased vascular inflammatory response conferred by anti-VEGF treatment in addition to inhibiting angiogenesis, which supports its favourable dual role in the positive immunological synergism with immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background A head and neck cancer organoid (HNCO) and peripheral blood T cell co-culture model was established to investigate whether HNCOs can induce the differentiation of peripheral blood T cells into tumor-reactive T cells. Additionally, this study seeks to explore the cytotoxicity of these T cells against autologous tumor organoids, providing theoretical and experimental evidence for the feasibility of this model as a platform for adoptive cell immunotherapy in head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods HNCO single cells were co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) collected and isolated from patients with HNC. The culture supernatant was collected and assayed for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α). The expression of T cell activation markers cluster of differentiation (CD)137 and CD107a was measured by flow cytometry to confirm tumor specificity and cytotoxicity. Additionally, the optimal effector-to-target (E/T) ratio was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, and HNCO killing was quantified by fluorescent labeling. Results Of the 27 successfully established HNCO-T cell co-culture systems, 81.48% induced the in vitro differentiation and tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell expansion capable of mediating the killing of mature HNCOs. Conclusion The patient-derived HNCO-T cell co-culture model effectively induced PBL differentiation into tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells with enhanced tumor-killing activities. This model serves as a novel in vitro preclinical tool for advancing personalized adoptive immunotherapy in HNC.">

However, their functions in vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) remain underexplored. In this review, we first describe the development of macrophages and the heterogeneity of macrophage differentiation, then present current insights into macrophages’ involvement across key stages of VCA, including ischemia–reperfusion injury at the peri-transplantation stage, and the outcomes following transplantation, including acute rejection, chronic rejection, and development of transplantation tolerance. The existing evidence supports that macrophages significantly influence both short- and long-term VCA graft survival. The presence of vascularized bone marrow within some VCA grafts further suggests the involvement of donor bone marrow-derived macrophage population and adds another layer of complexity to immune dynamics. Collectively, current understanding highlights the macrophage as a promising target for therapeutic intervention and warrants continued investigation into their diverse functions and potential for improving VCA outcomes.">

This study investigated alterations in the tumor-immune microenvironment related to the response to preoperative combination therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty patients underwent combination therapy. Biopsy or surgical specimens were obtained before and after treatment. Single-cell-based, 14-marker multiplex immunohistochemistry and image cytometry were employed to assess changes in immune cell densities and profiles. Three distinct immune profiles were identified: hypo-, lymphoid-, and myeloid-inflamed. Significant decreases in tumor volume and increases in CD45+ cells and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) scores were observed in the hypo- and lymphoid-inflamed groups, whereas the myeloid-inflamed group showed minimal changes. After treatment, increased calreticulin expression in tumor cells, together with increased lymphoid cell lineages, was observed in non-recurrent cases. The myeloid-inflamed group exhibited higher expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1α and zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2, suggesting the presence of a hypoxic and metastasis-promoting environment. Spatial analysis revealed that responders had a high infiltration of T cells within tumor cell nests, whereas non-responders had fewer T cells, with β-catenin expression in cancer cells. Upregulated lymphocyte activation gene 3 in the myeloid-inflammation group, and PD-L1 dynamics suggest potential targets for further therapy. These findings highlight the need for targeted neoadjuvant strategies based on immune profiling.">

        <tr id="Bronchiectasis is a chronic airway disease characterized by dysbiosis, persistent inflammation, and permanent structural airway damage. Neutrophilic inflammation is a key pathogenic feature, as indicated by enhanced neutrophil-derived proteases and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), associated with poor prognosis. However, recent studies have identified an eosinophilic endotype in up to 30% of patients, characterized by higher levels of type 2 (T2) cytokines and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). The role of T helper (Th) cells in the dysregulated inflammatory environment of bronchiectasis remains unclear. Evidence suggests that persistent bacterial infection can skew adaptive immunity from Th1 toward Th2 response, while the airway microbiome-IL-17 axis is also a critical regulator of chronic inflammation. T regulatory (Treg) cells have been shown to play a protective role against excessive chronic inflammation by modulating the function of several types of effector cells, including the Th17 subset. However, the capacity of this subset to delay or prevent disease progression remains to be determined Microbial dysbiosis, with loss of diversity and increased quantity of bacterial pathogens, may also be important for disease progression, and emerging evidence indicates that distinct inflammatory endotypes associate with specific microbiota alterations, especially in severe disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the immune cells and cytokine signaling that are involved in the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis. Additionally, we present the main endotypes of bronchiectasis and explore the relationships between the type of inflammation and alterations in microbiota, as well as the potential benefits of targeting specific pathophysiological mechanisms for the management of bronchiectasis. This review also examines how bacterial infection can shift adaptive immunity from Th1 toward Th2 responses, the role of the airway microbiome-IL-17 axis in chronic inflammation and the potential protective role of Treg cells against excessive inflammation. Novel therapeutic strategies are highlighted, with focus on targeting specific cytokine signaling pathways and restoring Th17/Treg balance These developments underscore a shift toward precision medicine in bronchiectasis, emphasizing the importance of identifying specific inflammatory endotypes to tailor treatment strategies effectively.">

 Background:
 Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is typically reversible in CAR-T therapy, while hyperinflammatory syndromes like macrophage activation-like syndrome (MAS-L) and high-grade immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (IEC-HS) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early interventions are critical for improving outcomes. We aim to analyze clinical cytokine assays and cellular phenotypes early in hyperinflammatory syndromes to identify profiles for severe cases to inform management decisions.
 Methods:
 This study included 113 CAR-T patients (pt) (September 2019-March 2024) with cytokine profiles (CP) performed at the second tocilizumab dose or with suspected hyperinflammatory states (CP1), followed by assessments at 24 hours (CP24) and 48 hours (CP48). 52 pts consented to blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cell immune phenotyping at pre-treatment (pre-LD) and day 1 for PB.
 Results:
 Among the 113 pts, CRS pts (N=74), when compared to MAS-L(N=19) & IEC-HS (N=20) at CP1, had lower levels of TNF (median in pg/mL; 31, 62.9, 47.7) , IL-18 (794, 1353, 2011), and MCP-1 (689, 2722, 2485.5). While MAS-L and IEC-HS had similar CP1 profiles, CP24 and CP48 differed between them: TNF & MCP-1 levels decreased in MAS-L but remained elevated or increased in IEC-HS. IL-18 was stable in MAS-L but increased steadily daily in IEC-HS. Infections were more frequent in IEC-HS (CRS: 43%; MAS-L: 58%; IEC-HS: 85%; p=0.002). Notably, patients who died with persistent
 E. faecium
 bacteremia had higher IL-18 in CP48. In the 52 pts with cell phenotypes available by flow, 33 had CRS, 18 MAS-L and 8 IEC-HS. The correlation between cell phenotypes and cytokine levels showed that elevated TNF at CP1 correlated with increased non-classical monocytes in pre-LD BM and higher NK and NK-T cells in pre-LD PB. Similarly, elevated IL-18 CP48 levels correlated with increased CD8 T-cells, NK-T cells, and intermediate monocytes in pre-LD PB, as well as increased NK cells at both pre-LD and day 1 (Table).
 Conclusions:
 We report distinct cytokine profiles in IEC-HS early in the inflammatory course post-CAR-T therapy. These elevated cytokines correlate with specific immune cell subsets, including BM-resident monocytes, intermediate monocytes with heightened cytokine trafficking and inflammatory capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility for identifying potential biomarkers for early risk stratification and targeted interventions.

        <tr id="Innate immune memory (trained immunity) refers to the ability of innate immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, to retain a long-term imprint of a prior stimulus through epigenetic and metabolic adaptations, enabling amplified responses upon restimulation. Recent studies have classified innate immune memory into central and peripheral types. Central innate immune memory originates in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the bone marrow, where epigenetic reprogramming generates a sustained inflammatory bias, contributing to chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart failure, and stroke. Peripheral innate immune memory occurs in monocytes or macrophages that acquire heightened responsiveness after repeated exposure to stimuli in peripheral tissues. This review explores the mechanisms underlying both central and peripheral innate immune memory, their roles in chronic inflammatory diseases, focusing on cardiovascular diseases, and potential strategies to target innate immune memory for therapeutic purposes. Advancing the understanding of these processes could facilitate the development of novel approaches to control inflammatory diseases and immune-related disorders.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common malignant tumor that imposes heavily public health burdens worldwide. Systemic therapies for gastric cancer (GC), such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, have undergone significant advancements. Nevertheless, the extensive application of anti-cancer agents has resulted in an increasing array of challenges related to drug resistance, presenting a substantial barrier in GC treatment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) as essential immunomodulators within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of GC, providing novel therapeutic targets due to their capacity for plasticity in reaction to environmental signals. They create a complex network of communication with various immune and stromal cell types, thereby contributing to the immunosuppressive nature of the TME in GC. In this review, we establish the map of the origin and polarization of macrophages in GC. During the process of carcinogenesis, macrophages undergo dynamic phenotypic transitions. Additionally, the interactions between TAMs and tumor cells significantly influence the progression of GC, affecting tumor growth, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. Furthermore, this intricate immunomodulatory axis notably enhances resistance to immunotherapy, suggesting that targeting TAMs presents substantial therapeutic opportunities for patients with GC. Approaches such as TAM elimination, TAM repolarization, and CAR-M therapy have been validated in numerous studies. We also elaborate on the challenges faced by the development of targeting TAMs, which may provide innovative perspectives on the GC treatment.">

        <tr id="Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by massive inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and subsequent axonal injury and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology of MS remains unclear and there is not yet a definitive therapeutic schedule for the disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), exhibiting neuroimmune-modulatory functions to alleviate various autoimmune diseases, show great potential in the treatment of MS. However, the instability of BMSCs-mediated immunosuppression in vivo has limited their application. MiR181-a, a positive regulator of immune balance, which has a preference for T cells and B cells differentiation, but degrade rapidly upon entering systemic circulation due to their unstable molecular structure. Methods We propose a synergistic therapy approach that combines the penetrative targeting capability of BMSCs with the immuno-modulatory effects of miR181-a by overexpressing miR181-a to BMSCs through lentivirus packaging system. With this strategy, on the basis of the establishment of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, miR181-a overexpressing BMSCs (miR181a-BMSCs) would have a stronger immuno-modulatory treatment benefit, in terms of attenuating MS development. Results Indicate that this method prolongs the modulatory effects of BMSCs and resulted in significantly enhancements of the proliferation of regulatory B cells (Bregs), regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the inhibition of Th17 cells compared to the traditional BMSCs group. Moreover, 10-fold miRNA’s concentration in the exosome of miR181a-BMSCs, leading to an increased duration of miRNAs to exert their biological effects. By immunotherapy and synergistic treatment, the effectiveness of the treatment is significantly enhanced, showing consistent results in different groups of the animal model. Conclusions This strategy takes advantage of BMSCs and miRNA and thus presents an effective synergistic strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Unfortunately, DC functions are disrupted by the tumor microenvironment. Suppressive cytokines, for instance, can impair DC maturation, reduce antigen-presenting capacity, or induce DC apoptosis. A novel strategy against such challenges is reprogramming cancer cells into DC-like cells. By inducing transcription factors, cancer cells can be directed to develop a DC phenotype, which is characterized by enhanced antigen-presenting markers, co-stimulatory molecules, and an increased ability to prime naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, showing enhanced immune activation and tumor regression. However, limitations remain, including reprogramming efficiency, tumor heterogeneity, and safety issues that require further refinement. This review provides fundamental knowledge about DC in the tumor microenvironment and cell fate reprogramming, recent advances in reprogramming cancer cells into DCs, and eventually discusses perspectives for translating this approach into clinical settings. This innovative reprogramming strategy holds the potential to overcome current limitations in cancer immunotherapy, offering a novel avenue for durable anti-tumor immunity">

        <tr id="The autoimmune response driving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) destruction in immune-mediated aplastic anemia (AA) remains incompletely understood. We previously identified a disease-specific immune cell network involving T-, B-, and myeloid cells. However, the interactions within this network, the interaction with the microenvironment and the chronological events in AA development, remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to characterize the changes occurring during disease development and to define the interactions between potential autoreactive cells and their target. Using imaging mass cytometry, we analyzed bone marrow (BM) biopsies from AA patients at diagnosis and after treatment with horse-derived anti-thymocyte globulin (hATG), and six controls. Within the hypocellular BM architecture, we identified lymphoid-dominant 'immune hotspots' with high densities of pro-inflammatory lymphocytes, and macrophage-enriched hotspots that additionally contained activated macrophages in proximity to progenitors. These immune hotspots potentially represent sites where the active immune response resulting in HSPC destruction takes place. In BM regions depleted of progenitors, effector cells with a differentiated phenotype remain. Our data indicate that HSPC destruction in AA is mediated by coordinated interactions among specific immune cell subpopulations. As the immune response progresses and HSPCs are depleted, the immune composition shifts, with activated T- and B-cells differentiating into terminally differentiated T-cells and plasma cells. In patients with normalizing BM post-hATG treatment, most immune hotspots were depleted, underscoring their potential pathogenic role. Collectively, our study visualizes the complex interactions among immune cell subpopulations and, for the first time, reveals the order of events in the immune-mediated pathogenesis of AA.">

        <tr id="Macrophages are key players in the immune system, exhibiting remarkable plasticity that allows them to influence cancer progression in opposing ways. Their polarization into M1 or M2 subtypes dictates their impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME). M1 macrophages, characterized by pro-inflammatory and anti-tumor functions, release cytokines that enhance immune responses and promote tumor destruction. Conversely, M2 macrophages support tumor growth by facilitating angiogenesis, immune suppression, and tissue remodeling, thereby creating a favorable environment for cancer progression. Further classification of M2 macrophages into subtypes M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d underscores their diverse roles in tumor development, metastasis, and immune evasion. Given their crucial role in shaping the TME, macrophages have become a major focus in cancer research. Recent therapeutic strategies aim to reprogram macrophages, shifting their phenotype from tumor-promoting to tumor-suppressive. By targeting macrophage polarization, researchers seek to develop novel immunotherapies that enhance treatment efficacy, improve patient outcomes, and combat therapy resistance in cancer.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown limited efficacy against solid tumors because of poor tissue penetration, constrained activity, and early exhaustion due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although stimulatory cytokines can counteract immune suppression, their systemic administration entails risk of toxicities and counter-regulatory responses. Here, we leveraged a population of tumor-associated TIE2-expressing macrophages (TEMs) to release interferon-α (IFN-α) and/or orthogonal interleukin-2 (oIL2) at the tumor site. Targeted cytokine delivery rescued CAR T cell functionality against the clinically relevant tumor antigen B7-homolog 3 (B7-H3) in an orthotopic, CAR T cell-refractory, immunocompetent mouse model of glioblastoma (GBM) named mGB2 that recapitulates pathological features of the human disease. Immunophenotypic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that inhibition of premature terminal exhaustion and induction of effector and memory states featuring activation of signaling pathways and transcriptional networks putatively boosted CAR T cell antitumor activity. Furthermore, IFN-α, especially when combined with private oIL2 signaling to CAR T cells, elicited potent endogenous T cell responses against multiple tumor-associated antigens, leading to delayed GBM growth and prolonged mouse survival even with tumors expressing B7-H3 in only a fraction of cells. These data suggest that the combination of TEM-based cytokine delivery and CAR T cells may have synergistic effects and support the further study of this approach for the treatment of patients with GBM.">

However, there has been little success in large-scale clinical trials of myeloid cell modulators. We aim to investigate potential molecular targets for TIMs and disclose the underlying mechanism. Using mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we analyzed 24 spontaneous HCC tissues from mouse. Orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor models were established with or without anti-SIRPα antibody treatment. Patient-derived tumor xenografts model (PDX) was used to identify the CD47-SIRPα axis blocked therapy. In 24 murine spontaneous HCC tissues, we observed that the proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) plus macrophages accounts for 40–90% of TIMs and SIRPα was highly expressed in TIMs, especially in macrophages and MDSCs. Through in vivo experiments, we showed that anti-SIRPα therapy inhibited tumor growth, accompanied by increased CD8+ T cells infiltration and decreased TIMs including MDSCs and macrophages. We found that anti-SIRPα inhibited immunosuppressive function, migration and PD-L1 expression of myeloid cells. In a series of in vivo experiments, we demonstrated the anti-tumor and immune-active effect of SIRPα-blocked therapy. Mechanistically, anti-SIRPα inhibited the immunosuppressive function and PD-L1 expression of TIMs through downregulating PI3K/AKT signaling in myeloid cells. At last, anti-SIRPα enhanced the antitumor effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy in orthotopic and spontaneous murine models. Together, SIRPα blocked therapy reversed the immunosuppressive TIME, which provides a promising therapeutic rationale for increasing the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in treating HCC.">

        <tr id="Background Cerebral malaria (CM), a fatal neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is partially driven by neuronal injury. Emerging evidence highlights exosomes as vital mediators of mast cell–neuron interactions in neurological disease progression. While mast cells and their exosomes were previously shown to exacerbate experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) severity, the specific role of mast cell-derived exosomes in CM-associated neuronal injury remains unclear. Methods Exosomes were isolated from resting and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated P815 mast cells (denoted as RE and AE, respectively) and characterized. These exosomes were administered to ECM mice and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)-infected red blood cell (iRBC)-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells to investigate their functional impact and mechanisms. Results Both RE and AE exhibited spherical morphology (20–100 nm diameter) and expressed exosomal markers (CD9, CD63, and CD81). Compared to infected controls, RE and AE treatments significantly reduced survival time, increased ECM incidence, and exacerbated brain pathology, blood–brain barrier disruption, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, RE and AE administration elevated messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and IL-1β) and increased numbers of neurons expressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, p-IRE1, XBP-1). Notably, AE treatment induced higher morbidity/mortality rates, more severe neuronal injury, and greater ER stress marker expression than RE. In vitro, RE-treated iRBC-stimulated neuronal HT-22 cells showed higher GRP78, CHOP, and XBP-1 mRNA levels than AE-treated cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing revealed three downregulated miRNAs (miR-330-3p, miR-185-5p, and miR-379-5p) and six upregulated miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-187-3p, miR-29c-3p, miR-188-5p, miR-192-5p) in AE versus RE, all previously implicated in targeting GRP78, CHOP, or XBP-1. Conclusions Mast cell-derived exosomes, particularly those from activated cells (AE), exacerbated ECM neuronal injury through partial activation of ER stress pathways.

        <tr id="Abstract Cervical cancer progression is not solely driven by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection but is profoundly influenced by the local immune microenvironment, particularly chronic cytokine imbalances. Unlike the acute cytokine storms observed in infections or sepsis, cervical cancer is characterized by a persistent, low-grade, “smoldering inflammatory response” that fuels tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8 sustain a tumor-supportive milieu, promoting angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and resistance to apoptosis, while immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β dampen anti-tumor immune responses and facilitate immune escape. This review explores chronic cytokine dysregulation in cervical cancer, examining how the prolonged, dysregulated cytokine network shapes the tumor microenvironment, remodels stromal interactions, and influences immune cell recruitment and function. We highlight key cytokines involved in these processes and discuss their clinical significance as potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Understanding these sustained inflammatory processes is critical because they represent a distinct biological landscape compared to acute inflammatory reactions and offer unique windows for therapeutic intervention. The paper reviewed emerging therapeutic strategies targeting these chronic cytokine pathways, including cytokine blockade, immune modulation, and combination approaches integrating immunotherapies or nanomedicine. Addressing chronic cytokine dysregulation holds promise for improving cervical cancer management and patient outcomes.">

Among the diverse cellular components of the tumor microenvironment, fibroblasts have been recognized as key regulators of inflammatory processes. Under tumor-specific conditions, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) undergo differentiation and promote tumor proliferation, metastasis and immune evasion via highly intricate mechanisms. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the reciprocal interactions between CAFs and inflammation, elucidating the mechanisms by which CAFs induce pro-inflammatory signaling and how inflammatory mediators, in turn, potentiate CAF activation and function. Furthermore, innovative therapeutic strategies, including the inhibition of stromal proteins, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and metabolic pathways associated with CAFs, as well as the application of nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, are examined for their potential to impede CAF-mediated tumor progression. Pharmacological agents targeting CAF-associated signaling pathways or inflammatory cytokines show dual efficacy by concurrently modulating inflammatory responses and CAF activity. These approaches frequently demonstrate improved therapeutic efficacy compared to interventions solely directed at CAF surface proteins, highlighting the therapeutic potential of concurrently addressing both inflammation and CAFs to enhance cancer treatment efficacy.">

 Background:
 Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are transient ectopic lymphoid aggregates composed of immune cells such as B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), and have been observed in various solid tumors. TLS are associated with favorable clinical outcomes. While TLS are believed to contribute to adaptive antitumor cellular and humoral responses, the mechanisms driving TLS formation and their immune regulatory functions in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) remain poorly understood.
 Methods:
 We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from 86 MM patients and performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and multiplex IHC (mIHC) to assess TLS density, maturation, and distribution. Clinical data were integrated to investigate the relationship between TLS and patient prognosis in MM. Additionally, single-cell data from 20 patients were analyzed to explore the abundance of immune cell types and subtypes in the TIME at single-cell resolution, along with potential intercellular interactions.
 Results:
 Based on histopathological analysis of MM samples, patients were stratified into two groups: those poccessing TLS (TLS+, n = 44) and those lacking TLS (TLS-, n = 42). Across the entire cohort, the TLS+ group showed a trend toward improved overall survival (OS), though not statistically significant (p = 0.27). A higher proportion of advanced-stage (T3 and T4) patients in the TLS+ group (T1-T3a: TLS- = 12, TLS+ = 5; T3a-T4b: TLS- = 17, TLS+ = 21) may have influenced the prognostic value of TLS in the overall patient cohort. Further supporting this notion, subgroup analysis restricted to patients with AJCC stage IIB and IIC revealed significantly improved OS in the TLS+ group (p = 0.046). Single-cell data revealed significant differences in the abundance of immune-related cells between the TLS+ and TLS- groups. All B cell subtypes (naïve, memory, germinal center (GC), and plasma cells) were enriched in the TLS+ group compared to the TLS- group. CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T cells also exhibited similar trends, whereas the distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells was comparable between the two groups. Furthermore, plasma cells in the TLS+ group were predominantly IgG-producing. Intercellular communication analysis with B cells identified a CAF subpopulation highly expressing TLS-associated genes. A CCL19-CCR7 and CCL21-CCR7 chemokine axis from this CAF subpopulation was observed exclusively in TLS+ tumors but was deficient in TLS- tumors. Multiple T cell subsets exhibited high expression of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis when communicating with B cells.
 Conclusions:
 Our findings highlight the prognostic value of TLS in patients within MM. TLS formation may be associated with specific CAF and T cell subtypes and their interactions with B cells.

While Tregs are well known for their immune suppressive activity toward the adaptive immune system, less is known about their regulatory activity toward the innate compartment. We showed in human and mouse lung cancer, that chemotherapy transiently reduced Treg number and switched the mononuclear phagocyte (MP) landscape toward a pro-inflammatory signature but also an increased TGFβ-expressing TAM accumulation over time. Preventing Treg recovery further increased the recruitment of monocytes and limited TGFβ expression upon TAM differentiation, demonstrating that Tregs dampen the pro-inflammatory status of the MP compartment induced by chemotherapy and promote tumor relapse. Anti-TNFR2 antibody treatment during the Treg recovery phase affected the direct interaction between Tregs and MPs, increased the pro-inflammatory signature of the MPs and improved survival in the mouse model. Targeting the crosstalk between tumor-associated Tregs and the MP compartment limits the reconstitution of an anti-inflammatory environment following chemotherapy and improves therapeutic outcome.">

        <tr id="Background Neuroblastoma, the most common pediatric extracranial solid tumor, has heterogeneous clinical outcomes ranging from malignant progression to spontaneous regression. With the highest frequency of the elusive spontaneous regression, low-risk INSS Stage 4S neuroblastoma represents an ideal model for mechanistic investigation. Spontaneous regression is often accompanied by tumor differentiation, but the mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unclear. Methods Single-nucleus transcriptomics (snRNA-seq) data of neuroblastoma samples were obtained from the Synapse repository to investigate the composition of heterogeneous tumor cell clusters. The feature of the Stage 4S-specific tumor cell subpopulation was revealed through differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and pseudotime analysis, followed by clinical significance validation on public cohort datasets. The biological function of secreted SLIT3 was validated using multiple in vitro models, including recombinant protein treatment, conditioned medium treatment, and cell lines coculture, to confirm the intratumoral crosstalk effect. Orthotopic and subcutaneous xenograft models were established to verify SLIT3's in vivo function. Cellular bulk RNA-seq analysis was performed with or without SLIT3 recombinant protein treatment to discover the downstream pathways activated by SLIT3, followed by validation with specific pathway inhibitors. Results Analysis of snRNA-seq revealed a distinct subpopulation of tumor cells within INSS Stage 4S neuroblastoma, characterized by a spontaneous regression-like program progressing toward differentiation. Activated SLIT-ROBO signaling was found in the Stage 4S-specific tumor cell subpopulation, which strongly correlated with favorable prognosis. Further investigation into the secreted ligands in SLIT-ROBO related pathways revealed that SLIT3 displayed the most potent enrichment in Stage 4S tumors and the strongest differentiation-inducing effect. In vitro experiments using recombinant SLIT3 protein, conditioned medium, and cell lines coculture consistently demonstrated the capacity of SLIT3 to induce neuroblastoma cell differentiation via intratumoral crosstalk, as evidenced by increased neurite outgrowth and elevated expression of neuronal differentiation markers. Both orthotopic xenograft and subcutaneous xenograft models demonstrated that SLIT3 expression suppressed tumor growth, leading to in vivo tumor differentiation. Mechanistically, PLCβ/PKC signaling mediates the SLIT3-induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation. Conclusions Stage 4S-specific tumor cell subpopulation exhibits a spontaneous regression-like program, from which SLIT3 mediates intratumoral crosstalk and promotes neuroblastoma differentiation via PLCβ/PKC signaling. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of spontaneous regression in neuroblastoma and offer novel therapeutic targets for differentiation-based treatment strategies.

        <tr id="Tumor-infiltrating B cells (TIBs) are the most important cell type involved in the immune response. TIBs display considerable intratumor heterogeneity due to genetic variation, epigenetic differences and transcriptional plasticity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Owing to the unique anatomical location of CRC, the B cell subpopulation exhibits more extensive heterogeneity. Many studies have shown that TIBs have gradually become a key predictor of immunotherapy for malignant cancers, including CRC. TIBs have essential functions, including antigen presentation and antibody secretion, and they promote T-cell activation and myeloid chemotaxis. However, owing to the complex TME, TIBs not only promote the antitumor immune response but also inhibit the immune response. With the in-depth study of tumor-infiltrating T cells, tumor-associated myeloid cells and the interactions among these cells in the TME, the special role of immune cells in the TME has gradually become clear. However, the influence of TIBs in the TME and their interactions with nonimmune cells in the TME remain unclear. Here, we summarize the current progress in TIBs based on single-cell RNA sequencing in CRC in recent years, focusing on specific effector or regulatory characteristics of different B cell subclusters in the CRC TME.">

However, there is still significant potential for further research and optimization. We propose incorporating immunogenic cell death stimuli into the production of dendritic cell-derived exosomes in order to improve their effectiveness as a cell-free anti-cancer treatment.

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) represent the dominant immune cell subset within the ovarian tumor microenvironment, which exhibits remarkable plasticity. They can readily undergo polarization toward an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype in response to various factors secreted by tumor cells, playing a pivotal role in ovarian cancer advancement and the development of resistance to chemotherapy. M2 TAMs promote the invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells and their resistance to therapeutic agents through the secretion of numerous tumor-promoting factors, including cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and exosomes. Furthermore, M2 TAMs significantly contribute to the peritoneal metastasis of cancer cells by aiding in the formation of spheroids and facilitating adhesion at metastatic sites. Concurrently, TAMs can suppress immune responses by interacting with lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells, thereby fostering an immunosuppressive milieu. Extensive research has indicated that M2-like TAMs exert detrimental effects in ovarian tumors, with elevated levels correlating positively with diminished overall survival rates. This review seeks to summarize the existing knowledge regarding the mechanisms through which TAMs affect both the progression of ovarian cancer and the development of chemotherapy resistance, underscoring the necessity for innovative therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting these cells within the tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils, a key component of the innate immune system, have emerged as significant players in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer. Traditionally recognized for their role in defending against infections, neutrophils in cancer contribute to both tumor progression and suppression, depending on their activation state and the signals they receive. Neutrophil-driven inflammation within the TME is critical in promoting tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. This review explores the complex role of neutrophils in breast cancer, emphasizing the mechanisms through which they influence tumor inflammation, including their interactions with other immune cells and the signaling pathways involved. Neutrophils can either support tumor progression by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes, and reactive oxygen species, or contribute to antitumor responses by directly killing cancer cells and stimulating adaptive immunity. The balance between these opposing functions is heavily influenced by the TME’s cytokine milieu and neutrophil polarization. Key signaling pathways, such as the CXCR2-CXCL8 axis and interactions with tumor-associated macrophages, regulate neutrophil recruitment and activation in the TME, enhancing inflammation and tumorigenesis. Additionally, neutrophils’ ability to form neutrophil extracellular traps further complicates their role, potentially promoting metastasis by trapping circulating tumor cells.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The testicular immune microenvironment sustains homeostasis and immune privilege. However, the presence and functional significance of B cells within this specialized niche remain poorly characterized. Furthermore, the intricate crosstalk between resident immune populations and testicular stromal cells that may orchestrate the immunological and endocrine microenvironment during sexual maturation warrants systematic investigation.


OBJECTIVE
To systematically delineate the immune cell atlas and developmental trajectory of testicular leukocytes before and after sexual maturation.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
An integrated analysis of leukocytes in post-sexual maturity (8-week-old) and pre-sexual maturity (2-week-old) mouse testes using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (CyTOF), was performed. Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) isolated immune subsets, followed by bioinformatics interrogation of cellular heterogeneity and ligand-receptor network analysis to map intercellular communication pathways.


RESULTS
Through scRNA-seq clustering analysis, we resolved 18 distinct leukocyte populations (11 lymphoid and seven myeloid lineages), which were further validated and expanded to 17 phenotypically discrete subsets (eight lymphoid and nine myeloid) via high-dimensional CyTOF profiling. Notably, we identified a rare but functionally significant B lymphocyte population within the testicular compartment. The myeloid compartment exhibited pronounced developmental plasticity, marked by progressive Il1b+Macrophages diminution and regulatory T cell expansion during maturation. Cell communication network analysis revealed intensified ligand-receptor cross-talk between androgen-producing Leydig cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes in post-pubertal testes, providing mechanistic insights into age-dependent immune privilege establishment.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Multi-omics integration reveals dynamic immune remodeling during testicular maturation. These findings underscore the potential involvement of B cells in local immune surveillance while identifying maturation-associated signaling axes between stromal and immune cells. This comprehensive mapping of testicular leukocyte dynamics significantly advances our understanding of reproductive immunology and lays foundation for investigating immune-mediated testicular pathologies.">

However, the state of cellular activation in the brain of virally suppressed (VS) PWH and the impact of local viral reservoirs on cellular activation are unclear. Using multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, here, we demonstrate that the frontal cortex brain tissue from both non-virally suppressed (nVS; n=17) and VS PWH (n=18) have higher frequencies of astrocytes and myeloid cells expressing interferon-inducible Mx-1 and proinflammatory TNFα relative to HIV-seronegative individuals (p<0.05 for all). The frequency of TGF-β1+ cells were also elevated in the brain tissue from both nVS and VS PWH, which may support active immunoregulatory responses despite ART. Importantly, the frequency of Mx1+ myeloid cells correlated with levels of total HIV DNA and intact and 5′ defective HIV proviral DNA (p<0.05 for all) in the brain of VS PWH. These findings demonstrate that cell activation persists in the brain of VS PWH and is associated with HIV DNA in the brain, which may contribute to neuropathology.">

        <tr id="Human papillomavirus-mediated recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a premalignant neoplasia of the upper airway characterized by significant dysphonia and respiratory obstruction. Immune checkpoint blockade has emerged as a potential alternative to repeated surgical interventions in RRP. Here, we investigated the intralesional T-cell composition and expression of the immune checkpoints programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) in RRP. We analyzed tissue samples from 30 patients treated at a tertiary care center between 2009 and 2021, including paired samples from individual patients collected at different time points. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for CD4, CD8, CTLA-4, FoxP3, and PD-L1 and correlated with disease severity and previous adjuvant therapies. Overall disease burden and intervention-free survival were not associated with the abundance of CD4+, CD8+, or FoxP3+ T cells, nor with immune checkpoint expression. However, patients with aggressive disease exhibited a higher intralesional FoxP3/CD4 T-cell ratio. Prior intralesional cidofovir treatment was associated with reduced CD4+ T-cell infiltration. These findings suggest that a locally immunosuppressive microenvironment, reflected by an elevated FoxP3/CD4 ratio, contributes to disease severity in RRP. Consistent CTLA-4 expression across all evaluated samples supports further investigation of anti-CTLA-4 therapy, either alone or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized cancer treatment. Unfortunately, the inability of lymphocytes to infiltrate the tumor nest, a phenomenon known as immune exclusion, drastically limits ICB responsiveness. Analyzing the immune landscape of matched pre- and early on-treatment biopsies of patients with melanoma undergoing ICB therapy, we observed a significant increase in cytotoxic NK cells in early on-treatment biopsies from nonresponders. Spatial multiomic analyses revealed that, although NK cells colocalized with CD8+ T cells within the tumor bed in responding lesions, they were excluded from the tumor parenchyma in nonresponding lesions. Strikingly, pharmacologic depletion of NK cells in a unique melanoma mouse model exhibiting an immune-excluded phenotype unleashed immune infiltration of the tumor core and tumor clearance upon ICB exposure. Mechanistically, we show that NK cells are actively recruited to immune-excluded areas upon ICB exposure via the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 to suppress tumor infiltration and antitumor function of CD8+ T cells.


SIGNIFICANCE
Immune exclusion is responsible for intrinsic resistance to ICB in about half of nonresponder patients. Our unexpected observation that targeting NK cell biology unleashes the recruitment and antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells in tumors with an immune-excluded phenotype offers a potential therapeutic avenue for this large patient population.

        <tr id="The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the profound and lasting impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the nervous system. Beyond acute infection, SARS-CoV-2 acts as a potent immunomodulatory agent, disrupting immune homeostasis and contributing to persistent inflammation, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, neuropathy, and mood disturbances. These are linked to immune dysregulation involving cytokine imbalance, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, glial activation, and T-cell exhaustion. Key biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NFL) correlate with disease severity and chronicity. This narrative review examines the immunopathological mechanisms underpinning the neurological sequelae of long COVID, focusing on neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and molecular mimicry. We also assess the role of viral variants in shaping neuroimmune outcomes and explore emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including biomarker-guided and immune-targeted interventions. By delineating how SARS-CoV-2 reshapes neuroimmune interactions, this review aims to support the development of precision-based diagnostics and targeted therapies for long COVID-related neurological dysfunction. Emerging approaches include immune-modulatory agents (e.g., anti-IL-6), neuroprotective drugs, and strategies for repurposing antiviral or anti-inflammatory compounds in neuro-COVID. Given the high prevalence of comorbidities, personalized therapies guided by biomarkers and patient-specific immune profiles may be essential. Advancements in vaccine technologies and targeted biologics may also hold promise for prevention and disease modification. Finally, continued interdisciplinary research is needed to clarify the complex virus–immune–brain axis in long COVID and inform effective clinical management.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibit a dual role in tumor progression and antitumor immunity. However, understanding the functional states and molecular mechanisms of antitumor TAMs remains a challenge. Herein, we show that intratumoral administration of a combination of agonists against TLR3 and CD40 (hereafter termed myeloid cell treatment, MCT) reprogrammed TAMs in situ to adopt a protective antitumor phenotype in an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model, and that this led to tumor regression. Single-cell RNA sequencing of TAMs from different tumor stages and post-MCT revealed a transient antitumor TAM phenotype, present at 12h post-MCT, characterized by markers such as iNOS and CD38, which was replaced by TAMs co-expressing tumor-limiting and promoting features by 72h post-MCT. Maintenance of antitumor TAMs required repeated MCT administration, and this promoted the activation of CD8+ T cells and long-term tumor eradication. Mechanistically, ROS and TNF-α were pivotal in TAM-mediated tumor control. Our findings uncover the vulnerability of transient TAM reprogramming and show that it can be overcome by repeated MCT administrations to sustain efficient antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="B-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies with a high relapse rate after conventional therapies. T-cell-mediated immunotherapies, notably chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies and T-cell-engaging bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), have transformed treatment paradigms by harnessing the immune system to target malignant cells. This review analyzes the efficacy and safety profiles of several CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapies and emerging CD20xCD3 BsAbs across various B-cell lymphoma subtypes. While these therapies have demonstrated high response rates and potential for durable remissions, challenges such as cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and infections remain significant. Understanding these mechanisms and managing adverse effects are crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes and guiding future research in personalized treatment strategies.">

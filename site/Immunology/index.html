        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is a major oncogenic driver in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promising therapeutic effects, overcoming resistance with immunotherapy becomes necessary when resistance develops. However, various clinical trials have revealed that their efficacies remain limited. To investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) factors contributing to poor immune checkpoint blockade responses in ALK-positive patients, we performed single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors with and without ALK rearrangements. Integrative analysis with additional public LUAD cohorts revealed distinct immune landscapes in ALK-positive tumors, marked by enriched innate immunity and depleted adaptive immunity. ALK-positive malignant cells exhibit higher stemness and aggressive phenotype. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in these tumors predominantly maintain pro-tumoral M2-like states, reinforcing immune suppression. B cells show reduced immune reactivity and impaired tertiary lymphoid structure formation, while CD8+ T cells display bystander-like signatures and reduced tumor reactivity. Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles combined with regulatory network analysis suggest that differences in transcription factor activities, rather than chromatin accessibility, may underlie T cell dysfunction. These findings provide insights into the immunosuppressive TME of ALK-positive LUAD, potentially explaining the failure of recent immunotherapy trials and highlighting targets for improving efficacy.">

        <tr id="During homeostasis, innate and epithelial cells undergo continuous maturation, shaped by microbial, molecular and cellular interactions. While these cells influence adaptive immunity during steady-state conditions, the reciprocal homeostatic role of adaptive immune cells in the maturation and function of innate and epithelial cells remains underexplored. Here, through computational approaches and murine models, we establish that adaptive immunity shapes innate immune and epithelial homeostatic landscapes. Mechanistically, adaptive immunity acts as a brake on type 1 polarization and diversification of innate lymphocytes (ILCs). Without adaptive immunity, the innate cellular interactions within the mesenteric lymph nodes are dominated by an interferon-gamma (IFNγ) signaling network. Moreover, the innate immune and epithelial cells follow distinct phenotypic and functional trajectories, including ILCs acquiring myeloid markers, monocytes adopting an inflammatory path, and colonic epithelial cells expressing altered antimicrobial peptides and losing Paneth-like features. Depleting ILCs, abolishing IFNγ signaling, or restoring adaptive immunity reduces these IFNγ-driven changes. Thus, our findings highlight a homeostatic function of adaptive immunity in modulating innate and epithelial cell communication, diversity, composition, function, and differentiation, notably by limiting ILC-derived IFNγ.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) generally acquire immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting phenotypes, which may contribute to tumor resistance to immunotherapy. We previously showed that suppression of microRNA activity through genetic Dicer1 inactivation rewires TAM’s transcriptomes and prompts their immunostimulatory activation. This phenotypic switch enhanced recruitment and activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and improved the efficacy of immunotherapy in mouse cancer models. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of whole tumors grown in either wild-type mice or mice with macrophage-specific Dicer1 deletion. The analysis of multiple cell populations, including several discrete monocyte and macrophage subsets, indicated broad and convergent immunostimulatory programming of the tumor microenvironment, which was dependent on CTL-derived interferon-gamma (IFNγ), in mice with DICER-deficient macrophages. Intriguingly, dynamic inferences on monocyte/macrophage ontogeny and differentiation by pseudotime analysis revealed trajectories associated with progression into cell cycle, monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, and transition from an immunostimulatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in tumors with DICER-proficient macrophages. Dicer1 deficiency interfered with this trajectory and stalled TAMs at an intermediate state between immature monocytes and macrophages with T cell-stimulatory capacity, thereby impeding immunosuppressive TAM development. This translated into enhanced response to antiangiogenic immunotherapy in an immunotherapy-resistant model of non-small cell lung cancer. Cycling/M2-like macrophages were conserved in human melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma and should represent a more promising therapeutic target than the bulk of TAMs.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic reinforcement of T cell exhaustion is known to be a major barrier limiting T cell responses during immunotherapy. However, the core epigenetic regulators restricting antitumor immunity during prolonged antigen exposure are not clear. We investigated three commonly mutated epigenetic regulators that promote clonal hematopoiesis to determine whether they affect T cell stemness and response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. CD8 T cells lacking Dnmt3a, Tet2, or Asxl1 preserved a progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) population for more than 1 year during chronic antigen exposure without undergoing malignant transformation. Asxl1 controlled the self-renewal capacity of T cells and reduced CD8 T cell differentiation through H2AK119 ubiquitination and epigenetic modification of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase pathway. Asxl1-deficient T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy to improve tumor control in experimental models and conferred a survival advantage to mutated T cells from treated patients. Editor’s summary T cell immunotherapies have been successful in treating some intractable cancers, but there are limitations caused by the inability of T cells to persist after prolonged stimulation. Kang et al. undertook a reverse-translation approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating the durability of T cell responsiveness to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Tsui and Kallies). Inspired by clinical observations from individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome, the epigenetic regulators (Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1) associated with clonal hematopoiesis were identified using experimental models of T cell exhaustion. Epigenetic disruption of the polycomb group repressive deubiquitinase complex resulted in preservation of a stem cell–like T cell population that was responsive to immunotherapy. Extending this mechanism to cancer adoptive cell therapy, Asxl1 disruption was found to endow T cells with superior therapeutic efficacy and an ability to synergize with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Sustained stimulation of CD8 T cells promotes the development of functional exhaustion, a terminal cell fate that has been broadly recognized to limit the durability of T cell–based immunotherapies. This state of exhaustion arises though a progressive transition of multipotent progenitor T cells (Tpex) into a terminally differentiated population (Tex) that has been defined as being nonresponsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The molecular determinants dictating the developmental transition are now being investigated as engineering targets to block the progression of T cell exhaustion and preserve the durability of immunotherapy approaches. RATIONALE We recently observed that the long-term survival of a small cohort of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients treated with anti–PD-L1 therapy was coupled to mutation of the ASXL1 gene among their T cells. Mutations in ASXL1, in addition to DNMT3A and TET2, are commonly associated with conferring a survival advantage among hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in subclonal outgrowth referred to as clonal hematopoiesis. Because of their general link to cellular stemness, we investigated the role of these regulators in the developmental transition of Tpex into Tex and the impact of deletion of these regulators on therapeutic durability during anti–PD-L1 treatment. RESULTS To investigate the role of Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1 in the development and maintenance of an ICB-responsive T cell population, we engineered T cells to contain mutations within each of these genes and then exposed them to a chronic source of antigen by adoptively transferring them into mice infected with the clone 13 strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Disruption of these regulators in a canonical model of T cell exhaustion allowed them to maintain their quantity and ICB-responsive state for >1 year during chronic antigen exposure. Despite being stimulated and undergoing antigen-driven proliferation for 1 year, these T cells did not exhibit any signs of malignant outgrowth. Moreover, the total pool of T cells containing each of these mutations was enriched for a large quantity of stem-like Tcf1+ T cells. Fate-tracking adoptive transfer experiments revealed that this Tcf1+ subset of ASXL1 KO T cells could both self-renew and give rise to potent effectors. Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of the knockout (KO) T cells identified Asxl1 as a regulator of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, controlling the deubiquitination of histone 2A lysine 119, which serves as a molecular checkpoint for the developmental transition of Tpex into Tex. Extension of this mechanistic insight into tumor models revealed that adoptively transferred T cells with Asxl1 disruption resisted tumor microenvironment–induced exhaustion. Moreover, the adoptively transferred Asxl1 KO T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 blockade, resulting in heightened tumor control. Finally, we show that Asxl1 disruption of tumor-specific T cells correlates with increased expansion of T cells in MDS patients after treatment with anti–PD-L1. CONCLUSION Results from these studies show that DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 control the developmental checkpoint between Tpex and terminally exhausted T cells. Specific investigation into Asxl1 revealed its role in T cell differentiation through epigenetic modification of the PR-DUB pathway. These data articulate a reverse-translation approach for defining molecular mechanisms that restrict maintenance of the ICB-responsive stem-like T cells within a suppressive tumor microenvironment. Through our mechanistic investigation of genes associated with patient survival, we have established a scientific rationale for specific genetic modification of discrete epigenetic regulators for future engineering to enhance the durability of cancer immunotherapy. Core epigenetic regulators in maintaining therapeutic durable multipotent Tpex populations. Using the canonical murine model system of exhaustion, disruption of Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1 in CD8 T cells preserved an ICB-responsive Tpex population for >1 year during chronic antigen exposure. Specific investigation into the new epigenetic regulator Asxl1 revealed that this unprecedented maintenance of Tpex is mediated by presence of monoubiqutinated histone 2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) through disruption of the PR-DUB complex.">

        <tr id="Tumor endothelial (TECs) cells play a critical role in regulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the mechanisms by which TECs modulate immune cell population remain unclear, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we investigated how NSCLC cells tweak normal endothelial cells (NECs) into TECs and the subsequent effects on immune regulation. NECs were cocultured with various NSCLC cell lines, using 2D and 3D coculture models to evaluate TEC-mediated effects on immune cells. We show that direct coculture led to significant transcriptomic, proteomic and kinomic alterations in TECs, especially in pro-inflammatory pathways. We identified a downregulation of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40L in TECs compared to NECs, suggesting impaired T-cell proliferation support. While TECs showed a limited effect on CD8+ T-cell activation, TECs supported CD4 T-cells polarization into Treg and Th22 subsets. Moreover, TECs also promoted M2-like macrophages polarization, thereby potentially contributing to the TME immunosuppression. State-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing of 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) revealed distinct TEC subpopulations, including an inflammatory subset with UPR signature. The latter was absent in 2D-cultured NECs but present in freshly isolated and 2D-cultured TECs from NSCLC patients. Importantly, we also identified within MCTS a perivascular M2-like macrophage subset, predicted to interact with TECs with MIF and Midkine signaling. In conclusion, TECs in NSCLC tumors play a pivotal role in remodeling the TME immune landscape by promoting immune suppression. This study highlights the complex immunoregulatory functions of TECs within our different in vitro models that mimic aspects of the TME. Our data may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting TECs or regulatory signaling to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Age is a major risk factor for cancer, but how aging impacts tumor control remains unclear. In this study, we establish that aging of the immune system, regardless of the age of the stroma and tumor, drives lung cancer progression. Hematopoietic aging enhances emergency myelopoiesis, resulting in the local accumulation of myeloid progenitor–like cells in lung tumors. These cells are a major source of interleukin (IL)–1⍺, which drives the enhanced myeloid response. The age-associated decline of DNA methyltransferase 3A enhances IL-1⍺ production, and disrupting IL-1 receptor 1 signaling early during tumor development normalized myelopoiesis and slowed the growth of lung, colonic, and pancreatic tumors. In human tumors, we identified an enrichment for IL-1⍺–expressing monocyte-derived macrophages linked to age, poorer survival, and recurrence, unraveling how aging promotes cancer and offering actionable therapeutic strategies. Editor’s summary Aging of the immune system is a key factor for cancer outcome. Park et al. performed immune profiling to explore how the immune system becomes less able to combat cancer with age. Through experimental lung cancer models, aging was associated with a more rapid recruitment of myeloid immune cells into tumors and enhanced tumor growth in older mice. Production of the cytokine interleukin-1α (IL-1α) by myeloid cells provided signals to hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow, which created a mechanism to further promote the recruitment of an immunosuppressive myeloid population. The enzyme DNMT3A (DNA methyltransferase 3A), involved in age-associated DNA methylation, was down-regulated with age and correlated with the production of IL-1. Blocking of the IL-1 receptor was found to reduce lung cancer progression in aged mice. —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Most cancers are diseases of aging. Extensive epidemiological work has established that this association is most notable at the sixth decade of life in terms of frequency of cancer diagnoses. Aging is the number one correlate to an increased risk for developing cancer, lower overall and progression-free survival, and an increased likelihood for a future relapse or recurrence. RATIONALE Studies on the cellular and molecular changes linked to aging have been attributed to the association between aging and cancer. And although preclinical studies testing therapeutics targeted toward senescent cells, exhausted T cells, or inflammatory molecules have shown some promise in patients, the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of whether tumor-intrinsic or -extrinsic and immunological or nonimmunological determinants of the tumor microenvironment are responsible for the protumorigenic consequence of aging. Recent work has demonstrated that cell-intrinsic aging of epithelial cells actually deters their neoplastic transformation and growth in old mice. Others have shown that, although a poor T cell response is associated with the protumor effect of aging, transferring T cells from young mice to old mice does not rescue the antitumor response in those recipients. As a result, there remains an unmet clinical need for an unbiased dissection of the tumor microenvironment that reveals how aging promotes cancer. RESULTS We show that the aging of the immune system, regardless of the age of the stroma, is associated with lung cancer. Notably, reconstituting old mice with a youthful immune system rescues their antitumor response and delays lung cancer progression. Hematopoietic aging enhances emergency myelopoiesis in old mice and results in an extramedullary accumulation of myeloid progenitors in lung tumors. Tumor-infiltrating, progenitor-like myeloid cells in old mice produce interleukin (IL)–1⍺, which acts as a driver of the enhanced myelopoietic response that promotes immunosuppression; disrupting this axis with either an anti–IL-1⍺ antibody or the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) antagonist, anakinra, early during tumor initiation not only slowed tumor growth but also normalized myelopoiesis. The increased proclivity of aged monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) to produce more IL-1 is due to an age-associated decline of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), the loss-of-function mutation of which is commonly linked to clonal hematopoiesis. Extending these findings to humans, we show that emergency hematopoiesis is enhanced with age and cancer stage; circulating hematopoietic progenitors from older patients exhibited a down-regulation of DNMT3A, and monocytes from older patients produced more IL-1. Moreover, in human lung cancer lesions, we show that enrichment for mo-macs that express IL-1⍺ correlates with aging, poorer survival, and recurrence of cancer. CONCLUSION We established that an aged immune system promotes tumor growth, regardless of the age of the tumor or its surrounding stroma. Specifically, hematopoietic aging drives emergency myelopoiesis, and targeting IL-1R1 signaling during early tumor development to attenuate this process abrogates the protumorigenic effect of aging on tumor control. Our study not only highlights the importance of immunotherapy in improving the age-dependent antitumor response but also the major role of local myeloid progenitors that actually fuel age-enhanced emergency myelopoiesis in a positive feedback loop. Notably, we defined the therapeutic window for the use of an IL-1R1–based intervention to delay lung cancer progression. Our findings have direct relevance to the design of cancer prevention strategies, support recent work from our group on lung cancer as a systemic disease involving the bone marrow, and are highly informative for unraveling the link between aging, DNMT3A mutation-driven clonal hematopoiesis, and cancer. Model of IL-1–driven emergency myelopoiesis as the basis for protumorigenic, hematopoietic aging. Aging of the immune system promotes tumor growth by exacerbating emergency myelopoiesis and sustaining it through a positive feedback loop involving IL-1. Disrupting this loop during the early stages of cancer progression in mouse models can delay age-dependent cancer growth.

        <tr id="Abstract Background The main challenge against patients with cancer to derive benefits from immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 appears to be the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), in which IL-33/ST2 signal fulfills critical functions. However, whether IL-33 limits the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 remains uncertain. Methods Molecular mechanisms of IL-33/ST2 signal on anti-PD-L1 treatment lewis lung carcinoma tumor model were assessed by RNA-seq, ELISA, WB and immunofluorescence (IF). A sST2-Fc fusion protein was constructed for targeting IL-33 and combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody for immunotherapy in colon and lung tumor models. On this basis, bifunctional fusion proteins were generated for PD-L1-targeted blocking of IL-33 in tumors. The underlying mechanisms of dual targeting of IL-33 and PD-L1 revealed by RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, FACS, IF and WB. Results After anti-PD-L1 administration, tumor-infiltrating ST2+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were elevated. Blocking IL-33/ST2 signal with sST2-Fc fusion protein potentiated antitumor efficacy of PD-L1 antibody by enhancing T cell responses in tumor models. Bifunctional fusion protein anti-PD-L1-sST2 exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy compared with combination therapy, not only inhibited tumor progression and extended the survival, but also provided long-term protective antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, the superior antitumor activity of targeting IL-33 and PD-L1 originated from reducing immunosuppressive factors, such as Tregs and exhausted CD8+ T cells while increasing tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated that IL-33/ST2 was involved in the immunosuppression mechanism of PD-L1 antibody therapy, and blockade by sST2-Fc or anti-PD-L1-sST2 could remodel the inflammatory TME and induce potent antitumor effect, highlighting the potential therapeutic strategies for the tumor treatment by simultaneously targeting IL-33 and PD-L1.">

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside in the lower airways and play a crucial role in lung health and response to sterile inflammation and infections. AMs possess remarkable adaptability to different environmental challenges that can persist through their memory capacity (trained immunity). β-glucan has been characterized as a potent inducer of trained immunity by reprogramming hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow generating trained innate cells with enhanced responsiveness. In the present study, we show that systemic administration of β-glucan reprograms alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung via neutrophils and IFNγ signalling, in a Dectin1-independent manner. We furthermore demonstrate that AM reprogramming at both the transcriptional and metabolic levels exacerbate lung injury following bacterial (LPS) or viral (polyI:C) challenges. These findings identify an additional facet of β-glucan in trained immunity involving AM reprogramming and shed light on the potential detrimental effects of trained immunity.">

        <tr id="Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) are pathologically activated neutrophils that potently impair immunotherapy responses. The chemokine receptor CXCR4, a central regulator of hematopoiesis, represents an attractive PMN-MDSC target1. Here, we fused a secreted CXCR4 partial agonist TFF2 to mouse serum albumin (MSA) and demonstrated that TFF2-MSA peptide synergized with anti-PD-1 to induce tumor regression or eradication, inhibited distant metastases, and prolonged survival in multiple gastric cancer (GC) models. Using histidine decarboxylase (Hdc)-GFP transgenic mice to track PMN-MDSC in vivo, we found TFF2-MSA selectively reduced the immunosuppressive Hdc-GFP+ CXCR4hi tumor PMN-MDSCs while preserving proinflammatory neutrophils, thereby boosting CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor response together with anti-PD-1. Furthermore, TFF2-MSA systemically reduced PMN-MDSCs and bone marrow granulopoiesis. In contrast, CXCR4 antagonism plus anti-PD-1 failed to provide a similar therapeutic benefit. In GC patients, expanded PMN-MDSCs containing a prominent CXCR4+LOX-1+ subset are inversely correlated with the TFF2 level and CD8+ T cells in circulation. Collectively, our studies introduce a strategy of using CXCR4 partial agonism to restore anti-PD-1 sensitivity in GC by targeting PMN-MDSCs and granulopoiesis.">

Here, our single-cell RNA sequencing data identify a subpopulation of macrophages expressing high levels of the phagocytic receptor MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK+ macrophages), which is closely associated with melanoma progression and immunotherapy resistance. Adoptive transfer of the MerTK+ macrophages into recipient mice notably accelerated tumor growth regardless of macrophage depletion. Mechanistic studies further revealed that ALK And LTK Ligand 1 (ALKAL1), a target gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), facilitated MerTK phosphorylation, resulting in heightened phagocytic activity of MerTK+ macrophages and their subsequent polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Specifically targeted delivery of AhR antagonist to tumor-associated macrophages with mannosylated micelles could suppress MerTK expression and improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti–programmed cell death ligand 1 therapy.

        <tr id="Type 1 immunity mediates host defense through pathogen elimination, but whether this pathway also impacts tissue function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that rapid induction of IFNγ signaling coordinates a multi-cellular response that is critical to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility following infection of mice with a tissue-invasive helminth. IFNγ production is initiated by antigen-independent activation of lamina propria CD8+ T cells following MyD88-dependent recognition of the microbiota during helminth-induced barrier invasion. IFNγ acted directly on intestinal stromal cells to recruit neutrophils that limited parasite-induced tissue injury. IFNγ sensing also limited the expansion of smooth muscle actin-expressing cells to prevent pathological gut dysmotility. Importantly, this tissue-protective response had limited impact on parasite burden, indicating that IFNγ supports a disease tolerance defense strategy. Our results have important implications for managing the pathophysiological sequelae of post-infectious gut dysfunction and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with stromal remodelling. HIGHLIGHTS Type 1 immunity is required for disease tolerance to tissue-invasive infection. Gut-resident CD8+ T cells produce IFNγ in an antigen-independent, yet microbiota-dependent manner. IFNγ signaling recruits neutrophils in a cell-extrinsic manner to limit helminth-induced tissue injury. Direct sensing of IFNγ by intestinal stroma is essential to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility during infection.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant healthcare burden worldwide, characterized by a complex interplay between obesity and chronic inflammation. While the relationship between CRC, obesity and altered lipid metabolism is not fully understood, there are evidences suggesting a link between them. In this study, we hypothesized that dysregulated lipid metabolism contributes to local accumulation of foam cells (FC) in CRC, which in turn disrupts antitumor immunosurveillance. Methods Tumor infiltrating FC and CD8+ were quantified by digital pathology in patients affected by T2–T4 CRC with any N stage undergoing radical upfront surgery (n=65) and correlated with patients’ clinical outcomes. Multiparametric high-resolution flow cytometry analysis and bulk RNAseq of CRC tissue were conducted to evaluate the phenotype and transcriptomic program of immune cell infiltrate in relation to FC accumulation. The immunosuppressive effects of FC and mechanistic studies on FC-associated transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and anti-PD-L1 inhibition were explored using an in-vitro human model of lipid-engulfed macrophages. Results FC (large CD68+ Bodipy+ macrophages) accumulated at the tumor margin in CRC samples. FChigh tumors exhibited reduced CD8+ T cells and increased regulatory T cells (Tregs). Functional transcriptional profiling depicted an immunosuppressed milieu characterized by reduced interferon gamma, memory CD8+ T cells, and activated macrophages mirrored by increased T-cell exhaustion and Treg enrichment. Furthermore, FChigh tumor phenotype was independent of standard clinical factors but correlated with high body mass index (BMI) and plasma saturated fatty acid levels. In CD8low tumors, the FChigh phenotype was associated with a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 8.6% compared with 28.7% of FClow (p=0.001). In-vitro studies demonstrated that FC significantly impact on CD8 proliferation in TFG-β dependent manner, while inhibition of TGF-β FC-related factors restored antitumor immunity. Conclusions FC exert immunosuppressive activity through a TGF-β-related pathway, resulting in a CD8-excluded microenvironment and identifying immunosuppressed tumors with worse prognosis in patients with primary CRC. FC association with patient BMI and dyslipidemia might explain the link of CRC with obesity, and offers novel therapeutic and preventive perspectives in this specific clinical setting.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) enhances T cell responses against cancer, leading to long-term survival in a fraction of patients. CD8+ T cell differentiation in response to chronic antigen stimulation is highly complex, and it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states at which anatomic sites are critical for the response to ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population in the white pulp of the spleen that underwent substantial expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increased systemic antigen redirected differentiation of this population toward a more circulatory exhausted KLR state, whereas a lack of cross-presented tumor antigen reduced its differentiation in the spleen. An analogous population of exhausted KLR CD8+ T cells in human blood samples exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability. Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role of antigen density within the spleen for the differentiation and expansion of T cell clonotypes in response to ICB. Response to ICB depends on optimal splenic antigen levels, whereas increased antigen induces differentiation to circulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T cell dysfunction is a defining feature of many tumor types, but how tumor-specific T cells progress to a terminally exhausted state and which populations are targeted by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains incompletely understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, Morgan et al. profiled T cell differentiation states across different anatomical sites including tumors, draining lymph nodes, and the white pulp of the spleen from tumor-bearing mice treated with ICB. A population of splenic intermediate-exhausted T cells supplied most of the ICB-elicited tumor-specific T cell response, which required low levels of cross-presented tumor antigen in the spleen. Together, these findings identify the spleen as an important site for generating a tumor-specific T cell response after ICB. —Claire Olingy">

        <tr id="Disease tolerance is an evolutionarily conserved host defence strategy that preserves tissue integrity and physiology without affecting pathogen load. Unlike host resistance, the mechanisms underlying disease tolerance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether an adjuvant (β-glucan) can reprogram innate immunity to provide protection against Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here we observe that β-glucan treatment reduced the morbidity and mortality against IAV infection, independent of host resistance (viral load). Increased survival of β-glucan treated mice against IAV is associated with the accumulation of neutrophils via RoRγt+ T cells in the lung tissue. Using gain-and-loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that β- glucan reprogrammed neutrophils are essential for promoting disease tolerance, limiting pulmonary tissue damage, and enhancing survival against IAV infection. β-glucan treatment promotes granulopoiesis in a type 1 interferon-dependent manner that leads to the generation of a unique subset of neutrophils, which are less mature with higher mitochondrial mass utilizing mitochondrial oxidative (OXPHOS) metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that β-glucan reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate neutrophils with a novel “regulatory” function, which is required for promoting disease tolerance and maintaining lung tissue integrity against viral infection.">

The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who will progress to severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. In patients with overweight/obesity these signatures are exacerbated compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic capacity compared to non-SD. Furthermore, type-I Interferon signalling is downregulated in SD, suggesting defective virus-sensing mechanisms may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional “professional killer” T/NK-cells underpin dengue pathogenesis. Our findings pave the way for the evaluation of immunomodulatory therapies for dengue.">

We identified overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in HIV-infected CD4⁺ T- cells that survive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) exposure, suggesting a mechanism of CTL resistance. Inhibition of EZH2 with the FDA-approved drug tazemetostat increased surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on CD4⁺ T-cells, counterbalancing HIV Nef–mediated MHC-I downregulation. This improved CTL-mediated elimination of HIV-infected cells and suppressed viral replication in vitro. In a participant-derived xenograft mouse model, tazemetostat elevated MHC-I and the pro-apoptotic protein BIM in CD4⁺ T-cells, facilitating CD8⁺ T-cell–mediated reductions of HIV reservoir seeding. Additionally, tazemetostat promoted sustained skewing of CD8⁺ T-cells toward less differentiated and exhausted phenotypes. Our findings reveal EZH2 overexpression as a novel mechanism of CTL resistance and support the clinical evaluation of tazemetostat to enhance clearance of HIV reservoirs and improve CD8+ T-cell function.">

Matched pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from the same lesion were obtained. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and custom multiplex staining to leverage the unique advantage of same-lesion longitudinal sampling. Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased CLEC9A+ dendritic cell and CLEC7A/SYK expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8+ T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13+CD8+ T- cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients.

        <tr id="Macrophages orchestrate tissue homeostasis and immunity. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophage presence is largely associated with poor prognosis because of their reprogramming into immunosuppressive cells. We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses. Coculture assays and cell-cell communication analyses support that hypoxic-activated macrophages enhance T cell–mediated responses. The NF-κB–associated hypomethylation signature is displayed by a subset of hypoxic inflammatory macrophages, isolated from ovarian tumors. Our results challenge paradigms regarding the effects of hypoxia on macrophages and highlight actionable target cells to modulate anticancer immune responses.">

TNFSF13 is a cytokine important for B cell maturation and function, but roles for epithelial TNFSF13 and putative contribution to inflammatory bowel disease are poorly understood. We evaluated functional consequences of a novel monoallelic TNFSF13 variant using biopsies, tissue-derived colonoids and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived colon organoids. TNFSF13 variant colonoids exhibited a >50% reduction in secreted TNFSF13, increased epithelial proliferation, and reduced apoptosis, which was confirmed in iPSC-derived colon organoids. Single cell RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry, and co-immunoprecipitation identified FAS as the predominant colonic epithelial receptor for TNFSF13. Imaging mass cytometry revealed an increase in epithelial-associated B cells in TNFSF13 variant colon tissue sections. Finally, TNFSF13 variant colonoids co-cultured with memory B cells demonstrated a reduction in the production of IgA+ plasma cells compared to control colonoid co-cultures. Our findings support a role for epithelial TNFSF13 as a regulator of colonic epithelial growth and epithelial crosstalk with B cells.

        <tr id="CD4 T helper cells (TH cells) play a vital role in coordinating and amplifying the immune response to specific pathogens. They constitutively produce different kinds of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which mediate cell-to cell communication and play diverse roles in immune regulation and inflammatory processes. Here we provide a resource documenting the composition of activated TH cell EVs and demonstrating their ability to instigate pro-inflammatory response in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). EVs were characterized by lipidomics, proteomics, and NanoFCM. The activated TH cells derived EVs (act-EVs) were found to be enriched in TH cell-specific proteins, transmembrane and cytosolic EV marker proteins, and HLA proteins relative to resting CD4 T cells EVs (rest-EVs). The pro-inflammatory effect of act-EVs vs rest-EVs on donor matched APCs were characterized by chemokine and cytokine profiling and flow cytometry analysis. There was no discernible contrast in endotoxin levels between act-EVs and rest-EVs. Functional distinctions were seen to arise from variations in the content and composition of these EVs. Moreover, we validated our findings with an in-vivo investigation in mice, demonstrating the recruitment of monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, and NK cells in the spleen, accompanied by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum after administering act-EVs. In summary, this study sheds light on the role of TH cell released EVs in modulating the immune response during pro-inflammatory responses and this resource provides a foundation for development of novel therapeutics on EV based scaffolds.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells suppress cellular and humoral immune responses via killing of T cells, resulting in diminished vaccine responses in mice and humans. Efforts to overcome this roadblock and achieve optimal immunity require an improved understanding of the molecular mediators facilitating NK cell-targeting of discrete subsets of CD4 T cells. We employed single-cell forensic victimology and CRISPR-Cas9 editing to delineate a transcriptional program uniquely responsible for the susceptibility of a subpopulation of CD4 T cells to perforin-dependent immunoregulation by NK cells. The unique vulnerability of these CD4 T cells relative to other subsets of CD4 T cells was not associated with a pattern of NK-cell-receptor ligand expression that would favor activation of NK cells. Instead, susceptible CD4 T cells were skewed toward follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation and exhibited intermediate expression of Klf2 and a related suite of KLF2-target genes (e.g. S1pr1) involved in cell migration and spatial positioning. NK-cell dependent suppression of the subset of Tfh exhibiting intermediate expression of KLF2 and S1PR1 was confirmed with single-cell proteomics. CRISPR targeting of KLF2 in CD4 T cells prevented suppression by NK cells. Thus, KLF2 regulation of spatial positioning of T cells is a key determinant of NK-cell immunoregulatory function and a possible target for strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy.">

Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we compared CD8+ T cell clones from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of monozygotic twin pairs in which the cotwin had either no or subclinical neuroinflammation (SCNI). We identified peripheral MS-associated immunological and metabolic alterations indicative of an enhanced migratory, proinflammatory, and activated CD8+ T cell phenotype, which was also evident in cotwins with SCNI and in an independent validation cohort of people with MS. Together, our in-depth single-cell analysis indicates a disease-driving proinflammatory role of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and identifies potential immunological and metabolic therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages of the disease.

We show that IL-23 receptors are expressed on the large majority of human MAIT, but not of conventional T cells. Protein and transcriptional profiling at the population and single cell level demonstrates that stimulation with IL-23 or the structurally related cytokine IL-12 drives distinct functional profiles, revealing a high level of plasticity of MAIT cells. IL-23, in particular, affects key molecules and pathways related to autoimmunity and cytotoxic functions. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility, supported by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion, shows that AP-1 transcription factors constitute a key regulatory node of the IL-23 pathway in MAIT cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that MAIT cells are key mediators of IL-23 functions in immunity to infections and chronic inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has revolutionised the treatment of multiple cancer types, however, these treatments only work for a proportion of patients and biomarkers to predict response are lacking. One correlate of response is the reinvigoration of a subset of CD8 T cells that have an exhausted phenotype and impaired functionality. In order to develop new therapies, reproducible models are required to identify candidate target genes that enables the reversal of key hallmarks of T cell exhaustion. Here we describe the development of an in vitro model by chronically stimulating T cells with their cognate antigen and performed an in depth temporal phenotypic characterisation. This model recapitulates many of the critical hallmarks of exhaustion, including increased expression of canonical exhaustion surface markers, impaired proliferation, reduced cytokine production, decreased release of cytotoxic granules, and metabolic alterations, including dysfunctional mitochondria. These exhaustion hallmarks were validated using an in vivo model and a gene signature identified which robustly define the shared in vitro and in vivo exhausted state. Critically, this signature is also observed in tumour infiltrating T cells from multiple human tumour types, validating the translational potential of this model for discovering and triaging new therapies.">

Transcriptomic analysis reveals that infection with T. vaginalis in symbiosis with M. hominis or M. hominis alone upregulates genes involved in the type I IFN response, but infection with T. vaginalis alone does not. Finally, we show that interferon-epsilon stimulation is protective against T. vaginalis cytoadherence and cytolysis of host cells and increases the ability of neutrophils to kill the parasite.

        <tr id="MALT1 protease is an intracellular signaling molecule that promotes tumor progression via cancer cell-intrinsic and cancer cell-extrinsic mechanisms. MALT1 has been mostly studied in lymphocytes, and little is known about its role in tumor-associated macrophages. Here, we show that MALT1 plays a key role in glioblastoma (GBM)-associated macrophages. Mechanistically, GBM tumor cells induce a MALT1-NF-κB signaling axis within macrophages, leading to macrophage migration and polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Inactivation of MALT1 protease promotes transcriptional reprogramming that reduces migration and restores a macrophage “M1-like” phenotype. Preclinical in vivo analysis shows that MALT1 inhibitor treatment results in increased immuno-reactivity of GBM-associated macrophages and reduced GBM tumor growth. Further, the addition of MALT1 inhibitor to temozolomide reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, which may enhance the efficacy of this standard-of-care chemotherapeutic. Together, our findings suggest that MALT1 protease inhibition represents a promising macrophage-targeted immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of GBM. Graphical abstract.

Despite extensive efforts in developing immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at controlling the recruitment or reprogramming of TAMs, success has been limited due to strategic caveats, underscoring the need for a novel approach targeting the TAMs. PU.1, a lineage-dependent transcription factor, is highly expressed throughout the lifespan of macrophages. We have found that inhibition of PU.1 by the small molecule DB2313 suppresses melanoma tumor growth in mice through enhanced tumor recruitment of CD4+ T helper cells and cytotoxic T/NK cells mediated by TAMs. Whole transcriptome and targeted gene expression analyses revealed that DB2313 upregulates CXCL9 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and TAMs. The anti-tumor effects of DB2313 were abolished by depleting macrophages with clodronate or inhibiting the CXCL9-CXCR3 chemokine axis using neutralizing antibodies against CXCL9 or CXCR3. Collectively, these results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PU.1 suppresses tumor growth by promoting tumor infiltrating lymphocytes through the CXCL9-CXCR3 chemokine axis.

        <tr id="Immunotherapy can lead to long-term survival for some cancer patients, yet generalized success has been hampered by insufficient antigen presentation and exclusion of immunogenic cells from the tumor microenvironment. Here, we developed an approach to reprogram tumor cells in vivo by adenoviral delivery of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3, which enabled them to present antigens as type 1 conventional dendritic cells. Reprogrammed tumor cells remodeled their tumor microenvironment, recruited, and expanded polyclonal cytotoxic T cells; induced tumor regressions; and established long-term systemic immunity in multiple mouse melanoma models. In human tumor spheroids and xenografts, reprogramming to immunogenic dendritic-like cells progressed independently of immunosuppression, which usually limits immunotherapy. Our study paves the way for human clinical trials of in vivo immune cell reprogramming for cancer immunotherapy. Editor’s summary The success of cancer immunotherapy can be limited by mechanisms that tumors develop to evade destruction by the immune system. Tumors can block the activation and obstruct the ability of immune cells (dendritic cells and T lymphocytes) to destroy the tumor, thereby creating an environment that is beneficial for cancer growth. Ascic et al. developed an approach to directly reprogram cancer cells into dendritic cells in vivo by delivering the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 with an adenoviral vector (see the Perspective by Zhou and Wu). The transcription factors promoted dendritic cell–like functions and enabled the engineered tumor cells to present antigens and mount cancer-specific T cell immune responses. The tumor-to-immune cell “reprogramming” reshaped the tumor microenvironment, triggering tumor regressions and systemic immunity. —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION The success of cancer immunotherapy depends on the priming of tumor-specific T cells. However, tumor cells often down-regulate antigen presentation and mount an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which excludes immunogenic antigen-presenting cells from the tumor. These limitations hinder the broad success of cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockade. Type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s), a rare subset of dendritic cells, are key for recruiting and activating cytotoxic T cells, and their presence in tumors correlates with improved survival. Previous studies showed that the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 (PIB) can directly reprogram fibroblasts or tumor cells into antigen-presenting cDC1-like cells in vitro within 9 days. However, ex vivo cell manipulation and readministration of these reprogrammed cells pose significant challenges for clinical application. RATIONALE We hypothesized that the reprogramming of tumor cells into cDC1-like cells could occur entirely in vivo within the tumor microenvironment. This approach would foster T cell activation by leveraging the unique functions of cDC1. Using a combination of syngeneic models, xenografts, and human cancer spheroids from multiple cancer types, we characterized local and systemic immune responses triggered by reprogramming and developed a viral platform for delivering PIB directly to tumors. RESULTS In vivo tumor cell reprogramming demonstrated faster kinetics and higher fidelity than in vitro approaches and resulted in tumor-resident cDC1-like cells showing a mature, immunogenic signature. Reprogramming efficiently progressed in human cancer spheroids despite the presence of immunosuppressive cancer-associated fibroblasts, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or pericytes, leading to T cell activation and tumor cell elimination. In murine immune-competent models, reprogrammed tumor cells recruited and expanded polyclonal cytotoxic and memory T cells within the tumor while reducing exhausted and regulatory populations. The formation of tertiary lymphoid structures containing B, T, and stromal cells was observed, switching the immune response from “cold” to “hot.” Immune remodeling led to tumor regression independently of endogenous cDC1. CD4+ T cells were identified as critical mediators, because their depletion with antibodies abolished the therapeutic response. Furthermore, in vivo reprogramming established tumor-specific systemic immunity and immunological memory in melanoma models with varying profiles of immunogenicity and responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. In addition to the monotherapy effects, we observed a marked synergy with anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (anti–PD-1) or anti–cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (anti–CTLA-4) immunotherapies. We further confirmed that reprogramming <2% of cells was sufficient to trigger tumor regression, supporting the intratumoral delivery of reprogramming factors. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates that in situ delivery of PIB using adenoviral vectors induces the generation of cDC1-like cells within tumors, leading to remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures, and the expansion of polyclonal cytotoxic and memory T cells. This work provides preclinical proof-of-concept for an off-the-shelf, tumor-specific immunotherapy that can orchestrate systemic and durable antitumor immunity. In vivo reprogramming of tumor cells to dendritic cells. (1) Adenoviral delivery of PIB to tumors generates cDC1-like cells, marked by XCR1, CLEC9A, MHC-I/II, and CD40 expression. (2) Reprogrammed tumor cells promote the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures, infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and polyclonal cytotoxic CD4+ T cells, (3) leading to tumor regression, immunological memory, and the control of abscopal tumors and lung metastasis.

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma has a unique tumor microenvironment (TME), which is characterized as a complex microenvironment comprising of bone cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and heterogeneous vascular structures. These elements are intricately embedded in a mineralized extracellular matrix, setting it apart from other primary TMEs. In a state of normal physiological function, these cell types collaborate in a coordinated manner to maintain the homeostasis of the bone and hematopoietic systems. However, in the pathological condition, i.e., neoplastic malignancies, the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) has been shown to promote cancer cells proliferation, migration, apoptosis and drug resistance, as well as immune escape. The intricate and dynamic system of the TIME in osteosarcoma involves crucial roles played by various infiltrating cells, the complement system, and exosomes. This complexity is closely associated with tumor cells evading immune surveillance, experiencing uncontrolled proliferation, and facilitating metastasis. In this review, we elucidate the intricate interplay between diverse cell populations in the osteosarcoma TIME, each contributing uniquely to tumor progression. From chondroblastic and osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells to osteoclasts, stromal cells, and various myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets, the comprehensive single-cell analysis provides a detailed roadmap of the complex osteosarcoma ecosystem. Furthermore, we summarize the mutations, epigenetic mechanisms, and extracellular vesicles that dictate the immunologic landscape and modulate the TIME of osteosarcoma. The perspectives of the clinical implementation of immunotherapy and therapeutic approaches for targeting immune cells are also intensively discussed.">

        <tr id="High-grade gliomas are a major health challenge with poor prognosis and high morbidity. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have emerged as promising therapeutic options for several malignancies yet show little efficacy against central nervous system (CNS) tumors. CD200 is a newly recognized immune checkpoint that modulates immune homeostasis. CD200 protein is expressed by a variety of cells, including immune cells and stromal cells, and is overexpressed by many tumors. The shedding of CD200 from tumor cells can create an immunosuppressive environment that dampens anti-tumor immunity by modulating cytolytic activity and cytokine expression both within and outside the tumor microenvironment (TME). While it is well-accepted that CD200 induces a pro-tumorigenic environment through its ability to suppress the immune response, we sought to determine the role of glioma-specific expression of CD200. We show that CD200 is expressed across glioma types, is shed from tumor cells, and increases over time in the serum of patients undergoing immunotherapy. Using CD200 knockout (KO) glioma models, we demonstrated that glioma cell-derived CD200 promotes tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. Notably, CD200 KO gliomas are spontaneously rejected by their host, a process that required a fully functional immune system, including NK and T-cells. Moreover, we report that glioma-derived or brain-injected soluble CD200 contributes to the suppression of antigen-specific CD8 T-cells in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Our work provides new mechanistic insights regarding CD200-mediated immunosuppression by gliomas. Statement of significance We demonstrate mechanisms of the druggable glioma-derived CD200 checkpoint on tumor growth and immune suppression.">

        <tr id="HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a progressive demyelinating disease of the spinal cord due to chronic inflammation. Hallmarks of disease pathology include dysfunctional anti-viral responses and the infiltration of HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells and HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in the central nervous system. HAM/TSP individuals exhibit CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with elevated co-expression of multiple inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs), but ICP blockade strategies can only partially restore CD8+ T-cell effector function. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles, can enhance the spread of viral infections and blunt anti-viral responses. Here, we evaluated the impact of exosomes isolated from HTLV-1-infected cells and HAM/TSP patient sera on dendritic cell (DC) and T-cell phenotypes and function. We observed that exosomes derived from HTLV-infected cell lines (OSP2) elicit proinflammatory cytokine responses in DCs, promote helper CD4+ T-cell polarization, and suppress CD8+ T-cell effector function. Furthermore, exosomes from individuals with HAM/TSP stimulate CD4+ T-cell polarization, marked by increased Th1 and regulatory T-cell differentiation. We conclude that exosomes in the setting of HAM/TSP are detrimental to DC and T-cell function and may contribute to the progression of pathology with HTLV-1 infection.">

This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) reduces the expansion of TFH cells and the associated autoantibody production in lupus-prone mice. Integrated cellular, transcriptomic, epigenetic and metabolic analyses showed that 2DG reversed the enhanced cell expansion and effector functions, as well as mitochondrial and lysosomal defects in lupus TFH cells, which include an increased chaperone-mediated autophagy induced by TLR7 activation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of 2DG-reprogrammed TFH cells protected lupus-prone mice from disease progression. Orthologs of genes responsive to 2DG in murine lupus TFH cells were overexpressed in the TFH cells of SLE patients, suggesting a therapeutic potential of targeting glycolysis to eliminate aberrant TFH cells and curb the production of autoantibodies inducing tissue damage.">

However, we still lack mechanistic understanding of the factors regulating immunity induced by this platform, especially innate pathways. We utilized a human tonsil organoid model to study the regulation of adaptive responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-α was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-α-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-α and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells, including TFH. These data provide key insights into innate pathways regulating ChAdOx1-induced immunity and highlights the promise of this model for vaccine platform mechanistic studies.

        <tr id="Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are key mediators of lung function and are potential targets for therapies during respiratory infections. TGFβ is an important regulator of AM differentiation and maintenance, but how TGFβ directly modulates the innate immune responses of AMs remains unclear. This shortcoming prevents effective targeting of AMs to improve lung function in health and disease. Here we leveraged an optimized ex vivo AM model system, fetal-liver derived alveolar-like macrophages (FLAMs), to dissect the role of TGFβ in AMs. Using transcriptional analysis, we first globally defined how TGFβ regulates gene expression of resting FLAMs. We found that TGFβ maintains the baseline metabolic state of AMs by driving lipid metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation and restricting inflammation. To better understand inflammatory regulation in FLAMs, we next directly tested how TGFβ alters the response to TLR2 agonists. While both TGFβ (+) and TGFβ (−) FLAMs robustly responded to TLR2 agonists, we found an unexpected activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses in FLAMs and primary AMs in a TGFβ-dependent manner. Surprisingly, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and the interferon regulator factors 3 and 7 were required for IFN production by TLR2 agonists. Together, these data suggest that TGFβ modulates AM metabolic networks and innate immune signaling cascades to control inflammatory pathways in AMs.">

We previously identified lysyl oxidase (LOX) and olfactomedin like-3 (OLFML3) as essential macrophage and microglia chemokines, respectively, in GBM. Here, single-cell transcriptomics and multiplex sequential immunofluorescence followed by functional studies demonstrate that macrophages negatively correlate with microglia in the GBM tumor microenvironment. LOX inhibition in PTEN-deficient GBM cells upregulates OLFML3 expression via the NF-κB-PATZ1 signaling pathway, inducing a compensatory increase of microglia infiltration. Dual targeting macrophages and microglia via inhibition of LOX and the CLOCK-OLFML3 axis generates potent anti-tumor effects and offers a complete tumor regression in more than 60% of animals when combined with anti-PD1 therapy in PTEN-deficient GBM mouse models.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Antibodies that target immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) are approved for treatment of multiple cancer types. Chemotherapy is often administered with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies that target CTLA-4 and/or PD-(L)1. ICB targeting other immune checkpoints such as lymphocyte activating gene-3 (LAG-3) has the potential to improve antitumor responses when combined with chemotherapy. Response to anti-PD-1 ICB is dependent on progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX) in the tumor, but it is unclear how chemotherapy alters TPEX proportions and phenotype. Methods Here we investigated whether sequential chemotherapy altered TPEX frequency and immune checkpoint expression in multiple murine tumor models. Results Two doses of two different anti-metabolite chemotherapies increased tumor infiltrating CD4+, and CD8+ TPEX expressing LAG-3 in multiple mouse models, which was not restricted to tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cells. To determine if LAG-3+tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) could be targeted to improve tumor control, we administered anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 ICB after two doses of chemotherapy and found combination therapy generated robust antitumor responses compared with each agent alone. Both anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 ICB with chemotherapy were required for the complete tumor regression observed. Conclusions Changes in immune checkpoint expression on TILs during chemotherapy administration informs selection of ICB therapies to combine with.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT High-grade serious ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is an aggressive malignancy that remains refractory to current immunotherapies. While advanced stage disease has been extensively studied, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote early immune escape in HGSOC remain largely unexplored. Here, we report that primary HGSO tumors program neutrophils to inhibit T cell anti-tumor function by activating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1α. We found that intratumoral neutrophils exhibited overactivation of ER stress response markers compared with their counterparts at non-tumor sites. Selective deletion of IRE1α in neutrophils delayed primary ovarian tumor growth and extended the survival of mice with HGSOC by enabling early T cell-mediated tumor control. Notably, loss of IRE1α in neutrophils sensitized tumor-bearing mice to PD-1 blockade, inducing HGSOC regression and long-term survival in ~ 50% of the treated hosts. Hence, neutrophil-intrinsic IRE1α facilitates early adaptive immune escape in HGSOC and targeting this ER stress sensor might be used to unleash endogenous and immunotherapy-elicited immunity that controls metastatic disease.">

        <tr id="The intestinal immune system maintains a balance between active immunity needed for protection and tolerance towards harmless antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) found in the intestinal mucosa are key to the adaptive arm of these immunoregulatory events. DCs sample antigens in the tissue and then migrate to the draining lymph nodes, where they prime the T cells that then migrate back to the tissue as effector or regulatory cells. Intestinal DC are highly heterogeneous, and it remains unclear exactly which subsets induces the different kinds of immune response, or what signalling molecules and cellular mechanisms are involved. Here, we have studied these issues using Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb) infection in mice, a model which is uniquely suited to dissecting this regulatory circuit in the gut, where it drives type 2 protective immunity at the same time as inhibiting other aspects of the immune response. Here, we characterise intestinal DC during Hpb infection for the first time. We observed a dynamical change of intestinal DC populations throughout the course of infection that correlated with altered phenotype and function. In particular, Hpb infection saw a rise in a population of CD103+ DC2 that retained a potent ability to drive Tregs during the infection and unlike CD103-DC2, had a reduced ability to induce pro-inflammatory immune response. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed that TGFβ signalling may be responsible for some of the changes observed. This was confirmed in vitro, where supplementation TGFβ or Hpb-produced TGFβ mimic (TGM) replicated the immunomodulatory effects seen in DCs in vivo. Together, these results present a mechanistic explanation of how helminths such as Hpb may modulate host immune responses by altering the differentiation and function of local DCs. Furthermore, our work provides the basis for understanding immune homeostasis in the intestine at the molecular and cellular levels. Thus, this work fills out a crucial gap in our knowledge of basic biology underlining the DC decision between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response in the central circuit of adaptive immune response.">

To date, it remains elusive how the duration of TN-DC interactions and integration of activation signals are controlled in vivo. Here, we report that lymphoid stroma-secreted ligands for CCR7 constrained interaction duration by gradually inducing CD8+ T cell release from DCs. At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses. In sum, our findings uncover that lymphoid stromal chemokines act as built-in “disruptors” of T cell-DC interactions for long-term preservation of TEFF functionality.">

CNTN4 bound to amyloid precursor protein (APP) on T cells, which attenuated conjugation between cancer cells and T cells, and diminished T cell receptor signaling cascades. We developed an anti-CNTN4 antibody (GENA-104A16) and an anti-APP antibody (5A7) that blocked the binding between CNTN4 and APP. Administration of either GENA-104A16 or 5A7 promoted antitumor T cell responses in a syngeneic mouse model and increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in vivo. Furthermore, elevated CNTN4 levels were associated with poor prognosis and negatively correlated with various cytotoxic immune-related markers. These results suggest that CNTN4-APP is an inhibitory checkpoint in T cells and represents a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Targeting the CNTN4-APP axis may boost anticancer immunity and improve conventional immunotherapy efficacy. Editor’s summary Contactin-4 (CNTN4) is an adhesion molecule known to engage amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain, but the function of this axis in T cells and antitumor immunity is not known. Jeon et al. explored the immunomodulatory role of CNTN4-APP, finding that CNTN4 expressed on tumor cells prevents T cell activation by engaging APP on T cells. They developed an anti-CNTN4 antibody (GENA-104A16) and an anti-APP antibody (5A7) and found that blocking the CNTN4-APP interaction promoted tumor killing. Expression of APP on T cells negatively correlated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer. These findings indicate that CNTN4-APP functions as an inhibitory checkpoint in T cells. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="The liver routinely encounters antigens from the gut, triggering pro- inflammatory responses. Unresolved inflammation can lead to liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is influenced by various immune cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which exhibit both innate and adaptive immunity traits. Here, we examined iNKT cell dynamics in a diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in iNKT cell numbers in HCC livers due to apoptosis and impaired cytokine production. CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, displayed delayed tumor initiation and lower tumor and foci number. However, these tumors were larger in size and characterized by enhanced proliferation and immunosuppression. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of healthy iNKT cells post-tumor establishment reduced tumor burden, highlighting their potential therapeutic role. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells contribute to early HCC development, while in later stages they help to control tumor growth, thus underscoring their complex role in liver carcinogenesis. Further understanding of iNKT cell functions may inform novel immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC management.">

In vitro, CD300e-deficient macrophages exhibit enhanced pro-inflammatory activity and phagocytic capacity, coupled with reduced efferocytosis, suggesting a critical role for CD300e in promoting tumor progression.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease characterized by expanding demyelinating lesions, leading to severe and irreversible disability. The mechanisms driving lesion expansion, however, remain poorly understood. Here, using a multi-omics approach, we identified foamy microglia as primary contributors to the molecular profile of lesions and disease progression in secondary progressive MS. Lesions with foamy microglia are marked by the accumulation of cholesterol esters, bismonoacylglycerolphosphates (BMP), and oxylipins, along with high B-cell infiltration, increased levels of immunoglobulin G1, and elevated expression of Fcγ- and complement receptors. Lesions with foamy GPNMB+-microglia display markers of enhanced phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, lysosomal dysfunction, and antigen presentation, but lack classical pro-inflammatory markers. Our data suggest that sustained phagocytosis of myelin overwhelms microglial endo-lysosomal capacity, leading to lipid droplet and oxylipin formation. This microglial phenotype may induce further recruitment of adaptive immune cells, axonal damage, drive lesion expansion and prevent remyelination. Monoacylglycerol lipase, involved in producing oxylipin precursors, was identified as a potential therapeutic target to disrupt this cycle and prevent chronic lesion expansion.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cancer immunotherapy has evolved rapidly in the last decade. A newly emerging immunotherapeutic approach utilizes oncolytic viruses to enhance the ability of the body’s own immune system to recognize and clear tumor cells. We have recently developed a novel chimeric oncolytic virus and demonstrated its anti-tumoral effects in various preclinical mouse models. To gain mechanistic insights into the immune response to this form of therapy at the cellular level and to identify targets to potentially further improve the therapy, we analyzed the immune cell signature in the tumors, blood, and lymphoid tissue in a syngeneic melanoma mouse model by flow cytometry. Both local and systemic immune responses were observed. Furthermore, selective depletion of cytotoxic T cells indicated that these cells are the main players in mediating the therapeutic response to this novel virotherapy. Abstract Background/Objectives: Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. We have previously described a recombinant hybrid oncolytic virus (OV), VSV-NDV, which has a favorable safety profile and therapeutic immunogenicity, leading to direct oncolysis, abscopal effects, and prolonged survival in syngeneic in vivo tumor models. While OVs are known to mediate systemic anti-tumor immune responses, the detailed characterization of local and systemic immune responses to fusogenic oncolytic virotherapy remains unexplored. Methods and Results: We analyzed immune cell compartments in the spleen, blood, tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), and tumors over the course of VSV-NDV therapy in a bilateral syngeneic melanoma mouse model. Our results revealed significant local infiltration and activation of T lymphocytes in tumors and globally in the blood and spleen. Notably, in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion led to complete abrogation of the tumor response, highlighting the crucial role of T cells in promoting the therapeutic effects of oncolytic VSV-NDV. In vitro co-culture experiments enabled the interrogation of human immune cell responses to VSV-NDV-mediated oncolysis. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were efficiently stimulated by exposure to VSV-NDV-infected cancer cells, which recapitulates the in vivo murine findings. Conclusions: Taken together, these data characterize a broad anti-tumor immune cell response to oncolytic VSV-NDV therapy and suggest that CD8+ T cells play a decisive role in therapeutic outcome, which supports the further development of this chimeric vector as a multimechanistic immunotherapy for solid cancers.">

        <tr id="Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are the regenerative force of the gut epithelium. Lgr5+-ISC have been shown to respond to changes in their microenvironment by coping with different metabolites, adapting to caloric changes, and recovering from injury and inflammation. However, how pathogenic bacteria affect adult stem cell regeneration and, as a consequence, the overall tissue adaption to infection has yet to be explored in depth. Here, we interrogated early Lgr5+ ISC responses to an enteric intracellular pathogen by profiling individual IECs from the mouse small intestine. Utilizing GFP-labeled Salmonella enterica, we isolated intracellular invaded cells to elucidate invasion programs of epithelial cell subsets. In particular, we identified a Salmonella-specific infection signature comprised of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, including the Defensin gene family. Our findings demonstrate that Salmonella enterica targets differentiated Paneth, enterocytes, and stem/progenitor cells at these early stages of infection. In response, a rapid Lg5+ ISC-driven cellular remodeling to enterocyte and Paneth lineages expressing AMP genes is initiated to combat the intruders. Importantly, we uncovered an ISC differentiation program via inflammasome activation to protect the crypt environment, while eliminating infected stem cells from the overall stem cell pool. This novel Lgr5+ stem cell defense mechanism not only protects the gut epithelium from persistent bacterial infection but also promotes tissue regeneration. We propose epithelial remodeling to AMP-secreting cells as a novel innate immune response to handle different gut stresses mediated by Lgr5+ ISCs to maintain organizational principles of gut homeostasis and physiology.">

        <tr id="The identification of specific markers for microglia has been a long-standing challenge. Recently, markers such as P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls have been proposed as microglia-specific and widely used to explore microglial functions within various central nervous system (CNS) contexts. The specificity of these markers was based on the assumption that circulating monocytes retain their distinct signatures even after infiltrating the CNS. However, recent findings reveal that infiltrating monocytes can adopt microglia-like characteristics while maintaining a pro-inflammatory profile upon permanent engraftment in the CNS.In this study, we utilize bone marrow chimeras, single-cell RNA sequencing, ATAC-seq, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that engrafted monocytes acquire expression of established microglia markers—P2ry12, TMEM119, Fcrls—and the pan-myeloid marker Iba1, which has been commonly mischaracterized as microglia-specific. These changes are accompanied by alterations in chromatin accessibility and shifts in chromatin binding motifs that are indicative of microglial identity. Moreover, we show that engrafted monocytes dynamically regulate the expression of CX3CR1, CCR2, Ly6C, and transcription factors PU.1, CTCF, RUNX, AP-1, CEBP, and IRF2, all of which are crucial for shaping microglial identity. This study is the first to illustrate that engrafted monocytes in the retina undergo both epigenetic and transcriptional changes, enabling them to express microglia-like signatures. These findings highlight the need for future research to account for these changes when assessing the roles of monocytes and microglia in CNS pathology. Significance Statement Monocytes can express putative microglia markers P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls upon engraftment into the retina. Given their involvement in neuroinflammation, it is crucial to consider this overlap when utilizing these markers for experimental analysis.">

Here, we extensively validate a combination of scRNA-seq profiling and matching flow cytometry isolation that reproducibly identifies 7 key CM and Endo populations across mouse strains and accurately surveys both niche locations. We demonstrate that different perturbations exert specific effects on different compartments, with type I interferon responses causing CM mesenchymal stromal cells to adopt an inflammatory phenotype associated with overproduction of chemokines modulating local monocyte dynamics in the surrounding microenvironment.

        <tr id="Animal models of stress and stress-related disorders are also associated with blood neutrophilia. The mechanistic relevance of this to symptoms or behavior is unclear. We used cytometry, immunohistochemistry, whole tissue clearing, and single-cell sequencing to characterize the meningeal immune response to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress in mice. We find that chronic, but not acute, stress causes meningeal neutrophil accumulation, and CSD increases neutrophil trafficking in vascular channels emanating from skull bone marrow (BM). Transcriptional analysis suggested CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils. Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protected against the anhedonic and anxiogenic effects of CSD stress, potentially through reduced infiltration of IFNAR+ neutrophils into the meninges from skull BM. Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders.

However, Th2 responses are notably absent from known host-microbiota intestinal immune circuits. Notably, the commensal protist Tritrichomonas induces a transient innate ILC2 circuit rather than a chronic Th2 circuit. Canonical Th2 responses rely on the induction of IL-4 production by innate cells. This study shows that the absence of Tet2, a DNA demethylase, reprograms naïve T cells to autonomously produce IL-4 upon T cell receptor stimulation, bypassing the need for IL-4 from innate cells for Th2 differentiation. Loss of this checkpoint induces chronic Th2 responses to Tritrichomonas, associated with IL-25-dependent barrier dysfunction and increased susceptibility to allergic pathology in response to dietary antigens.

        <tr id="Severe viral pneumonia can induce rapid expansion of KRT5+ basal-like cells in small airways and alveoli; this forms a scar-like structure that persists in the injured alveoli and impedes normal alveolar epithelium regeneration. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which viral infection induced this remodeling response. Through comparing different lung-injury models, we demonstrated that infection induced strong IFN-γ signal–stimulated dysplastic KRT5+ cell formation. Inactivation of interferon receptor 1 (Ifngr1) reduced dysplastic cell formation, ameliorated lung fibrosis, and improved lung-function recovery. Mechanistically, IFN-γ regulated dysplastic cell formation via the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) pathway. Inhibiting FAK/Src diminished IFN-γ–induced YAP nuclear translocation and dysplastic cell formation. Inhibiting YAP during viral infection prevented dysplastic cell formation, whereas inhibiting YAP in persistent KRT5+ cells led to their conversion into distal club cells. Importantly, human dysplastic cells exhibited elevated FAK and YAP activity, and IFN-γ treatment promoted the transformation of human alveolar progenitor cells into dysplastic cells. These findings uncover the role of infection-induced inflammatory response in alveolar remodeling and may provide potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of alveolar remodeling in patients with severe viral pneumonia.">

Key findings and limitations: sTIM-3 is elevated in the plasma of patients with mccRCC and shows distinct associations with survival on anti-PD-1 vs anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4. sTIM-3 is independent from other clinical and biological factors. Myeloid immune cells appear as the prominent source of sTIM-3, which may indicate their dysfunctional role in the antitumor immune response. Future investigations are warranted in patients treated with anti-PD-1 + antiangiogenic therapies. Further functional studies are needed to confirm its theranostic value and clarify its role in the immune response. Conclusions and clinical implications: sTIM-3 appears to be a promising biomarker for optimizing treatment strategies in ccRCC as well as a potential therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="The interaction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) with T cells within G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts in patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains to be elucidated. Through studying allo- and auto-PBSC grafts, we observed grafts containing large numbers of T cells and MDSCs with intergraft variability in their percentage and number. T cells from autologous grafts compared to allografts expressed relative higher percentages of inhibitory receptors PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM-3, LAG-3, TIGIT and BTLA. Autograft T cells had decreased cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion, which supported the possible presence of T cell exhaustion. On the contrary, graft monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs) expressed multiple inhibitory receptor ligands, including PD-L1, CD86, Galectin-9, HVEM and CD155. The expression of inhibitory receptor ligands on M-MDSCs was correlated with their corresponding inhibitory receptors on T cells in the grafts. Isolated M-MDSCs had the ability to suppress T cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion and/or promote Treg expansion. Blocking the PD-L1-PD-1 signaling pathway partially reversed the functions of M-MDSCs. Taken together, our data indicated that T cells and M-MDSCs in PBSC grafts express complementary inhibitory receptor–ligand pairing, which may impact the quality of immune recovery and clinical outcome post transplantation.">

        <tr id="Functional tumor-specific CD8+ T cells are essential for an effective anti-tumor immune response and the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In comparison to other organ sites, we found higher numbers of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in primary, metastatic liver tumors in murine tumor models. Despite their abundance, CD8+ T cells in the liver displayed an exhausted phenotype. Depletion of CD8+ T cells showed that liver tumor-reactive CD8+ T failed to control liver tumors but was effective against subcutaneous tumors. Similarly, analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from patients showed a higher frequency of exhausted tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells in liver metastasis compared to paired primary colon cancer. High-dimensional, multi-omic analysis combining proteomic CODEX and scRNA-seq data revealed enriched interaction of SPP1+ macrophages and CD8+ tumor-reactive T cells in profibrotic, alpha-SMA rich regions in the liver. Liver tumors grew less in Spp1-/- mice and the tumor-specific CD8+ T cells were less exhausted. Differential pseudotime trajectory inference analysis revealed extrahepatic signaling promoting an intermediate cell (IC) population in the liver, characterized by co-expression of VISG4, CSF1R, CD163, TGF-βR, IL-6R, SPP1. scRNA-seq of a third data set of premetastatic adenocarcinoma showed that enrichment of this population may predict liver metastasis. Our data suggests a mechanism by which extrahepatic tumors facilitate the formation of liver metastasis by promoting an IC population inhibiting tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell function.">

        <tr id="In central nervous system (CNS) diseases characterized by late-onset neurodegeneration, the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the resident immune cells of the Central Nervous System (CNS), play crucial roles in homeostasis, immune responses, and the modulation of neuronal functions. In brain tumors, microglia are difficult to distinguish from infiltrating macrophages and are collectively called Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs). While these cells exhibit plasticity, support tumor growth, and suppress antitumor immune responses, their identity and function remain largely unknown. Cellular senescence, a state of growth arrest associated with the upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4A (Cdkn2a), can both suppress and promote tumor progression via the secretion of inflammatory and tissue remodeling factors, collectively known as Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). By leveraging existing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of murine brain tumors, we identified a population of Cdkn2a-positive TAMs involved in immune regulation and neurogenesis, characterized by high expression of Emb and Cd93, which we named MECC (Microglia-like, and Emb-, CD93- and Cdkn2a-positive) cells. In humans, these cells were more prevalent in recurrent glioblastoma and associated with poorer prognosis. Comparative analysis of brain samples from patients with neurodegeneration and healthy older individuals revealed the specificity of MECCs for brain tumors. These findings suggest that MECCs are a unique and distinct cell population associated with aggressive brain tumors, which could potentially serve as targets for novel treatments.">

Bregs have been shown to maintain immune homeostasis and modulate inflammatory responses. Bregs are an exciting cellular target across a range of diseases, including Breg induction in autoimmunity, allergy and transplantation, and Breg suppression in cancers and infection. Bregs exhibit a remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, rendering their unequivocal identification a challenging task. The lack of a universally accepted and exclusive surface marker set for Bregs across various studies contributes to inconsistencies in their categorization. This review paper presents a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the phenotypic and functional properties of human Bregs while addressing the persisting ambiguities and discrepancies in their characterization. Finally, the paper examines the promising therapeutic opportunities presented by Bregs as their immunomodulatory capacities have gained attention in the context of autoimmune diseases, allergic conditions, and cancer. We explore the exciting potential in harnessing Bregs as potential therapeutic agents and the avenues that remain open for the development of Breg-based treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that lacks hormone receptors and HER2 amplification, making it unresponsive to standard hormone or HER2-targeted therapies. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in tumors with high lymphocyte infiltration, their efficacy remains limited in tumors with minimal lymphocyte infiltration. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel approach to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from an immunosuppressive to an inflammatory phenotype within the tumor microenvironment (TME), aiming to enhance therapeutic outcomes in TNBC. Methods We designed a chimeric cytokine receptor (ChCR) that triggers STAT1 signaling upon stimulation with IL-10 or TGFβ, cytokines prevalent in the TME that typically drive immunosuppression. Human primary macrophages were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing the ChCR, and changes in their phenotype, secretome, and transcriptome were analyzed following stimulation. The anti-tumoral activity of these reprogrammed macrophages was assessed using co-culture assays with 3D TNBC spheroids. Results ChCR expressing macrophages showed robust STAT1 activation in response to IL-10 or TGFβ stimulation, resulting in an inflammatory phenotype similar to IFNγ activation, as confirmed by phenotypic markers, and transcriptomic profiling. These ChCR-stimulated macrophages demonstrated significant anti-tumoral effects in 3D TNBC spheroids. Moreover, ChCR stimulation led to the upregulation of genes associated with good response to ICIs, among others CXCL9 and CXCL10, chemokines essential for lymphocyte recruitment. Secretion of CXCL10 was also confirmed by ELISA. Conclusion We successfully engineered a ChCR that reprograms TAMs within an IL-10- and TGFβ-rich environment, inducing an inflammatory phenotype and anti-tumoral activity. The expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 further supports lymphocyte recruitment, potentially facilitating greater lymphocyte infiltration and disrupting the immunosuppressive TME. This approach offers a promising strategy to improve immunotherapy outcomes in TNBC patients, particularly those with low immune cell infiltration, thereby addressing a critical unmet clinical need.">

        <tr id="Background Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a serious liver disease characterized by immune disorders, particularly effector T-cell overactivation. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanism of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicle (MSC-EV) treatment on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and liver injury in AIH. Methods The metabolic changes of CD4+ T cells were assayed in human AIH and mouse hepatitis models. The liver protective effect of MSC-EVs was evaluated by transaminase levels, liver histopathology and inflammation. The effect of MSC-EVs on the metabolic state of CD4+ T cells was also explored. Results Enhanced glycolysis (eg, ~1.5-fold increase in hexokinase 2 levels) was detected in the CD4+ T cells of AIH patient samples and mouse hepatitis models, whereas the inhibition of glycolysis decreased CD4+ T-cell activation (~1.8-fold decrease in CD69 levels) and AIH liver injury (~6-fold decrease in aminotransferase levels). MSC-EV treatment reduced CD4+ T-cell activation (~1.5-fold decrease in CD69 levels) and cytokine release (~5-fold decrease in IFN-γ levels) by reducing glycolysis (~3-fold decrease) while enhancing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (~2-fold increase in maximal respiration) in such cells. The degree of liver damage in AIH mice was ameliorated after MSC-EV treatment (~5-fold decrease in aminotransferase levels). MSC-EVs carried abundant mitochondrial proteins and might transfer them to metabolically reprogram CD4+ T cells, whereas disrupting mitochondrial transfer impaired the therapeutic potency of MSC-EVs in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusion Disordered glucose metabolism promotes CD4+ T-cell activation and associated inflammatory liver injury in AIH models, which can be reversed by MSC-EV therapy, and this effect is at least partially dependent on EV-mediated mitochondrial protein transfer between cells. This study highlights that MSC-EV therapy may represent a new avenue for treating autoimmune diseases such as AIH.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Fungal pathogens are underappreciated causes of significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In previous studies, we determined that a heat-killed, Cryptococcus neoformans fbp1-deficient strain (HK-fbp1) is a potent vaccine candidate. We determined that vaccination with HK-fbp1 confers protective immunity against lethal Cryptococcosis in an interferon γ (IFNγ)-dependent manner. In this study, we set out to uncover cellular sources and relevant targets of the protective effects of IFNγ in response to the HK-fbp1 vaccine. We found that early IFNγ production peaks at day 3 and that monocytes and neutrophils are important sources of this cytokine after vaccination. Neutralization of IFNγ at day 3 results in impaired CCR2+ monocyte recruitment and reduced differentiation into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC). In turn, depletion of CCR2+ cells prior to immunization results in impaired activation of IFNγ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells. Thus, monocytes are important targets of innate IFNγ and help promote further IFNγ production by lymphocytes. We employed monocyte-fate mapper and conditional STAT1 knockout mice to uncover that STAT1 activation in CD11c+ cells, including alveolar macrophages, Mo-DCs, and monocyte-derived macrophages (Mo-Mac) is essential for HK-fbp1 vaccine-induced protection. Altogether, our aggregate findings suggest critical roles for innate cells as orchestrators of vaccine-induced protection against Cryptococcus infection. IMPORTANCE The number of patients susceptible to invasive fungal infections across the world continues to rise at an alarming pace yet current antifungal drugs are often inadequate. Immune-based interventions and novel antifungal vaccines hold the promise of significantly improving patient outcomes. In previous studies, we identified a Cryptococcus neoformans mutant strain (Fbp1-deficient) as a potent, heat-inactivated vaccine candidate capable of inducing homologous and heterologous antifungal protection. In this study, we used a combination of methods together with a cohort of conditional knockout mouse strains to interrogate the roles of innate cells in the orchestration of vaccine-induced antifungal protection. We uncovered novel roles for neutrophils and monocytes as coordinators of a STAT1-dependent cascade of responses that mediate vaccine-induced protection against invasive cryptococcosis. This new knowledge will help guide the future development of much-needed antifungal vaccines.">

        <tr id="In the tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma, myeloid cells act as a double-edged sword—they are a major cellular component modulating the immune response while presenting a potential therapeutic target. Our study highlights the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1, predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, as a crucial regulator of their physiological functions. We discovered a strong correlation between increased Hv1 expression and poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. Depleting Hv1 significantly extended survival in a mouse model of glioma. Employing multiple novel transgenic mouse lines, we demonstrated that Hv1 is upregulated in response to tumor presence, with glioma-associated macrophages as the principal contributors. Specifically, we identified that Hv1 in infiltrating macrophages as the major driver of survival phenotype differences. Through a combination of in vivo two-photon imaging, spectral flow cytometry, and spatial transcriptomic sequencing, we found that Hv1 depletion leads to reduced macrophage infiltration and enhanced antigen presentation, ultimately fostering a stronger adaptive immune response. These findings establish the Hv1 channel as a crucial new immune regulator within the brain tumor milieu, offering a promising target for reprogramming macrophage function to combat glioblastoma.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial in cancer development and therapeutic response. Immunotherapy is increasingly recognized as a critical component of cancer treatment. While immunotherapies have shown efficacy in various cancers, including breast cancer, patient responses vary widely. Some patients receive significant benefits, while others experience minimal or no improvement. This disparity underscores the complexity and diversity of the immune system. In this study, we investigated the immune landscape and cell–cell communication within the TME of breast cancer through integrated analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data. We established profiles of tumor immune infiltration that span across a broad spectrum of adaptive and innate immune cells. Our clustering analysis of immune infiltration identified three distinct patient groups: high T cell abundance, moderate infiltration, and low infiltration. Patients with low immune infiltration exhibited the poorest survival rates, while those in the moderate infiltration group showed better outcomes than those with high T cell abundance. Moreover, the high cell abundance group was associated with a greater tumor burden and higher rates of TP53 mutations, whereas the moderate infiltration group was characterized by a lower tumor burden and elevated PIK3CA mutations. Analysis of an independent single-cell RNA-seq breast cancer dataset confirmed the presence of similar infiltration patterns. Further investigation into ligand–receptor interactions within the TME unveiled significant variations in cell–cell communication patterns among these groups. Notably, we found that the signaling pathways SPP1 and EGF were exclusively active in the low immune infiltration group, suggesting their involvement in immune suppression. This work comprehensively characterizes the composition and dynamic interplay in the breast cancer TME. Our findings reveal associations between the extent of immune infiltration and clinical outcomes, providing valuable prognostic information for patient stratification. The unique mutations and signaling pathways associated with different patient groups offer insights into the mechanisms underlying diverse tumor immune infiltration and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Currently, there are no effective therapies for glioblastoma. Infiltrating myeloid cells contributes significantly to the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment that is characteristic of GBM. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells are chief immune suppressive cells found in the glioma microenvironment. Understanding the mechanisms of M-MDSC differentiation and T-cell suppression is imperative for generating therapies that target this tumor-supportive cell population. In this study, we found that glioma-secreted CSF1R ligands, M-CSF and IL-34, promote M-MDSCs to suppress CD8 T cells. These M-MDSCs partially utilize nitric oxide synthase to illicit their suppressive activity. However, spatial RNAseq points to glioma microenvironment niches driving M-MDSC heterogeneity. Our findings identify key regulators of differentiation and suppressive mechanisms of M-MDSCs and confirm the importance of targeting this cell population in glioma. Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, resulting in poor survival despite aggressive therapies. GBM is characterized by a highly heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) made up predominantly of infiltrating peripheral immune cells. One significant immune cell type that contributes to glioma immune evasion is a population of immunosuppressive cells, termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Previous studies suggest that a subset of myeloid cells, expressing monocytic (M)-MDSC markers and dual expression of chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1, utilize CCR2 to infiltrate the TME. This study evaluated the mechanism of CCR2+/CX3CR1+ M-MDSC differentiation and T cell suppressive function in murine glioma models. We determined that bone marrow-derived CCR2+/CX3CR1+ cells adopt an immune suppressive cell phenotype when cultured with glioma-derived factors. Glioma-secreted CSF1R ligands M-CSF and IL-34 were identified as key drivers of M-MDSC differentiation while adenosine and iNOS pathways were implicated in the M-MDSC suppression of T cells. Mining a human GBM spatial RNAseq database revealed a variety of different pathways that M-MDSCs utilize to exert their suppressive function that is driven by complex niches within the microenvironment. These data provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of M-MDSCs in glioblastoma.">

DN T-cell subsets were analyzed prospectively in 10 HIV+ individuals during acute infection and following early ART initiation compared to 20 HIV-uninfected controls. In this study, 21 Rhesus macaques (RMs) were SIV-infected, of which 13 were assessed during acute infection and 8 following ART initiation four days post-infection. DN T-cells and FoxP3+ DN Treg frequencies increased during acute HIV infection, which was not restored by ART. The expression of activation (HLA-DR/CD38), immune checkpoints (PD-1/CTLA-4), and senescence (CD28−CD57+) markers by DN T-cells and DN Tregs increased during acute infection and was not normalized by ART. In SIV-infected RMs, DN T-cells remained unchanged despite infection or ART, whereas DN Treg frequencies increased during acute SIV infection and were not restored by ART. Finally, frequencies of CD39+ DN Tregs increased during acute HIV and SIV infections and remained elevated despite ART. Altogether, acute HIV/SIV infections significantly changed DN T-cell and DN Treg frequencies and altered their immune phenotype, while these changes were not fully normalized by early ART, suggesting persistent HIV/SIV-induced immune dysregulation despite early ART initiation.">

        <tr id="Cancer treatment has been rapidly transformed by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1. However, many patients fail to respond, especially those with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), suggesting the existence of additional immune checkpoints that act through orthogonal mechanisms. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-7 and -9 are newly designated glycoimmune checkpoints that are abundantly expressed by tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. We discovered that T cells express only basal levels of Siglec transcripts; instead, they acquire Siglec-7 and -9 from interacting myeloid cells in the TME via trogocytosis, which impairs their activation and effector function. Mechanistically, Siglec-7 and -9 suppress T cell activity by dephosphorylating T cell receptor (TCR)-related signaling cascades. Using sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry, we developed a ligand that binds to Siglec-7 and -9 with high-affinity and exclusive specificity. Using this ligand, we constructed a Siglec-7/9 degrader that targets membrane Siglec-7 and -9 to the lysosome for degradation. Administration of this degrader induced efficient Siglec degradation in both T cells and myeloid cells in the TME. We found that Siglec-7/9 degradation has a negligible effect on macrophage phagocytosis, but significantly enhances T cell anti-tumor immunity. The degrader, particularly when combined with anti-CTLA-4, enhanced macrophage antigen presentation, reshaped the TME, and resulted in long-lasting T cell memory and excellent tumor control in multiple murine tumor models. These findings underscore the need to consider exogenous checkpoints acquired by T cells in the TME when selecting specific checkpoint blockade therapy to enhance T cell immunity.">

        <tr id="Drugs that eliminate senescent cells, senolytics, can be powerful when combined with pro-senescence cancer therapies. Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen, we identify here SLC25A23 as a vulnerability of senescent cancer cells. Suppressing SLC25A23 disrupts cellular calcium homeostasis, impairs oxidative phosphorylation and interferes with redox signaling, leading to death of senescent cells. These effects can be replicated by salinomycin, a cation ionophore antibiotic. Salinomycin prompts a PANoptosis-like cell death in senescent cells, including apoptosis and two forms of immunogenic cell death: necroptosis and pyroptosis. Notably, we observed that salinomycin treatment or SLC25A23 suppression elevates reactive oxygen species, upregulating death receptor 5 via JNK pathway activation. We show that a combination of a DR5 agonistic antibody and salinomycin is a robust senolytic cocktail. We provide evidence that this drug combination provokes a potent NK and CD8+ T cell mediated immune destruction of senescent cancer cells, mediated by the pyroptotic cytokine IL18. Significance The efficacy of multiple cancer drugs is limited by the induction of senescence, which enables cancer cells to evade cell death. We uncover here a new selective vulnerability of senescent cancer cells and we show that this vulnerability can be targeted with a commonly-used antibiotic. We show that a combination of senescence-inducing therapy, combined with this antibiotic causes a highly immunogenic cell death phenotype that further stimulates potent immune destruction of senescent cancer cells.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) greatly contribute to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance of cancer. However, its underlying mechanisms and whether TAMs can be promising targets to overcome ICI resistance remain to be unveiled. Through integrative analysis of immune multiomics data and single‐cell RNA‐seq data (iMOS) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lymphotoxin β receptor (LTBR) is identified as a potential immune checkpoint of TAMs, whose high expression, duplication, and low methylation are correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Immunofluorescence staining shows that the infiltration of LTBR+ TAMs is associated with LUAD stages, immunotherapy failure, and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, LTΒR maintains immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype of TAMs by noncanonical nuclear factor kappa B and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathways. Macrophage‐specific knockout of LTBR hinders tumor growth and prolongs survival time via blocking TAM immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype. Moreover, TAM‐targeted delivery of LTΒR small interfering RNA improves the therapeutic effect of ICI via reversing TAM‐mediated immunosuppression, such as boosting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and inhibiting granulocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells infiltration. Taken together, we bring forth an immune checkpoint discovery pipeline iMOS, identify LTBR as a novel immune checkpoint of TAMs, and propose a new immunotherapy strategy by targeting LTBR+ TAMs.">

        <tr id="The thymus is the central organ involved with T-cell development and the production of naïve T cells. During normal aging, the thymus undergoes marked involution, reducing naïve T-cell output and resulting in a predominance of long-lived memory T cells in the periphery. Outside of aging, systemic stress responses that induce corticosteroids (CS), or other insults such as radiation exposure, induce thymocyte apoptosis, resulting in a transient acute thymic involution with subsequent recovery occurring after cessation of the stimulus. Despite the increasing utilization of immunostimulatory regimens in cancer, effects on the thymus and naïve T cell output have not been well characterized. Using both mouse and human systems, the thymic effects of systemic immunostimulatory regimens, such as high dose IL-2 (HD IL-2) with or without agonistic anti-CD40 mAbs and acute primary viral infection, were investigated. These regimens produced a marked acute thymic involution in mice, which correlated with elevated serum glucocorticoid levels and a diminishment of naïve T cells in the periphery. This effect was transient and followed with a rapid thymic “rebound” effect, in which an even greater quantity of thymocytes was observed compared to controls. Similar results were observed in humans, as patients receiving HD IL-2 treatment for cancer demonstrated significantly increased cortisol levels, accompanied by decreased peripheral blood naïve T cells and reduced T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), a marker indicative of recent thymic emigrants. Mice adrenalectomized prior to receiving immunotherapy or viral infection demonstrated protection from this glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution, despite experiencing a substantially higher inflammatory cytokine response and increased immunopathology. Investigation into the effects of immunostimulation on middle aged (7-12 months) and advance aged (22-24 months) mice, which had already undergone significant thymic involution and had a diminished naïve T cell population in the periphery at baseline, revealed that even further involution was incurred. Thymic rebound hyperplasia, however, only occurred in young and middle-aged recipients, while advance aged not only lacked this rebound hyperplasia, but were entirely absent of any indication of thymic restoration. This coincided with prolonged deficits in naïve T cell numbers in advanced aged recipients, further skewing the already memory dominant T cell pool. These results demonstrate that, in both mice and humans, systemic immunostimulatory cancer therapies, as well as immune challenges like subacute viral infections, have the potential to induce profound, but transient, glucocorticoid-mediated thymic involution and substantially reduced thymic output, resulting in the reduction of peripheral naive T cells. This can then be followed by a marked rebound effect with naïve T cell restoration, events that were shown not to occur in advanced-aged mice.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Limited activation and infiltration of CD8+ T cells are major challenges facing T cell-based immunotherapy for most solid tumors, of which the mechanism is multilayered and not yet fully understood. Methods Levels of CD93 expression on monocytes from paired non-tumor, peritumor and tumor tissues of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were evaluated. The underlying mechanisms mediating effects of CD93+ monocytes on the inhibition and tumor exclusion of CD8+ T cells were studied through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results In this study, we found that monocytes in the peritumoral tissues of HCC significantly increased levels of CD93 expression, and these CD93+ monocytes collocated with CD8+ T cells, whose density was much higher in peritumor than intratumor areas. In vitro experiments showed that glycolytic switch mediated tumor-induced CD93 upregulation in monocytes via the Erk signaling pathway. CD93 on the one hand could enhance PD-L1 expression through the AKT-GSK3β axis, while on the other hand inducing monocytes to produce versican, a type of matrix component which interacted with hyaluronan and collagens to inhibit CD8+ T cell migration. Consistently, levels of CD93+ monocytes positively correlated with the density of peritumoral CD8+ T cells while negatively correlated with that of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. Targeting CD93 on monocytes not only increased the infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells but also enhanced tumor sensitivity to anti-PD-1 treatment in mice in vivo. Conclusion This study identified an important mechanism contributing to the activation and limited infiltration of CD8+ T cells in solid tumors, and CD93+ monocytes might represent a plausible immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.">

        <tr id="Proliferating tumor cells take up glutamine for anabolic processes engendering glutamine deficiency in the tumor microenvironment. How this might impact immune cells is not well understood. Using multiple mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, glutamine antagonists, as well as genetic and pharmacological inhibition of glutamine utilization, we found that the number and frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) is dependent on microenvironmental glutamine levels. cDCs comprise two distinct subsets – cDC1 and cDC2, with the former subset playing a critical role in antigen cross-presentation and tumor immunity. While both subsets show dependence on Glutamine, cDC1s are particularly sensitive. Notably, glutamine antagonism did not reduce the frequency of DC precursors but decreased proliferation and survival of cDC1s. Further studies suggest a role of the nutrient sensing mTOR signaling pathway in this process. Taken together, these findings uncover glutamine dependence of cDC1s that is coopted by tumors to escape immune responses. One Sentence Summary Type 1 conventional dendritic cells require glutamine to maintain their number in non-lymphoid tissue. Significance Immune evasion is a key hallmark of cancer; however, the underlying pathways are diverse, tumor-specific and not fully elucidated. Many tumor cells avidly import glutamine to support their anabolic needs, creating a glutamine-deficient tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, using mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, we show that glutamine depletion in TME leads to reduced type 1 conventional dendritic cells – a cell type that is critical for adaptive immune responses. This work is a paradigm for how tumor cell metabolism can regulate anti-tumor immune responses and will be foundational to future efforts targeting glutamine metabolism for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Smooth muscle cell (SMC) plasticity and phenotypic switching play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, but their role in tumorigenesis is unknown. We investigated whether and how SMC diversity and plasticity plays a role in tumor angiogenesis and the tumor microenvironment. Methods and Results We use SMC-specific lineage-tracing mouse models and single cell RNA sequencing to observe the phenotypic diversity of SMCs participating in tumor vascularization. We find that a significant proportion of SMCs adopt a phenotype traditionally associated with macrophage-like cells. These cells are transcriptionally similar to ‘resolution phase’ M2b macrophages, which have been described to have a role in inflammation resolution. Computationally predicted by the ligand-receptor algorithm CellChat, signaling from BST2 on the surface of tumor cells to PIRA2 on SMCs promote this phenotypic transition; in vitro SMC assays demonstrate upregulation of macrophage transcriptional programs, and increased proliferation, migration, and phagocytic ability when exposed to BST2. Knockdown of BST2 in the tumor significantly decreases the transition towards a macrophage-like phenotype, and cells that do transition have a comparatively higher inflammatory signal typically associated with anti-tumor effect. Conclusion As BST2 is known to be a poor prognostic marker in multiple cancers where it is associated with an M2 macrophage-skewed TME, these studies suggest that phenotypically switched SMCs may have a previously unidentified role in this immunosuppressive milieu. Further translational work is needed to understand how this phenotypic switch could influence the response to anti-cancer agents and if targeted inhibition of SMC plasticity would be therapeutically beneficial.">

        <tr id="Abstract Myeloid malignancies arise in bone marrow microenvironments and shape these microenvironments in favor of malignant development. Immune suppression is one of the most important stages in myeloid leukemia progression. Leukemic clone expansion and immune dysregulation occur simultaneously in bone marrow microenvironments. Complex interactions emerge between normal immune system elements and leukemic clones in the bone marrow. In recent years, researchers have identified several of these pathological interactions. For instance, recent works shows that the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), from bone marrow stromal cells contributes to immune dysregulation and the selective proliferation of JAK2V617F+ clones in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Moreover, inflammasome activation and sterile inflammation result in inflamed microenvironments and the development of myelodysplastic syndromes. Additional immune dysregulations, such as exhaustion of T and NK cells, an increase in regulatory T cells, and impairments in antigen presentation are common findings in myeloid malignancies. In this review, we discuss the role of altered bone marrow microenvironments in the induction of immune dysregulations that accompany myeloid malignancies. We also consider both current and novel therapeutic strategies to restore normal immune system function in the context of myeloid malignancies.">

        <tr id="We identified molecular interactions between duodenal enterocytes and intraepithelial T cells in celiac disease (CeD) vs normal controls. We observed an expected increased ratio of T cells [bearing either T cell receptor (TCR) αβ or γδ and mostly activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) expressing granzyme B, CD45RO, Ki67 and Nur 77 proteins as well as IFNγ mRNA] to villous enterocytes. Few T cells (<5%) express NKG2C or DAP12 proteins. CeD villous enterocytes express an IFNγ signature (by single cell RNA sequencing and nuclear phopho-STAT1 and HLA-DR protein staining). CeD enterocytes express increased IFNγ-inducible chemokines CCL3, CCL4, CXCL10 and CXCL11 mRNA while CeD intraepithelial T cells express reduced levels of CCR5 and CXCR3 chemokine receptors, suggesting ligand-induced downregulation. CeD enterocyte HLA-E mRNA and protein are upregulated whereas HLA-B mRNA but not protein increases. Proximity ligation detected frequent interactions of αβ and γδ TCRs with HLA-E and HLA-B but not with HLA-DR and fewer NKG2C interactions with HLA-E. We suggest that CeD IFNγ-producing TCR αβ and γδ CTLs are recruited into villous epithelium by IFNγ-induced enterocyte production of CCR5 and CXCR3-binding chemokines and kill villous enterocytes primarily by TCR engagement with class I HLA molecules, including HLA-E, likely presenting gluten peptides. The IFN-γ signature of CeD villous enterocytes is a potential biomarker of active disease and a therapeutic target.">

        <tr id="Background Immune therapies are emerging as a critical component of cancer treatment, capable of delivering durable and potentially curative responses. While CAR-T cell therapy has proven effective for hematological malignancies, it faces challenges in treating solid tumors due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and physical barriers hindering CAR-T cell infiltration. NK cells, particularly adaptive NK (aNK) cells, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to recognize and kill tumor cells without prior sensitization and their resistance to immunosuppressive environments. Purpose The study investigates the role of cytokines, specifically IL-21 and IL-15, in enhancing aNK cell expansion and activation using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Methods Buffy coats and GBM TILs were collected from Karolinska Hospital. NK cells were isolated and expanded in vitro with IL-15 and IL-21 cytokines and feeder cells (K562 and K562E). Furthermore, tumor lysate was added in the cultures to boost memory responses in aNK cells. NK cell functionality, cytotoxicity, and phenotyping was assessed using flow cytometry and statistical analysis (t-test and two-way ANOVA) used to validate the results. Further animal model was used to validate the cytotoxicity capacities of these cells against GBM tumors using a zebrafish model. Results IL-21 drives the expansion of aNK better than IL-15 controls, data shown in PBMCs and TILs derived from GBM patients and IPLA OVCA patients. Additionally, the use of tumor lysate as a booster for restimulation further amplifies the cytotoxic capacity of aNK cells against autologous tumors. The zebrafish model validates this method, by decreasing the tumor size in zebrafish animals after 3 days of injection. Conclusion The results demonstrate that IL-21 is essential for the specific expansion of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. Additionally, tumor lysate significantly increases the cytotoxic efficacy of aNK cells upon restimulation with the same tumor cells. These findings suggest that IL-21 plays a crucial role in the specific expansion and activation of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. By optimizing the expansion protocol, this method aims to advance the clinical application of aNK cells in immunotherapies for solid tumors, offering a potential solution to the limitations faced by current CAR-T therapies.">

        <tr id="Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is primarily categorized into basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most prevalent form of skin cancer, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), the second most common type. Both BCC and cSCC represent a significant health burden, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. The immune system plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of NMSC, making it a critical focus for therapeutic interventions. This review highlights key immunological targets in BCC and cSCC, with a focus on immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4, which regulate T cell activity and contribute to immune evasion. This review also highlights anti-tumor immune cell subsets within the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and dendritic cells. Additionally, it examines the immunosuppressive elements of the TME, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as well as their roles in NMSC progression and resistance to therapy. Emerging strategies targeting these immune elements, such as monoclonal antibodies, are also discussed for their potential to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve clinical outcomes. By elucidating the immunological landscape of BCC and cSCC and drawing comparisons to melanoma, this review highlights the transformative potential of immunotherapy in treating these malignancies.">

        <tr id="Abstract High-grade serous ovarian cancer remains a poorly understood disease with a high mortality rate. Although most patients respond to cytotoxic therapies, a majority will experience recurrence. This may be due to a minority of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells (CSC) that survive chemotherapy and are capable of repopulating heterogeneous tumors. It remains unclear how CSCs are supported in the tumor microenvironment (TME) particularly during chemotherapy exposure. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) make up half of the immune population of the ovarian TME and are known to support CSCs and contribute to cancer progression. TAMs are plastic cells that alter their phenotype in response to environmental stimuli and thus may influence CSC maintenance during chemotherapy. Given the plasticity of TAMs, we studied the effects of carboplatin on macrophage phenotypes using both THP1- and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)–derived macrophages and whether this supports CSCs and ovarian cancer progression following treatment. We found that carboplatin exposure induces an M1-like proinflammatory phenotype that promotes SOX2 expression, spheroid formation, and CD117+ ovarian CSCs, and that macrophage-secreted CCL2/MCP-1 is at least partially responsible for this effect. Depletion of TAMs during carboplatin exposure results in fewer CSCs and prolonged survival in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. This study supports a role for platinum-based chemotherapies in promoting a transient proinflammatory M1-like TAM that enriches for CSCs during treatment. Improving our understanding of TME responses to cytotoxic drugs and identifying novel mechanisms of CSC maintenance will enable the development of better therapeutic strategies for high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Significance: We show that chemotherapy enhances proinflammatory macrophage phenotypes that correlate with ovarian cancer progression. Given that macrophages are the most prominent immune cell within these tumors, this work provides the foundation for future translational studies targeting specific macrophage populations during chemotherapy, a promising approach to prevent relapse in ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Glioblastoma is known to be highly immunosuppressive in nature. Plasmacytoid dendritic cell infiltration is known to be associated with glioblastoma progression and promotes tumor immunosuppression. We provide important details to indicate that glioblastoma cell-secreted CCL21 plays a dual role both in recruiting plasmacytoid dendritic cells via binding to CCR7 and activating plasmacytoid dendritic cells through the CCR7/ACKR4—β-arrestin/CIITA pathway. Our result also provides a rationale to therapeutically target CCL21 as a potential novel treatment for glioblastoma. Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that are traditionally divided into two distinct subsets: myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). pDCs are known for their ability to secrete large amounts of cytokine type I interferons (IFN- α). In our previous work, we have demonstrated that pDC infiltration promotes glioblastoma (GBM) tumor immunosuppression through decreased IFN-α secretion via TLR-9 signaling and increased suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) via increased IL-10 secretion, resulting in poor overall outcomes in mouse models of GBM. Further dissecting the overall mechanism of pDC-mediated GBM immunosuppression, in this study, we identified CCL21 as highly upregulated by multiple GBM cell lines, which recruit pDCs to tumor sites via CCL21-CCR7 signaling. Furthermore, pDCs are activated by CCL21 in the GBM microenvironment through intracellular signaling of β-arrestin and CIITA. Finally, we found that CCL21-treated pDCs directly suppress CD8+ T cell proliferation without affecting regulatory T cells (Tregs) differentiation, which is considered the canonical pathway of immunotolerant regulation. Taken together, our results show that pDCs play a multifaced role in GBM immunosuppression, and CCL21 could be a novel therapeutic target in GBM to overcome pDC-mediated immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils play a crucial role in various pathophysiological conditions, yet targeting them for therapeutic intervention has been discouraged due to the associated risk of infections. Thus, identification of neutrophil subsets and their involvement in inflammatory conditions is warranted for targeted therapeutic strategies. This study, through screening of surface proteins on neutrophils isolated from different tissue microenvironments, identified a distinct neutrophil subset, CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils, expressing Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). Interestingly, these Sca1pos neutrophils were more abundant in the liver than BM, blood, and lungs. Further analysis revealed that Sca1pos neutrophils are mature and activated with enhanced effector functions, including superoxide generation, phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis. Tracing studies demonstrated ageing-independent characteristics of Sca1pos neutrophils. Remarkably, Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophils promote T cell proliferation through ROS, while inhibition of Sca-1 restores T cell proliferation and ROS generation. Intriguingly, inflammatory as well as metabolic cues induce the transition of conventional neutrophils (Sca1neg) to Sca1pos neutrophils and differentiation of progenitors (granulocyte monocyte progenitors, GMPs) into Sca1pos neutrophils. Furthermore, in vivo models of acute inflammation, peritonitis, and chronic inflammatory condition, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), exhibit an increase of Sca1pos neutrophils at inflammatory sites, while the pharmacological approach using NAC specifically mitigates the expansion of these pro-inflammatory neutrophils. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel subset of Sca1pos neutrophils with implications for inflammation. Significance Statement Neutrophilic inflammation remains the leading driver in infectious and inflammatory diseases. Targeting neutrophil populations remained un-recommended due to hampering the immunological functions of neutrophils. The heterogeneity of neutrophils provides the perspective to target altered neutrophil subsets, but subtle changes defining neutrophil subsets make it complex and ambiguous. Our study identified abundant expression of Sca1on distinct neutrophils under steady state and inflammation. Thus, we reported previously undefined Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophil subsets and elucidated their regulation. This study further established their involvement in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. This understanding may further pave the way toward targeting specific neutrophil subsets in pathologies characterized by neutrophilic inflammation. Graphical Abstract Highlights CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophil subset identified with <1% presence in BM and >40% frequency in the liver. These neutrophils are mature and activated, demonstrating enhanced effector functions. Sca1pos neutrophils promote T cell proliferation and display pro-inflammatory characteristics. Conventional Sca1neg neutrophils transition into Sca1pos neutrophils in response to inflammatory signals, while progenitors undergo differentiation. Both acute and chronic inflammatory models show the expansion of CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils.">

        <tr id="Simultaneous analysis of T cell receptor repertoire and T cell phenotype is of high relevance to gain a deeper understanding on the T cell response in terms of differentiation, kinetics and persistence. Also it is currently unknown how the repertoire of immune checkpoints on T cells evolves over time. To fully capture the heterogenous response, TCR repertoire and T cell phenotype analysis is preferably performed at the single-cell level, but this is costly and analytically challenging. Therefore, we developed a flow cytometry based method that allows for simultaneous characterization of the T cell TCR Vβ and the phenotype. We generated a 9-tube 24-color panel with antibodies against maturation and activation markers, and 24 TCR Vβ chains. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 5 healthy controls were analyzed, revealing the presence of oligoclonal expansions. Within the CD27+CD28+ memory T cell population, oligoclonal expansions were characterized by a T regulatory, or KLRG1+CCR7-CD27low phenotype. Within the late CD27- and/or CD28-memory T cells, the populations with the lowest TCR Vβ diversity expressed CX3CR1. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the dynamics of circulating oligoclonal T cell expansions that emerged following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the presence of CMV in 2 patients. We provide evidence that oligoclonal T cells transferred from donor to recipient can be traced up to at least 2.5 years while maintaining its phenotype. Mostly TIGIT and PD-1 were critical in defining T cell expansions, while CD45RA, CD57, CD56 and NKG2A were variably expressed. Overall, we developed a phenotype based method to trace T cell populations, that is widely applicable to different settings in which the T cell response needs to be monitored.">

        <tr id="The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1-α (IRE1α) is associated with lung infections where innate immune cells are drivers for progression and resolution of inflammation. Yet, the role of IRE1α in pulmonary innate immune host defense during acute respiratory infection remains unexplored. Here, we found that activation of IRE1α in infected lungs compromises immunity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-induced primary and secondary pneumonia. Moreover, activation of IRE1α in MRSA-infected lungs and alveolar macrophages (AMs) leads to exacerbated production of inflammatory mediators followed by cell death. Ablation of myeloid IRE1α or global IRE1α inhibition confers protection against MRSA-induced pneumonia with improves survival, bacterial clearance, cytokine reduction, and lung injury. In addition, loss of myeloid IRE1α protects mice against MRSA-induced secondary to influenza pneumonia by promoting AM survival. Thus, activation of IRE1α is detrimental to pneumonia and therefore, it shows potential as a target to control excessive unresolved lung inflammation.">

        <tr id="Introduction Patients with chronic HBV infection (CHI) exhibit defective anti-viral immune-response whose underlying causes still remain unclear. Monocytes act as immune sentinels for pathogens and can regulate immunity via interaction with other immune-cells, apart from differentiating into macrophages. Immune-checkpoint molecules (ICMs) expressed by immune-cells, including monocytes are known to negatively regulate immune-responses. Here, we evaluated the expression of ICMs, namely, Gal-9, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 on monocytes in different phases of CHI, identified the viral and the host factors causing their aberrant expression and investigated their impact during interaction of monocytes with T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells and also on monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Influence of Tenofovir therapy on the expression of monocytic ICMs was also studied. Methods Collection of blood and liver-tissue samples from HBV infected patients and controls, flow-cytometry, cell sorting, cell culture and immune-fluorescence were performed for this study. Results Gal-9+ and PD-L1+-monocytes were significantly increased in HBeAg-positive as well as HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients than healthy controls (HC). In immune-tolerant (IT) subjects, only Gal-9+-monocytes and in inactive carriers (IC), PD-L1+-monocytes were higher than HC while CTLA-4+-monocytes remained comparable among groups. High serum Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) concentration in CHB as well as IT and TNF-α in CHB triggered monocytic Gal-9-expression whereas, PD-L1 was induced by elevated TNF-α and IL-4 in CHB and IL-1β in CHB and IC. Purified monocytes from CHB and IT having high Gal-9 expression led to expansion of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+-Tregs, CD19+IL-10+-Bregs and CD19+CD27-CD21–atypical memory B-cells and these monocytes also preferentially differentiated into M2-macrophages. These phenomena were reversed by anti-Gal-9-antibody. Parallelly, PD-L1+-monocytes in CHB and IC reduced IL-2/IFN-γ and IL-6 production by HBV-specific T- and B-cells respectively, which were restored by anti-PD-L1-antibody. Both Gal-9+- and PD-L1+-monocytes caused decline in IFN-γ+-NK-cells but enhanced IL-10-expressing HBV-specific-T-cells and NK-cells. Increased intrahepatic CD14+Gal-9+ and CD14+PD-L1+-monocytes were noted in CHB patients than HC. One-year tenofovir therapy failed to reduce monocytic Gal-9 and PD-L1 along with the levels of HBsAg, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-4. Conclusions Monocytic Gal-9 and PD-L1, expressed heterogeneously in different phases of CHI, exert diverse inhibitory effects on immune-responses and their therapeutic targeting could boost anti-HBV immunity.">

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment, with oncolytic adenoviruses showing power as immunotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the immunotherapeutic potential of an adenovirus construct expressing CXCL9, CXCL10, or IL-15 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumor models. Our results demonstrated robust cytokine secretion upon viral treatment, suggesting effective transgene expression. Subsequent analysis using resistance-based transwell migration and microfluidic chip assays demonstrated increased T-cell migration in response to chemokine secretion by infected cells in both 2D and 3D cell models. Flow cytometry analysis revealed CXCR3 receptor expression across T-cell subsets, with the highest percentage found on CD8+ T-cells, underscoring their key role in immune cell migration. Alongside T-cells, we also detected NK-cells in the tumors of immunocompromised mice treated with cytokine-encoding adenoviruses. Furthermore, we identified potential immunogenic antigens that may enhance the efficacy and specificity of our armed oncolytic adenoviruses in ccRCC. Overall, our findings using ccRCC cell line, in vivo humanized mice, physiologically relevant PDCs in 2D and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) in 3D suggest that chemokine-armed adenoviruses hold promise for enhancing T-cell migration and improving immunotherapy outcomes in ccRCC. Our study contributes to the development of more effective ccRCC treatment strategies by elucidating immune cell infiltration and activation mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and highlights the usefulness of PDOs for predicting clinical relevance and validating novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Overall, our research offers insights into the rational design and optimization of viral-based immunotherapies for ccRCC.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the brain’s resident macrophages, can be reconstituted by surrogate cells - a process termed “microglia replacement.” To expand the microglia replacement toolkit, we here introduce estrogen-regulated (ER) homeobox B8 (Hoxb8) conditionally immortalized macrophages, a cell model for generation of immune cells from murine bone marrow, as a versatile model for microglia replacement. We find that ER-Hoxb8 macrophages are highly comparable to primary bone marrow-derived (BMD) macrophages in vitro, and, when transplanted into a microglia-free brain, engraft the parenchyma and differentiate into microglia-like cells. Furthermore, ER-Hoxb8 progenitors are readily transducible by virus and easily stored as stable, genetically manipulated cell lines. As a demonstration of this system’s power for studying the effects of disease mutations on microglia in vivo, we created stable, Adar1-mutated ER-Hoxb8 lines using CRISPR-Cas9 to study the intrinsic contribution of macrophages to Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS), an inherited interferonopathy that primarily affects the brain and immune system. We find that Adar1 knockout elicited interferon secretion and impaired macrophage production in vitro, while preventing brain macrophage engraftment in vivo - phenotypes that can be rescued with concurrent mutation of Ifih1 (MDA5) in vitro, but not in vivo. Lastly, we extended these findings by generating ER-Hoxb8 progenitors from mice harboring a patient-specific Adar1 mutation (D1113H). We demonstrated the ability of microglia-specific D1113H mutation to drive interferon production in vivo, suggesting microglia drive AGS neuropathology. In sum, we introduce the ER-Hoxb8 approach to model microglia replacement and use it to clarify macrophage contributions to AGS.">

        <tr id="The mucosal immune system is a critical first line of defense to infectious diseases, as many pathogens enter the body through mucosal surfaces, disrupting the balanced interactions between mucosal cells, secretory molecules, and microbiota in this challenging microenvironment. The mucosal immune system comprises of a complex and integrated network that includes the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). One of its primary responses to microbes is the secretion of IgA, whose role in the mucosa is vital for preventing pathogen colonization, invasion and spread. The mechanisms involved in these key responses include neutralization of pathogens, immune exclusion, immune modulation, and cross-protection. The generation and maintenance of high affinity IgA responses require a delicate balance of multiple components, including B and T cell interactions, innate cells, the cytokine milieu (e.g., IL-21, IL-10, TGF-β), and other factors essential for intestinal homeostasis, including the gut microbiota. In this review, we will discuss the main cellular components (e.g., T cells, innate lymphoid cells, dendritic cells) in the gut microenvironment as mediators of important effector responses and as critical players in supporting B cells in eliciting and maintaining IgA production, particularly in the context of enteric infections and vaccination in humans. Understanding the mechanisms of humoral and cellular components in protection could guide and accelerate the development of more effective mucosal vaccines and therapeutic interventions to efficiently combat mucosal infections.">

This study aimed to elucidate the characteristics of CD4+GNLY+ T cells and their relationship with immune restoration. Single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell TCR sequencing, and flow cytometry were used to analyze the frequency, phenotypes, and function of CD4+GNLY+ T cells. Moreover, Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect plasma cytokines production in patients. CD4+GNLY+ T cells were found to be highly clonally expanded, characterized by higher levels of cytotoxicity, senescence, P24, and HIV-1 DNA than CD4+GNLY− T cells. Additionally, the frequency of CD4+GNLY+ T cells increased after ART, and further increased in INRs, and were positively associated with the antiretroviral therapy duration in INR. Furthermore, increased IL-15 levels in INRs positively correlated with the frequency and senescence of CD4+GNLY+ T cells, suggesting that CD4+GNLY+ T cells may provide new insights for understanding the poor immune reconstitution of INRs. In conclusion, increased, highly clonally expanded, and senescent CD4+GNLY+ T cells may contribute to poor immune reconstitution in HIV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Tumor immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment in recent years, offering vast potential. This method primarily involves targeting and inhibiting the suppressive checkpoints present in different immune cells to enhance their activation, ultimately leading to tumor regression. However, tumor cells exploit the surrounding immune cells and tissues to establish a tumor microenvironment (TME) that supports their survival and growth. Within the TME, the efficacy of effector immune cells is compromised, as tumor cells exploit inhibitory immune cells to suppress their function. Furthermore, certain immune cells can be co-opted by tumor cells to facilitate tumor growth. While significantly enhancing the body’s tumor immunity can lead to tumor regression, it can also result in severe toxic side effects and an inflammatory factor storm. As a consequence, patients often discontinue treatment due to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) or, in extreme cases, succumb to toxic side effects before experiencing tumor regression. In this analysis, we examined several remission regimens for irAEs, each with its own drawbacks, including toxic side effects or suppression of tumor immunotherapy, which is undesirable. A recent research study, specifically aimed at downregulating intestinal epithelial barrier permeability, has shown promising results in reducing the severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) while preserving immune function. This approach effectively reduces the severity of IBD without compromising the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ, which are crucial for maintaining the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. Based on the substantial similarities between IBD and ICI colitis (combo immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced colitis), this review proposes that targeting epithelial cells represents a crucial research direction for mitigating irAEs in the future.">

        <tr id="Lung tumor-promoting environmental exposures and γherpesvirus infections are associated with Type 17 inflammation. To test the effect of γherpesvirus infection in promoting lung tumorigenesis, we infected mutant K-Ras-expressing (K-RasLA1) mice with the murine γherpesvirus MHV68 via oropharyngeal aspiration. After 7 weeks, the infected mice displayed a more than 2-fold increase in lung tumors relative to their K-RasLA1 uninfected littermates. Assessment of cytokines in the lung revealed that expression of Type 17 cytokines (Il-6, Cxcl1, Csf3) peaked at day 7 post-infection. These observations correlated with the post-infection appearance of known immune mediators of tumor promotion via IL-17A in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice. Surprisingly, Cd84, an immune cell marker mRNA, did not increase in MHV68-infected wild-type mice lacking lung tumors. Csf3 and Cxcl1 protein levels increased more in the lungs of infected K-RasLA1 mice relative to infected wild-type littermates. Flow cytometric and transcriptomic analyses indicated that the infected K-RasLA1 mice had increased Ly6Gdim/Ly6Chi immune cells in the lung relative to levels seen in uninfected control K-RasLA1 mice. Selective methylation of adenosines (m6A modification) in immune-cell-enriched mRNAs appeared to correlate with inflammatory infiltrates in the lung. These observations implicate γherpesvirus infection in lung tumor promotion and selective accumulation of immune cells in the lung that appears to be associated with m6A modification of mRNAs in those cells.">

        <tr id="Background Broad T cell phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions were prominent in COVID-19. There are few and inconclusive data about the role of immune checkpoints for T cell exhaustion/activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Methods We tested T cell subsets and immune checkpoints in 177 MM patients with COVID-19, as well as in 32 healthy infected controls and 42 uninfected MM patients. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulation and immune checkpoints (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, OX40, and 4-1BB) were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results We have found that pronounced lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio in severe COVID-19 patients were especially developed within the first month after infection. And T cell subset dysregulation was persistent in severe patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune checkpoints on CD4+ T cells were variable and uncorrelated with the level of adaptive immunity, while the proportion of CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with humoral immune response. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in severe patients and sustained for more than 2 months, which was associated with impaired cellular immune function. Moreover, exhausted molecules PD-1 and TIGIT on T cells were reduced in immunotherapy patients. Conclusion The prolonged T cell dysregulation after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the close surveillance from reinfection in MM patients even during convalescence. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells could be important prognostic factors to stratify prognosis in MM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, immunotherapy may downregulate the expression of exhausted checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT, leading to T cell overactivation and severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Gliomas are diverse types of tumors originating from glial cells. Among these tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form and has a poor prognosis and high mortality rate, with treatment success largely influenced by patient age, tumor location, and genetic mutations. Glioma cells can reprogram their tumor microenvironment (TME) to support tumor proliferation and survival, interacting with other cells through cytokines and growth factors. The TME of gliomas is highly heterogeneous, complex, and often immunosuppressive, interfering with treatment strategies. Current therapeutic strategies focus on modulating immune cell activities and enhancing anti-tumor responses. T-cell-based immunotherapies are being explored to target glioma cells. These include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy, which involve engineering T cells to recognize tumor antigens. However, these therapies face multiple challenges including tumor heterogeneity, immunosuppression by T cell exhaustion, and altered antigen presentation, etc. Future research should focus on boosting T cell functions, targeting immune checkpoints, and developing more effective delivery methods to improve treatment outcomes for glioma patients. Abstract Glioma is known for its immunosuppressive microenvironment, which makes it challenging to target through immunotherapies. Immune cells like macrophages, microglia, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and T lymphocytes are known to infiltrate the glioma tumor microenvironment and regulate immune response distinctively. Among the variety of immune cells, T lymphocytes have highly complex and multifaceted roles in the glioma immune landscape. T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, are known for their pivotal roles in anti-tumor responses. However, these cells may behave differently in the highly dynamic glioma microenvironment, for example, via an immune invasion mechanism enforced by tumor cells. Therefore, T lymphocytes play dual roles in glioma immunity, firstly by their anti-tumor responses, and secondly by exploiting gliomas to promote immune invasion. As an immunosuppression strategy, glioma induces T-cell exhaustion and suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells (Tregs) or by altering their signaling pathways. Further, the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors on the glioma cell surface leads to T cell anergy and dysfunction. Overall, this dynamic interplay between T lymphocytes and glioma is crucial for designing more effective immunotherapies. The current review provides detailed knowledge on the roles of T lymphocytes in the glioma immune microenvironment and helps to explore novel therapeutic approaches to reinvigorate T lymphocytes.">

        <tr id="In sepsis, the liver functions as a central filter organ, where hepatic macrophages form a primary antimicrobial defense layer by eliminating bacteria and regulating immune responses. Therefore, precise regulation of the immune response in hepatic macrophages is crucial for triggering effective defense mechanisms. We aim to modulate the defense immune response by delivering transcription factor HIF1α, a key regulator of monocyte/macrophage reprogramming in sepsis. Transcription factors are promising candidates because they dynamically modulate gene expression across diverse conditions, though delivering them remains challenging. In this study, we suggest a novel method for loading HIF1α into extracellular vesicles (EVs) to enhance immune defense and resolve sepsis. By delivering HIF1α to macrophages during sepsis, we promoted the differentiation of Nr1h3-dependent pro-efferocytic MoMFs and C/ebpβ-dependent pro-survival MoMFs. Pro-efferocytic MoMFs eliminate damaged hepatocytes and immune cells and pro-survival MoMFs withstand inflammatory conditions and trigger innate memory responses. Particularly, the zonation of these macrophages in the periportal region ensures effective pathogen clearance and minimizes tissue damage. These findings suggest that EV-mediated HIF1α delivery could be a promising therapeutic option for managing sepsis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a kinase expressed by various immune cells and is often activated under proinflammatory states. Although the majority of BTK-related research has historically focused on B cells, understanding the role of BTK in non-B cell populations is critical given myeloid cells also express BTK at comparable levels. In this study, we investigated and compared how BTK inhibition in human and murine myeloid cells alters cell phenotype and function. All experiments were performed using two BTK inhibitors (evobrutinib and tolebrutinib) that are currently in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Assays were performed to assess the impact of BTK inhibition on cytokine and microRNA expression, phagocytic capacity, and cellular metabolism. In all cells, both evobrutinib and tolebrutinib significantly decreased phosphorylated BTK and LPS-induced cytokine release. BTK inhibition also significantly decreased the oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate in myeloid cells, and significantly decreased phagocytosis in murine-derived cells, but not human macrophages. To further elucidate the mechanism, we also investigated the expression of microRNAs known to impact the function of myeloid cells. BTK inhibition resulted in an altered microRNA expression profile (i.e., decreased miR-155-5p and increased miR-223-3p), which is consistent with a decreased proinflammatory myeloid cell phenotype. In summary, these results provide further insights into the mechanism of action of BTK inhibitors in the context of immune-related diseases, while also highlighting important species-specific and cell-specific differences that should be considered when interpreting and comparing results between preclinical and human studies.">

TME induces T cell exhaustion through long-term antigen stimulation, upregulation of immune checkpoints, recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. CD8+ Tex may be both the reflection of cancer progression and the reason for poor cancer control. The successful outcome of the current cancer immunotherapies, which include immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell treatment, depends on CD8+ Tex.

In this study, we studied the immunological response of murine erythroid cells to acute blood loss using flow cytometry, NanoString immune transcriptome profiling, and BioPlex cytokine secretome profiling. We observed that acute blood loss forces the differentiation of murine erythroid cells in both bone marrow and spleen and that there was an up-regulation of several immune response genes, in particular pathogen-associated molecular pattern sensing gene Clec5a in post-acute blood loss murine bone marrow erythroid cells. We believe that the up-regulation of the Clec5a gene in bone marrow erythroid cells could help bone marrow erythroid cells detect and eliminate pathogens with the help of reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial proteins calprotectin and cathelicidin, the genes of which (S100a8, S100a9, and Camp) dominate the expression in bone marrow erythroid cells of mice.">

        <tr id="Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a tiny structure that contains multiple immune cell components around tumor cells, which plays an important role in tumorigenesis, and is also the potential core area of activated immunotherapy. How immune cells with tumor-killing capacity in TIME are hijacked by tumor cells during the progression of tumorigenesis and transformed into subpopulations that facilitate cancer advancement is a question that needs to be urgently addressed nowadays. γδ T cells (their T cell receptors are composed of γ and δ chains), a unique T cell subpopulation distinguished from conventional αβ T cells, are involved in a variety of immune response processes through direct tumor-killing effects and/or indirectly influencing the activity of other immune cells. However, the presence of γδ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been reported to be associated with poor prognosis in some tumors, suggesting that certain γδ T cell subsets may also have pro-tumorigenic effects. Recent studies have revealed that metabolic pathways such as activation of glycolysis, increase of lipid metabolism, enhancement of mitochondrial biosynthesis, alterations of fatty acid metabolism reshape the local TME, and immune cells trigger metabolic adaptation through metabolic reprogramming to meet their own needs and play the role of anti-tumor or immunosuppression. Combining previous studies and our bioinformatics results, we hypothesize that γδT cells compete for resources with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells by means of fatty acid metabolic regulation in the TME, which results in the weakening or loss of their ability to recognize and kill HCC cells through genetic and epigenetic alterations, thus allowing γδT cells to be hijacked by HCC cells as a subpopulation that promotes HCC progression.">

        <tr id="Melanoma, the most aggressive type of skin cancer with a high mutation rate, is the fifth most common cancer among Caucasians. Despite advancements in treatments like immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, over 40% of patients experience immune-related side effects, presenting significant challenges. Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) has become an essential target in cancer therapy due to its overexpression in various cancers, where it enhances regulatory T cell (Treg) function and supports tumor growth, often leading to poor outcomes. This study investigated the effects of NRP1 inhibition in B16-F10 melanoma and its impact on immune responses regulated by Tregs. NRP1 was overexpressed in several cancers, including B16-F10 cells, compared to non-cancerous NIH-3T3 cells. Inhibiting NRP1 selectively caused apoptosis in B16-F10 cells without affecting NIH-3T3 cells. It also reversed the immunosuppression of splenic T cells induced by B16-F10-conditioned media, reducing Treg markers (NRP1, NKG2A, FOXP3), Treg activity, and the production of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10, IL-17A). Furthermore, NRP1 inhibition increased T cell proliferation and boosted the release of effector cytokines (TNF, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-2). NRP1 inhibition also suppressed the STAT, ERK MAPK, and Smad2/3 pathways while activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. In splenic T cells from B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice treated with an NRP1 inhibitor, there was a decrease in Treg markers and activity, along with enhanced T cell proliferation. Additionally, NRP1 inhibitor treatment reduced lung metastasis, decreased tumor size, and improved survival in these mice. This study shows that inhibiting NRP1 may slow B16-F10 melanoma progression and reduce Treg-mediated immunosuppression. This suggests its potential as a promising approach in future cancer immunotherapies, especially in combination with other treatments.">

NK cells suppressed thymus recovery by aberrantly targeting thymic epithelial cells (TECs), which act as the master regulators of organ function and regeneration.

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) make major contributions to immune homeostasis. Because Treg dysfunction can lead to both allo- and autoimmunity, there is interest in correcting these disorders through Treg adoptive transfer. Two of the central challenges in clinically deploying Treg cellular therapies are ensuring phenotypic stability and maximizing potency. Here, we describe an approach to address both issues through the creation of OX40 ligand (OX40L)–specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–Tregs under the control of a synthetic forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) promoter. The creation of these CAR-Tregs enabled selective Treg stimulation by engagement of OX40L, a key activation antigen in alloimmunity, including both graft-versus-host disease and solid organ transplant rejection, and autoimmunity, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. We demonstrated that OX40L–CAR-Tregs were robustly activated in the presence of OX40L-expressing cells, leading to up-regulation of Treg suppressive proteins without induction of proinflammatory cytokine production. Compared with control Tregs, OX40L–CAR-Tregs more potently suppressed alloreactive T cell proliferation in vitro and were directly inhibitory toward activated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). We identified trogocytosis as one of the central mechanisms by which these CAR-Tregs effectively decrease extracellular display of OX40L, resulting in decreased DC stimulatory capacity. OX40L–CAR-Tregs demonstrated an enhanced ability to control xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease compared with control Tregs without abolishing the graft-versus-leukemia effect. These results suggest that OX40L–CAR-Tregs may have wide applicability as a potent cellular therapy to control both allo- and autoimmune diseases. Human FOXP3 promoter–driven OX40L–CAR-Tregs potently suppress alloreactivity and control graft-versus-host disease. Editor’s summary Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapies have emerged as a promising approach for diseases ranging from autoimmunity to transplantation, but delivery of a mixed pool of Tregs has not proven consistently successful. To make an improved Treg-based therapy, Rui et al. developed OX40L–CAR-Tregs, where expression of an OX40 ligand (OX40L)–specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is expressed only in Tregs that have turned on the master Treg transcription factor FoxP3. The authors showed that OX40L–CAR-Tregs outperformed control, standard Tregs in their ability to suppress effector T cells, in part through their ability to strip OX40L from the surface of antigen-presenting cells. In vivo, OX40L–CAR-Tregs were able to suppress development of graft-versus-host disease without an obvious detrimental effect on the antileukemia response, supporting further development of this potent cellular therapy. —Courtney Malo">

Furthermore, we briefly introduce the clinical implications of IM, emphasizing its potential as a target for novel cancer therapies, diagnostic biomarkers, and prognostic indicators. Notably, microbe-based therapeutic strategies such as fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT), probiotics regulation, bacteriotherapy, bacteriophage therapy, and oncolytic virotherapy are highlighted.

        <tr id="Breastfeeding provides important immunological benefits to the neonate, but how the different immunoactive components in breastmilk contribute to immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized human breastmilk T cells using single-cell RNA-Seq and flow cytometry. Breastmilk contained predominantly memory T cells, with expression of immune signaling genes, high proliferation, and an effector Th1/cytotoxic profile with high cytokine production capacities. Elevated activation was balanced by an enriched Treg population and immune regulatory markers in conventional memory T cells. Gene and surface expression of tissue-residency markers indicate that breastmilk T cells represented tissue-adapted rather than circulatory T cells. In addition, breastmilk T cells had a broad homing profile and higher activation markers in these migratory subsets. The partly overlapping transcriptome profile between breastmilk and breast tissue T cells, particularly cytotoxic T cells, might support a role in local immune defense in the mammary gland. However, unique features of breastmilk, such as Tregs, might imply an additional role in neonatal immune support. We found some correlations between the breastmilk T cell profile and clinical parameters, most notably with maternal and household factors. Together, our data suggest that breastmilk contains an adapted T cell population that exerts their function in specific tissue sites.">

        <tr id="Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality. Editor’s summary During embryonic development, macrophages interact with blood stem cells, removing those exhibiting high levels of cellular stress. The surviving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can proliferate and give rise to blood cell linages in adults. Pessoa Rodrigues et al. used zebrafish models and mammalian systems to investigate signals within HSPCs that could prevent macrophages from engulfing them. Molecules associated with innate immune nucleic acid sensing promoted the expression of Beta-2-microglobulin on the surface of HSPCs to increase their survival when they interacted with macrophages. Impairing this pathway decreased the number of distinct stem cell clones in adult zebrafish. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) produce mature blood cells throughout life. During this process, HSPCs engage in interactions with the variety of cells present in the marrow niche, including macrophages. These macrophages mediate a myriad of processes by releasing cytokines and chemokines and patrolling to remove stressed, dead, or aging cells. In this manner, macrophages contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During hematopoiesis, macrophages ensure the quality of normal blood stem cells and determine the number of hematopoietic clones that participate in adult hematopoiesis. They then either engulf a stem cell completely, referred to as “dooming,” or capture portions of the stem cell’s cellular material, referred to as “grooming.” After grooming, the stem cell continues to divide, whereas the doomed HSPC clone is eliminated. RATIONALE Past work has shown that the HSPC-macrophage interaction is mediated by an “eat-me” signal, calreticulin (Calr), on the surface of HSPCs. Surface Calr levels are increased in stem cells with higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this triggers macrophages to engulf and kill stem cells that have high amounts of stress-activated proteins. However, the specific molecular cues that regulate the dooming versus grooming behavior are still unknown. RESULTS To investigate the cues mediating grooming versus dooming, we screened a panel of 1200 bioactive small molecules in human cells and identified 93 compounds that robustly increased surface CALR in a dose-dependent manner. Of these compounds, 22 also facilitated interactions between macrophages and stem cells in zebrafish. Compounds that depended on ROS to increase CALR showed higher dooming ratios and, conversely, animals treated with ROS-independent compounds exhibited a higher probability of grooming events despite increased CALR and increased macrophage–stem cell interactions. To investigate the signals involved in interactions under ROS-independent conditions, we undertook a genome-wide screen in human cells. We identified Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as a CALR inducer in the “don’t eat me” context. Next, we found that TLR3 expression was required for the expression of the “don’t eat me” signal Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). Antibody staining and studies of a b2m knockout zebrafish line showed that b2m on stem cells was required for preventing the macrophage dooming. To determine whether the increased dooming observed in the b2m mutant affected clonal dominance, we generated mosaic deletions using the zebrabow color barcoding system (TWISTR) as a lineage tracer. Mosaic deletion of b2m reduced the number of myeloid clones but increased clonal dominance. The dominant clones in these fish were wild type for b2m that were resistant to dooming and overtook the adult marrow. TLR3 signaling is activated by double-stranded RNA, which can sometimes be found in cells due to the expression of transcripts associated with repetitive elements (REs), including long terminal repeats (LTRs) and endogenous retroviruses. RE expression in HSPCs positively correlated with elevated levels of B2m. Moreover, overexpressing ltr4 in zebrafish led to higher HSPC proliferation, indicative of decreased dooming. Impairing the TLR3-B2M pathway by disrupting the expression of TLR3, IRF3, or B2M expression decreased the number of blood cell clones in zebrafish. Using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor CM272 to promote up-regulation of REs amplified the proliferation of already established HSPC clones in zebrafish embryos. CONCLUSION Our findings support a model in which endogenous TLR3 ligands lead to expression of b2m, thereby providing a blockade against macrophage-induced dooming and determining hematopoietic stem cell clonality by monitoring stem cell quality with macrophages. The balance of Calr and B2m governs the number of long-lived HSC clones that contribute to the adult blood system through macrophage-mediated quality assurance. This sheds light on the intricate interplay between HSPC clonal expansion and immune-regulated cell clearance. We propose that this protective mechanism may also operate in adulthood in response to environmental stress, such as during infections or in clonal stem cell disorders. Manipulating the levels of “don’t eat-me” and “eat-me” signals may have important therapeutic implications for immune therapy by harnessing the macrophage-selective removal of a mutated stem cell clone. ROS and TLR3 signaling mediates the “eat-me” and “don’t eat me” signals that determine stem cell clonal selection by macrophages. Shown is a schematic overview of the proposed model showing the balance between the Calr-mediated “eat-me” and B2m-mediated “don’t eat-me” signals that influence macrophage behavior.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive, poorly immunogenic cancer and non-responsive to all currently available treatments, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. As survival rates remain low (13%), there is an urgent need for new therapeutic options. A hallmark of PDAC is the limited infiltration of anti-tumor cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data of PDAC tumors from treatment naïve patients reveals high expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. PSGL-1 is an intrinsic negative regulator of CD8+ T cells that promotes the development of functional exhaustion. We therefore hypothesized that PSGL-1-mediated immune suppression is a critical barrier to effective anti-tumor immunity in PDAC. To test this, we used preclinical models of orthotopic injection PDAC tumor cells into pancreata, recapitulating patient responses to PDAC with limited T cell infiltrates and uncontrolled tumor growth in C57BL/6 (wildtype) control mice and compared anti-tumor immune responses in PSGL-1KO (C57BL/6 background) mice. At 28 days post-injection of KPC.4662 PDAC tumor cells, tumor burden in PSGL-1KO mice was reduced by >50% compared to controls, with 45% of PSGL-1KO animals exhibiting >70% reduction. Total immune infiltration (CD45+) was 2-fold greater in tumors from PSGL-1KO mice, with significant increases in infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Detailed analyses revealed that infiltrating CD8+ T cells from PSGL-1KO mice were less terminally differentiated towards exhaustion. PSGL-1KO PD-1+ CD8+ T cells expressed less TOX expression and fewer cells co-expressed CD38 and CD101 while more expressed CX3CR1 compared to controls. Intratumoral PSGL-1KO CD8+ T cells also retained greater functionality as well as indicated by inflammatory cytokine production (IFNg, TNFa) and Granzyme B expression. Moreover, PSGL-1KO mice showed protection against metastatic disease to the lungs. We find that protection by PSGL-1KO mice is T cell dependent as transient depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells prior to tumor cell implantation results in the loss of PDAC tumor growth inhibition by PSGL-1KO mice. Less-differentiated, proliferation-competent precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX) are essential to PD-1 ICB responsiveness in patients and preclinical models. Given that PSGL-1-deficiency limits terminal differentiation of CD8+ T cells in PDAC, we hypothesized that PSGL-1-deficiency would promote responsiveness to PD-1 ICB, which is ineffective as a monotherapy in PDAC patients and mouse models. While therapeutic treatment with anti-PD-1 had no effect on the tumor growth in the control animals, PD-1 ICB resulted in tumor ablation in 85% of PSGL-1KO animals, demonstrating a profound synergistic effect of PD-1 inhibition in the absence of PSGL-1. From these studies, we conclude that PSGL- 1 is a critical inhibitor anti-tumor T cell immunity in PDAC and represents a novel ICB target with high translational potential for promoting immune responses to PDAC tumors.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a malignancy with significant immunosuppressive properties and limited immune activation. This immunosuppression is linked to reduced cytotoxic T-cell activity, impaired antigen presentation, and elevated levels of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules. Studies demonstrate that cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration correlates with improved survival, while increased regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are associated with worse outcomes and therapeutic resistance. Th1 cells are beneficial, whereas Th17 cells, producing interleukin-17 (IL-17), contribute to tumor progression. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1/PD-L1 and TIM-3 are also linked to advanced stages of PCa. Chemotherapy holds promise in converting the "cold" tumor microenvironment (TME) to a "hot" one by depleting immunosuppressive cells and enhancing tumor immunogenicity.


SUMMARY
This comprehensive review examines the immune microenvironment in PCa, focusing on the intricate interactions between immune and tumor cells in the TME. It highlights how TAMs, Tregs, cytotoxic T cells, and other immune cell types contribute to tumor progression or suppression and how PCa's low immunogenicity complicates immunotherapy.


KEY MESSAGES
The infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and Th1 cells correlates with better outcomes, while elevated Tregs and TAMs promote tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance. TANs and NK cells exhibit dual roles, with higher NK cell levels linked to better prognoses. Immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1, PD-L1, and TIM-3 are associated with advanced disease. Chemotherapy can improve tumor immunogenicity by depleting Tregs and MDSCs, offering therapeutic promise.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a pro-cancerous niche harboring immunosuppressive factors that are secreted by cancer cells and the surrounding cancer-supportive tissue, such as kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell-mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co-culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium-throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGFβ type I receptor (TGFβR-1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGFβR-1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGFβR-1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.">

        <tr id="Antigen-specific humoral responses are orchestrated through complex interactions among immune cells in lymphoid tissues, including the collaboration between B cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Accumulating evidence indicates a crucial role for interleukin-9 (IL-9) in the formation of germinal centers (GCs), enhancing the generation of class-switched high-affinity antibodies. However, the exact function of IL-9 in Tfh cell regulation remains unclear. In this study, we examined the humoral immune responses of CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice, which lack an IL-9-specific receptor in Tfh cells. Upon intraperitoneal immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice displayed diminished levels of SRBC-specific IgG antibodies in their sera, along with reduced levels of GC B cells and plasma cells. Notably, Il9ra-deficient Tfh cells in the spleen exhibited decreased expression of their signature molecules such as B-cell lymphoma 6, C-X-C chemokine receptor 5, IL-4, and IL-21 compared to control mice. In models of allergic asthma induced by house dust mite (HDM) inhalation, CD4Cre/+Il9rafl/fl mice failed to elevate serum levels of HDM-specific IgE and IgG. This was accompanied by reductions in Tfh cells, GC B cells, and plasma cells in mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) were identified as producers of IL-9 under immunizing conditions, possibly induced by leukotrienes released by activated IgD+ B cells around the T-B border. These observations may indicate the critical role of IL-9 receptor signaling in the activation of Tfh cells, with ILC2s potentially capable of supplying IL-9 in organized lymphoid tissues.">

 Glioblastoma (GBM) has a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), largely mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we utilized a retroviral replicating vector (RRV) to deliver Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8), a master regulator of type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) development, in a syngeneic murine GBM model. We hypothesized that RRV-mediated delivery of IRF8 could “reprogram” intratumoral MDSCs into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby restore anti-tumor T-cell responses.



 Effects of RRV-IRF8 on survival and tumor growth kinetics were examined in the SB28 murine GBM model. Immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression assays. We assayed functional immunosuppression and antigen presentation by ex vivo T-cell-myeloid co-culture.



 Mice with RRV-IRF8 pre-transduced intracerebral tumors had significantly longer survival and slower tumor growth compared to controls. RRV-IRF8 treated tumors exhibited significant enrichment of cDC1s and CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, myeloid cells derived from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed decreased expression of the immunosuppressive markers Arg1 and IDO1 and demonstrated reduced suppression of naïve T-cell proliferation in ex vivo co-culture, compared to controls. Further, intra-tumoral and cervical lymph node DCs from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed increased antigen presentation compared to those from control tumors. To assess mechanism of action, mice were treated azidothymidine (AZT), a viral replication inhibitor. Untreated mice maintained a superior survival benefit, which demonstrated that viral replication through proliferating cells is necessary for tumor control. This showed that IRF8 transduction in both tumor and non-tumor cells is necessary for survival benefit, associated with a reprogrammed, cDC1- and CD8 T-cell-enriched TIME. Moreover, subset of mice with RRV-IRF8 treated tumors achieved complete tumor clearance and further rejected subcutaneous GBM tumors, indicating the presence of immunological memory.



 Our results indicate that reprogramming of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells by in vivo expression of IRF8 may reduce immunosuppression and enhance antigen presentation in situ, achieving improved tumor control and conferring a significant survival benefit.

        <tr id="Simple Summary The tumor microenvironment (TME) refers to the area immediately surrounding a cancerous tumor that influences the tumor’s behavior and how the immune system reacts to it. Central to the TME environment are special immune cells—tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)—that, rather than restrict the tumor, actually facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, targeting these TAMs can help to eliminate cancer. In this article, we review the biology of TAMs and delve into the signaling mechanisms underlying the polarization of macrophage phenotypes, their plasticity, and therapeutic implications. Abstract Within the tumor microenvironment, myeloid cells constitute a dynamic immune population characterized by a heterogeneous phenotype and diverse functional activities. In this review, we consider recent literature shedding light on the increasingly complex biology of M2-like immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), including their contribution to tumor cell invasion and metastasis, stromal remodeling (fibrosis and matrix degradation), and immune suppressive functions, in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review also delves into the intricate signaling mechanisms underlying the polarization of diverse macrophage phenotypes, and their plasticity. We also review the development of promising therapeutic approaches to target these populations in cancers. The expanding knowledge of distinct subsets of immunosuppressive TAMs, and their contributions to tumorigenesis and metastasis, has sparked significant interest among researchers regarding the therapeutic potential of TAM depletion or phenotypic modulation.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation initiated by inflammatory monocytes underlies the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, approaches that can effectively resolve chronic low-grade inflammation targeting monocytes are not readily available. The small chemical compound 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) exhibits broad anti-inflammatory effects in reducing atherosclerosis. Selective delivery of 4-PBA reprogrammed monocytes may hold novel potential in providing targeted and precision therapeutics for the treatment of atherosclerosis. METHODS: Systems analyses integrating single-cell RNA sequencing and complementary immunologic approaches characterized key resolving characteristics as well as defining markers of reprogrammed monocytes trained by 4-PBA. Molecular mechanisms responsible for monocyte reprogramming were assessed by integrated biochemical and genetic approaches. The intercellular propagation of homeostasis resolution was evaluated by coculture assays with donor monocytes trained by 4-PBA and recipient naive monocytes. The in vivo effects of monocyte resolution and atherosclerosis prevention by 4-PBA were assessed with the high-fat diet-fed ApoE−/− mouse model with IP 4-PBA administration. Furthermore, the selective efficacy of 4-PBA-trained monocytes was examined by IV transfusion of ex vivo trained monocytes by 4-PBA into recipient high-fat diet-fed ApoE−/− mice. RESULTS: In this study, we found that monocytes can be potently reprogrammed by 4-PBA into an immune-resolving state characterized by reduced adhesion and enhanced expression of anti-inflammatory mediator CD24. Mechanistically, 4-PBA reduced the expression of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) via reducing peroxisome stress and attenuating SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase)-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling. Concurrently, 4-PBA enhanced the expression of resolving mediator CD24 through promoting PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) neddylation mediated by TOLLIP (toll-interacting protein). 4-PBA-trained monocytes can effectively propagate anti-inflammation activity to neighboring monocytes through CD24. Our data further demonstrated that 4-PBA-trained monocytes effectively reduce atherosclerosis pathogenesis when administered in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes a robust and effective approach to generate resolving monocytes, characterizes novel mechanisms for targeted monocyte reprogramming, and offers a precision therapeutics for atherosclerosis based on delivering reprogrammed resolving monocytes.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity through their immunosuppressive function. There have been numerous reports confirming that high levels of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are associated with a poor prognosis, highlighting their role in promoting an immunosuppressive environment. In breast cancer (BC), Tregs interact with cancer cells, ultimately leading to the suppression of immune surveillance and promoting tumor progression. This review discusses the dual role of Tregs in breast cancer, and explores the controversies and therapeutic potential associated with targeting these cells. Researchers are investigating various strategies to deplete or inhibit Tregs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokine antagonists, and metabolic inhibition. However, the heterogeneity of Tregs and the variable precision of treatments pose significant challenges. Understanding the functional diversity of Tregs and the latest advances in targeted therapies is critical for the development of effective therapies. This review highlights the latest approaches to Tregs for BC treatment that both attenuate Treg-mediated immunosuppression in tumors and maintain immune tolerance, and advocates precise combination therapy strategies to optimize breast cancer outcomes.">

        <tr id="Cancer, a heterogeneous disease in nature, often requires help from diverse pro-tumor or tumor-associated- cells, which are recruited and persevered within the stroma. Pro-tumor stromal cells provide the essential support needed for tumor growth, metastasis, and development of drug resistance in due time. Tumor-associated macrophages, one of such cells, are essential to tumor microenvironment and tumor survival. In recent years, TAMs have been identified as potential drug targets and therapeutic agents, which encourages the in-depth characterization of their crosstalk with the tumors. The current study has successfully developed a cost-effective in vitro platform for Chemokine Assisted Recruitment of Macrophages to spheroids mimicking the physiology of TAM recruitment. Firstly, monocytic cell line (U937) were converted into activated naive macrophages (M0) and pro-and anti-inflammatory (M1 and M2) subtypes. Monocytes, M0, M1, and M2 macrophages are characterized extensively. Secondly, the naive and polarized macrophages were subjected to chemokine-dependent recruitment into monotypic and heterotypic breast cancer spheroids. The nature of the recruitment is further investigated by assessing the profile of chemokines and chemokine receptors. Recruited macrophages are also observed to manipulate spheroid behavior in many ways. The recruited macrophages also exhibit an increased level of Siglec-1 (CD169), one of the potential TAM markers. The current platform’s potential for application can be extended to understand the recruitment process of other immune/stromal cells to solid tumors. It could be a potential addition to the arrays of in vitro platforms developed to screen the efficiency of cell-based immunotherapeutics in the future.">

        <tr id="Radiotherapy (RT) triggers an immune response that contributes to anti-tumor effects. Induction of interferon beta (IFN-β) is a key event in this immunogenicity of RT. We have previously shown that TRIM33, a chromatin reader, restrains IFN-β expression in Toll-like receptor-activated myeloid cells. Here, we explored whether deleting Trim33 in myeloid cells might improve the radio-induced immune response, and subsequent efficiency of RT. We first established that Trim33-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages showed increased expression of IFN-β in response to direct irradiation, or to treatment with irradiated cancer cells, further supporting our hypothesis. We then tested the efficiency of a single dose RT in three subcutaneous and one orthotopic tumor models. In all situations, myeloid deletion of Trim33 led to a significantly improved response after RT, leading to a complete and durable response in most of the treated mice bearing orthotopic oral tumors. This effect required the IFN-I pathway, and the presence of CD8+ T lymphocytes, but not NK cells. In addition, cured mice were capable of rejecting a secondary tumor challenge, demonstrating an in situ vaccination effect. We conclude that deleting Trim33 in myeloid cells improves RT efficiency, through a mechanism involving the IFN-I pathway and the immune response. Our work suggests that myeloid Trim33 is a host factor affecting the tumor response to RT, thus representing a new potential therapeutic target for modifying RT responses.">

        <tr id="T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by high rates of induction failure and relapse, and effective targeted immunotherapies are lacking. Despite promising clinical progress with genome-edited CD7-directed CAR-T cells, which present significant logistical and regulatory issues, CAR-T cell therapy in T-ALL remains challenging due to the shared antigen expression between malignant and healthy T cells. This can result in CAR-T cell fratricide, T cell aplasia, and the potential for blast contamination during CAR-T cell manufacturing. Recently, CAR-T cells have been described that target non-pan-T antigens, absent on healthy T cells but expressed on specific T-ALL subsets. These antigens include CD1a (NCT05679895), which is expressed in cortical T-ALL, and CCR9. We show that CCR9 is expressed on >70% of T-ALL patients (132/180) and is maintained at relapse, with a safe expression profile in healthy hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues. Further analyses showed that dual targeting of CCR9 and CD1a could benefit ∼86% of patients with T-ALL, with a greater blast coverage than single CAR-T cell treatments. We therefore developed, characterized, and preclinically validated a novel humanized CCR9-specific CAR with robust and specific antileukemic activity as a monotherapy in vitro and in vivo against cell lines, primary T-ALL samples, and patient-derived xenografts. Importantly, CCR9/CD1a dual-targeting CAR-T cells showed higher efficacy than single-targeting CAR-T cells, particularly in T-ALL cases with phenotypically heterogeneous leukemic populations. Dual CCR9/CD1a CAR-T therapy may prevent T cell aplasia and obviate the need for allogeneic transplantation and regulatory-challenging genome engineering approaches in T-ALL.">

        <tr id="Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be released by any cell and are crucial for cell-to-cell communications. EVs have been characterized in patients with solid and hematological tumors, where they play an important role in tumor progression and metastasis. EVs may express different surface proteins derived from the parental cells, including immunomodulatory molecules, such as HLA-G and PDL1.We isolated EV from bone marrow (BM) samples of patients with Neuroblastoma (NB) and healthy controls and we analyzed the expression of CD56, GD2 and immune checkpoints on EV by flow cytometry. Next, we analyzed the function of T cells in vitro in the presence or absence of NB patients' BM-derived EV, in terms of proliferation and cytokine production. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the expression of immune checkpoints on EV and the clinical outcome of patients.We found a higher expression of CD56 on EVs derived from BM of patients with NB than in those from healthy donors (HD). However, CD56 expression was not dependent on BM infiltration of NB cells. Moreover, the analysis of GD2 expression revealed that only a small fraction of EVs was released by infiltrating NB cells, whereas the majority may derive from BM-resident cells. BM-derived EVs from NB patients display a higher expression of HLA-G and PD-L1 than those derived from HD. Nonetheless, such EVs are able to modulate T cell immune responses. We measured a robust response, in vitro, towards a common bacterial antigen, including the release of GM-CSF and proinflammatory cytokines, like IFN-a and IL-6, from mononuclear cells. Some of these immunomodulatory features are dependent on the expression of HLA-G and PD-L1, whereas others may rely on other mechanism(s). Finally, a high expression of CD56, HLA-G and PD-L1 on BM-derived EVs may represent a good prognostic factor.We described the presence of HLA-G and PDL1-bearing EVs in the BM of NB patients, which may represent a mechanism performed by resident BM cells to counteract the inflammation occurring in the BM microenvironment of NB patients.">

 A major challenge in osteosarcoma (OS) immunotherapy is overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), to restore immune recognition and destruction of tumor cells. One of the key immune cell subsets known to contribute to the immunosuppressive TME are M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Our work aims to identify novel oncolytic virus (OV) combination immunotherapies to induce direct lysis of OS tumor cells, activate immune-mediated destruction of OS, and remodel the immunosuppressive TME. The direct lytic activity of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV; HSV1716) treatment was assessed using LIVE/DEAD flow cytometry and viral replication was measured using standard plaque assay. NK cell degranulation and killing assays were performed by co-culture of OS cell lines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) treated ± oHSV; NK cell degranulation and target cell death was assessed by flow cytometry. TAMs were generated in vitro by co-culture of PBMC with OS cell lines or primary bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for 7 days. Phagocytosis assays were performed by co-culture of TAMs with OS cells using fluorescent cell tracker stains and flow cytometry. Multicellular spheroids were generated by co-culture of firefly luciferase-expressing OS cell lines with CD14+ monocytes and bone marrow derived MSCs for 7 days in low adhesion plates, viability of tumor cells after treatment was assessed by addition of d-luciferin and quantification of luminescence. Treatment of four OS cell lines with oHSV for 72 hours resulted in <20% cell death by direct lysis. However, after treatment with oHSV-GFP, >95% of OS cells were GFP+ and viral titer increased up to 105-fold when compared to viral input. This highlighted high levels of infection and replication of oHSV within OS cell lines, despite limited oncolysis. Moreover, oHSV treatment of PBMC significantly enhanced the immune-mediated killing of OS cell lines, and this was NK cell dependent. Monolayer co-culture of PBMC with OS cell lines or MSC generated TAMs with significantly increased pro-tumor M2-like phenotype (CD14+CD206+CD163+), when compared with PBMC cultured alone, and TAMs suppressed NK cell degranulation against OS cell lines. Treatment of TAMS with oHSV encoding GM-CSF reduced the proportion of M2 TAMs. Moreover, treatment of OS target cells with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) and co-culture with in vitro generated TAMs significantly increased their phagocytic activity. Multicellular spheroids incorporating MSCs and CD14+ monocytes displayed a high degree of resistance against immune-mediated killing, when compared with OS cell line alone as monolayer or spheroid cultures. However, combination of OV with anti-EGFR mAb significantly increased immune-mediated killing against multicellular spheroids. oHSV combination strategies with mAb may be a promising treatment strategy against OS, to exert direct oncolysis, stimulate immune-mediated destruction, and remodel the immunosuppressive TME.

Although immunologists can demonstrate these phenomena in all fish, the responding cells remain elusive for lack of defining markers and tools to study them. Fundamentally, we posited that it is longevity that defines a memory cell like how antibody production defines a plasma cell. We infected the common carp with Sphaerospora molnari, a cnidarian parasite which causes seasonal outbreaks to which no vaccine is available. B cells proliferated and expressed gene signatures of differentiation. Despite a half-year gap between EdU labeling and sampling, B cells retained the thymidine analogue, suggesting that these are at least six-month-old resting memory cells stemming from proliferating precursors. Additionally, we identified a lymphoid organ-resident population expressing exceptional levels of IgM as plasma cells. Thus, teleost fish produce the lymphocytes key to vaccination success and long-term disease protection, and immunological memory is universal and universally demonstrable.">

In this study, we explore effects of radiation on CAF-derived immunoregulatory signals to the TME. Methods Primary CAF cultures were established from freshly collected human NSCLC lung tumors. CAFs were exposed to single-high or fractionated radiation regimens (1x18Gy or 3x6Gy), and the expression of different immunoregulatory cell-associated and secreted signaling molecules was analyzed 48h and 6 days after initiation of treatment. Analyses included quantitative measurements of released damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), interferon (IFN) type I responses, expression of immune regulatory receptors, and secretion of soluble cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. CAFs are able to survive ablative radiation regimens, however they enter into a stage of premature cell senescence. Results Our data show that CAFs avoid apoptosis and do not contribute by release of DAMPs or IFN-I secretion to radiation-mediated tumor immunoregulation. Furthermore, the secretion of relevant immunoregulatory cytokines and growth factors including TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IL-1β, VEGF, CXCL12, and CXCL10 remain comparable between non-irradiated and radiation-induced senescent CAFs. Importantly, radiation exposure modifies the cell surface expression of some key immunoregulatory receptors, including upregulation of CD73 and CD276. Discussion Our data suggest that CAFs do not participate in the release of danger signals or IFN-I secretion following radiotherapy. The immune phenotype of CAFs and radiation-induced senescent CAFs is similar, however, the observed elevation of some cell surface immunological receptors on irradiated CAFs could contribute to the establishment of an enhanced immunosuppressive TME after radiotherapy.">

        <tr id="Introductions Identifying patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are optimal candidates for immunotherapy is a cornerstone in clinical decision-making. The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is intricately linked with both the prognosis of the malignancy and the efficacy of immunotherapeutic interventions. CD8+ T cells, and more specifically, tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells [CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells] are postulated to be pivotal in orchestrating the immune system's assault on tumor cells. Nevertheless, the accurate quantification of immune cell infiltration—and by extension, the prediction of immunotherapeutic efficacy—remains a significant scientific frontier. Methods In this study, we introduce a cutting-edge non-invasive radiomic model, grounded in TIME markers (CD3+ T, CD8+ T, and CD8+ TRM cells), to infer the levels of immune cell infiltration in NSCLC patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors and ultimately predict their response to immunotherapy. Data from patients who had surgical resections (cohort 1) were employed to construct a radiomic model capable of predicting the TIME. This model was then applied to forecast the TIME for patients under immunotherapy (cohort 2). Conclusively, the study delved into the association between the predicted TIME from the radiomic model and the immunotherapeutic outcomes of the patients. Result For the immune cell infiltration radiomic prediction models in cohort 1, the AUC values achieved 0.765, 0.763, and 0.675 in the test set of CD3+ T, CD8+ T, and CD8+ TRM, respectively. While the AUC values for the TIME-immunotherapy predictive value were 0.651, 0.763, and 0.829 in the CD3-immunotherapy response model, CD8-immunotherapy response model, and CD8+ TRM-immunotherapy response model in cohort 2, respectively. The CD8+ TRM-immunotherapy model exhibited the highest predictive value and was significantly better than the CD3-immunotherapy model in predicting the immunotherapy response. The progression-free survival (PFS) analysis based on the predicted levels of CD3+ T, CD8+ T, and CD8+ TRM immune cell infiltration showed that the CD8+ T cell infiltration level was an independent factor (P=0.014, HR=0.218) with an AUC value of 0.938. Discussion Our empirical evidence reveals that patients with substantial CD8+ T cell infiltration experience a markedly improved PFS compared with those with minimal infiltration, asserting the status of the CD8+ T cell as an independent prognosticator of PFS in the context of immunotherapy. Although CD8+ TRM cells demonstrated the greatest predictive accuracy for immunotherapy response, their predictive strength for PFS was marginally surpassed by that of CD8+ T cells. These insights advocate for the application of the proposed non-invasive radiomic model, which utilizes TIME analysis, as a reliable predictor for immunotherapy outcomes and PFS in NSCLC patients.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has led to unprecedented success in treating relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The most common CAR-T cell products currently in the clinic for DLBCL differ in their co-stimulation moiety, containing either CD28 or 4-1BB, which initiate distinct signalling pathways. Previous work has highlighted the importance of T cell metabolism in fuelling anti-cancer function. We have studied the metabolic characteristics induced by CD28 versus 4-1BB co-stimulation in patient CAR-T cells ex vivo. Our data show that in patients, CD28 and 4-1BB drive significantly divergent metabolic profiles. CD28 signalling endows T cells with a preferentially glycolytic metabolism supporting an effector phenotype and increased expansion capacity, while 4-1BB co-stimulation preserves mitochondrial fitness and results in memory-like differentiation. Despite this divergent programming, T cells in patients responding successfully to therapy were metabolically similar, irrespective of co-stimulator, suggesting that efficient fuelling of CAR-T cells in lymphoma requires a ‘balanced’ metabolism. In contrast, CAR-T cells in non-responders were pushed to their metabolic extremes. One sentence summary CD28 and 4-1BB signalling drive divergent metabolic profiles in patient CAR-T cells, however patients that respond to therapy have CAR-T cells that maintain metabolic balance.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are recognized as the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and act as intermediaries between the innate and adaptive immune systems. The maturation and function of DCs are significantly influenced by autophagy. Hence, the current research evaluated the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an autophagy inhibitor, on the maturation and activation of monocyte-derived DCs. Monocytes were cultured and induced to differentiate into monocyte-derived DCs by the addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) cytokines. After five days, the immature DCs were exposed to HCQ and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), followed by a 24-hour incubation period. On the sixth day, the flow cytometry technique was employed to assess the impact of HCQ on the phenotypic characteristics of the DCs. Finally, the expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes in the HCQ-treated and untreated DCs groups was examined using the real-time PCR method.  DCs that were subjected to treatment with HCQ exhibited a notable augmentation in the expression of CD11c, CD86, and HLA-DR, which are markers associated with maturation and antigen presentation. Furthermore, the DCs treated with HCQ demonstrated a significant reduction in the expression of IL-10, TGF-β, and IDO genes, while displaying an increase in the expression of TNF-α and IL-12 when compared to the control group. These findings indicate that targeting autophagy can induce a shift in DCs towards an immunogenic state. However, further investigations are necessary to assess the impact of HCQ-treated DCs on T cell responses both in vitro and in vivo in tumor-bearing animal models.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a critical role in resistance to immunotherapy. In this study, we identified epidermal growth factor-like 6 (Egfl6) as a new regulator of myeloid cell functions. Our analyses indicated that Egfl6, via binding with β3 integrins and activation of p38 and SYK signaling, acts as a chemotactic factor for myeloid cells migration and promotes their differentiation towards an immunosuppressive state. In syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer (OvCa), tumor expression of Egfl6 increased the intra-tumoral accumulation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) MDSCs and TAMs and their expression of immunosuppressive factors, including CXCL2, IL-10 and PD-L1. Consistent with this, in an immune 'hot' tumor model, Egfl6 expression eliminated response to a-PD-L1 therapy, while Egfl6 neutralizing antibody decreased the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD206+ TAMs and PMN-MDSCs and restored the efficacy of a-PD-L1 therapy. Supporting a role in human tumors, in human OvCa tissue samples, areas of high EGFL6 expression co-localized with myeloid cell infiltration. scRNAseq analyses revealed a correlation between EGFL6 and immune cell expression of immunosuppressive factors. Our data provide mechanistic insights into the onco-immunologic functions of EGFL6 in mediating tumor immune suppression and identified EGFL6 as a potential novel therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy in OvCa patients.">

        <tr id="Severe infections such as malaria are on the rise worldwide, driven by both climate change and increasing drug-resistance. It is therefore paramount that we better understand how the host’s organism responds to severe infection. Hematopoiesis is particularly of interest in this context because hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain the turnover of all blood cells, including all immune cells. Severe infections have been widely acknowledged to affecting HSPCs, however this disruption has been mainly studied during the acute phase, and the process and level of HSPC recovery remains understudied. Using a self-resolving model of natural rodent malaria, infection by Plasmodium chabaudi, here we systematically assess HSPCs’ acute response and recovery upon pathogen clearance. We demonstrate that during the acute phase of infection the most quiescent and functional stem cells are depleted, multipotent progenitor compartments are drastically enlarged, and oligopotent progenitors virtually disappear, underpinned by dramatic, population-specific and sometimes unexpected changes in proliferation rates. HSPC populations return to homeostatic size and proliferation rate again through specific patterns of recovery. Overall, our data demonstrate that HSPC populations adopt different responses to cope with severe infection and suggest that the ability to adjust proliferative capacity becomes more restricted as differentiation progresses.">

        <tr id="Cardiovascular events seem to occur more frequently after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This suggests a possible role of immune checkpoints in accelerating atherosclerosis formation. We therefore aimed to assess the expression of soluble and membrane-bound immune checkpoints in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). We assessed the levels of 14 soluble immune checkpoints in fasting blood plasma of PAD patients (intermittent claudication, n= 37) and healthy controls (HCs, n=39) by Multiplex protein assay. We measured the levels of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 and 2 (PD-L1/2), B-and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), glucocorticoid-induced TNRF-related protein (GITR), herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), CD28, CD27, CD80, CD137 and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3). The surface expression of CD28, PD-L2, PD-1, GITR, LAG-3, TIM-3 and BTLA on peripheral blood immune cells was determined by flow cytometry. Cytokine production capacity was measured by flow cytometry in TIM-3+ T cells to determine immune exhaustion. Soluble levels of PD-L2 were decreased in PAD patients, but only in females, whereas soluble levels of TIM-3 showed a trend towards increased concentration in female PAD patients. All monocyte subsets had increased frequencies of PD-L2+ cells in PAD patients. CD4+ T cells had increased frequencies of TIM-3+ cells, which showed little overlap with other immune exhaustion markers. TIM-3+ CD4+ T cells appeared to have a low capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, but a higher capacity to produce IL-10 compared to TIM-3-CD4+ T cells. We found that PAD patients show differences in expression of both membrane-bound and soluble immune checkpoints. Some of these differences might be caused by prolonged immune activation, although immune exhaustion markers did not always overlap.">

        <tr id="Tumors often evolve to engage numerous strategies to circumvent detection by the immune system. Our group recently discovered elevated neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (nsGSL) surface levels as a possible immune evasion mechanism of tumors. We demonstrated a direct disruption of both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity in vitro when expression of nsGSLs was upregulated on established target cells. It remains unclear however, whether in vivo nsGSLs play an active role in tumor development and can aid tumors in evading immune responses. To investigate whether nsGSLs facilitate tumor progression in vivo, we first established a murine model system using MC38-OVA cell lines with varying cell surface levels of nsGSLs. In vitro analysis revealed reduced MHC-I accessibility on tumor cells with elevated nsGSLs profiles, leading to diminished activation of OVA-specific OT-I T cells as evidenced by decreased expression of CD25, CD69, and production of IFNγ, which subsequently resulted in decreased tumor cell death. Subsequent in vivo experiments investigating tumor outgrowth after engraftment of subcutaneously injected MC38-OVA cell lines with low or high cell surface levels of nsGSLs demonstrated better growth of nsGSL-rich tumor cells compared to nsGSL-poor tumors which could be controlled. Together these results suggest that nsGSLs expressed by tumors can facilitate immune evasion and subsequent tumor progression. These data pave the way to explore whether targeting of the GSL pathway with specific inhibitors could be advantageous as a therapy against tumors with high nsGSL levels.">

By influencing the expression of immune checkpoint-associated proteins, the UPS modulates T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses and can potentially facilitate the immune escape of tumor cells. Additionally, the UPS contributes to the remodeling of the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment (TIME) by regulating B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and Treg cells. Targeting the UPS in conjunction with immune checkpoint-associated proteins, and combining these with other therapeutic approaches, may significantly enhance the efficacy of combination therapies and pave the way for novel cancer treatment strategies. In this review, we first summarize the composition and alterations of the TIME, with a particular emphasis on the role of the UPS in TIME and its interactions with various immune cell types.

        <tr id="T cell surveillance of tissues is spatially organized: circulating memory T cells perform surveillance of secondary lymphoid organs while tissue-resident memory T cells act as sentinels in barrier tissues. In the context of infection, tissue-resident memory T cells survive long term in barrier tissues and are poised to respond to re-encounter of infectious agents. The activity of such tissue-resident T cells is regulated by the PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitory receptors targeted by cancer immunotherapies. This review investigates the hypothesis that T cells with a tissue residency program play an important role in both protective anti-tumor immunity and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). A series of translational studies have demonstrated that a higher density of tissue-resident T cells within tumors is associated with favorable survival outcomes in a diverse range of cancer types. Tissue-resident T cells have also been implicated in clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade, and dynamic tracking of T cell populations in pre- and on-treatment tumor samples demonstrated that T cells with a tissue residency program responded early to ICB. Investigation of colitis and dermatitis as examples of irAEs demonstrated that tissue-resident memory T cells were reactivated at these epithelial sites, resulting in a highly cytotoxic state and secretion of inflammatory cytokines IFNγ and TNFα. It will therefore be important to consider how a tissue residency program can be enhanced to promote T cell-mediated tumor immunity while preventing the development of irAEs.">

        <tr id="Hypoxia occurs in settings where stringent control of inflammation is mandatory to avoid tissue damage. Here, we analyzed how hypoxia-induced mediators alter recognition of pathogen-derived molecular patterns (PAMPs). The most relevant finding was that hypoxia selectively targets IFN-α induced upon stimulation with nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLR7/8 and -9) in PBMC. Notably, IFN-α secretion was reduced, but IFN-α producing capacity preserved. Corroborating these findings IFN-dependent cytokines IP-10 and IL-12 p70 were reduced under hypoxia, while other cytokines such as TNF remained unaffected. A role for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) was confirmed with prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitors CoCl2 and DMOG. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) were identified as the major source of IFN-α and experiments in B cell/PDC and monocyte/PDC cocultures indicated that T cells are not required and both lymphoid and myeloid cells equally support inhibition of IFN-α. Moreover, supernatants from unstimulated PBMC generated under hypoxic conditions were not suppressive but further experiments indicated that hypoxia-specific release of IFN-α regulators lactate and TGF-β can contribute to the IFN-α blockage and might synergize with PGE2. However, each one of these factors alone is insufficient to block IFN-α secretion. These findings suggest that control of the PDC response occurs via combined soluble factors and cell contact-dependent mechanisms, thereby enabling a fine-tuning of the anti-microbial immune response in hypoxia.">

        <tr id="Dormant cancer stem cells (DCSCs) exhibit characteristics of chemotherapy resistance and immune escape, and they are a crucial source of tumor recurrence and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. We demonstrate that enriched Gzmk+ CD8+ T cells within the niche of esophageal DCSCs restrict the outgrowth of tumor mass. Nonetheless, DCSCs can escape immune elimination by enhancing PD-L1 signaling, thereby maintaining immune equilibrium. Quiescent fibroblast-derived quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) promotes the expression of PD-L1 and its own expression in DCSCs by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, high QSOX1 in the dormant tumor niche contributes to the exclusion of CD8+ T cells. Conversely, blocking QSOX1 with Ebselen in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy can effectively eradicate residual DCSCs by reducing PD-L1 expression and promoting CD8+ T cell infiltration. Clinically, high expression of QSOX1 predicts a poor response to anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with esophageal cancer. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism whereby QSOX1 promotes PD-L1 upregulation and T cell exclusion, facilitating the immune escape of DCSCs, and QSOX1 inhibition, combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, represents a promising therapeutic approach for eliminating DCSCs and preventing recurrence.">

        <tr id="Juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP) is caused by persistent infection of epithelial cells by low-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11. While multiple infiltrated immune cells have been reported to mediate disease progress, knowledge of HPV-reactive T-cell subsets in papillomas remains elusive. Through single-cell RNA sequencing and RNA microarray, we found that CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ TRM) cells with strong interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production expanded, and were negatively correlated to the disease severity in the frequency of surgery. These IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells were readily activated and expanded in vitro by autologous dendritic cells loaded with HPV11 E7 peptide pool. Moreover, T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion was observed in JORRP papilloma tissues, indicating a biased TCR repertoire toward HPV-specific recognition. Finally, we identified and characterized HPV11 E7-specific candidate TCR clonotypes from IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells, suggesting their potential application in TCR-engineered T cells (TCR-T) therapy for HPV11-related diseases. Our findings provided insights into the specific local immune response to HPV6/11 infection and highlighted the importance of IFN-γ+ CD8+ TRM cells in anti-HPV6/11 T-cell immunity.IMPORTANCEThe persistent recurrence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 6/11 infection in papillomas underscores the failure of local immune responses in patients with juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP). Our previous study demonstrated that T cells constitute the predominant immune cell population in JORRP papilloma tissues. Understanding the T-cell-mediated immune responses within JORRP papilloma tissues is crucial for disease control. In the present study, we characterized CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ TRM) cells as the primary T-cell subset responsible for local anti-HPV6/11 immunity. Moreover, we identified two HPV11 E7-specific candidate T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes out of IFN-γ+ CD8+ memory T cells. Overall, our findings provided insights into the local immune responses to HPV6/11 infection and offered information for developing more effective immunotherapeutic strategies against JORRP.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells that play a crucial role in initiating immune responses by cross-presenting relevant antigens to initial T cells. The activation of DCs is a crucial step in inducing anti-tumor immunity. Upon recognition and uptake of tumor antigens, activated DCs present these antigens to naive T cells, thereby stimulating T cell-mediated immune responses and enhancing their ability to attack tumors. It is particularly noted that DCs are able to cross-present foreign antigens to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, prompting CD8+ T cells to proliferate and differentiate into cytotoxic T cells. In the malignant progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the inactivation of DCs plays an important role, and the activation of DCs is particularly important in anti-HCC immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of DCs activation in HCC, the involved regulatory factors and strategies to activate DCs in HCC immunotherapy. It provides a basis for the study of HCC immunotherapy through DCs activation.">

        <tr id="Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) arising from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are prominent in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). We have previously shown that CAF formation is triggered by exposure to reactive oxygen species-inducing chemotherapy and that CAF support chemoresistance by donating mitochondria to the cancer cells, through tunnelling nanotubes. In the present study, we show that exposure of MSC to ALL cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and primary cells or their conditioned media can also trigger CAF formation. Using bulk RNA sequencing in cell lines, we show that the MSC to CAF transition is accompanied by a robust interferon pathway response and we have validated this finding in primary cells. Using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we identify the take-up of leukaemia cell-derived mitochondrial dsRNA by MSC as a proximate trigger for the MSC to CAF transition. We show that inhibition of dsRNA formation in ALL cells by treatment with low-dose ethidium or the mitochondrial transcription inhibitor IMT1 or degradation of dsRNA in conditioned media by 100°C exposure ablates the ability of the ALL conditioned media to stimulate MSC to CAF transition. Our data reveal a novel and previously undescribed mechanism by which cancer cells induce a CAF phenotype in stromal cells, showing how B-ALL cells can directly induce the previously described niche-mediated protection within the bone marrow.">

Recent advances in proteomics have deepened our understanding of treatment mechanisms and revealed promising biomarkers for predicting therapeutic outcomes. This study focuses on the identification of a protein profile of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from neurons, oligodendrocytes, and B and T cells able to differentiate treatment responders and non-responders in 80 patients with MS. In the patients who responded to treatment, T cell-derived EVs were enriched in LV151, a protein involved in the promotion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, whereas Bcell-derived EVs showed elevated PSMD6 and PTPRC, related to immunoproteasome function. Oligodendrocyte- and neuron-derived EVs showed upregulated CO6A1 and COEA1, involved in extracellular matrix reorganisation, as well as LAMA5, NonO, SPNT, and NCAM, which are critical for brain repair. In contrast, non-responders showed higher levels of PSMD7 and PRS10 from B cell-derived EVs, associated with DNA damage, and increased levels of PERM and PERL from T cell-derived EVs, linked to nuclear factor kappa B activation and drug-resistant proteins such as HS90A and RASK. These findings highlight a distinct panel of proteins in EVs that could serve as an early indicator of treatment efficacy in MS.">

        <tr id="T-cell-mediated therapeutic strategies are the most potent effectors of cancer immunotherapy. However, an essential barrier to this therapy in solid tumors is disrupting the anti-cancer immune response, cancer-immunity cycle, T-cell priming, trafficking and T-cell cytotoxic capacity. Thus, reinforcing the anti-cancer immune response is needed to improve the effectiveness of T-cell-mediated therapy. Tumor-associated protease ADAM10, endothelial cells (ECs) and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells engage in complex communication via adhesion, transmigration and chemotactic mechanisms to facilitate an anti-cancer immune response. The precise impact of ADAM10 on the intricate mechanisms underlying these interactions remains unclear. This paper broadly explores how ADAM10, through different routes, influences the efficacy of T-cell-mediated therapy. ADAM10 cleaves CD8+ T-cell-targeting genes and impacts their expression and specificity. In addition, ADAM10 mediates the interactions of adhesion molecules with T cells and influences CD8+ T-cell activity and trafficking. Thus, understanding the role of ADAM10 in these events may lead to innovative strategies for advancing T-cell-mediated therapies.">

        <tr id="Abstract The ability of the skin to “remember” has been a potential mechanism for studying recurrent skin diseases. While it has been thought that the ability to retain past encounters is the prerogative of immune cells, it has recently been discovered that skin tissue stem cells can also take on this task. Epithelial stem cells undergoing inflammation retain their “memory” through epigenetic reprogramming and exhibit rapid epithelialization and epidermal proliferation upon secondary stimulation. This is a non-specific memory modality independent of conventional immune memory, in which histone modifications (acetylation and methylation) and specific transcription factors (AP-1 and STAT3) are involved in the establishment of inflammatory memories, and AIM2/Caspase-1/IL-1β mainly performs the rapid effects of memory. This finding is intriguing for addressing recurrent inflammatory skin diseases, which may explain the fixed-site recurrence of inflammatory skin diseases and develop new therapeutic strategies in the future. However, more research is still needed to decipher the mysteries of memory.">

Macrophages are key players in the immune system, are indispensable for intestinal health, and contribute to immune defense and repair mechanisms. Understanding the multifaceted roles of macrophages can provide critical insights into maintaining and restoring gastrointestinal (GI) health. This review explores the essential role of macrophages in maintaining the gut barrier function and their contribution to post-inflammatory and post-infectious responses in the gut. Macrophages significantly contribute to gut barrier integrity through epithelial repair, immune modulation, and interactions with gut microbiota. They demonstrate active plasticity by switching phenotypes to resolve inflammation, facilitate tissue repair, and regulate microbial populations following an infection or inflammation. In addition, tissue-resident (M2) and infiltration (M1) macrophages convert to each other in gut problems such as IBS and IBD via major signaling pathways mediated by NF-κB, JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, Toll-like receptors, and specific microRNAs such as miR-155, miR-29, miR-146a, and miR-199, which may be good targets for new therapeutic approaches. Future research should focus on elucidating the detailed molecular mechanisms and developing personalized therapeutic approaches to fully harness the potential of macrophages to maintain and restore intestinal permeability and gut health.">

        <tr id="The use of antitumor drugs represents a reliable strategy for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, drug resistance has become increasingly common and contributes to tumor metastasis and local recurrence. The tumor immune microenvironment (TME) consists of immune cells, cytokines and immunomodulators, and collectively they influence the response to treatment. Epigenetic changes including DNA methylation and histone modification, as well as increased drug exportation have been reported to contribute to the development of drug resistance in cancers. In the past few years, the majority of studies on tumors have only focused on the development and progression of a tumor from a mechanistic standpoint; few studies have examined whether the changes in the TME can also affect tumor growth and drug resistance. Recently, emerging evidence have raised more concerns regarding the role of TME in the development of drug resistance. In the present review, it was discussed how the suppressive TME adapts to drug resistance characterized by the cooperation of immune cells, cytokines, immunomodulators, stromal cells and extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it was reviewed how these immunological or metabolic changes alter immuno-surveillance and thus facilitate tumor drug resistance. In addition, potential targets present in the TME for developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve individualized therapy for cancer treatment were revealed.">

        <tr id="Since their conception with the smallpox vaccine, vaccines used worldwide have mitigated multiple pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Insightful studies have uncovered the complexities of different functional networks of CD4 T cells (T helper 1 (Th1); Th2, Th17) and CD8 T cells (T cytotoxic; Tc), as well as B cell (BIgM, BIgG, BIgA and BIgE) subsets, during the response to vaccination. Both T and B cell subsets form central, peripheral, and tissue-resident subsets during vaccination. It has also become apparent that each vaccination forms a network of T regulatory subsets, namely CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells and interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing CD4+ Foxp3− T regulatory 1 (Tr1), as well as many others, which shape the quality/quantity of vaccine-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody production. These components are especially critical for immunocompromised patients, such as older individuals and allograft recipients, as their vaccination may be ineffective or less effective. This review focuses on considering how the pre- and post-vaccination Treg/Tr1 levels influence the vaccination efficacy. Experimental and clinical work has revealed that Treg/Tr1 involvement evokes different immune mechanisms in diminishing vaccine-induced cellular/humoral responses. Alternative steps may be considered to improve the vaccination response, such as increasing the dose, changing the delivery route, and/or repeated booster doses of vaccines. Vaccination may be combined with anti-CD25 (IL-2Rα chain) or anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to decrease the Tregs and boost the T/B cell immune response. All of these data and strategies for immunizations are presented and discussed, aiming to improve the efficacy of vaccination in humans and especially in immunocompromised and older individuals, as well as organ transplant patients.">

        <tr id="A key mediator of T cell impairment during respiratory virus infection is the inhibitory receptor PD-1. PD-1 is induced on T cells following antigen exposure, whereas proinflammatory cytokines upregulate the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Respiratory virus infection leads to upregulation of PD-L1 on airway epithelial cells, dendritic cells, and alveolar macrophages. However, the role of PD-L1 on different cell types in acute respiratory virus infections is not known. We sought to determine the role of PD-L1 on different cell types in CD8+ T cell impairment. We found that PD-L1-/- mice challenged with human metapneumovirus or influenza showed a similar level of CD8+ T cell impairment compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Moreover, virus clearance was delayed in PD-L1-/- mice compared to WT. CD8+ T cells from PD-L1-deficient mice expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors both at baseline and after respiratory virus infection. The antibody blockade of PD-L2 failed to restore function to the impaired cells. While reciprocal bone marrow chimeras between WT and PD-L1-/- mice did not restore CD8+ T cell function after the respiratory virus challenge, mice that received the PD-L1-/- bone marrow had higher inhibitory receptor expression on CD8+ cells. This discrepancy in the inhibitory receptor expression suggests that cells of the hematopoietic compartment contribute to T cell impairment on CD8+ T cells.IMPORTANCEThe phenomenon of pulmonary CD8+ T cell impairment with diminished antiviral function occurs during acute respiratory virus infection mediated by Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) signaling. Moreover, PD-1 blockade enhances T cell function to hasten viral clearance. The ligand PD-L1 is expressed in many cell types, but which cells drive lung T cell impairment is not known. We used genetic approaches to determine the contribution of PD-L1 on lung T cell impairment. We found that PD-L2 cannot compensate for the loss of PD-L1, and PD-L1-deficient mice exhibit increased expression of other inhibitory receptors. Bone marrow chimeras between PD-L1-deficient and wild-type mice indicated that hematopoietic PD-L1 expression is associated with inhibitory receptor upregulation and impairment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Tumour cell senescence can be induced by various factors, including DNA damage, inflammatory signals, genetic toxins, ionising radiation and nutrient metabolism. The senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP), secreted by senescent tumour cells, possesses the capacity to modulate various immune cells, including macrophages, T cells, natural killer cells and myeloid‐derived suppressor cells, as well as vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts within the tumour microenvironment (TME), and this modulation can result in either the promotion or suppression of tumorigenesis and progression. Exploring the impact of SASP on the TME could identify potential therapeutic targets, yet limited studies have dissected its functions. In this review, we delve into the causes and mechanisms of tumour cell senescence. We then concentrate on the influence of SASP on the tumour immune microenvironment, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix and the reprogramming of cancer stem cells, along with their associated tumour outcomes. Last, we present a comprehensive overview of the diverse array of senotherapeutics, highlighting their prospective advantages and challenge for the treatment of cancer patients. Key points Senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) secretion from senescent tumour cells significantly impacts cancer progression and biology. SASP is involved in regulating the remodelling of the tumour microenvironment, including immune microenvironment, vascular, extracellular matrix and cancer stem cells. Senotherapeutics, such as senolytic, senomorphic, nanotherapy and senolytic vaccines, hold promise for enhancing cancer treatment efficacy.">

        <tr id="We demonstrate the role of signaling via the glucocorticoid receptor, NR3C1, in differentiation of CD8+ T cell memory. Pharmacological inhibition as well as the short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor hindered memory transition and limited the homeostatic turnover of the activated CD8+ T cells. Dexamethasone exposure of CD8+ T cells expanded during a resolving infection with influenza A virus or a γ-herpesvirus promoted conversion of effector cells into memory cells by modulating cellular metabolism and lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Reduced reactive oxygen species levels in the responding effector cells upregulated Bcl2 and enhanced survival. The generated virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells were efficiently recalled following challenge of animals with a secondary infection to control it better. The memory-enhancing effect was predominantly evident at low doses of dexamethasone. Therefore, controlled glucocorticoid signaling within the effector CD8+ T cells is crucial for optimal memory differentiation.">

        <tr id="The onset of malaria causes the induction of various inflammatory markers in the host’s body, which in turn affect the body’s homeostasis and create several cerebral complications. Polarization of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) from the classically activated M1 to alternatively activated M2 phenotype increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules. Treatment with recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) not only alters this MDSC’s polarization but also targets the glycolysis pathway of the metabolism in MDSCs, rendering them less immunosuppressive. Along with that, the Helper T-cells subset 17 (Th17)/T regulatory cells (Tregs) ratio is skewed towards Th17, which increases inflammation by producing more IL-17. However, treating with rIL-33 also helps to restore this ratio, which brings back homeostasis. During malaria infection, there is an upregulation of IL-12 production from dendritic cells along with a distorted myeloid dendritic cells (mDC)/plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) ratio towards mDCs promoting inflammation. Administering rIL-33 will also subvert this IL-12 production and increase the population of pDC in the host’s immune system during malaria infection, thus restoring mDC/pDC to homeostasis. Therefore, treatment with rIL-33 to reduce the pro-inflammatory signatures and maintenance of immune homeostasis along with the increase in survivability could be a potential therapeutic approach for cerebral malaria.">

 Immunotherapy has had very limited success in pancreatic cancer, due to its low mutational burden and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Our approach consists in redirecting pre- existing antiviral immunity against pancreatic tumors by delivering viral antigens using the tumor penetrating peptide iRGD .This peptide, targets the tumor vasculature through av integrins and neuropilin-1, delivering conjugated or co-administered cargo to tumors. Here we used mouse cytomegalovirus (CMV) as an infection model. CMV is a β-herpesvirus that induces a strong T-cell response in mice and humans, comprising >10% of all circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells mostly with effector-memory phenotype. Importantly, human CMV infects over 60% of the world’s population rendering it a suitable candidate for translation. Methods: Mice latently infected with CMV were orthotopically implanted with KPC pancreatic tumor cells and treated with systemic injections of vehicle or iRGD plus CMV class I and II binding peptides. Another cohort of age matched uninfected mice was used as a control. Tumor growth and mouse weight were monitored twice a week and CMV specific immune responses were measured in spleen, liver and tumor by flow cytometry, using tetramer staining and CMV specific peptide recall. Results: CMV infected mice receiving iRGD+CMV peptides responded to treatment as evidenced by delayed tumor growth associated with increased tumor necrosis and T cell infiltration. In addition, flow cytometry analysis of tumor, liver and spleen showed a significant increase in CMV specific T cells preferentially in the tumor. Surprisingly, these T cells preferentially infiltrated tumors regardless of the use of iRGD for tumor targeting of CMV peptides. Survival studies showed a marked increase in median survival, reaching 42 days in the infected and treated group, compared to 25 days in the vehicle treated one. The survival benefit was very similar in the presence or absence of iRGD. Combining this strategy with anti- PD1 and or anti-IL10R did not significantly improve the benefits of CMV therapy alone. On the other hand, combination with low dose gemcitabine (5mg/kg) significantly improved tumor growth delay and survival in the combination compared to either therapy alone. The median survival reached 49 days in the combination, compared to 39 for gemcitabine or CMV therapy alone and 32 for vehicle.Conclusions: We have recently performed single cell RNA sequencing in tumors from infected and CMV peptide or vehicle treated mice and will analyze the transcriptional profile and TCR sequence of the tumor infiltrating T cells. Preliminary analysis of this data shows a massive T cell infiltration and an increase in dendritic cells and macrophages in infected and treated mice. Taken together, this data shows we can deliver antigens to pancreatic tumors and elicit an anti-tumor immune response that results in delayed tumor growth and has a survival benefit. This is a mutation agnostic approach with high translational value, since more than 60% of the population has previous CMV immunity.

        <tr id="The field of immunology has traditionally focused on immune checkpoint modulation of adaptive immune cells. However, many malignancies such as glioblastoma are mostly devoid of T cells and rather are enriched with immunosuppressive myeloid cells of the innate immune system. While some immune checkpoint targets are shared between adaptive and innate immunity, myeloid-specific checkpoints could also serve as potential therapeutics. To better understand the impact of immune checkpoint blockade on myeloid cells, we systematically summarize the current literature focusing on the direct immunological effects of PD-L1/PD-1, CD24/Siglec-10, collagen/LAIR-1, CX3CL1/CX3CR1, and CXCL10/CXCR3. By synthesizing the molecular mechanisms and the translational implications, we aim to prioritize agents in this category of therapeutics for glioblastoma.">

        <tr id="CD8+ T cells play a critical role in cancer immune-surveillance and pathogen elimination. However, their effector function can be severely impaired by inhibitory receptors such as programmed death-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (Tim-3). Here Siglec-G is identified as a coinhibitory receptor that limits CD8+ T cell function. Siglec-G is highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating T cells and is enriched in the exhausted T cell subset. Ablation of Siglec-G enhances the efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in suppressing solid tumors growth. Mechanistically, sialoglycan ligands, such as CD24 on tumor cells, activate the Siglec-G-SHP2 axis in CD8+ T cells, impairing metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which dampens cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation, expansion, and cytotoxicity. These findings discover a critical role for Siglec-G in inhibiting CD8+ T cell responses, suggesting its potential therapeutic effect in adoptive T cell therapy and tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Macrophages have crucial roles in immune responses and tumor progression, exhibiting diverse phenotypes based on environmental cues. In the present study, the impact of cinobufagin (CB) on macrophage polarization and the consequences on tumor-associated behaviors were investigated. Morphological transformations of THP-1 cells into M0, M1 and M2 macrophages were observed, including distinct changes in the size, shape and adherence properties of these cells. CB treatment inhibited the viability of A549 and LLC cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 28.8 and 30.12 ng/ml, respectively. CB at concentrations of <30 ng/ml had no impact on the viability of M0 macrophages and lung epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells. CB influenced the expression of macrophage surface markers, reducing CD206 positivity in M2 macrophages without affecting CD86 expression in M1 macrophages. CB also altered certain expression profiles at the mRNA level, notably downregulating macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) expression in M2 macrophages and upregulating tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β in both M0 and M1 macrophages. Furthermore, ELISA analyses revealed that CB increased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in M1 macrophages and reduced the levels of anti-inflammatory factors in M2 macrophages. CB treatment also attenuated the migration and invasion capacities of A549 and LLC cells stimulated by M2 macrophage-conditioned medium. Additionally, CB modulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and MARCO expression in M2 macrophages and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 cells, which was partially reversed by rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist. Finally, CB and cisplatin treatments hindered tumor growth in vivo, with distinct impacts on animal body weight and macrophage marker expression in tumor tissues. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that CB exerted complex regulatory effects on macrophage polarization and tumor progression, suggesting its potential as a modulator of the tumor microenvironment and a therapeutic for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="T cells are key contributors to clear our body from infected and malignant cells. When T cells respond to target cells, they undergo profound translational alterations. The evolutionary and highly conserved kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central mediator of T cell differentiation, homeostasis, and T cell activation, including the production of the key pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL2, and IFNγ. mTOR was shown to execute its translation activity through TOP motifs located in the 5’ Untranslated region (5’UTR) of its target genes. Here, we uncovered a distinct mechanism of mTOR signaling on cytokine production in T cells, which is under control of the 3’UTR. Even though non-classical TOP motifs are present in cytokine 3’UTRs, they do not contribute to mTOR-mediated translation regulation. Rather, AU-rich elements (AREs) are required for mTOR-mediated cytokine production. Furthermore, we discovered that the RNA binding protein DDX21 binds to 3’UTR AREs and confers the mTOR-mediated translation control. In conclusion, we here present a previously unappreciated ARE-dependent, 3’UTR-mediated mode of action that mTOR employs to regulate cytokine production.">

Due to the duality of macrophage effects on tumors, TAMs have been a hot topic in tumor research. In this paper, the heterogeneity and plasticity of TAMs, the interactions between TAMs and other immune cells, and the effects of TAMs on tumors are reviewed, and the therapeutic strategies for TAMs are summarized and discussed.

 Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, only 20-40% of all patients respond to immunotherapy. Further, efficacy varies highly by tumor type. Tumors with high infiltration of canonically anti-tumoral immune cells, such as lung cancers, also tend to display increased sensitivity to treatment. In contrast, those with higher infiltration of pro-tumoral immune cells, such as pancreatic cancers, are much less amenable to immunotherapy. These differences in immune infiltration have been linked to differential transcriptional regulation of immune cell recruiting factors, suggesting that perhaps tumors can intrinsically assemble different immune microenvironments in a tissue-of-origin dependent manner. Thus, it is necessary to better understand the factors that lead to heterogeneity of immune cell infiltration, how these mechanisms differ across tumor types, and how they may be perturbed to improve therapy responses. Here, we utilized two panels of clonal cell lines both driven by Kras-G12D and Tp53-R172H mutations but derived from two different tissues of origin: the lung and pancreas. These panels serve to recapitulate the immune heterogeneity of non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, respectively, while controlling for genetic drivers that may influence immune infiltration. Analyses of subcutaneously implanted lung and pancreatic-origin tumors revealed that the overall abundance of immunosuppressive granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) is significantly higher in pancreatic-origin tumors while the infiltration of dendritic cells is much lower as compared to that of lung-origin tumors, despite controlling for engraftment site. Likewise, lung, but not pancreatic-origin tumors exhibit more rapid tumor growth upon natural killer (NK) cell depletion, suggesting a lung-origin specific role of NK cells in controlling tumor burden. There were also similarities in immune archetype, with T-cell abundance negatively correlating with that of gMDSCs. However, whereas “T-cell inflamed” pancreatic tumors partially respond to immune checkpoint blockade, their lung-origin counterparts do not. We hypothesized that these differences in immune phenotype and subsequent therapy response may be due in part to somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). We performed sparse whole genome sequencing and identified substantial genomic rearrangements in both lung and pancreatic-origin tumors. Notably, the specific regions of rearrangements differed highly between the two panels, with lung-origin clones showing more amplifications in chromosomes 2 and 11 and deletions in chromosomes 16 and 18. These results suggest that there are indeed tissue-of-origin specific differences in immune phenotype that can influence therapy outcome. Ongoing work seeks to further elucidate specific tumor cell-intrinsic factors that can be leveraged to skew the tumor immune microenvironment towards a more anti-tumoral phenotype and ultimately increase sensitivity to immunotherapy in a site-specific manner.

        <tr id="The cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNγ) plays a multifaceted role in intestinal immune responses ranging from anti- to pro-inflammatory depending on the setting. Here, using a 3D co-culture system based on human intestinal epithelial organoids, we explore the capacity of IFNγ-exposure to reprogram intestinal epithelia and thereby directly modulate lymphocyte responses. IFNγ treatment of organoids led to transcriptional reprogramming, marked by a switch to a pro-inflammatory gene expression profile, including transcriptional upregulation of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Proteomic analysis of organoid-conditioned medium post-treatment confirmed chemokine secretion. IFNγ-treatment of organoids led to enhanced T cell migration in a CXCL11-dependent manner without affecting T cell activation status. Taken together, our results suggest a specific role for CXCL11 in T cell recruitment that could be targeted to prevent T cell trafficking to the inflamed intestine.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor. Although serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) family members play crucial roles in tumors, their impact on tumor immunology remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of SRSF10 in HCC immunotherapy.


METHODS
To identify the key genes associated with immunotherapy resistance, we conducted single-nuclear RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence, and The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus database analyses. We investigated the biological functions of SRSF10 in immune evasion using in vitro co-culture systems, flow cytometry, various tumor-bearing mouse models, and patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids.


RESULTS
SRSF10 was upregulated in various tumors and associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, SRSF10 positively regulated lactate production, and SRSF10/glycolysis/ histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) formed a positive feedback loop in tumor cells. Increased lactate levels promoted M2 macrophage polarization, thereby inhibiting CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, SRSF10 interacted with the 3'-untranslated region of MYB, enhancing MYB RNA stability, and subsequently upregulating key glycolysis-related enzymes including glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 1 (HK1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), resulting in elevated intracellular and extracellular lactate levels. Lactate accumulation induced histone lactylation, which further upregulated SRSF10 expression. Additionally, lactate produced by tumors induced lactylation of the histone H3K18la site upon transport into macrophages, thereby activating transcription and enhancing pro-tumor macrophage activity. M2 macrophages, in turn, inhibited the enrichment of CD8+ T cells and the proportion of interferon-γ+CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus creating an immunosuppressive TME. Clinically, SRSF10 could serve as a biomarker for assessing immunotherapy resistance in various solid tumors. Pharmacological targeting of SRSF10 with a selective inhibitor 1C8 enhanced the efficacy of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in both murine and human preclinical models.


CONCLUSIONS
The SRSF10/MYB/glycolysis/lactate axis is critical for triggering immune evasion and anti-PD-1 resistance. Inhibiting SRSF10 by 1C8 may overcome anti-PD-1 tolerance in HCC.">

        <tr id="Engineered cellular therapy with CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) has revolutionized outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma (LBCL), but the cellular and molecular features associated with response remain largely unresolved. We analyzed serial peripheral blood samples ranging from day of apheresis (day -28/baseline) to 28 days after CAR-T infusion from 50 patients with LBCL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) by integrating single cell RNA and TCR sequencing (scRNA-seq/scTCR-seq), flow cytometry, and mass cytometry (CyTOF) to characterize features associated with response to CAR-T. Pretreatment patient characteristics associated with response included presence of B cells and increased lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (ALC/AMC). Infusion products from responders were enriched for clonally expanded, highly activated CD8+ T cells. We expanded these observations to 99 patients from the ZUMA-1 cohort and identified a subset of patients with elevated baseline B cells, 80% of whom were complete responders. We integrated B cell proportion 0.5% and ALC/AMC 1.2 into a two-factor predictive model and applied this model to the ZUMA-1 cohort. Estimated progression free survival (PFS) at 1 year in patients meeting one or both criteria was 65% versus 31% for patients meeting neither criterion. Our results suggest that patients' immunologic state at baseline affects likelihood of response to CAR-T through both modulation of the T cell apheresis product composition and promoting a more favorable circulating immune compartment prior to therapy. These baseline immunologic features, measured readily in the clinical setting prior to CAR-T, can be applied to predict response to therapy.">

 Diffuse astrocytomas, especially glioblastomas (GBs), are aggressive brain tumors with a poor prognosis despite the efforts to improve their treatment. In diffuse astrocytomas, myeloid immune cells, notably monocyte-derived macrophages and brain-resident microglia are pivotal in the immunoregulation of tumor microenvironment (TME). GBs, characterized by higher macrophage frequencies, often exhibit hypoxia in the TME. In this work, we investigated how hypoxia affects the regulation of myeloid immune cells.



 We analyzed 222 diffuse astrocytoma patient samples using multiplex immunohistochemistry, 45 GBs with single-cell RNA sequencing (SCS) data, and 30 diffuse astrocytoma samples using spatial transcriptomics. The resulting data was analyzed with QuPath as well as R and Python-based tools and scripts.



 Our findings reveal that hypoxia generates distinct spatial and gene expression responses in macrophages and microglia. Microglia decrease in highly hypoxic areas, while macrophages increase gradually compared to normoxia. In SCS data, macrophages show the highest proportion of cells under hypoxia, and the responding differentially expressed genes in macrophages and microglia are associated with different biological processes. Our results are further validated with spatial transcriptomics and cell culture models.



 Hypoxia is significantly shaping the TME and immunosuppression in diffuse astrocytomas.

        <tr id="S100A9, a multifunctional protein mainly expressed by neutrophils and monocytes, poses an immunological paradox. In virus infections or sterile inflammation, it functions as an alarmin attracting innate immune cells, as well as mediating proinflammatory effects through TLR4 signaling. However, in cancer, S100A9 levels have been shown to associate with poor prognosis and lack of response to immunotherapy. Its expression by myeloid cells has been related to an immune suppressive phenotype, the so-called myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Targeting S100A9 in cancer has therefore been proposed as a potential way to relieve myeloid-mediated immune suppression. Surprisingly, we found that blocking the extracellular TLR4 signaling from S100A9 using the inhibitor Paquinimod, resulted in increased tumor growth and a detrimental effect on anti-PD-L1 efficacy in the CT26 tumor model. This effect was caused by a reduction in the tumor immune infiltration to about half of untreated controls, and the reduction was made up of a 5-fold decrease in Ly6Chigh monocytic cells. The suppressive Ly6G+ myeloid cells compartment was not reduced by Paquinimod treatment, suggesting alternative mechanisms by which S100A9 contributes to myeloid-mediated suppression. Intratumoral injection of recombinant S100A9 early after mice inoculation with CT26 cells had an anti-tumor effect. These findings indicate an important yet understudied role of S100A9 as an alarmin and immune stimulatory signal in cancer settings, and highlight the potential to exploit such signals to promote beneficial anti-tumor responses.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue is rich in dendritic cells, T cells, B cells, macrophages, natural killer cells and cellular stroma. Together they form the tumor microenvironment (TME), which is also rich in numerous cytokines. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are involved in the regulation of tumor development. TAMs in HCC receive stimuli in different directions, polarize in different directions and release different cytokines to regulate the development of HCC. TAMs are mostly divided into two cell phenotypes: M1 and M2. M1 TAMs secrete pro-inflammatory mediators, and M2 TAMs secrete a variety of anti-inflammatory and pro-tumorigenic substances. The TAM polarization in HCC tumors is M2. Both direct and indirect methods for TAMs to regulate the development of HCC are discussed. TAMs indirectly support HCC development by promoting peripheral angiogenesis and regulating the immune microenvironment of the TME. In terms of the direct regulation between TAMs and HCC cells, the present review mainly focuses on the molecular mechanism. TAMs are involved in both the proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cells to regulate the quantitative changes of HCC, and stimulate the related invasive migratory ability and cell stemness of HCC cells. The present review aims to identify immunotherapeutic options based on the mechanisms of TAMs in the TME of HCC.">

        <tr id="T-cell activation is a multistep process requiring T-cell receptor engagement by peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (Signal 1) coupled with CD28-mediated costimulation (Signal 2). Tumors typically lack expression of CD28 ligands, so tumor-specific Signal 1 (e.g., neoepitope presentation) without costimulation may be ineffective or even induce T-cell anergy. We designed the bispecific antibody XmAb808 to co-engage the tumor-associated antigen B7-H3 with CD28 to promote T-cell costimulation within the tumor microenvironment. XmAb808 costimulation was measured by its ability to activate and expand T cells and enhance T cell-mediated cancer cell killing in cocultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cancer cells, and in mice engrafted with human PBMCs and tumor xenografts. XmAb808 avidly bound cancer cells and stimulated interleukin (IL)2 and interferon (IFN)γ secretion from T cells cocultured with cancer cells engineered to deliver Signal 1 to T cells via a surface-expressed anti-CD3 antibody. XmAb808 enhanced expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL and CD25, promoting survival and IL2-dependent expansion of T cells coupled with increased T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. XmAb808 combined with a EpCAM×CD3 bispecific antibody to enhance target cell killing through IL2-dependent expansion of CD25+ T cells. This combination also suppressed pancreatic tumor xenograft growth in mice. Further, XmAb808 combined with an anti-PD1 antibody to suppress breast tumor xenograft growth in mice. XmAb808 as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody is currently in clinical development in patients with advanced solid tumors. Our results suggest that XmAb808 may also combine with tumor antigen-targeted anti-CD3 (Signal 1) T-cell engagers.">

        <tr id="Maintaining peripheral immune tolerance and preventing harmful autoimmune reactions is a fundamental task of the immune system. However, these essential functions are significantly compromised during autoimmune disorders, creating a major challenge in treating these conditions. In this context, we provide an overview of research on small spleen polypeptides (SSPs) that naturally regulate peripheral immune tolerance. Alongside outlining the observed effects of SSPs, we summarize here the findings on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie their regulatory impact. Specifically, SSPs have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in halting the progression of developing or established autoimmune disorders like psoriasis or arthritis in animal models. They primarily target dendritic cells (DCs), swiftly prompting the production of extracellular ATP, which is then degraded and sensed by adenosine receptors. This process triggers the mTOR signaling cascade, similar to powerful immune triggers, but instead of a rapid and intense reaction, it leads to a moderate yet significant activation of the mTOR signaling cascade. This induces a tolerogenic state in dendritic cells, ultimately leading to the generation of Foxp3+ immunosuppressor Treg cells. In addition, SSPs may indirectly attenuate the autoimmune response by reducing extracellular ATP synthesis in non-immune cells, such as endothelial cells, when exposed to elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. SSPs thus have the potential to contribute to the restoration of peripheral immune tolerance and may offer valuable therapeutic benefits in treating autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Age-related changes in the immune system, referred to as immunosenescence, appear to evolve with rather paradoxical manifestations, a diminished adaptive immune capacity, and an increased propensity for chronic inflammation often with autoimmunity, which may underlie the development of diverse disorders with age. Immunosenescent phenotypes are associated with the emergence of unique lymphocyte subpopulations of both T and B lineages. We report that a CD153+ PD-1+ CD4+ T-cell subpopulation with severely attenuated T-cell receptor (TCR)-responsiveness, termed senescence-associated T (SAT) cells, co-evolve with potentially autoreactive CD30+ B cells, such as spontaneous germinal center B cells and age-associated B cells, in aging mice. SAT cells and CD30+ B cells are reciprocally activated with the aid of the interaction of CD153 with CD30 in trans and with the TCR complex in cis, resulting in the restoration of TCR-mediated proliferation and secretion of abundant proinflammatory cytokines in SAT cells and the activation and production of autoantibodies by CD30+ B cells. Besides normal aging, the development of SAT cells coupled with counterpart B cells may be robustly accelerated and accumulated in the relevant tissues of lymphoid or extra-lymphoid organs under chronic inflammatory conditions including autoimmunity and may contribute to the pathogenesis and aggravation of the disorders. This review summarizes and discusses recent advances in the understanding of SAT cells in the contexts of immunosenescent phenotypes, autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases and provides a novel therapeutic clue.">

        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs from colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a significant reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. Further, IgA+ PCs, the major cellular output of intestinal GCs were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations associated with changes in intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. Herein, we highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia, with major implications.

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

        <tr id="For triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subset of breast cancer, immune cell infiltrates have prognostic implications. The presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells supports tumor progression, while tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) correlate with improved survival and responsiveness to immunotherapy. Manipulating the abundance of these populations may enhance tumor immunity. Gemcitabine (GEM), a clinically employed chemotherapeutic, is reported to be systemically myeloablative, and thus it is a potentially useful adjunct therapy for promoting anti-tumor immunity. However, knowledge about the immunological effects of GEM intratumorally is limited. Thus, we directly compared the impact of systemic GEM on immune cell presence and functionality in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to its effects in the periphery. We found that GEM is not myeloablative in the TME; rather, we observed sustained, significant reductions in TILs and dendritic cells—crucial components in initiating an adaptive immune response. We also performed bulk-RNA sequencing to identify immunological alterations transcriptionally induced by GEM. While we found evidence of upregulation in the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) response pathway, we determined that GEM-mediated growth control is not dependent on IFN-γ. Overall, our findings yield new insights into the tissue- and temporal-dependent immune ablative effects of GEM, contrasting the paradigm that this therapy is specifically myeloablative.">

        <tr id="Immune cells from the adaptive and innate immune systems coexist in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) to mediate tumor cell immunosurveillance and prevent tumor relapse. Relapse-free survival after surgical resection is heterogeneous in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), the two major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer. Yet, little is known about the composition and spatial organisation of the TME that could explain the different prognoses for lung cancer patients. Using spatial multi-omics analyses, we show that LUAD and LUSC have distinct TMEs and that neutrophil-enriched tumors are associated with worse survival, while the accumulation of myeloid-instructed CD14+ T cells in the tumor core was associated with prolonged patient survival. CD14+CD4+ T cells express prototypic markers of myeloid cells and were found to be clonally expanded tumor-specific activated T cells. TNFα signaling was activated in tumors with high infiltration of CD14+CD4+ T cells in the tumor core. Our results demonstrate that innate immune cells impact adaptive immune cell activity to support the deployment of discrete T cell populations with anti-tumor activity.">

        <tr id="The adjuvant AS01 plays a key role in the immunogenicity of several approved human vaccines with demonstrated high efficacy. Its adjuvant effect relies on activation of the innate immune system. However, specific effects of AS01-adjuvanted vaccines on innate cell function and epigenetic remodeling, as described for Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and influenza vaccines, are still unknown. We assessed the long-term functional and epigenetic changes in circulating monocytes and dendritic cells induced by a model vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen and AS01 in healthy adults (NCT01777295). The AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, but not an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine, increased the number of circulating monocytes and their expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–DR, which correlated with the magnitude of the memory CD4+ T cell response. Single-cell analyses revealed epigenetic alterations in monocyte and dendritic cell subsets, affecting accessibility of transcription factors involved in cell functions including activator protein-1 (AP-1), GATA, C/EBP, and interferon regulatory factor. The functional changes were characterized by a reduced proinflammatory response to Toll-like receptor activation and an improved response to interferon-γ, a cytokine critical for the adjuvant’s mode of action. Epigenetic changes were most evident shortly after the second vaccine dose in CD14+ monocytes, for which accessibility differences of some transcription factors could persist for up to 6 months postvaccination. Together, we show that reprogramming of monocyte subsets occurs after vaccination with an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine, an effect that may contribute to the impact of vaccination beyond antigen-specific protection. An AS01-adjuvanted vaccine for hepatitis B virus modifies the epigenetic landscape of monocytes isolated from clinical study participants. Editor’s summary Most vaccines based on recombinant antigens rely on coadministration with an adjuvant to elicit a robust immune response. Although adjuvants are needed for many vaccines, it is less clear which adjuvant(s) should be paired with each immunogen. In two papers, Bechtold et al. and Arunachalam et al. performed comparative analyses to assess the effect of different adjuvants on the immune response. Bechtold et al. showed that an AS01-adjuvanted hepatitis B virus vaccine, which induces robust CD4+ T cell responses against the vaccine antigen, also elicited trained immunity in human recipients, which was not observed in an Alum-adjuvanted vaccine. Arunachalam et al. found that Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum adjuvantation induced robust immune responses to the R21 malaria vaccine in nonhuman primates, but a third comparator, GLA-LSQ, elicited a lower magnitude of response that was short lived. Although Matrix-M and 3M-052 + Alum induced robust and durable antibody responses, they elicited distinct innate immune responses, demonstrating that multiple innate immune mechanisms can program durable vaccine-induced immunity. These head-to-head comparisons in both humans and nonhuman primates demonstrate that selecting an adjuvant should be done carefully and that different adjuvants have distinct effects on both innate and adaptive immunity. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="Influenza viruses are a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Vagal TRPV1+ nociceptive sensory neurons, which innervate the airways, are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents. However, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.

        <tr id="Yellow fever vaccination provides long-lasting protection and is a unique model for studying the immune response to an acute RNA virus infection in humans. To elucidate the early innate immune events preceding the rapid generation of protective immunity, we performed transcriptome analysis of human blood dendritic cell (DC) and monocyte subpopulations before and 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after vaccination. We detected temporary upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in all DC and monocyte subsets on day 3 and 7 after vaccination as well as cell type specific responses and temporal dynamics. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed rapid appearance of activated DC and monocyte clusters dominated by ISGs, inflammatory chemokines and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation. This was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in a large cohort of vaccinees. We identified SIGLEC1/CD169 upregulation as a sensitive indicator of the transient IFN-induced activation state elicited in DCs and monocytes by YF17D vaccination correlating with early protective IgM antibody responses.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) presented clinical benefits in many cancer patients but invariably fail in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Lack of ICI efficacy in GBM is attributed to the accumulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells that create the “cold” tumor microenvironment (TME) impeding infiltration and activation of effector T cells. We developed a designer RGD peptide that hindered glioma-instigated, integrin-mediated pro-tumoral reprogramming of myeloid cells and blocked microglia-dependent invasion of human and mouse glioma cells in co-cultures in vitro. Intratumorally-delivered RGD alone did not reduce glioma growth in syngeneic mice but prevented the emergence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and led to peritumoral blood vessels normalization. Furthermore, combining RGD with immunotherapy using PD-1 blockade reduced tumor growth, led to upsurge of proliferating, interferon-ɣ producing CD8+T cells and depleted regulatory T cells. Transcriptomic profiles of myeloid cells were altered by the combined treatment, consistently with the restored “hot” inflammatory TME and boosted immunotherapy responses. RGD modified the phenotypes of myeloid cells in human gliomas in nude mice. Thus, combining the integrin blockade with ICI reinvigorates antitumor immunity and paves the way to improve immunotherapy outcomes in GBM.">

        <tr id="While immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated durable responses in various cancer types, a significant proportion of patients do not exhibit favourable responses to these interventions. To uncover potential factors associated with a positive response to immunotherapy, we established a bilateral tumor model using P815 mastocytoma implanted in DBA/2 mice. In this model, only a fraction of tumor-bearing mice responds favourably to anti-PD-1 treatment, thus providing a valuable model to explore the influence of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in determining the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based immunotherapies. Moreover, this model allows for the analysis of a pretreatment tumor and inference of its treatment outcome based on the response observed in the contralateral tumor. Here, we demonstrated that tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell clones expressing high levels of Tim-3 were associated to a positive anti-tumor response following anti-PD-1 administration. Our study also revealed distinct differentiation dynamics in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in responding and non-responding mice. An IFNγ-enriched TME appeared to promote the differentiation of monocytes into PD-L1pos MHC IIhigh cells in mice responding to immunotherapy. Monocytes present in the TME of non-responding mice failed to reach the same final stage of differentiation trajectory, suggesting that an altered monocyte to macrophage route may hamper the response to ICB. These insights will direct future research towards a temporal analysis of TAMs, aiming to identify factors responsible for transitions between differentiation states within the TME. This approach may potentially pave the way to novel strategies to enhance the efficacy of PD-1 blockade.">

        <tr id="Introduction In the course of immune development, HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants exhibit abnormal immune function and increased infectious morbidity compared to HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) infants. Yet the specific functional phenotypes and regulatory mechanisms associated with in-utero HIV and/or ART exposure remain largely obscure. Methods We utilized flow cytometry and RNA-seq technologies to conduct the immunological and transcriptomic profiling in cord blood from 9 HEU mother-infant pairs and 24 HUU pairs. On top of that, we compared the cord blood dataset with the maternal venous blood dataset to characterize unique effects induced by in-utero HIV and/or ART exposure. Results Flow cytometry immunophenotyping revealed that the level of B lymphocyte subsets was significantly decreased in HEU cord blood as compared to HUU (P < 0.001). Expression profiling-based cell abundance assessment, includes CIBERSORT and ssGSEA algorithm, showed a significantly reduced abundance of naive B cells in HEU cord blood (both P < 0.05), supporting the altered composition of B lymphocyte subsets in HEU. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated suppressed innate immune responses and impaired immune regulatory function of B cells in HEU cord blood. Furthermore, through differential expression analysis, co-expression network analysis using WGCNA, and feature selection analysis using LASSO, we identified a 4-gene signature associated with HEU status. This signature effectively assesses B cell levels in cord blood, enabling discrimination between HEU and HUU infants. Discussion Our study provides the first comprehensive immunological and transcriptomic characterization of HEU cord blood. Additionally, we establish a 4-gene-based classifier that holds potential for predict immunological abnormalities in HEU infants.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The main challenge against patients with cancer to derive benefits from immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 appears to be the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), in which IL-33/ST2 signal fulfills critical functions. However, whether IL-33 limits the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 remains uncertain. Methods Molecular mechanisms of IL-33/ST2 signal on anti-PD-L1 treatment lewis lung carcinoma tumor model were assessed by RNA-seq, ELISA, WB and immunofluorescence (IF). A sST2-Fc fusion protein was constructed for targeting IL-33 and combined with anti-PD-L1 antibody for immunotherapy in colon and lung tumor models. On this basis, bifunctional fusion proteins were generated for PD-L1-targeted blocking of IL-33 in tumors. The underlying mechanisms of dual targeting of IL-33 and PD-L1 revealed by RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, FACS, IF and WB. Results After anti-PD-L1 administration, tumor-infiltrating ST2+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were elevated. Blocking IL-33/ST2 signal with sST2-Fc fusion protein potentiated antitumor efficacy of PD-L1 antibody by enhancing T cell responses in tumor models. Bifunctional fusion protein anti-PD-L1-sST2 exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy compared with combination therapy, not only inhibited tumor progression and extended the survival, but also provided long-term protective antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, the superior antitumor activity of targeting IL-33 and PD-L1 originated from reducing immunosuppressive factors, such as Tregs and exhausted CD8+ T cells while increasing tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated that IL-33/ST2 was involved in the immunosuppression mechanism of PD-L1 antibody therapy, and blockade by sST2-Fc or anti-PD-L1-sST2 could remodel the inflammatory TME and induce potent antitumor effect, highlighting the potential therapeutic strategies for the tumor treatment by simultaneously targeting IL-33 and PD-L1.">

        <tr id="Type 1 immunity mediates host defense through pathogen elimination, but whether this pathway also impacts tissue function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that rapid induction of IFNγ signaling coordinates a multi-cellular response that is critical to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility following infection of mice with a tissue-invasive helminth. IFNγ production is initiated by antigen-independent activation of lamina propria CD8+ T cells following MyD88-dependent recognition of the microbiota during helminth-induced barrier invasion. IFNγ acted directly on intestinal stromal cells to recruit neutrophils that limited parasite-induced tissue injury. IFNγ sensing also limited the expansion of smooth muscle actin-expressing cells to prevent pathological gut dysmotility. Importantly, this tissue-protective response had limited impact on parasite burden, indicating that IFNγ supports a disease tolerance defense strategy. Our results have important implications for managing the pathophysiological sequelae of post-infectious gut dysfunction and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with stromal remodelling. HIGHLIGHTS Type 1 immunity is required for disease tolerance to tissue-invasive infection. Gut-resident CD8+ T cells produce IFNγ in an antigen-independent, yet microbiota-dependent manner. IFNγ signaling recruits neutrophils in a cell-extrinsic manner to limit helminth-induced tissue injury. Direct sensing of IFNγ by intestinal stroma is essential to limit tissue damage and maintain gut motility during infection.">

        <tr id="Therapies that harness the immune system to target and eliminate tumor cells have revolutionized cancer care. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), which boosts the anti-tumor immune response by inhibiting negative regulators of T cell activation1–3, is remarkably successful in a subset of cancer patients, yet a significant proportion do not respond to treatment, emphasizing the need to understand factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy of ICB4–9. The gut microbiota, consisting of trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a critical determinant of immune function and response to cancer immunotherapy, with multiple studies demonstrating association of microbiota composition with clinical response10–16. However, a mechanistic understanding of how gut commensal bacteria influence the efficacy of ICB remains elusive. Here we utilized a gut commensal microorganism, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induces an antigen-specific Th17 cell effector program17, to investigate how colonization with it affects the efficacy of ICB in restraining distal growth of tumors sharing antigen with SFB. We find that anti-PD-1 treatment effectively inhibits the growth of implanted SFB antigen-expressing melanoma only if mice are colonized with SFB. Through T cell receptor clonal lineage tracing, fate mapping, and peptide-MHC tetramer staining, we identify tumor-associated SFB-specific Th1-like cells derived from the homeostatic Th17 cells induced by SFB colonization in the small intestine lamina propria. These gut-educated ex-Th17 cells produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, and promote expansion and effector functions of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby controlling tumor growth. A better understanding of how distinct intestinal commensal microbes can promote T cell plasticity-dependent responses against antigen-sharing tumors may allow for the design of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Disease tolerance is an evolutionarily conserved host defence strategy that preserves tissue integrity and physiology without affecting pathogen load. Unlike host resistance, the mechanisms underlying disease tolerance remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated whether an adjuvant (β-glucan) can reprogram innate immunity to provide protection against Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Here we observe that β-glucan treatment reduced the morbidity and mortality against IAV infection, independent of host resistance (viral load). Increased survival of β-glucan treated mice against IAV is associated with the accumulation of neutrophils via RoRγt+ T cells in the lung tissue. Using gain-and-loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that β- glucan reprogrammed neutrophils are essential for promoting disease tolerance, limiting pulmonary tissue damage, and enhancing survival against IAV infection. β-glucan treatment promotes granulopoiesis in a type 1 interferon-dependent manner that leads to the generation of a unique subset of neutrophils, which are less mature with higher mitochondrial mass utilizing mitochondrial oxidative (OXPHOS) metabolism. Collectively, our data indicate that β-glucan reprograms hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to generate neutrophils with a novel “regulatory” function, which is required for promoting disease tolerance and maintaining lung tissue integrity against viral infection.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Cancer immunotherapy has been regarded as a promising strategy for cancer therapy by blocking immune checkpoints and evoking immunity to fight cancer, but its efficacy seems to be heterogeneous among patients. Manipulating the gut microbiota is a potential strategy for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Here, we report that MS-20, also known as “Symbiota®”, a postbiotic that comprises abundant microbial metabolites generated from a soybean-based medium fermented with multiple strains of probiotics and yeast, inhibited colon and lung cancer growth in combination with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) antibody in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, MS-20 remodeled the immunological tumor microenvironment by increasing effector CD8+ T cells and downregulating PD1 expression, which were mediated by the gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from mice receiving MS-20 treatment to recipient mice increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment and significantly improved antitumor activity when combined with anti-PD1 therapy. Notably, the abundance of Ruminococcus bromii, which increased following MS-20 treatment, was positively associated with a reduced tumor burden and CD8+ T-cell infiltration in vivo. Furthermore, an ex vivo study revealed that MS-20 could alter the composition of the microbiota in cancer patients, resulting in distinct metabolic pathways associated with favorable responses to immunotherapy. Overall, MS-20 could act as a promising adjuvant agent for enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint-mediated antitumor therapy.">

        <tr id="Memory T cells are a highly dynamic and heterogeneous population that is maintained by cytokine-driven homeostatic proliferation interspersed with episodes of antigen-mediated expansion and contraction which affect their functional state and their durability. This heterogeneity complicates studies on the impact of aging on global human memory cells, specifically, it is unclear how aging drives memory T cell dysfunction. Here, we used chronic infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to assess the influence of age on memory states at the level of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. We find that in young adults (<40 years), EBV-specific CD8+ T cells assume preferred differentiation states depending on their peptide specificity. By age >65-years, different T cell specificities had undergone largely distinct aging trajectories, which had in common a loss in adaptive and a gain in innate immunity signatures. No evidence was seen for cellular senescence or exhaustion. While naïve/stem-like EBV-specific T cells disappeared with age, T cell diversity of EBV-specific memory cells did not change or even increased. In summary, by controlling for antigen specificity we uncover age-associated shifts in gene expression and TCR diversity that have implications for optimizing vaccination strategies and adoptive T cell therapy.">

Dysfunctional T cell activity precipitates tissue pathology that occurs alongside disease-associated alterations of structural cell subsets, but the mechanisms by which T cells promote these changes remain unclear. We show that subsets of circulating and skin-resident CD4+ T cells promote distinct transcriptional outcomes in human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts that correspond with divergent T cell cytokine production. Using these transcriptional signatures, we identify T cell-dependent outcomes associated with inflammatory skin disease, including a set of Th17 cell-induced genes in keratinocytes that are enriched in the skin during psoriasis and normalized by anti-IL-17 therapy, and a skin-resident T cell-induced gene module enriched in scleroderma-associated fibroblasts. Interrogating clinical data using T cell-derived structural cell gene networks enables investigation of the immune-dependent contribution to inflammatory disease and the heterogeneous patient response to biologic therapy.">

        <tr id="Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus infection affecting half of the world’s population for which therapies are lacking. The role of T and NK-cells in protection/immunopathogenesis remains unclear for dengue. We performed a longitudinal phenotypic, functional and transcriptional analyses of T and NK-cells in 124 dengue patients using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that T/NK-cell signatures early in infection discriminate patients who will progress to severe dengue (SD) from those who do not. In patients with overweight/obesity these signatures are exacerbated compared to healthy weight patients, supporting their increased susceptibility to SD. In SD, CD4+/CD8+ T-cells and NK-cells display increased co-inhibitory receptor expression and decreased cytotoxic capacity compared to non-SD. Furthermore, type-I Interferon signalling is downregulated in SD, suggesting defective virus-sensing mechanisms may underlie NK/T-cell dysfunction. We propose that dysfunctional “professional killer” T/NK-cells underpin dengue pathogenesis. Our findings pave the way for the evaluation of immunomodulatory therapies for dengue.">

        <tr id="Tumor cell–originated events prevent efficient antitumor immune response and limit the application of anti-PD1 checkpoint immunotherapy. We show that syndecan-1 (SDC1) has a critical role in the regulation of T cell–mediated control of tumor growth. SDC1 inhibition increases the permeation of CD8+ T cells into tumors and triggers CD8+ T cell–mediated control of tumor growth, accompanied by increased proportions of progenitor-exhausted and effector-like CD8+ T cells. SDC1 deficiency alters multiple signaling events in tumor cells, including enhanced IFN-γ–STAT1 signaling, and augments antigen presentation and sensitivity to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Combinatory inhibition of SDC1 markedly potentiates the therapeutic effects of anti-PD1 in inhibiting tumor growth. Consistently, the findings are supported by the data from human tumors showing that SDC1 expression negatively correlates with T cell presence in tumor tissues and the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our findings suggest that SDC1 inhibits antitumor immunity, and that targeting SDC1 may promote anti-PD1 response for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) enhances T cell responses against cancer, leading to long-term survival in a fraction of patients. CD8+ T cell differentiation in response to chronic antigen stimulation is highly complex, and it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states at which anatomic sites are critical for the response to ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population in the white pulp of the spleen that underwent substantial expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increased systemic antigen redirected differentiation of this population toward a more circulatory exhausted KLR state, whereas a lack of cross-presented tumor antigen reduced its differentiation in the spleen. An analogous population of exhausted KLR CD8+ T cells in human blood samples exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability. Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role of antigen density within the spleen for the differentiation and expansion of T cell clonotypes in response to ICB. Response to ICB depends on optimal splenic antigen levels, whereas increased antigen induces differentiation to circulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T cell dysfunction is a defining feature of many tumor types, but how tumor-specific T cells progress to a terminally exhausted state and which populations are targeted by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains incompletely understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, Morgan et al. profiled T cell differentiation states across different anatomical sites including tumors, draining lymph nodes, and the white pulp of the spleen from tumor-bearing mice treated with ICB. A population of splenic intermediate-exhausted T cells supplied most of the ICB-elicited tumor-specific T cell response, which required low levels of cross-presented tumor antigen in the spleen. Together, these findings identify the spleen as an important site for generating a tumor-specific T cell response after ICB. —Claire Olingy">

Matched pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies from the same lesion were obtained. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and custom multiplex staining to leverage the unique advantage of same-lesion longitudinal sampling. Patients receiving dual TLR8 agonism and anti-PD-1 blockade exhibited marked upregulation of innate immune effector genes and cytokines, highlighted by increased CLEC9A+ dendritic cell and CLEC7A/SYK expression. This was revealed via comparison with a previous cohort from an anti-PD-1 blockade monotherapy single-cell RNA sequencing study. Furthermore, in dual therapy patients, post-treatment mature dendritic cells increased in adjacency to CD8+ T-cells. Increased tumoral cytotoxic T-lymphocyte densities and expanded CXCL13+CD8+ T- cell populations were observed in responders, with increased tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) across all three patients.

In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophage presence is largely associated with poor prognosis because of their reprogramming into immunosuppressive cells. We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses. Coculture assays and cell-cell communication analyses support that hypoxic-activated macrophages enhance T cell–mediated responses. The NF-κB–associated hypomethylation signature is displayed by a subset of hypoxic inflammatory macrophages, isolated from ovarian tumors. Our results challenge paradigms regarding the effects of hypoxia on macrophages and highlight actionable target cells to modulate anticancer immune responses.">

Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of brain CD8+ T cells from T. gondii-infected mice showed heterogeneous expression of the transcriptional regulator Id2, correlating with different functional states. Using mixed bone marrow chimeras, we found that Id2-deficiency in T cells caused parasite-specific Trm to develop an altered phenotype with diminished effector functions and reduced expression of CD49a. Furthermore, loss of Id2 in brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells led to the accumulation of exhausted PD1+Tox+CD8+ Trm cells, while Id2 overexpression repressed T cell exhaustion. Overall, our study shows that Id2 levels dictate the acquisition of effector vs. exhausted phenotypes in CD8+ Trm during chronic CNS infection.

        <tr id="Abstract The regulation of inflammation is a critical aspect of disease tolerance and naturally acquired clinical immunity to malaria. Here, we demonstrate using RNA sequencing and epigenetic landscape profiling by cytometry by time-of-flight, that the regulation of inflammatory pathways during asymptomatic parasitemia occurs downstream of pathogen sensing—at the epigenetic level. The abundance of certain epigenetic markers (methylation of H3K27 and dimethylation of arginine residues) and decreased prevalence of histone variant H3.3 correlated with suppressed cytokine responses among monocytes of Ugandan children. Such an epigenetic signature was observed across diverse immune cell populations and not only characterized active asymptomatic parasitemia but also correlated with future long-term disease tolerance and clinical immunity when observed in uninfected children. Pseudotime analyses revealed a potential trajectory of epigenetic change that correlated with a child's age and recent parasite exposure and paralleled the acquisition of clinical immunity. Thus, our data support a model whereby exposure to Plasmodium falciparum induces epigenetic changes that regulate excessive inflammation and contribute to naturally acquire clinical immunity to malaria.">

        <tr id="Abstract CD4+ T cells are key players in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) through the production of inflammatory mediators including tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Anti-TNF therapy has revolutionized the treatment of several IMIDs and we previously demonstrated that in vitro treatment of human CD4+ T cells with anti-TNF promotes anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression in multiple subpopulations of CD4+ T cells. Here we investigated the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the IL-10 induction by TNF-blockade in CD4+ T cells, isolated from PBMCs of healthy volunteers, stimulated in vitro for 3 days with anti-CD3/CD28 mAb in the absence or presence of anti-TNF. After culture, CD45RA+ cells were depleted before performing gene expression profiling and chromatin accessibility analysis. Gene expression analysis of CD45RA-CD4+ T cells showed a distinct anti-TNF specific gene signature of 183 genes (q-value < 0.05). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed multiple pathways related to cytokine signalling and regulation of cytokine production; in particular, IL10 was the most upregulated gene by anti-TNF, while the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines IFNG, IL9, IL22, and CXCL10 were significantly downregulated (q-value < 0.05). Transcription factor motif analysis at the differentially open chromatin regions, after anti-TNF treatment, revealed 58 transcription factor motifs enriched at the IL10 locus. We identified seven transcription factor candidates for the anti-TNF mediated regulation of IL-10, which were either differentially expressed or whose locus was differentially accessible upon anti-TNF treatment. Correlation analysis between the expression of these transcription factors and IL10 suggests a role for MAF, PRDM1, and/or EOMES in regulating IL10 expression in CD4+ T cells upon anti-TNF treatment.">

However, their functional characteristics and effect on cellular immunity after surgery have not been comprehensively investigated.

We then screened a small molecule library using our sx-MDSC:NK cell suppression assay to identify compounds that could inhibit sx-MDSCs.

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells suppress cellular and humoral immune responses via killing of T cells, resulting in diminished vaccine responses in mice and humans. Efforts to overcome this roadblock and achieve optimal immunity require an improved understanding of the molecular mediators facilitating NK cell-targeting of discrete subsets of CD4 T cells. We employed single-cell forensic victimology and CRISPR-Cas9 editing to delineate a transcriptional program uniquely responsible for the susceptibility of a subpopulation of CD4 T cells to perforin-dependent immunoregulation by NK cells. The unique vulnerability of these CD4 T cells relative to other subsets of CD4 T cells was not associated with a pattern of NK-cell-receptor ligand expression that would favor activation of NK cells. Instead, susceptible CD4 T cells were skewed toward follicular helper T cell (Tfh) differentiation and exhibited intermediate expression of Klf2 and a related suite of KLF2-target genes (e.g. S1pr1) involved in cell migration and spatial positioning. NK-cell dependent suppression of the subset of Tfh exhibiting intermediate expression of KLF2 and S1PR1 was confirmed with single-cell proteomics. CRISPR targeting of KLF2 in CD4 T cells prevented suppression by NK cells. Thus, KLF2 regulation of spatial positioning of T cells is a key determinant of NK-cell immunoregulatory function and a possible target for strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) contributes significantly to the global burden of neglected tropical diseases, with 12 million people currently infected with Leishmania parasites. CL encompasses a range of disease manifestations, from self-healing skin lesions to permanent disfigurations. Currently there is no vaccine available, and many patients are refractory to treatment, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Previous work demonstrated macrophage HIF-α-mediated lymphangiogenesis is necessary to achieve efficient wound resolution during murine L. major infection. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage HIF-α signaling independent of lymphangiogenesis. We sought to determine the relative contributions of the parasite and the host-mediated inflammation in the lesional microenvironment to myeloid HIF-α signaling. Because HIF-α activation can be detected in infected and bystander macrophages in leishmanial lesions, we hypothesize it is the host’s inflammatory response and microenvironment, rather than the parasite, that triggers HIF-α activation. To address this, macrophages from mice with intact HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/+) or mice with deleted HIF-α signaling (LysMCreARNTf/f) were subjected to RNASequencing after L. major infection and under pro-inflammatory stimulus. We report that L. major infection alone is enough to induce some minor HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic changes, while infection with L. major in combincation with pro-inflammatory stimuli induces numerous transcriptomic changes that are both dependent and independent of HIF-α signaling. Additionally, by coupling transcriptomic analysis with several pathway analyses, we found HIF-α suppresses pathways involved in protein translation during L. major infection in a pro-inflammatory environment. Together these findings show L. major induces a HIF-α-dependent transcriptomic program, but HIF-α only suppresses protein translation in a pro-inflammatory environment. Thus, this work indicates the host inflammatory response, rather than the parasite, largely contributes to myeloid HIF-α signaling during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Respiratory fungal infections pose a significant threat to human health. Animal models do not fully recapitulate human disease, necessitating advanced models to study human-fungal pathogen interactions. In this study, we utilized primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) to recapitulate the lung environment in vitro and investigate cellular responses to two diverse, clinically significant fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. To understand the mechanisms of early pathogenesis for both fungi, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of infected hAECs. Analysis revealed that both fungi induced cellular stress and cytokine production. However, the cell subtypes affected and specific pathways differed between fungi, with A. fumigatus and C. posadasii triggering protein-folding-related stress in ciliated cells and hypoxia responses in secretory cells, respectively. This study represents one of the first reports of single-cell transcriptional analysis of hAECs infected with either A. fumigatus or C. posadasii, providing a vital dataset to dissect the mechanism of disease and potentially identify targetable pathways. Importance Fungal infections in the lungs are dreaded complications for those with compromised immune systems and have limited treatment strategies available. These options are restricted further by the increased prevalence of treatment-resistant fungi. Many studies focus on how our immune systems respond to these pathogens, yet airway epithelial cells remain an understudied component of fungal infections in the lungs. Here, the authors provide a transcriptional analysis of primary human airway epithelial cells stimulated by two distinct fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. These data will enable further mechanistic studies of the contribution of the airway epithelium to initial host responses and represent a powerful new resource for investigators.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Dysregulated T-cell immune response-mediated inflammation plays critical roles in the pathology of diverse liver diseases, but the underlying mechanism of liver immune homeostasis control and the specific therapies for limiting T-cell overactivation remain unclear. Methods: The metabolic changes in concanavalin A (ConA) mice and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) patients and their associations with liver injury were analyzed. The expression of purine catabolism nucleases (e.g., CD39 and CD73) on liver cells and immune cells was assessed. The effects of MCregs and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) on CD4+ T-cell overactivation and the underlying mechanism were also explored. Results: Our findings revealed significant alterations in purine metabolism in ConA mice and AIH patients, which correlated with liver injury severity and therapeutic response. CD39 and CD73 were markedly upregulated on CD11b+Gr-1+ MCs under liver injury conditions. The naturally expanded CD39+CD73+Gr-1highCD11b+ MCreg subset during early liver injury effectively suppressed CD4+ T-cell hyperactivation and liver injury both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MCregs released CD73high EVs, which converted extracellular AMP to immunosuppressive metabolites (e.g., adenosine and inosine), activating the cAMP pathway and inhibiting glycolysis and cytokine secretion in activated CD4+ T cells. Conclusions: This study provides insights into the mechanism controlling immune homeostasis during the early liver injury phase and highlights that MCreg or MCreg-EV therapy may be a specific strategy for preventing diverse liver diseases induced by T-cell overactivation.">

        <tr id="Secondary bacterial infection, often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), is one of the most frequent and severe complications of influenza A virus (IAV)-induced pneumonia. Phenotyping of the pulmonary innate immune landscape after IAV infection revealed a significant depletion of the tissue-resident alveolar macrophage (TR-AM) population at day 7, which was associated with increased susceptibility to Spn outgrowth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying TR-AM depletion, and to define putative targets for treatment, we combined single-cell transcriptomics and cell-specific PCR profiling in an unbiased manner, using in vivo models of IAV infection and IAV/Spn co-infection. The TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) ligand-receptor axis was revealed as the driving force behind post-influenza TR-AM death during the early infection phase, enabling the transition to pneumococcal pneumonia, while intrapulmonary transfer of genetically modified TR-AMs and antibody-mediated neutralization of specific pathway components alleviated disease severity. With a mainly neutrophilic expression and a high abundance in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) of patients with severe virus-induced ARDS, TNFSF14 emerged as a novel determinant of virus-driven lung injury. Targeting the TNFSF14-mediated intercellular communication network in the virus-infected lung can, therefore, improve host defense, minimizing the risk of subsequent bacterial pneumonia, and ameliorating disease outcome.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has quickly risen to become the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. This is in part because of its fibrotic tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to poor vascularization and immune infiltration and subsequent chemo- and immunotherapy failure. Here, we investigated an immunotherapy approach combining delivery of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) innate immune agonists by lipid-based nanoparticle (NP) coencapsulation with senescence-inducing RAS-targeted therapies, which can remodel the immune suppressive PDAC TME through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Treatment of transplanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models with these regimens led to enhanced uptake of NPs by multiple cell types in the PDAC TME, induction of type I interferon and other proinflammatory signaling pathways, increased antigen presentation by tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells, and subsequent activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. This two-pronged approach produced potent T cell–driven and type I interferon–mediated tumor regression and long-term survival in preclinical PDAC models dependent on both tumor and host STING activation. STING and TLR4-mediated type I interferon signaling was also associated with enhanced natural killer and CD8+ T cell immunity in human PDAC samples. Thus, combining localized immune agonist delivery with systemic tumor-targeted therapy can orchestrate a coordinated type I interferon–driven innate and adaptive immune response with durable antitumor efficacy against PDAC. Combining MEK/CDK4/6 inhibitors with nanoparticle delivery of STING/TLR4 agonists leads to T cell–mediated control of pancreatic tumors in mice. Editor’s summary Unlike other tumor types, existing immunotherapies have not proven very successful for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), necessitating the development of additional approaches. Here, Chibaya et al. developed a combination therapy approach that included nanoparticle delivery of STING and TLR4 agonists, which stimulate the immune response, in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib and CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, which promote senescence of tumor cells. The combination therapy induced robust antitumor immune responses that controlled tumor burden in implanted and autochthonous PDAC mouse models. These data support further development of this potent combination therapy for PDAC. —Courtney Malo">

        <tr id="The severity of COVID-19 is linked to excessive inflammation. Neutrophils represent a critical arm of the innate immune response and are major mediators of inflammation, but their role in COVID-19 pathophysiology remains poorly understood. We conducted transcriptomic profiling of neutrophils obtained from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, as well as from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice, in comparison to non-infected healthy controls. In addition, we investigated the inflammasome formation potential in neutrophils from patients and mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), consisting mainly of mature neutrophils, revealed a striking type I interferon (IFN-I) gene signature in severe COVID-19 patients, contrasting with mild COVID-19 and healthy controls. Notably, low-density granulocytes (LDGs) from severe COVID-19 patients exhibited an immature neutrophil phenotype and lacked this IFN-I signature. Moreover, PMNs from severe COVID-19 patients showed heightened nigericin-induced caspase1 activation, but reduced responsiveness to exogenous inflammasome priming. Furthermore, IFN-I emerged as a priming stimulus for neutrophil inflammasomes. These findings suggest a potential role for neutrophil inflammasomes in driving inflammation during severe COVID-19. Altogether, these findings open promising avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions to mitigate the pathological processes associated with the disease.">

However, the contribution of T cells in controlling SARS-CoV-2 during infection is not well understood. Following infection of C57BL/6 mice, SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the respiratory tract, and a vast proportion secrete the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. Using depleting antibodies, we found that T cells within the lungs play a minimal role in viral control, and viral clearance occurs in the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through 28 days postinfection. In the nasal compartment, depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but not individually, results in persistent, culturable virus replicating in the nasal epithelial layer through 28 days postinfection. Viral sequencing analysis revealed adapted mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including a large deletion in ORF6. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of T cells in controlling virus replication within the respiratory tract during SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) belong to a continuous disease spectrum of myeloid malignancies with poor prognosis in the relapsed/refractory setting necessitating novel therapies. Natural killer (NK) cells from patients with myeloid malignancies display global dysfunction with impaired killing capacity, altered metabolism, and an exhausted phenotype at the single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic levels. In this study, we identified that this dysfunction was mediated through a cross-talk between NK cells and myeloid blasts necessitating cell-cell contact. NK cell dysfunction could be prevented by targeting the αvβ-integrin/TGF-β/SMAD pathway but, once established, was persistent because of profound epigenetic reprogramming. We identified BATF as a core transcription factor and the main mediator of this NK cell dysfunction in AML. Mechanistically, we found that BATF was directly regulated and induced by SMAD2/3 and, in turn, bound to key genes related to NK cell exhaustion, such as HAVCR2, LAG3, TIGIT, and CTLA4. BATF deletion enhanced NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unidentified mechanism of NK immune evasion in AML manifested by epigenetic rewiring and inactivation of NK cells by myeloid blasts. This work highlights the importance of using healthy allogeneic NK cells as an adoptive cell therapy to treat patients with myeloid malignancies combined with strategies aimed at preventing the dysfunction by targeting the TGF-β pathway or BATF. BATF deletion prevents epigenetic rewiring and enhances the antitumor activity of NK cells in AML. Editor’s summary Patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), often relapse after standard of care. To improve outcomes, Kumar et al. have investigated the role of natural killer (NK) cells in antitumor immunity against myeloid blasts and have identified global dysfunction of NK cells in these patients. They identified BATF as responsible for this dysfunction, and by knocking out BATF downstream of the TGF-β canonical pathway in NK cells, they were able to enhance NK cell function against AML in vitro and in vivo. This has led to the initiation of a promising clinical trial using these TGFBR2 knockout NK cells against myeloid malignancies. —Dorothy Hallberg">

        <tr id="Clinical, pathological, and imaging evidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) shows that inflammation starts early and progresses with age. B cells play a central role in this process, contributing to cytokine production, defective regulatory functions, and abnormal immunoglobulin production, even in the central nervous system. Anti-CD20 (aCD20) therapies, which deplete CD20+ B cells, are largely used in the treatment of both relapsing remitting (RR) and progressive (PR) forms of MS. Although effective against MS symptoms and lesions detectable by magnetic resonance imaging, aCD20 therapies can reduce the immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. By using high-parameter flow cytometry, we examined the antigen-specific (Ag+) immune response six months post-third COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in MS patients with RR and PR forms on aCD20 therapy. Despite lower Ag+ B cell responses and lower levels of anti-SARS-CoV2, both total and neutralizing antibodies, RR and PR patients developed strong Ag+ T cell responses. We observed similar percentages and numbers of Ag+ CD4+ T cells and a high proportion of Ag+ CD8+ T cells, with slight differences in T cell phenotype and functionality; this, however, suggested the presence of differences in immune responses driven by age and disease severity.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The interleukin (IL)-1-family receptor antagonist IL-38 has emerged as a negative regulator of auto-inflammation. Given the intricate interplay between antitumor immunity and auto-inflammation, we hypothesized that blocking IL-38 may enhance tumor immune control. Methods Our hypothesis was tested in the transgenic polyoma virus middle T oncoprotein mammary carcinoma model that is suitable for identifying strong immunomodulators. To investigate the effect of acute IL-38 blockade, we used a neutralizing antibody, alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Immune cell composition and location in tumors were determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The role of γδ T cells was studied using an antibody blocking γδ T-cell receptor signaling. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing and RNA expression analysis were employed to determine mechanisms downstream of IL-38 neutralization. Additionally, in vitro assays with γδ T cells, CD8+ T cells and cDC1, followed by in vivo CD8+ T cell depletion, were performed to study the underlying mechanistic pathways. Results Both, genetic ablation of IL-38 and neutralization with the antibody, reduced tumorigenesis, and IL-38 blockade improved chemotherapy efficacy. This was accompanied by an augmented lymphocyte infiltrate dominated by γδ T cells and CD8+ T cells, and signaling through the γδ-T-cell receptor was required for CD8+ T cell infiltration. Rather than directly interacting with CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells recruited conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) into tumors via the chemokine Xcl1. cDC1 in turn activated CD8+ T cells via the Notch pathway. Moreover, IL-38 negatively correlated with cDC1, XCL1-producing γδ T cells, T-cell infiltrates and survival in patients with mammary carcinoma. Conclusions These data suggest that interfering with IL-38 improves antitumor immunity even in immunologically cold tumors.">

        <tr id="Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a significant public health problem leading to permanently disfiguring skin lesions caused by Leishmania parasites. Lesion severity stems from an excessive host inflammatory response that prevents healing. Here, we characterized the transcriptional and translational responses of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) during murine CL using historical single-cell RNA sequencing data combined with flow cytometry and in vivo puromycin incorporation to assess translational activity. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation pathways including MHC-I, MHC-II, and immunoproteasome transcripts in dermal LECs from Leishmania major-infected mice compared to naive controls. LECs also exhibited increased expression of guanylate binding proteins and interferon-inducible genes, indicative of immune activation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that LECs in leishmanial lesions displayed heightened translational activity relative to LECs from uninflamed ears, and LEC translational activity was highest in activated LECs. Furthermore, LEC translational activity exceeded that of other cell types within the lesion microenvironment. Validating the transcriptomic data, LECs in lesions expressed elevated MHC-II and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1), supporting their potential role in antigen presentation. Functional assays using DQ-OVA confirmed that LECs from leishmanial lesions efficiently uptake and process antigens, highlighting their capability as antigen presenting cells in the inflamed dermal microenvironment. Overall, our study reveals the activation status of LECs in leishmanial lesions, shedding light on their potential role in shaping local immunity and inflammation in a variety of skin diseases.">

        <tr id="The liver routinely encounters antigens from the gut, triggering pro- inflammatory responses. Unresolved inflammation can lead to liver damage, steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is influenced by various immune cells, including invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, which exhibit both innate and adaptive immunity traits. Here, we examined iNKT cell dynamics in a diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC mouse model. We observed a significant reduction in iNKT cell numbers in HCC livers due to apoptosis and impaired cytokine production. CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, displayed delayed tumor initiation and lower tumor and foci number. However, these tumors were larger in size and characterized by enhanced proliferation and immunosuppression. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of healthy iNKT cells post-tumor establishment reduced tumor burden, highlighting their potential therapeutic role. Our findings suggest that iNKT cells contribute to early HCC development, while in later stages they help to control tumor growth, thus underscoring their complex role in liver carcinogenesis. Further understanding of iNKT cell functions may inform novel immunotherapeutic strategies for HCC management.">

        <tr id="Animal models of stress and stress-related disorders are also associated with blood neutrophilia. The mechanistic relevance of this to symptoms or behavior is unclear. We used cytometry, immunohistochemistry, whole tissue clearing, and single-cell sequencing to characterize the meningeal immune response to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress in mice. We find that chronic, but not acute, stress causes meningeal neutrophil accumulation, and CSD increases neutrophil trafficking in vascular channels emanating from skull bone marrow (BM). Transcriptional analysis suggested CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils. Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protected against the anhedonic and anxiogenic effects of CSD stress, potentially through reduced infiltration of IFNAR+ neutrophils into the meninges from skull BM. Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders. One sentence summary Type I interferon sensing neutrophils accumulate in meninges of psychosocially stressed mice via skull bone marrow channels and are associated with the negative behavioral sequelae of stress; blockade of this pathway inhibits neutrophil trafficking and improves behavioral outcomes.">

        <tr id="CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key to maintain peripheral self-tolerance and suppress immune responses to tumors. Their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment (TME) correlates with poor clinical outcome in several human cancers, including breast cancer (BC). However, the properties of intratumoral Tregs remain largely unknown. Here, we found that a functionally distinct subpopulation of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, which express the Foxp3 splicing variant retaining exon 2 (Foxp3E2), is prominent in the TME and peripheral blood of hormone receptor- positive (HR+) BC subjects with poor prognosis. Notably, a comprehensive examination of the Tumor Cell Genome Atlas (TCGA) validated Foxp3E2 as an independent prognostic marker in all other BC subtypes. We found that FOXP3E2 expression underlies BCs with highly immune suppressive landscape, defective mismatch repair and a stem-like signature thus highlighting pathways involved in tumor immune evasion. Finally, we confirmed the higher immunosuppressive capacity of BC patients-derived Foxp3E2+ Tregs by functional assays. Our study suggests Foxp3E2+ Tregs might be used as an independent biomarker to predict BC prognosis and recurrence, and to develop super-targeted depletion-based immunotherapies. One-sentence summaries Foxp3E2+ Treg enrichment reflects an increased tumor-immune suppression and predicts prognosis and recurrence in breast cancer.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT T cell engagers (TCEs) are becoming an integral class of biological therapeutic owing to their highly potent ability to eradicate cancer cells. Nevertheless, the widespread utility of classical CD3-targeted TCEs has been limited by narrow therapeutic index (TI) linked to systemic CD4+ T cell activation and aberrant cytokine release. One attractive approach to circumvent the systemic activation of pan CD3+ T cells and reduce the risk of cytokine release syndrome is to redirect specific subsets of T cells. A promising strategy is the use of peptide-major histocompatibility class I bispecific antibodies (pMHC-IgGs), which have emerged as an intriguing modality of TCE, based on their ability to selectively redirect highly reactive viral-specific effector memory cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to eliminate cancer cells. However, the relatively low frequency of these effector memory cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may hamper their redirection as effector cells for clinical applications. To mitigate this potential limitation, we report here the generation of a pMHC-IgG derivative known as guided-pMHC-staging (GPS) carrying a covalent fusion of a monovalent interleukin-2 (IL-2) mutein (H16A, F42A). Using an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) arm as a proof-of-concept, tumor-associated antigen paired with a single-chain HLA-A *02:01/CMVpp65 pMHC fusion moiety, we demonstrate in vitro that the IL-2-armored GPS modality robustly expands CMVpp65-specific CD8+ effector memory T cells and induces potent cytotoxic activity against target cancer cells. Similar to GPS, IL-2-armored GPS molecules induce modulated T cell activation and reduced cytokine release profile compared to an analogous CD3-targeted TCE. In vivo we show that IL-2-armored GPS, but not the corresponding GPS, effectively expands grafted CMVpp65 CD8+ T cells from unstimulated human PBMCs in an NSG mouse model. Lastly, we demonstrate that the IL-2-armored GPS modality exhibits a favorable developability profile and monoclonal antibody-like pharmacokinetic properties in human neonatal Fc receptor transgenic mice. Overall, IL-2-armored GPS represents an attractive approach for treating cancer with the potential for inducing vaccine-like antiviral T cell expansion, immune cell redirection as a TCE, and significantly widened TI due to reduced cytokine release.">

However, the importance of this spatial compartmentalization for BM responses to inflammation and neoplasia remains largely unknown. Here, we extensively validate a combination of scRNA-seq profiling and matching flow cytometry isolation that reproducibly identifies 7 key CM and Endo populations across mouse strains and accurately surveys both niche locations. We demonstrate that different perturbations exert specific effects on different compartments, with type I interferon responses causing CM mesenchymal stromal cells to adopt an inflammatory phenotype associated with overproduction of chemokines modulating local monocyte dynamics in the surrounding microenvironment. Our results provide a comprehensive method for molecular and functional stromal characterization and highlight the importance of altered stomal cell activity in regulating hematopoietic responses to inflammatory challenges.">

        <tr id="In central nervous system (CNS) diseases characterized by late-onset neurodegeneration, the interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses remains poorly understood. This knowledge gap is amplified by the prolonged nature of these diseases, complicating the delineation of brain-resident and infiltrating cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive profiling of innate and adaptive immune cells across various CNS regions in a murine model of spastic paraplegia 15 (SPG15), a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Using fate-mapping of bone marrow-derived cells via genetic labeling, we identified microgliosis and microglial MHC-II upregulation accompanied by infiltration and local expansion of T cells in the CNS of Spg15-/- mice. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells across CNS regions occurring prior to neuronal loss. Analysis of potential cell-cell communication pathways suggested bidirectional interactions between DAM and effector CD8+ T cells potentially contributing to disease progression in Spg15-/- mice. In summary, we identified a shift in microglial phenotypes associated with recruitment and clonal expansion of T cells as a new characteristic of Spg15-driven neuropathology. Targeting activated microglia, CD8+ T cells and their communication represent promising avenues to prevent the loss of neuronal function in HSP.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial in initiating and shaping both innate and adaptive immune responses. Clinical studies and experimental models have highlighted their significant involvement in various autoimmune diseases, positioning them as promising therapeutic targets. Nicotinamide (NAM), a form of vitamin B3, with its anti-inflammatory properties, has been suggested, while the involvement of NAM in DCs regulation remains elusive. Here, through analyzing publicly available databases, we observe substantial alterations in NAM levels and NAM metabolic pathways during DCs activation. Furthermore, we discover that NAM, but not Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN), significantly inhibits DCs over-activation in vitro and in vivo. The suppression of DCs hyperactivation effectively alleviates symptoms of psoriasis. Mechanistically, NAM impairs DCs activation through a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs)-NF-κB dependent manner. Notably, phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) and PARPs are significantly upregulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated DCs and psoriasis patients; elevated NAMPT and PARPs expression in psoriasis patients correlates with higher psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) scores. In summary, our findings underscore the pivotal role of NAM in modulating DCs functions and autoimmune disorders. Targeting the NAMPT-PARP axis emerges as a promising therapeutic approach for DC-related diseases.">

        <tr id="Understanding the initiation of T-helper (Th)-2 immunity is crucial for addressing allergic diseases that have been linked to the commensal microbiota. However, Th2 responses are notably absent from known host-microbiota intestinal immune circuits. Notably, the commensal protist Tritrichomonas induces a transient innate ILC2 circuit rather than a chronic Th2 circuit. Canonical Th2 responses rely on the induction of IL-4 production by innate cells. This study shows that the absence of Tet2, a DNA demethylase, reprograms naïve T cells to autonomously produce IL-4 upon T cell receptor stimulation, bypassing the need for IL-4 from innate cells for Th2 differentiation. Loss of this checkpoint induces chronic Th2 responses to Tritrichomonas, associated with IL-25-dependent barrier dysfunction and increased susceptibility to allergic pathology in response to dietary antigens.

        <tr id="Background Viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) can reduce severity of subsequent LRTIs but have also been linked to respiratory allergy development and exacerbation. Here, we show that viral LRTI can imprint lung epithelial cells (LECs), leading to long-term phenotypic and functional changes in their response to subsequent challenges. Methods Mice were infected via intranasal administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). After 28 days, LECs were isolated using cold dispase digestion followed by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Epigenetic changes were assessed using CUT&RUN, while transcriptional changes were evaluated using NanoString and qPCR. Flow cytometry was employed to measure cell surface MHC levels, antigen uptake and processing rates, and OT-I proliferation. Results We identified epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in murine LECs 28 days post respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection after recovery in genes associated with major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). Lasting upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II was further increased following in vivo LPS stimulation. Importantly, MHC upregulation was associated with increased antigen uptake and processing, as well as increased antigen presentation to T cells. Conclusions Our data suggest that LRTI can induce long-term upregulation of antigen-presentation by LECs, thus facilitating local T cell responses to microbial antigens and allergens, potentially enhancing immunity or in susceptible hosts respiratory allergy.">

        <tr id="Modest response rates to immunotherapy observed in advanced lung cancer patients underscore the need to identify reliable biomarkers and targets, enhancing both treatment decision-making and efficacy. Factors such as PD-L1 expression, tumor mutation burden, and a ‘hot’ tumor microenvironment with heightened effector T cell infiltration have consistently been associated with positive responses. In contrast, the predictive role of the abundantly present tumor-infiltrating myeloid cell (TIMs) fraction remains somewhat uncertain, partly explained by their towering variety in terms of ontogeny, phenotype, location, and function. Nevertheless, numerous preclinical and clinical studies established a clear link between lung cancer progression and alterations in intra- and extramedullary hematopoiesis, leading to emergency myelopoiesis at the expense of megakaryocyte/erythroid and lymphoid differentiation. These observations affirm that a continuous crosstalk between solid cancers such as lung cancer and the bone marrow niche (BMN) must take place. However, the BMN, encompassing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, differentiated immune and stromal cells, remains inadequately explored in solid cancer patients. Subsequently, no clear consensus has been reached on the exact breadth of tumor installed hematopoiesis perturbing cues nor their predictive power for immunotherapy. As the current era of single-cell omics is reshaping our understanding of the hematopoietic process and the subcluster landscape of lung TIMs, we aim to present an updated overview of the hierarchical differentiation process of TIMs within the BMN of solid cancer bearing subjects. Our comprehensive overview underscores that lung cancer should be regarded as a systemic disease in which the cues governing the lung tumor-BMN crosstalk might bolster the definition of new biomarkers and druggable targets, potentially mitigating the high attrition rate of leading immunotherapies for NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immunotherapies for malignant melanoma are challenged by the resistance developed in a significant proportion of patients. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), with their ability to inhibit antitumor T-cell responses, are a major contributor to immunosuppression and resistance to immune checkpoint therapies in melanoma. Damage-associated molecular patterns S100A8, S100A9, and HMGB1, acting as toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) ligands, are highly expressed in the tumor microenvironment and drive MDSC activation. However, the role of TLR4 and RAGE signaling in the acquisition of MDSC immunosuppressive properties remains to be better defined. Our study investigates how the signaling via TLR4 and RAGE as well as their ligands S100A9 and HMGB1, shape MDSC-mediated immunosuppression in melanoma. Methods MDSC were isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with advanced melanoma or generated in vitro from healthy donor-derived monocytes. Monocytes were treated with S100A9 or HMGB1 for 72 hours. The immunosuppressive capacity of treated monocytes was assessed in the inhibition of T-cell proliferation assay in the presence or absence of TLR4 and RAGE inhibitors. Plasma levels of S100A8/9 and HMGB1 were quantified by ELISA. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on monocytes from patients with melanoma and healthy donors. Results We showed that exposure to S100A9 and HMGB1 converted healthy donor-derived monocytes into MDSC through TLR4 signaling. Our scRNA-seq data revealed in patient monocytes enriched inflammatory genes, including S100 and those involved in NF-κB and TLR4 signaling, and a reduced major histocompatibility complex II gene expression. Furthermore, elevated plasma S100A8/9 levels correlated with shorter progression-free survival in patients with melanoma. Conclusions These findings highlight the critical role of TLR4 and, to a lesser extent, RAGE signaling in the conversion of monocytes into MDSC-like cells, underscore the potential of targeting S100A9 to prevent this conversion, and highlight the prognostic value of S100A8/9 as a plasma biomarker in melanoma.">

        <tr id="Introduction Biological processes such as aging, carcinogenesis, and immune response rely on the ability to maintain or rapidly expand cell populations. The fitness of the involved cells is constrained by their replicative potential, which is reflected in the cellular telomere content. Method We apply TelomereHunter to scATAC-seq data to determine telomere content on single-cell level, in a hematopoietic dataset consisting of 35,139 cells from samples of basal cell carcinoma patients receiving programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade treatment. Integrating information from open-chromatin-based signatures to assess cell identity, we characterize the heterogeneity of telomere length for individual cell populations pre- and post-immunotherapy. Results The extracted telomeric reads reflect the expected telomereome-to-genome fraction. Telomere content distributions differ significantly between cell populations, and the median telomere content in intermediate and terminal exhausted CD8+ T-cells pre-treatment is significantly correlated to response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Likewise, telomere content correlates with post-treatment cell proliferation in terminally exhausted and T follicular helper cells from responding patients. Conclusion Telomere content measurement from scATAC-seq data has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to detect significant differences between cell types. Furthermore, the telomere content of CD8+ exhausted T-cells pre-treatment is a putative biomarker for successful PD-1-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Currently, there are no effective therapies for glioblastoma. Infiltrating myeloid cells contributes significantly to the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment that is characteristic of GBM. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells are chief immune suppressive cells found in the glioma microenvironment. Understanding the mechanisms of M-MDSC differentiation and T-cell suppression is imperative for generating therapies that target this tumor-supportive cell population. In this study, we found that glioma-secreted CSF1R ligands, M-CSF and IL-34, promote M-MDSCs to suppress CD8 T cells. These M-MDSCs partially utilize nitric oxide synthase to illicit their suppressive activity. However, spatial RNAseq points to glioma microenvironment niches driving M-MDSC heterogeneity. Our findings identify key regulators of differentiation and suppressive mechanisms of M-MDSCs and confirm the importance of targeting this cell population in glioma. Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, resulting in poor survival despite aggressive therapies. GBM is characterized by a highly heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) made up predominantly of infiltrating peripheral immune cells. One significant immune cell type that contributes to glioma immune evasion is a population of immunosuppressive cells, termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Previous studies suggest that a subset of myeloid cells, expressing monocytic (M)-MDSC markers and dual expression of chemokine receptors CCR2 and CX3CR1, utilize CCR2 to infiltrate the TME. This study evaluated the mechanism of CCR2+/CX3CR1+ M-MDSC differentiation and T cell suppressive function in murine glioma models. We determined that bone marrow-derived CCR2+/CX3CR1+ cells adopt an immune suppressive cell phenotype when cultured with glioma-derived factors. Glioma-secreted CSF1R ligands M-CSF and IL-34 were identified as key drivers of M-MDSC differentiation while adenosine and iNOS pathways were implicated in the M-MDSC suppression of T cells. Mining a human GBM spatial RNAseq database revealed a variety of different pathways that M-MDSCs utilize to exert their suppressive function that is driven by complex niches within the microenvironment. These data provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of M-MDSCs in glioblastoma.">

Immune cells are reported to upregulate CD47 during infection, however, the role of CD47 in innate and adaptive immune cells remains unclear.


METHODS
To bridge this knowledge gap, we analysed our single cell (sc)-RNA dataset along with other publicly available sc-RNA datasets from healthy controls, people with HIV-1 (PWH) and COVID-19 patients. We characterized each immune cell based on low, intermediate, and high expression of CD47 .


RESULTS
Our analyses revealed that CD47 high pDCs and monocytes exhibited relatively higher expression of IFN-α regulatory genes, antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and MHC-I associated genes compared to CD47 inter. and CD47 low cells. Furthermore, CD47 high NK and CD8+ T cells showed higher expression of antiviral ISGs, as well as genes encoding for cytotoxic markers like granzyme B, perforin, granulysin, interferon gamma and NKG7. Additionally, CD47 high CD8+ T cells expressed higher levels of PD-1 and LAG-3 genes. Lastly, we found that CD47 high B cells had enriched expression of genes involved in cell activation and humoral responses.


CONCLUSION
Overall, our analyses revealed that innate and adaptive immune cells expressing elevated activation and functional gene signatures also express higher CD47 levels.">

        <tr id="Macrolide antibiotic azithromycin is widely used in clinical practice to treat respiratory tract infections and inflammatory diseases. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Given the involvement of the CD27 pathway in the pathophysiology of various T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory, autoimmune, and lymphoproliferative diseases, we examined the impact of AZM on CD27 regulation and potential consequences on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell phenotypes. Using cellular immunology approaches on healthy donors’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we demonstrate AZM-mediated downregulation of surface CD27 expression as well as its extracellular release as soluble CD27. Notably, AZM-exposed CD27high (hi) cells were defective in their ability to expand compared to CD27intermediate (Int) and CD27low (lo) subsets. The defective CD27hi subset expansion was found to be associated with impaired cell proliferation and cell division. At the molecular level, the CD27hi subset exhibited lower mTOR activity than other subsets. Functionally, AZM treatment resulted in marked depletion of helper CD4+ (Th1) and cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte (Tc1)-associated CXCR3+CD27hi effector cells and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ production. These findings provide mechanistic insights on immunomodulatory features of AZM on T-lymphocyte by altering the CD27 pathway. From a clinical perspective, this study also sheds light on potential clinical benefits observed in patients on prophylactic AZM regimens against various respiratory diseases and opens avenues for future adjunct therapy against Th1- and Tc1-dominated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="The role of Erythroid cells in immune regulation and immunosuppression is one of the emerging topics in modern immunology that still requires further clarification as Erythroid cells from different tissues and different species express different immunoregulatory molecules. In this study, we performed a thorough investigation of human bone marrow Erythroid cells from adult healthy donors and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients using the state-of-the-art single-cell targeted proteomics and transcriptomics via BD Rhapsody and cancer-related gene copy number variation analysis via NanoString Sprint Profiler. We found that human bone marrow Erythroid cells express the ARG1, LGALS1, LGALS3, LGALS9, and C10orf54 (VISTA) immunosuppressive genes, CXCL5, CXCL8, and VEGFA cytokine genes, as well as the genes involved in antimicrobial immunity and MHC Class II antigen presentation. We also found that ARG1 gene expression was restricted to the single erythroid cell cluster that we termed ARG1-positive Orthochromatic erythroblasts and that late Erythroid cells lose S100A9 and gain MZB1 gene expression in case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These findings show that steady-state erythropoiesis bone marrow Erythroid cells express myeloid signature genes even without any transdifferentiating stimulus like cancer.">

        <tr id="The continuous threats posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, including the emergence of potentially more infectious and deadly variants, necessitate ongoing studies to uncover novel and detailed mechanisms driving disease severity. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we conducted a secondary data analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients of varying severities and healthy controls to comprehensively examine immune responses. We observed significant immune cell alterations correlating with disease severity. In severe cases, macrophages showed upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes TNFα and IL1β, contributing to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Neutrophils exhibited increased activation, marked by S100A8, CXCL8, and IL1β expression, with extended viability and reduced phagocytosis. Genes such as MCL1 and HIF1α supported extended viability, while MSR1 and MRC1 indicated reduced phagocytosis. Enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and reduced clearance, indicated by NET-associated markers, were linked to thrombo-inflammation and organ damage. Both macrophages and neutrophils in severe cases showed impaired efferocytosis, indicated by decreased expression of MSR1 and TREM2 in macrophages and downregulation of FCGR3B in neutrophils, leading to the accumulation of apoptotic cells and exacerbating inflammation. Severe cases were characterized by M1 macrophages with high TNFα and IL1β, while milder cases had M2 macrophages with elevated PPARγ. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs) increased significantly in severe cases, showing higher CXCR4 and CD274 and lower FCGR3B compared to high-density neutrophils (HDNs). NK and T cells in severe cases demonstrated altered receptor and gene expression, with increased activation markers IFNγ and ISG15, suggesting a paradoxical state of activation and exhaustion. This imbalance suggests a potential mechanism for immune dysregulation and ineffective antiviral responses in severe COVID-19. This analysis highlights the critical role of dysregulated neutrophil, macrophage, NK, and T cell responses in severe COVID-19, identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing novel insights into the disease. Author Summary Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, poses continuous health threats due to emerging, potentially more infectious and deadly variants. We used single-cell gene analysis from lung fluid samples, known as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), from COVID-19 patients to understand why some cases become more severe than others. In severe cases, immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils showed higher levels of genes that trigger inflammation and cause damage to the body. These cells were more active and lived longer but were less capable of clearing away dead cells and debris, leading to prolonged inflammation. Severe cases also had more neutrophils that were less effective in fighting infections. Another type of immune cell, NK and T cells, showed changes indicating an ineffective response to the virus, with signals that were not properly coordinated to fight the infection. This imbalance in the immune response can lead to severe inflammation and organ damage. Our findings highlight potential targets for treatments to help manage severe COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes. Understanding these immune cell behaviors through single-cell gene analysis could guide the development of new therapies and improve strategies for treating severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Introduction Pediatric patients with unexplained bone marrow failure (BMF) are often categorized as aplastic anemia (AA). Based on the accepted hypothesis of an auto-immune mechanism underlying AA, immune suppressive therapy (IST) might be effective. However, due to the lack of diagnostic tools to identify immune AA and prognostic markers to predict IST response together with the unequaled curative potential of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), most pediatric severe AA patients are momentarily treated by HSCT if available. Although several studies indicate oligoclonal T-cells with cytotoxic activities towards the hematopoietic stem cells, increasing evidence points towards defective inhibitory mechanisms failing to inhibit auto-reactive T-cells. Methods We aimed to investigate the role of NK- and B-cells in seven pediatric AA patients through a comprehensive analysis of paired bone marrow and peripheral blood samples with spectral flow cytometry in comparison to healthy age-matched bone marrow donors. Results We observed a reduced absolute number of NK-cells in peripheral blood of AA patients with a skewed distribution towards CD56bright NK-cells in a subgroup of patients. The enriched CD56bright NK-cells had a lower expression of CD45RA and TIGIT and a higher expression of CD16, compared to healthy donors. Functional analysis revealed no differences in degranulation. However, IFN-γ production and perforin expression of NK-cells were reduced in the CD56bright-enriched patient group. The diminished NK-cell function in this subgroup might underly the auto-immunity. Importantly, NK-function of AA patients with reduced CD56bright NK-cells was comparable to healthy donors. Also, B-cell counts were lower in AA patients. Subset analysis revealed a trend towards reduction of transitional B-cells in both absolute and relative numbers compared to healthy controls. As these cells were previously hypothesized as regulatory cells in AA, decreased numbers might be involved in defective inhibition of auto-reactive T-cells. Interestingly, even in patients with normal distribution of precursor B-cells, the transitional compartment was reduced, indicating partial differentiation failure from immature to transitional B-cells or a selective loss. Discussion Our findings provide a base for future studies to unravel the role of transitional B-cells and CD56bright NK-cells in larger cohorts of pediatric AA patients as diagnostic markers for immune AA and targets for therapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Cancer can create a shield of suppressive innate immune cells that stop our body’s natural defenses from tumors. VTX-0811 is a new drug that targets these cells and turns them from allies of cancer to fighters against it. Preclinical tests show that it works in the lab on human cells and tumors and is safe and efficacious in animals. The results are promising and pave the way for human trials to see if VTX-0811 can become a new powerful weapon against cancer. Abstract Omnipresent suppressive myeloid populations in the tumor microenvironment limit the efficacy of T-cell-directed immunotherapies, become more inhibitory after administration of T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, and are overall associated with worse survival of cancer patients. In early clinical trials, positive outcomes have been demonstrated for therapies aimed at repolarizing suppressive myeloid populations in the tumor microenvironment. We have previously described the key role of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) in maintaining an inhibitory state of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), most of which express high levels of PSGL-1. Here we describe a novel, first-in-class humanized high-affinity monoclonal antibody VTX-0811 that repolarizes human macrophages from an M2-suppressive phenotype towards an M1 inflammatory phenotype, similar to siRNA-mediated knockdown of PSGL-1. VTX-0811 binds to PSGL-1 of human and cynomolgus macaque origins without inhibiting PSGL-1 interaction with P- and L-Selectins or VISTA. In multi-cellular assays and in patient-derived human tumor cultures, VTX-0811 leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators. RNAseq data from VTX-0811 treated ex vivo tumor cultures and M2c macrophages show similar pathways being modulated, indicating that the mechanism of action translates from isolated macrophages to tumors. A chimeric version of VTX-0811, consisting of the parental murine antibody in a human IgG4 backbone, inhibits tumor growth in a humanized mouse model of cancer.

        <tr id="Biliary atresia (BA) is a leading cause of liver failure in infants. Despite effective surgical drainage, patients with BA exhibit attenuated immune responses to childhood vaccines, suggesting there are long-lasting alterations to immune function. The perinatal liver is home to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and serves as the epicenter for rapidly progressive and significantly morbid inflammatory diseases like BA. We have previously established the role of neonatal myeloid progenitors in the pathogenesis of perinatal liver inflammation (PLI) and hypothesize that PLI leads to long-term changes to HSPCs in mice that recovered from PLI. To test this hypothesis, we compared the changes that occur to HSPCs and mature myeloid populations in the bone marrow of adult mice during homeostasis and during PLI. Our results demonstrate that HSPCs from animals that recover from PLI (“PLI-recovered”) undergo long-term expansion with a reduced proliferative capacity. Notably, PLI leads to persistent activation of common myeloid progenitors through the involvement of CXCL10 and its canonical receptor, CXCR3. Our data suggests that the CXCR3-CXCL10 axis may mediate the changes in HSPCs that lead to altered immune function observed in BA, providing support for a targetable pathway to mitigate the detrimental long-term immune effects observed in patients with BA.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells often become dysfunctional during tumor progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain unclear. To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs.">

        <tr id="How group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) regulate mucosal protection in the presence of T cells remains poorly understood. Here, we examined ILC3 function in intestinal immunity using ILC3-deficient mice that maintain endogenous T cells, T helper 17 (TH17) cells, and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were dispensable for generation of TH17 and TH22 cell responses to commensal and pathogenic bacteria, and absence of ILC3s did not affect IL-22 production by CD4 T cells before or during infection. However, despite the presence of IL-22–producing T cells, ILC3s and ILC3-derived IL-22 were required for maintaining homeostatic functions of the intestinal epithelium. T cell–sufficient, ILC3-deficient mice were capable of pathogen clearance and survived infection with a low dose of Citrobacter rodentium. However, ILC3s promoted pathogen tolerance at early time points of infection by activating tissue-protective immune pathways. Consequently, ILC3s were indispensable for survival after high-dose infection. Our results demonstrate a context-dependent role for ILC3s in immune-sufficient animals and provide a blueprint for uncoupling of ILC3 and TH17 cell functions. In T cell–sufficient mice, ILC3s are required for mucosal protection from high-dose but not low-dose bacterial infection. Editor’s summary Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) contribute to intestinal homeostasis and immunity against gut pathogens. Distinguishing the functions of ILC3s from those of T helper 17 (TH17) cells has remained challenging because of similar transcription factor dependencies and cytokine production profiles. To better define ILC3-specific roles, Araujo et al. developed genetically engineered mice that lack ILC3s while retaining endogenous T cells and secondary lymphoid organs. ILC3s were the primary producers of IL-22, which was required for the maintenance of intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. Whereas TH17 cells were sufficient to protect against low-dose Citrobacter rodentium infection, ILC3s provided early protection and were required for survival after high-dose infection. Together, these findings identify nonredundant functions of ILC3s in mucosal homeostasis and immunity. —Claire Olingy">

Several studies support the idea that innate immunity, through the release of pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines and tumor growth factors, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma (MM). Cutaneous melanoma is the most common skin cancer, with an incidence that rapidly increased in recent decades. Melanoma is a highly immunogenic tumor, due to its high mutational burden. The metastatic form retains a high mortality. The advent of immunotherapy revolutionized the therapeutic approach to this tumor and significantly ameliorated the patients’ clinical outcome.

        <tr id="Ionizing radiation exposure can cause damage to diverse tissues and organs, with the hematopoietic system being the most sensitive. However, limited information is available regarding the radiosensitivity of various hematopoietic cell populations in the bone marrow due to the high heterogeneity of the hematopoietic system. In this study, we observed that granulocyte–macrophage progenitors, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and B cells within the bone marrow showed the highest sensitivity, exhibiting a rapid decrease in cell numbers following irradiation. Nonetheless, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and dendritic cells demonstrated a certain degree of radioresistance, with neutrophils exhibiting the most pronounced resistance. By employing single-cell transcriptome sequencing, we investigated the early responsive genes in various cell types following irradiation, revealing that distinct gene expression profiles emerged between radiosensitive and radioresistant cells. In B cells, radiation exposure led to a specific upregulation of genes associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, suggesting a connection between these complexes and cell radiosensitivity. In neutrophils, radiation exposure resulted in fewer gene alterations, indicating their potential for distinct mechanisms in radiation resistance. Collectively, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanism for the heterogeneity of radiosensitivity among the various bone marrow hematopoietic cell populations.">

Despite the spectacular efficacy of Ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), resistance can develop in CLL patients, and alternative therapeutic strategies are therefore required. Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care and may be an attractive approach in this context. We speculated that characterizing the immune responses of CLL patients may highlight putative immunotherapeutic targets. Here, we used high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry to compare the distribution and phenotype of non-B-cell immune populations in the circulating blood of CLL patients treated with Ibrutinib displaying a complete response or secondary progression. Although no drastic changes were observed in the composition of their immune subsets, the Ibrutinib-resistant group showed increased cycling of CD8+ T cells, leading to their overabundance at the expense of dendritic cells. In addition, the expression of 11 different surface checkpoints was similar regardless of response status. Together, this suggests that CLL relapse upon Ibrutinib treatment may not lead to major alterations in the peripheral immune response.">

        <tr id="Aberrant activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway causes autoimmunity in humans and mice; however, the exact mechanism by which the cGAS-STING pathway initiates adaptive immunity and tissue pathology is still not fully understood. Here, we used a cGAS knockin (KI) mouse model that develops systemic autoimmunity. In the lungs of cGAS-KI mice, blood vessels were enclosed by organized lymphoid tissues that resemble tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). Cell-intrinsic cGAS induction promoted up-regulation of CCR5 in CD8+ T cells and led to CCL5 production in vascular endothelial cells. Peripheral CD8+ T cells were recruited to the lungs and produced CXCL13 and interferon-γ. The latter triggered endothelial cell death, potentiated CCL5 production, and was essential for TLS establishment. Blocking CCL5 or CCR5, or depleting CD8+ T cells, impaired TLS formation. cGAS-mediated TLS formation also enhanced humoral and antitumor responses. These data demonstrate that cGAS signaling drives a specialized lymphoid structure that underlies autoimmune tissue pathology. cGAS initiates pulmonary TLS formation, which is dependent on the CCL5-CCR5 axis between endothelial cells and T cells. Editor’s summary Overactivation of the innate immune sensing cGAS-STING pathway can lead to inflammation and autoimmunity. To investigate how cGAS hyperactivation drives lung inflammation, Zhao et al. generated a cGAS conditional knockin mouse model. Hyperactivation of cGAS resulted in the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in the lung, which enhanced antibody responses and antitumor immunity. CCL5-producing endothelial cells in the lung promoted CD8+ T cell recruitment to TLSs via CCR5 signaling, which was induced by T cell–intrinsic cGAS expression. Blocking CCR5/CCL5 impaired TLS formation, suggesting that CCR5/CCL5 could be targeted therapeutically to treat autoimmunity or to enhance antitumor immunity. —Hannah Isles">

        <tr id="Abstract Myeloid malignancies arise in bone marrow microenvironments and shape these microenvironments in favor of malignant development. Immune suppression is one of the most important stages in myeloid leukemia progression. Leukemic clone expansion and immune dysregulation occur simultaneously in bone marrow microenvironments. Complex interactions emerge between normal immune system elements and leukemic clones in the bone marrow. In recent years, researchers have identified several of these pathological interactions. For instance, recent works shows that the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), from bone marrow stromal cells contributes to immune dysregulation and the selective proliferation of JAK2V617F+ clones in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Moreover, inflammasome activation and sterile inflammation result in inflamed microenvironments and the development of myelodysplastic syndromes. Additional immune dysregulations, such as exhaustion of T and NK cells, an increase in regulatory T cells, and impairments in antigen presentation are common findings in myeloid malignancies. In this review, we discuss the role of altered bone marrow microenvironments in the induction of immune dysregulations that accompany myeloid malignancies. We also consider both current and novel therapeutic strategies to restore normal immune system function in the context of myeloid malignancies.">

        <tr id="Background: Large granular lymphocyte leukemias (LGLLs) are rare lymphoproliferative malignancies caused by clonal expansion of granular lymphocytes. T-cell LGLL and natural killer (NK) cell LGLL are defined based on their cellular origin. Their clinical manifestation and pathophysiology vary depending on the subtype and include, e.g., neutropenia, anemia, recurrent infections, and autoimmunity. A limited number of available patient-derived cell lines are considered valuable tools to study the biology of these malignancies. They differ in the expression of lineage-specific surface markers, but generally contain cytotoxic effector molecules in characteristic granules. Methods: We investigated the presence and release of lysosome-associated effector proteins in patient-derived LGLL cell lines by flow and imaging cytometry, by Western blotting and by bottom–up proteomics profiling. Results: The tested cell lines did not express FasL (CD178), but did express CD26/DPP4+. Intracellularly, we detected major differences in the abundance and subcellular distribution of granzymes, perforin, and granulysin. Similar differences were seen in enriched lysosome-related effector vesicles (LREVs). The proteomics profiling of enriched EVs from an NK-LGLL line (NKL) and a T-LGLL line (MOTN-1), confirmed individual profiles of effector molecules. Conclusion: Our analyses underscore the individual distribution of effector proteins but also open new routes to define the role of intra- and extracellular granules in the disease manifestation or pathology of LGLLs.">

Further phenotypical analysis confirmed the granulocytic-like features of this monocyte subpopulation that is associated with an increase in granulocyte–monocyte precursors (GMPs) in the PB of these patients (pts). Mechanistically, this granulocyte-like monocyte population suppressed NK cell activity by inducing TIGIT and engaging NKp30. Accordingly, an increased frequency of TIGIT+ NK cells with impaired functions was found in both the PB and tumoral tissue of CRC pts.

        <tr id="Adaptation to existence outside the womb is a key event in the life of a mammal. The absence of macrophages in rats with a homozygous mutation in the Csf1r gene (Csf1rko) severely compromises pre-weaning somatic growth and maturation of organ function. Transfer of wild-type bone marrow cells (BMT) at weaning rescues tissue macrophage populations permitting normal development and long-term survival. To dissect the phenotype and function of macrophages in postnatal development, we generated transcriptomic profiles of all major organs of wild-type and Csf1rko rats at weaning and selected organs following rescue by BMT. The transcriptomic profiles revealed subtle effects of macrophage deficiency on development of all major organs. Network analysis revealed a common signature of CSF1R-dependent resident tissue macrophages that includes the components of complement C1Q (C1qa/b/c genes). Circulating C1Q was almost undetectable in Csf1rko rats and rapidly restored to normal levels following BMT. Tissue-specific macrophage signatures were also identified, notably including sinus macrophage populations in the lymph nodes. Their loss in Csf1rko rats was confirmed by immunohistochemical localisation of CD209B (SIGNR1). By 6-12 weeks, Csf1rko rats succumb to emphysema-like pathology associated with the selective loss of interstitial macrophages and granulocytosis. This pathology was reversed by BMT. Along with physiological rescue, BMT precisely regenerated the abundance and expression profiles of resident macrophages. The exception was the brain, where BM-derived microglia-like cells had a distinct expression profile compared to resident microglia. In addition, the transferred BM failed to restore blood monocyte or CSF1R-positive bone marrow progenitors. These studies provide a model for the pathology and treatment of CSF1R mutations in humans and the innate immune deficiency associated with prematurity.">

        <tr id="During activation the T cell transmembrane receptor CD6 becomes incorporated into the T cell immunological synapse where it can exert both co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory functions. Given the ability of CD6 to carry out opposing functions, this study sought to determine how CD6 regulates early T cell activation in response to viral infection. Infection of CD6 deficient mice with a neurotropic murine coronavirus resulted in greater activation and expansion of CD4 T cells in the draining lymph nodes. Further analysis demonstrated that there was also preferential differentiation of CD4 T cells into T follicular helper cells, resulting in accelerated germinal center responses and emergence of high affinity virus specific antibodies. Given that CD6 conversely supports CD4 T cell activation in many autoimmune models, we probed potential mechanisms of CD6 mediated suppression of CD4 T cell activation during viral infection. Analysis of CD6 binding proteins revealed that infection induced upregulation of Ubash3a, a negative regulator of T cell receptor signaling, was hindered in CD6 deficient lymph nodes. Consistent with greater T cell activation and reduced UBASH3a activity, the T cell receptor signal strength was intensified in CD6 deficient CD4 T cells. These results reveal a novel immunoregulatory role for CD6 in limiting CD4 T cell activation and deterring CD4 T follicular helper cell differentiation, thereby attenuating antiviral humoral immunity. Importance CD6 monoclonal blocking antibodies are being therapeutically administered to inhibit T cell activation in autoimmune disorders. However, the multifaceted nature of CD6 allows for multiple and even opposing functions under different circumstances of T cell activation. We therefore sought to characterize how CD6 regulates T cell activation in the context viral infections using an in vivo murine coronavirus model. In contrast to its role in autoimmunity, but consistent with its function in the presence of superantigens, we found that CD6 deficiency enhances CD4 T cell activation and CD4 T cell help to germinal center dependent antiviral humoral responses. Finally, we provide evidence that CD6 regulates transcription of its intracellular binding partner UBASH3a, which suppresses T cell receptor signaling and consequently T cell activation. These findings highlight the context dependent flexibility of CD6 in regulating in vivo adaptive immune responses, which may be targeted to enhance anti-viral immunity.">

        <tr id="TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a member of the IKK family and plays a crucial role in the activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling and type I interferon responses. The aberrant activation of TBK1 contributes to the proliferation and survival of various types of tumor cells, particularly in specific mutational or tumorous contexts. Inhibitors targeting TBK1 are under development and application in both in vivo and in vitro settings, yet their clinical efficacy remains limited. Numerous literatures have shown that TBK1 can exhibit both tumor promoting and tumor inhibiting effects. TBK1 acts as a pivotal node within the innate immune pathway, mediating anti-tumor immunity through the activation of innate immune responses. Facilitating interferon-I (IFN-I) production represents a critical mechanism through which TBK1 bridges these processes. IFN has been shown to exert both beneficial and detrimental effects on tumor progression. Hence, the paradoxical role of TBK1 in tumor development may necessitate acknowledgment in light of its downstream IFN-I signaling cascade. In this paper, we review the signaling pathways mediated by TBK1 in various tumor contexts and summarize the dual roles of TBK1 and the TBK1-IFN pathways in both promoting and inhibiting tumor progression. Additionally, we highlight the significance of the TBK1-IFN pathway in clinical therapy, particularly in the context of immune response. We anticipate further advancements in the development of TBK1 inhibitors as part of novel cancer treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Concurrent KRAS LKB1 (STK11, KL) mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers (NSCLC) is particularly difficult to treat and does not respond well to current immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. This is due to numerous mechanisms including low antigen presentation limiting T cell mediated killing. To activate anti-tumor immunity, we targeted tumor cell – natural killer (NK) cell interactions. We tested whether a novel antibody based therapeutic strategy that predominantly activates natural killer (NK) cells demonstrates efficacy in pre-clinical mouse models of KL NSCLC. NK cells rely on binding of ligands, such as Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I-related chain A or B (MICA/B), to the activating receptor NKG2D. Importantly MICA and MICB are widely expressed in elevated levels across NSCLC subtypes including KL lung cancers. Proteases with the tumor microenvironment (TME) can cleave these proteins rendering tumor cells less visible to NK cells. We therefore developed a MICA monoclonal antibody, AHA-1031, which utilizes two NK cell activating receptors. AHA1031 prevents ligand shedding without interfering with binding to NKG2D while targeting cancer cells to antibody mediated cell dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our therapeutic novel antibody has significant monotherapy activity in KL cancer models including xenografts of human cell lines and patient derived xenografts. Activating NK cells through MICA/B stabilization and inducing ADCC offers an alternative and potent therapy option in KL tumors. MICA/B are shed across different tumors making this therapeutic strategy universally applicable.">

        <tr id="Immune-surveillance depends in part on the recognition of peptide variants by T cell antigen receptors. Given that both normal B cells and malignant B cells accumulate mutations we chose a murine model of multiple myeloma to test conditions to induce cell-mediated immunity targeting malignant plasma cell (PC) clones but sparing of normal PCs. Revealing a novel function for intracellular C3d, we discovered that C3d engaged T cell responses against malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow of mice that had developed multiple myeloma spontaneously. Our results show that C3d internalized by cells augments immune surveillance by several mechanisms. In one, C3d induces a master transcription regulator, E2f1, to increase the expression of long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, to generate peptides for MHC-I presentation and increase MHC-I expression. In another, C3d increases expression of RNAs encoding ribosomal proteins linked to processing of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) that arise from non-canonical translation and known to promote immunosurveillance. Cancer cells are uniquely susceptible to increased expression and presentation of mutant peptides given the extent of protein misfolding and accumulation of somatic mutations. Accordingly, although C3d can be internalized by any cell, C3d preferentially targets malignant clones by evoking specific T cell mediated immunity (CMI) and sparing most non-transformed polyclonal B cells and plasma cells with lower mutation loads. Malignant plasma cell deletion was blocked by cyclosporin or by CD8 depletion confirming that endogenous T cells mediated malignant clone clearance. Besides the potential for therapeutic application our results highlight how intracellular C3d modifies cellular metabolism to augment immune surveillance. One Sentence Summary We show that intracellular soluble fragment 3d of complement (C3d) induces regression of spontaneous multiple myeloma in mice reducing tumor burden by 10 fold, after 8 weeks. C3d enables cell-mediated immunity to target multiple myeloma clones sparing non-transformed polyclonal B cells and plasma cells with lower mutation loads. We show that C3d increases the expression of ribosomal subunits associated with the translation of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). C3d also decreases expression of protein arginine methyl transferase (PRMT) 5 which in turn relieves E2f1 repression increasing the expression of Lnc RNAs and derived peptides that evoke anti-tumor cellular immunity. The approach increases MHC-I expression by tumor cells and generates a CMI response that overcomes tumor immune-evasion strategies. Significance Tumors are immunogenic in part because of somatic mutations that originate novel peptides that once presented on MHC engage cell-mediated immunity (CMI). However, in spite of the higher mutation load most tumors evade immunity. We discovered that a component of the complement system (C3d) overcomes tumor immune evasion by augmenting expression of ribosomal proteins and lncRNAs linked to the presentation of novel peptides by tumor cells. C3d induced CMI targets cancer cells sparing non transformed cells uncovering a novel function for complement in immune surveillance.">

        <tr id="In the previous studies, anti-TGF-β/PD-L1 bispecific antibody YM101 is demonstrated, with superior efficacy to anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in multiple tumor models. However, YM101 therapy can not achieve complete regression in most tumor-bearing mice, suggesting the presence of other immunosuppressive elements in the tumor microenvironment (TME) beyond TGF-β and PD-L1. Thoroughly exploring the TME is imperative to pave the way for the successful translation of anti-TGF-β/PD-L1 BsAb into clinical practice. In this work, scRNA-seq is employed to comprehensively profile the TME changes induced by YM101. The scRNA-seq analysis reveals an increase in immune cell populations associated with antitumor immunity and enhances cell-killing pathways. However, the analysis also uncovers the presence of immunosuppressive CCR5+ T cells in the TME after YM101 treatment. To overcome this hurdle, YM101 is combined with Maraviroc, a widely used CCR5 antagonist for treating HIV infection, suppressing CCR5+ T cell accumulation, and optimizing the immune response. Mechanistically, YM101-induced neutrophil activation recruits immunosuppressive CCR5+ T cells via CCR5 ligand secretion, creating a feedback loop that diminishes the antitumor response. Maraviroc then cleared these infiltrating cells and offset YM101-mediated immunosuppressive effects, further unleashing the antitumor immunity. These findings suggest selectively targeting CCR5 signaling with Maraviroc represents a promising and strategic approach to enhance YM101 efficacy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) show signs of low-grade inflammation, which is related to the development of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the underlying triggers remain unknown. The gut microbiota is a plausible source as it comprises pro-inflammatory bacteria, bacterial metabolites and viruses, including (bacterio)phages. These prokaryotic viruses have been shown to mediate inflammatory responses in gastrointestinal disease. Given the differences in phage populations in healthy individuals versus those with cardiometabolic diseases such as T2D, we here questioned whether phages from T2D individuals would have increased immunogenic potential. To address this, we isolated intestinal phages from a fresh stool sample of healthy controls and individuals with newly diagnosed, treatment-naive T2D. Phages were purified using cesium chloride ultracentrifugation and incubated with healthy donor dendritic cells (DCs) and autologous T cells. Donors with T2D had slightly higher free viral particle numbers compared to healthy controls (p = .1972), which has been previously associated with disease states. Further, phages from T2D induced a higher inflammatory response in DCs and T cells than phages from HC. For example, the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on DCs (p < .001) and interferon-y secretion from T cells (p < .01) were increased when comparing the two groups. These results suggest that phages might play a role in low-grade inflammation in T2D individuals.">

        <tr id="NKT cells are innate-like T cells, recruited to the skin during viral infection, yet their contributions to long-term immune memory to viruses are unclear. We identified granzyme K, a product made by cytotoxic cells including NKT cells, as linked to induction of Th1-associated antibodies during primary dengue virus (DENV) infection in humans. We examined the role of NKT cells in vivo using DENV-infected mice lacking CD1d-dependent (CD1ddep) NKT cells. In CD1d-KO mice, Th1-polarized immunity and infection resolution were impaired, which was dependent on intrinsic NKT cell production of IFN-γ, since it was restored by adoptive transfer of WT but not IFN-γ–KO NKT cells. Furthermore, NKT cell deficiency triggered immune bias, resulting in higher levels of Th2-associated IgG1 than Th1-associated IgG2a, which failed to protect against a homologous DENV rechallenge and promoted antibody-dependent enhanced disease during secondary heterologous infections. Similarly, Th2 immunity, typified by a higher IgG4/IgG3 ratio, was associated with worsened human disease severity during secondary infections. Thus, CD1ddep NKT cells establish Th1 polarity during the early innate response to DENV, which promotes infection resolution, memory formation, and long-term protection from secondary homologous and heterologous infections in mice, with consistent associations observed in humans. These observations illustrate how early innate immune responses during primary infections can influence secondary infection outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract In situations involving continuous exposure to antigens, such as chronic infections or cancer, antigen‐specific CD8+ T cells can become dysfunctional or exhausted. This change is marked by increased expression levels of inhibitory receptors (PD‐1 and Tim‐3). Stem‐like progenitor exhausted (Tpex) cells, a subset of exhausted cells that express TCF‐1 and are mainly found in the lymph nodes, demonstrate the ability to self‐renew and exhibit a high rate of proliferation. Tpex cells can further differentiate into transitional intermediate exhausted (Tex‐int) cells and terminally exhausted (Tex‐term) cells. Alternatively, they can directly differentiate into Tex‐term cells. Tpex cells are the predominant subset that respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), making them a prime candidate for improving the efficacy of ICI therapy. This review article aimed to present the latest developments in the field of Tpex formation, expansion, and differentiation in the context of cancer, as well as their responses to ICIs in cancer immunotherapy. Consequently, it may be possible to develop novel treatments that exclusively target Tpex cells, thus improving overall treatment outcomes. Key points Tpex cells are located in lymph nodes and TLS. Several pathways control the differentiation trajectories of Tpex cells, including epigenetic factors, transcription factors, cytokines, age, sex, etc.">

Within the TME, cell-to-cell inhibitory interactions play significant roles in dampening their anti-tumor activities. Recent studies have revealed that soluble factors released in the TME by immune and non-immune cells, as well as by tumor cells themselves, contribute to the exacerbation of T cell exhaustion. Our understanding of the cytokine landscape of the TME, their interrelationships, and their impact on cancer development is still at its early stages. In this review, we aim to shed light on Interleukin (IL) -6, IL-9, and IL-10, a small group of JAK/STAT signaling-dependent cytokines harboring T cell-suppressive effects in the TME and summarize their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we will explore how advancements in scientific research can help us overcoming the obstacles posed by cytokines that suppress T cells in tumors, with the ultimate objective of stimulating further investigations for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to counteract their tumor-promoting activities.">

        <tr id="Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β cells and involves an interplay between β cells and cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), an enzyme implicated in inflammatory pathways in β cells and macrophages, using a mouse model in which the endogenous mouse Alox15 gene is replaced by the human ALOX12 gene. Our findings demonstrate that VLX-1005, a potent 12-LOX inhibitor, effectively delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes in human gene replacement non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. By spatial proteomics analysis, VLX-1005 treatment resulted in marked reductions in infiltrating T and B cells and macrophages with accompanying increases in immune checkpoint molecules PD-L1 and PD-1, suggesting a shift towards an immune-suppressive microenvironment. RNA sequencing analysis of isolated islets from inhibitor-treated mice revealed significant alteration of cytokine-responsive pathways. RNA sequencing of polarized proinflammatory macrophages showed that VLX-1005 significantly reduced the interferon response. Our studies demonstrate that the ALOX12 human replacement gene mouse provides a platform for the preclinical evaluation of LOX inhibitors and supports VLX-1005 as an inhibitor of human 12-LOX that engages the enzymatic target and alters the inflammatory phenotypes of islets and macrophages to promote the delay of autoimmune diabetes.">

Using mass spectrometry, we discovered distinct metabolomes of these cells in humans and their unique enrichment in amino acids. By assessing energy metabolism in in vitro and ex vivo single-cell analyses, we determined that increased intracellular L-phenylalanine boosts glycolysis while limiting OXPHOS in CD4+T, memory CD4+T and Th2, but not in Treg cells. L-phenylalanine also restrains memory CD4+T proliferation in an IL4I1-dependent manner and inhibits Th2 cell proliferation and differentiation. RNA-sequencing, metabolomics, flow cytometry and proteomics, validated in vitro and across patients’ cohorts, revealed an impairment in LAT1-dependent transport of L-phenylalanine into Th2 cells in allergy with an increase in its intracellular processing, accompanied by an expansion of pathogenic Th2 cells. Thus, our study identifies L-phenylalanine as a checkpoint in the development, energy metabolism and function of Th2 cells.">

        <tr id="The incidence and mortality of digestive system-related cancers have always been high and attributed to the heterogeneity and complexity of the immune microenvironment of the digestive system. Furthermore, several studies have shown that chronic inflammation in the digestive system is responsible for cancer incidence; therefore, controlling inflammation is a potential strategy to stop the development of cancer. Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC) represent a heterogeneous group of lymphocytes that exist in contrast to T cells. They function by interacting with cytokines and immune cells in an antigen-independent manner. In the digestive system cancer, from the inflammatory phase to the development, migration, and metastasis of tumors, ILC have been found to interact with the immune microenvironment and either control or promote these processes. The conventional treatments for digestive tumors have limited efficacy, therefore, ILC-associated immunotherapies are promising strategies. This study reviews the characterization of different ILC subpopulations, how they interact with and influence the immune microenvironment as well as chronic inflammation, and their promotional or inhibitory role in four common digestive system tumors, including pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, and hepatocellular cancers. In particular, the review emphasizes the role of ILC in associating chronic inflammation with cancer and the potential for enhanced immunotherapy with cytokine therapy and adoptive immune cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Reduced responsiveness of precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) to chemotherapy can be first detected in the form of minimal residual disease leukemia cells that persist after 28 days of initial treatment. The ability of these cells to resist chemotherapy is partly due to the microenvironment of the bone marrow, which promotes leukemia cell growth and provides protection, particularly under these conditions of stress. It is unknown if and how the glycocalyx of such cells is remodelled during the development of tolerance to drug treatment, even though glycosylation is the most abundant cell surface post-translational modification present on the plasma membrane. To investigate this, we performed omics analysis of BCP-ALL cells that survived a 30-day vincristine chemotherapy treatment while in co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells. Proteomics showed decreased levels of some metabolic enzymes. Overall glycocalyx changes included a shift from Core-2 to less complex Core-1 O-glycans, and reduced overall sialylation, with a shift from α2-6 to α2-3 linked Neu5Ac. Interestingly, there was a clear increase in bisecting complex N-glycans with a concomitant increased mRNA expression of MGAT3, the only enzyme known to form bisecting N-glycans. These small but reproducible quantitative differences suggest that individual glycoproteins become differentially glycosylated. Glycoproteomics confirmed glycosite-specific modulation of cell surface and lysosomal proteins in drug-tolerant BCP-ALL cells, including HLA-DRA, CD38, LAMP1 and PPT1. We conclude that drug-tolerant persister leukemia cells that grow under continuous chemotherapy stress have characteristic glycotraits that correlate with and perhaps contribute to their ability to survive and could be tested as neoantigens in drug-resistant leukemia.">

Here, we demonstrate that navitoclax, an orally bioavailable, small-molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor, significantly improves pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) treatments as a host-directed therapy. Addition of navitoclax to standard TB treatments at human equipotent dosing in mouse models of TB, inhibits Bcl-2 expression, leading to improved bacterial clearance, reduced tissue damage / fibrosis and decreased extrapulmonary bacterial dissemination. Using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, we show that navitoclax induces apoptosis in several immune cells, including CD68 + and CD11b + cells. Finally, positron emission tomography (PET) in live animals using novel, clinically translatable biomarkers for apoptosis (18F-ICMT-11) and fibrosis (18F-FAPI-74) demonstrates that navitoclax significantly increases apoptosis and reduces fibrosis in pulmonary tissues, which are confirmed using post-mortem studies. Our studies suggest that proapoptotic drugs such as navitoclax can improve pulmonary TB treatments, and should be evaluated in clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the leading infectious causes of death worldwide. There is no available licensed therapeutic vaccine that shortens active tuberculosis (TB) disease drug treatment and prevents relapse, despite the World Health Organization’s calls. Here, we show that an intranasal DNA vaccine containing a fusion of the stringent response relMtb gene with the gene encoding the immature dendritic cell-targeting chemokine, MIP-3α/CCL20, shortens the duration of curative TB treatment in immunocompetent mice. Compared to the first-line regimen for drug-susceptible TB alone, our novel adjunctive vaccine induced greater RelMtb-specific T-cell responses associated with optimal TB control in spleen, blood, lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. These responses were sustained, if not augmented, over time. It also triggered more effective dendritic cell recruitment, activation, and colocalization with T cells, implying enhanced crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, it potentiated a 6-month TB drug-resistant regimen, rendering it effective across treatment regimens, and also showed promising results in CD4+ knockout mice, perhaps due to enhanced Rel-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Notably, our novel fusion vaccine was also immunogenic in nonhuman primates, the gold standard animal model for TB vaccine studies, eliciting antigen-specific T-cell responses in blood and BAL fluid analogous to those observed in protected mice. Our findings have critical implications for therapeutic TB vaccine clinical development in immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations and may serve as a model for defining immunological correlates of therapeutic vaccine-induced protection.

T cells are major IL-32 producers in these diseases and key mediators of pathogen and tumor elimination but also autoimmune destruction. However, their contribution to IL-32 biology during immune responses is hardly understood due to several isoforms with divergent inflammatory properties. Here, we identified IL-32β as the predominant isoform in various T cell subsets of healthy individuals and breast cancer patients with the highest levels detected in intratumoral regulatory T cells. We show that IL-32β is induced by IL-2 but IL-32β release requires T Cell Receptor rather than IL2R stimulation. Using inhibitors of protein secretion pathways and serial (ultra)centrifugation of T cell supernatants, we demonstrate that T cells actively secrete IL-32β unconventionally, as a free protein and, to a minor degree, through exosomes. Thus, our data identify activated T cells as major IL-32β secretors in health and cancer.">

        <tr id="Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus and the leading cause of infectious disease related birth defects worldwide. How the immune response modulates the risk of intrauterine transmission of HCMV after maternal infection remains poorly understood. Maternal T cells likely play a critical role in preventing infection at the maternal-fetal interface and limiting spread across the placenta, but concerns exist that immune responses to infection may also cause placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a guinea pig model of primary cytomegalovirus infection. Monoclonal antibodies specific to guinea pig CD4 and CD8 were used to deplete T cells in non- pregnant and in pregnant guinea pigs after mid-gestation. CD4+ T cell depletion increased the severity of illness, caused significantly elevated viral loads, and increased the rate of congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection relative to animals treated with control antibody. CD8+ T cell depletion was comparably well tolerated and did not significantly affect the weight of infected guinea pigs or viral loads in their blood or tissue. However, significantly more viral genomes and transcripts were detected in the placenta and decidua of CD8+ T cell depleted dams post-infection. This study corroborates earlier findings made in nonhuman primates that maternal CD4+ T cells play a critical role in limiting the severity of primary CMV infection during pregnancy while also revealing that other innate and adaptive immune responses can compensate for an absent CD8+ T cell response in α-CD8-treated guinea pigs. Author Summary Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is a leading cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes and preventable disability in children. Using guinea pigs, a well-established small animal model of congenital infection and intrauterine development, this study tested how depleting T cells affects the course of primary cytomegalovirus infections. Severe illness and high rates of congenital infection were observed when helper CD4+ T cells were depleted. The depletion of killer CD8+ T cells did not affect the severity of disease or the rate of congenital infection but did increase the amount of virus that was detected in the placenta. A greater understanding how an immune response can prevent the infection of the placenta and developing offspring is needed to inform vaccine and therapeutic development. This study not only describes a new reagent that can be used to study the guinea pig immune system but also sheds new light in how adaptive immunity regulates congenital viral infection.">

Also, they have the potential to shape the adaptive immunity via a unique crosstalk with the different immune cells.

To decipher the immunological virus-host interactions, two major infection models are being investigated in mice regarding NK cell-mediated recognition: murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). In this review, we recapitulate recent findings regarding the multifaceted role of NK cells in controlling LCMV and MCMV infections and outline the exquisite interplay between NK cells and other immune cells in these two settings. Considering that, infections with MCMV and LCMV recapitulates many physiopathological characteristics of human cytomegalovirus infection and chronic virus infections respectively, this study will extend our understanding of NK cells biology in interactions between the virus and its natural host.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, is a promising treatment modality in oncology that involves augmenting the tumor-attacking capabilities of the immune system. Several preclinical and clinical studies have underscored the transformative potential of ICBs in the context of malignancies. 1 However, the efficacy of ICB therapy is often impeded by intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms in solid tumors, which are commonly due to a paucity of tumor neoantigens, checkpoint targets, and the inflammatory presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is profoundly immunosuppressive, which is the key reason for the limited clinical efficacy of ICB therapy. Within this milieu, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the predominant myeloid cell subset, and their high infiltration levels have been implicated in mediating resistance to ICB therapy, thereby correlating with adverse prognosis across a spectrum of cancers. 3 Recent advances reported in Nature Cancer have shed light on specific TAM subpopulations that are instrumental in facilitating tumor immune evasion and resistance to ICB therapy. Two recent studies have delineated the roles of Sirp α + TAMs in colorectal cancer (CRC) 4 and Siglec-9 + TAMs in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM">

EOMES+type-1 regulatory (EOMES+Tr1-like) T-cells had a dysregulated homeostasis in multiple sclerosis (MS), which was related to their activation in the central nervous system (CNS). EOMES+Tr1-like cells were strongly enriched in patient’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and were the main IL-10-producing T-cells in the CSF.

EOMES+Tr1-like cells and FOXP3+Tregs produced IL-10 with EBV-derived antigens, but not with major myelin antigens. EOMES+Tr1-like cells responded selectively to the latency-associated antigen EBNA1, whereas FOXP3+Tregs responded also to lytic antigens. EBNA1-specific EOMES+Tr1-like cells were associated with anti-EBNA1 IgG, disappeared upon therapeutic B-cell depletion and were relatively abundant in patients with the HLA-DRB1*15 risk haplotype. The aberrant anti-viral specificities of Tregs in MS could undermine their protective functions and anti-EBV immune surveillance.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) mediate host defense against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and tumors. However, the magnitude of CTL response and their function needed to confer heterosubtypic immunity against influenza virus infection are unknown. We addressed the role of CD8+ T cells in the absence of any cross-reactive antibody responses to influenza viral proteins using an adenoviral vector expressing a 9mer amino acid sequence recognized by CD8+ T cells. Our results indicate that both CD8+ T cell frequency and function are crucial for heterosubtypic immunity. Low morbidity, lower viral lung titers, low to minimal lung pathology, and better survival upon heterosubtypic virus challenge correlated with the increased frequency of NP-specific CTLs. NP-CD8+ T cells induced by differential infection doses displayed distinct RNA transcriptome profiles and functional properties. CD8+ T cells induced by a high dose of influenza virus secreted significantly higher levels of IFN-γ and exhibited higher levels of cytotoxic function. The mice that received NP-CD8+ T cells from the high-dose virus recipients through adoptive transfer had lower viral titers following viral challenge than those induced by the low dose of virus, suggesting differential cellular programming by antigen dose. Enhanced NP-CD8+ T-cell functions induced by a higher dose of influenza virus strongly correlated with the increased expression of cellular and metabolic genes, indicating a shift to a more glycolytic metabolic phenotype. These findings have implications for developing effective T cell vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.


IMPORTANCE
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are an important component of the adaptive immune system that clears virus-infected cells or tumor cells. Hence, developing next-generation vaccines that induce or recall CTL responses against cancer and infectious diseases is crucial. However, it is not clear if the frequency, function, or both are essential in conferring protection, as in the case of influenza. In this study, we demonstrate that both CTL frequency and function are crucial for providing heterosubtypic immunity to influenza by utilizing an Ad-viral vector expressing a CD8 epitope only to rule out the role of antibodies, single-cell RNA-seq analysis, as well as adoptive transfer experiments. Our findings have implications for developing T cell vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer.">

        <tr id="In the dynamic landscape of cervical cancer (CC) pathophysiology, this study aimed to elucidate the role of necroptosis in modulating tumor proliferation, invasion, and the immune microenvironment in CC. In this study, the impact of necroptosis on CC was evaluated through a series of bioinformatical analyses and experimental approaches. The impact of necroptosis on CC was illustrated by analyzing its effects on tumor aggression, immune responses, and the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was also evaluated for its potential induction of necroptosis in CC cells and its interaction with necroptosis inhibitors. Additionally, the study assessed the influence of necroptosis on the immune microenvironment, particularly in T-cell-related pathways and the expression of tumor suppressor genes in CC. Necroptosis was found to enhance VEGFA expression through the activation of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway, promoting tumor proliferative and invasive capabilities in CC. Bevacizumab induced necroptosis in CC cells, potentially leading to resistance to therapy. The combination of bevacizumab with necroptosis inhibitors attenuated VEGFA expression, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy. Additionally, necroptosis activated T-cell-related pathways and promoted the infiltration and activation of Jurkat T cells. CD3D—a tumor suppressor gene in CC—was identified as a critical marker and its expression could be upregulated by necroptosis via the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in Jurkat T cells. Treatment of CC cells with supernatants from necroptosis-induced Jurkat cells resulted in reduced tumor cell proliferation and invasion. This study reveals a complex interaction between necroptosis, tumor progression, and the immune response in CC. The findings propose a nuanced approach to leveraging necroptosis for therapeutic interventions, highlighting the potential of combining necroptosis inhibitors with existing therapies to improve treatment outcomes in CC.">

        <tr id="Abstract As a major immune cell type in the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages secrete suppressive factors that can inhibit antitumor immunity and promote tumor progression. One approach trying to utilize macrophages for immunotherapy has been to block the CD47-SIRPα axis, which mediates inhibitory signaling, to promote phagocytosis of tumor cells. Many CD47-targeted agents, namely, anti-CD47 antibodies and SIRPα fusion proteins, were associated with a diverse spectrum of toxicities that limit their use in clinical settings. Universal expression of CD47 also leads to a severe “antigen sink” effect of CD47-targeted agents. Given that the CD47 receptor, SIRPα, has a more restricted expression profile and may have CD47-independent functions, targeting SIRPα is considered to have distinct advantages in improving clinical efficacy with a better safety profile. We have developed ES004-B5, a potentially best-in-class pan-allelic human SIRPα-blocking antibody using hybridoma technology. ES004-B5 binds to major human SIRPα variants through a unique epitope with high affinity. By blocking CD47-induced inhibitory “don't-eat-me” signaling, ES004-B5 exerts superior antitumor activity in combination with anti-tumor-associated antigen antibodies in vitro and in vivo. Unlike CD47-targeted agents, ES004-B5 exhibits an excellent safety profile in nonhuman primates. ES004-B5 has potential to be an important backbone for SIRPα-based combination therapy and/or bispecific antibodies, which will likely overcome the limitations of CD47-targeted agents encountered in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="The symbiotic relationship between host and microbiota plays a pivotal role in training and development of the host’s innate and adaptive immune systems. Antigen-specific recognition of microbiota by T cells enforces tolerance at homeostasis. Conversely, dysbiosis—characterized by alterations in microbiota diversity and abundance—leads to imbalanced T cell responses and triggering of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Despite their significance, the identities of immunogenic microbial antigens are still largely enigmatic. Here, we leveraged an in-house developed antigen screening platform, the MCR system 1, to delineate CD4+ T cell reactivity against Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT), —two prominent members of the gut microbiota. T-cell hybridomas reactive to AKK and BT bacteria showed polyreactivity to select microbiota-derived peptides in MCR co-cultures. We discovered 13 novel antigenic epitopes from AKK and 14 from BT. Steady-state T cells recognized these epitopes in an MHC-restricted fashion. Ex vivo stimulation of peptide-specific T cells revealed induction of type 1 and type 17 immune responses, albeit with non-overlapping specificities, contrary to MCR system results. Our findings further demonstrated that most identified epitopes are broadly conserved within the given phylum and originate from both membrane and intracellular proteins. Our work showcases the potential of the MCR system for identifying immunogenic microbial epitopes, providing a valuable resource. Additionally, it indicates the existence of mucosal T cells with a tropism toward broadly conserved bacterial epitopes. Overall, our study forms the basis for decoding antigen specificity in immune system-bacterial interactions, with applications in understanding both microbiome and pathogenic bacterial immunity.">

        <tr id="Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) represents endogenous mechanisms of negative immunoregulation. While the modulation of effector functions has been the major focus of PD-1 research, quick PD-1 upregulation in naïve T cells starting 1 h after priming raised a possibility that PD-1 also affects the development of effector T cells. The role of PD-1 in functional differentiation into Th1 and Th2 has been unclear. In murine naïve CD4+ T cell activation, we found that PD-1 stimulation during the early stage of T cell activation strongly impaired Th2 cell development, while Th1 cell induction was relatively resistant to this immunosuppressive signaling. The steep decline in Th2 cell induction suggested the significance of PD-1 in allergic inflammation. Treatment with anti-human PD-1 agonist antibody inhibited allergic inflammation in human PD-1-knock-in mice as shown by the reduction of Th2 cells, IgE levels and eosinophilic infiltration. This study shows that PD-1 regulates not only the intensity but also the quality of immune response by deviating Th differentiation. PD-1 stimulators are projected to be valuable in suppressing various forms of inflammatory activities, but the efficacy against Th2-dominant immune response may be particularly high.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive, poorly immunogenic cancer and non-responsive to all currently available treatments, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. As survival rates remain low (13%), there is an urgent need for new therapeutic options. A hallmark of PDAC is the limited infiltration of anti-tumor cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data of PDAC tumors from treatment naïve patients reveals high expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. PSGL-1 is an intrinsic negative regulator of CD8+ T cells that promotes the development of functional exhaustion. We therefore hypothesized that PSGL-1-mediated immune suppression is a critical barrier to effective anti-tumor immunity in PDAC. To test this, we used preclinical models of orthotopic injection PDAC tumor cells into pancreata, recapitulating patient responses to PDAC with limited T cell infiltrates and uncontrolled tumor growth in C57BL/6 (wildtype) control mice and compared anti-tumor immune responses in PSGL-1KO (C57BL/6 background) mice. At 28 days post-injection of KPC.4662 PDAC tumor cells, tumor burden in PSGL-1KO mice was reduced by >50% compared to controls, with 45% of PSGL-1KO animals exhibiting >70% reduction. Total immune infiltration (CD45+) was 2-fold greater in tumors from PSGL-1KO mice, with significant increases in infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Detailed analyses revealed that infiltrating CD8+ T cells from PSGL-1KO mice were less terminally differentiated towards exhaustion. PSGL-1KO PD-1+ CD8+ T cells expressed less TOX expression and fewer cells co-expressed CD38 and CD101 while more expressed CX3CR1 compared to controls. Intratumoral PSGL-1KO CD8+ T cells also retained greater functionality as well as indicated by inflammatory cytokine production (IFNg, TNFa) and Granzyme B expression. Moreover, PSGL-1KO mice showed protection against metastatic disease to the lungs. We find that protection by PSGL-1KO mice is T cell dependent as transient depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells prior to tumor cell implantation results in the loss of PDAC tumor growth inhibition by PSGL-1KO mice. Less-differentiated, proliferation-competent precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX) are essential to PD-1 ICB responsiveness in patients and preclinical models. Given that PSGL-1-deficiency limits terminal differentiation of CD8+ T cells in PDAC, we hypothesized that PSGL-1-deficiency would promote responsiveness to PD-1 ICB, which is ineffective as a monotherapy in PDAC patients and mouse models. While therapeutic treatment with anti-PD-1 had no effect on the tumor growth in the control animals, PD-1 ICB resulted in tumor ablation in 85% of PSGL-1KO animals, demonstrating a profound synergistic effect of PD-1 inhibition in the absence of PSGL-1. From these studies, we conclude that PSGL- 1 is a critical inhibitor anti-tumor T cell immunity in PDAC and represents a novel ICB target with high translational potential for promoting immune responses to PDAC tumors.

        <tr id="Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality. Editor’s summary During embryonic development, macrophages interact with blood stem cells, removing those exhibiting high levels of cellular stress. The surviving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can proliferate and give rise to blood cell linages in adults. Pessoa Rodrigues et al. used zebrafish models and mammalian systems to investigate signals within HSPCs that could prevent macrophages from engulfing them. Molecules associated with innate immune nucleic acid sensing promoted the expression of Beta-2-microglobulin on the surface of HSPCs to increase their survival when they interacted with macrophages. Impairing this pathway decreased the number of distinct stem cell clones in adult zebrafish. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) produce mature blood cells throughout life. During this process, HSPCs engage in interactions with the variety of cells present in the marrow niche, including macrophages. These macrophages mediate a myriad of processes by releasing cytokines and chemokines and patrolling to remove stressed, dead, or aging cells. In this manner, macrophages contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During hematopoiesis, macrophages ensure the quality of normal blood stem cells and determine the number of hematopoietic clones that participate in adult hematopoiesis. They then either engulf a stem cell completely, referred to as “dooming,” or capture portions of the stem cell’s cellular material, referred to as “grooming.” After grooming, the stem cell continues to divide, whereas the doomed HSPC clone is eliminated. RATIONALE Past work has shown that the HSPC-macrophage interaction is mediated by an “eat-me” signal, calreticulin (Calr), on the surface of HSPCs. Surface Calr levels are increased in stem cells with higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this triggers macrophages to engulf and kill stem cells that have high amounts of stress-activated proteins. However, the specific molecular cues that regulate the dooming versus grooming behavior are still unknown. RESULTS To investigate the cues mediating grooming versus dooming, we screened a panel of 1200 bioactive small molecules in human cells and identified 93 compounds that robustly increased surface CALR in a dose-dependent manner. Of these compounds, 22 also facilitated interactions between macrophages and stem cells in zebrafish. Compounds that depended on ROS to increase CALR showed higher dooming ratios and, conversely, animals treated with ROS-independent compounds exhibited a higher probability of grooming events despite increased CALR and increased macrophage–stem cell interactions. To investigate the signals involved in interactions under ROS-independent conditions, we undertook a genome-wide screen in human cells. We identified Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as a CALR inducer in the “don’t eat me” context. Next, we found that TLR3 expression was required for the expression of the “don’t eat me” signal Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). Antibody staining and studies of a b2m knockout zebrafish line showed that b2m on stem cells was required for preventing the macrophage dooming. To determine whether the increased dooming observed in the b2m mutant affected clonal dominance, we generated mosaic deletions using the zebrabow color barcoding system (TWISTR) as a lineage tracer. Mosaic deletion of b2m reduced the number of myeloid clones but increased clonal dominance. The dominant clones in these fish were wild type for b2m that were resistant to dooming and overtook the adult marrow. TLR3 signaling is activated by double-stranded RNA, which can sometimes be found in cells due to the expression of transcripts associated with repetitive elements (REs), including long terminal repeats (LTRs) and endogenous retroviruses. RE expression in HSPCs positively correlated with elevated levels of B2m. Moreover, overexpressing ltr4 in zebrafish led to higher HSPC proliferation, indicative of decreased dooming. Impairing the TLR3-B2M pathway by disrupting the expression of TLR3, IRF3, or B2M expression decreased the number of blood cell clones in zebrafish. Using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor CM272 to promote up-regulation of REs amplified the proliferation of already established HSPC clones in zebrafish embryos. CONCLUSION Our findings support a model in which endogenous TLR3 ligands lead to expression of b2m, thereby providing a blockade against macrophage-induced dooming and determining hematopoietic stem cell clonality by monitoring stem cell quality with macrophages. The balance of Calr and B2m governs the number of long-lived HSC clones that contribute to the adult blood system through macrophage-mediated quality assurance. This sheds light on the intricate interplay between HSPC clonal expansion and immune-regulated cell clearance. We propose that this protective mechanism may also operate in adulthood in response to environmental stress, such as during infections or in clonal stem cell disorders. Manipulating the levels of “don’t eat-me” and “eat-me” signals may have important therapeutic implications for immune therapy by harnessing the macrophage-selective removal of a mutated stem cell clone. ROS and TLR3 signaling mediates the “eat-me” and “don’t eat me” signals that determine stem cell clonal selection by macrophages. Shown is a schematic overview of the proposed model showing the balance between the Calr-mediated “eat-me” and B2m-mediated “don’t eat-me” signals that influence macrophage behavior.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a pro-cancerous niche harboring immunosuppressive factors that are secreted by cancer cells and the surrounding cancer-supportive tissue, such as kynurenine, prostaglandin E2 and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). These factors dampen the activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes like natural killer (NK) cells, allowing evasion of immune cell-mediated killing. To identify small molecules that counteract the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we developed a phenotypic co-culture assay of cancer cells and primary lymphocytes suitable for medium-throughput screening. We discovered small molecules that restore NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity through diverse mechanisms. The potent TGFβ type I receptor (TGFβR-1) inhibitor, RepSox, stood out as superior to other TGFβR-1 inhibitors due to its ability to abolish the effects of both inhibitory factors used in our setup. This mode of action goes beyond TGFβR-1 inhibition and is related to the simultaneous abrogation of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) activity.">

        <tr id="Prostate cancer presents as an immunologically "cold" malignancy, characterized by a lack of response to immunotherapy in the majority of patients. The dysfunction of prostate tumor metabolism is recognized as a critical factor in immune evasion, resulting in reduced effectiveness of immunotherapeutic interventions. Despite this awareness, the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning metabolic dysregulation in prostate cancer and its intricate relationship with immune evasion remain incompletely elucidated. In this study, we introduce the multi-drug resistance protein ABCC4/MRP4 as a key player prominently expressed in prostate cancer, exerting a pivotal role in suppressing the activity of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. Depletion of ABCC4 in prostate cancer cells halts the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a molecule that diminishes the population of CD8+ T cells and curtails their cytotoxic capabilities. Conversely, constraining the activation of PGE2 signaling in CD8+ T cells effectively improved the efficacy of prostate cancer treatment with PD-1 blockade. During this process, downregulation of the JAK1-STAT3 pathway and depolarization of mitochondria emerge as crucial factors contributing to T cell anergy. Collectively, our research identifies the ABCC4-PGE2 axis as a promising target for reversing dysfunction within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and augmenting the suboptimal responsiveness to immunotherapy in prostate cancer.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are abundant and influential elements of the tumor microenvironment (TME), giving support to tumor development in multiple ways. Among other mechanisms, CAFs are important regulators of immunological processes occurring in tumors. However, CAF-mediated tumor immunomodulation in the context of radiotherapy remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore effects of radiation on CAF-derived immunoregulatory signals to the TME. Methods Primary CAF cultures were established from freshly collected human NSCLC lung tumors. CAFs were exposed to single-high or fractionated radiation regimens (1x18Gy or 3x6Gy), and the expression of different immunoregulatory cell-associated and secreted signaling molecules was analyzed 48h and 6 days after initiation of treatment. Analyses included quantitative measurements of released damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), interferon (IFN) type I responses, expression of immune regulatory receptors, and secretion of soluble cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. CAFs are able to survive ablative radiation regimens, however they enter into a stage of premature cell senescence. Results Our data show that CAFs avoid apoptosis and do not contribute by release of DAMPs or IFN-I secretion to radiation-mediated tumor immunoregulation. Furthermore, the secretion of relevant immunoregulatory cytokines and growth factors including TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IL-1β, VEGF, CXCL12, and CXCL10 remain comparable between non-irradiated and radiation-induced senescent CAFs. Importantly, radiation exposure modifies the cell surface expression of some key immunoregulatory receptors, including upregulation of CD73 and CD276. Discussion Our data suggest that CAFs do not participate in the release of danger signals or IFN-I secretion following radiotherapy. The immune phenotype of CAFs and radiation-induced senescent CAFs is similar, however, the observed elevation of some cell surface immunological receptors on irradiated CAFs could contribute to the establishment of an enhanced immunosuppressive TME after radiotherapy.">

        <tr id="Combination therapy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved the prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but many patients still have unsatisfactory outcomes. CD8 T cells are known to exert a pivotal function in the immune response against tumors. Nevertheless, most CD8 T cells in HCC tissues are in a state of exhaustion, losing the cytotoxic activity against malignant cells. Cytokines, mainly secreted by immune cells, play an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors. Here, we demonstrated the changes in exhausted CD8T cells during combination therapy by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on tumor samples before and after treatment. Combination therapy exerted a substantial impact on the exhausted CD8T cells, particularly in terms of cytokine expression. CCL5 was the most abundantly expressed cytokine in CD8T cells and exhausted CD8T cells, and its expression increased further after treatment. Subsequently, we discovered the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on CCL5-stimulated Huh7 cells and verified through a series of experiments that this pathway can mediate the resistance of liver cancer cells to lenvatinib. Tissue experiments showed that after combination therapy, the CCL5/CCR5/CYP1A1 pathway was activated, which can benefit the residual tumor cells to survive treatment. Tumor-bearing mouse experiments demonstrated that bergamottin (BGM), a competitive inhibitor of CYP1A1, can enhance the efficacy of both lenvatinib and combination therapy. Our research revealed one mechanism by which hepatoma cells can survive the combination therapy, providing a theoretical basis for the refined treatment of HCC.">

        <tr id="Recent advancements in mucosal immunology have unveiled a complex network of intercellular connections within diverse tissues, shedding light on the unique properties of different cell types. Central to this intricate network is the cytokine IL-33, which has gained significant attention for its critical role in various diseases, from allergy to cancer, triggering type 2 immune responses, among others. Recent research has challenged the prior assumptions attributing IL-33 expression to epithelial cells, highlighting stromal cells as the predominant source in adipose tissue and the lungs. However, in the complex landscape of the intestine, where IL-33 plays a crucial role in mediating immune surveillance and tolerance and is implicated in many gut-related disorders, its primary source, regulation, and main characteristics need more exploration. This study identifies stromal cells as the primary IL-33-expressing cell type in the small intestine. By investigating their transcriptome and intrinsic signaling pathways, we have uncovered a possible role of IL-33+ stromal cells in maintaining the stem cell niche and their potential crosstalk with neurons relevant to the regulation of axonogenesis. Importantly, our experiments have demonstrated that vasoactive intestinal peptide stimulation of a primary intestinal stromal cell culture significantly amplifies IL-33 expression on mRNA and protein level. Therefore, our study represents a significant leap forward in understanding the plethora of interactions IL-33+ intestinal stromal cells maintain in the intestine, paving the way for future investigations into stromal-neuro crosstalk in the gut. These findings hold great promise for developing targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at harnessing the potential of IL-33 across a spectrum of diseases.">

In a tissue culture model of the blood–brain barrier, antagonizing the interaction of CD200 and sCD200 with T-cell CD200 receptor (CD200R1) via anti-CD200 blocking antibodies or the RNAi-mediated inhibition of CD200 production by endothelial cells increased T-cell adhesion and transmigration across monolayers of endothelial cells.

 A major challenge in osteosarcoma (OS) immunotherapy is overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), to restore immune recognition and destruction of tumor cells. One of the key immune cell subsets known to contribute to the immunosuppressive TME are M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Our work aims to identify novel oncolytic virus (OV) combination immunotherapies to induce direct lysis of OS tumor cells, activate immune-mediated destruction of OS, and remodel the immunosuppressive TME. The direct lytic activity of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV; HSV1716) treatment was assessed using LIVE/DEAD flow cytometry and viral replication was measured using standard plaque assay. NK cell degranulation and killing assays were performed by co-culture of OS cell lines with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) treated ± oHSV; NK cell degranulation and target cell death was assessed by flow cytometry. TAMs were generated in vitro by co-culture of PBMC with OS cell lines or primary bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for 7 days. Phagocytosis assays were performed by co-culture of TAMs with OS cells using fluorescent cell tracker stains and flow cytometry. Multicellular spheroids were generated by co-culture of firefly luciferase-expressing OS cell lines with CD14+ monocytes and bone marrow derived MSCs for 7 days in low adhesion plates, viability of tumor cells after treatment was assessed by addition of d-luciferin and quantification of luminescence. Treatment of four OS cell lines with oHSV for 72 hours resulted in <20% cell death by direct lysis. However, after treatment with oHSV-GFP, >95% of OS cells were GFP+ and viral titer increased up to 105-fold when compared to viral input. This highlighted high levels of infection and replication of oHSV within OS cell lines, despite limited oncolysis. Moreover, oHSV treatment of PBMC significantly enhanced the immune-mediated killing of OS cell lines, and this was NK cell dependent. Monolayer co-culture of PBMC with OS cell lines or MSC generated TAMs with significantly increased pro-tumor M2-like phenotype (CD14+CD206+CD163+), when compared with PBMC cultured alone, and TAMs suppressed NK cell degranulation against OS cell lines. Treatment of TAMS with oHSV encoding GM-CSF reduced the proportion of M2 TAMs. Moreover, treatment of OS target cells with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) and co-culture with in vitro generated TAMs significantly increased their phagocytic activity. Multicellular spheroids incorporating MSCs and CD14+ monocytes displayed a high degree of resistance against immune-mediated killing, when compared with OS cell line alone as monolayer or spheroid cultures. However, combination of OV with anti-EGFR mAb significantly increased immune-mediated killing against multicellular spheroids. oHSV combination strategies with mAb may be a promising treatment strategy against OS, to exert direct oncolysis, stimulate immune-mediated destruction, and remodel the immunosuppressive TME.

        <tr id="Abstract Aims SARS‐CoV‐2 causes systemic immune dysfunction, leading to severe respiratory dysfunction and multiorgan dysfunction. Granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis (GMA) therapy is designed to regulate an excessive inflammatory response and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We aimed to investigate a targeted subset of granulocytes and monocytes to be removed after GMA therapy in patients with severe COVID‐19 infection. Methods We established an ex vivo experimental system to study the effects of GMA. Blood samples were collected into EDTA‐treated tubes and a mixture of blood samples and cellulose acetate beads was used in GMA. After GMA, blood samples were removed, and the granulocyte and monocyte subtypes before and after GMA were determined by CyTOF mass cytometry. To analyze mass cytometry data with a self‐organizing map, hierarchical clustering was used to determine the appropriate number of metaclusters from t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results We included seven patients with severe COVID‐19 and four age‐ and sex‐matched volunteers. Granulocyte subsets removed by GMA strongly expressed CD11b, CD16, and CD66b, and weakly expressed CD11c, consistent with mature and activated neutrophils. Monocyte subsets strongly expressed CD14, weakly expressed CD33 and CD45RO, and did not express CD16. These subsets were indicated to promote the release of inflammatory cytokines and activate T cells. Conclusions The identification of the granulocyte and monocyte subsets removed after GMA in patients with severe COVID‐19 may help explain the potential mechanism underlying the effectiveness of GMA in COVID‐19 and other inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Abstract Type I interferons (IFN) are immune-stimulatory cytokines involved in antiviral and antitumor immune responses. They enhance the efficacy of immunogenic anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy by activating both innate and adaptive immune cells. Macrophages are one of the most abundant innate immune cells in the immune microenvironment of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) and can exert potent immune-suppressive functions. Here, we investigate the potential of tumoral type I IFNs to repolarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in two murine MBM models and assess the effects of radiotherapy-induced type I IFN on TAMs in a transcriptomic MBM patient dataset. In mice, we describe a proinflammatory M1-like TAM phenotype induced by tumoral IFNβ and identify a myeloid type I IFN-response signature associated with a high M1/M2-like TAM ratio. Following irradiation, patients with MBM displaying a myeloid type I IFN-response signature showed increased overall survival, providing evidence that tumoral IFNβ supports an effective antitumor immune response by re-educating immune-regulatory TAM. These findings uncover type I IFN–inducing therapies as a potential macrophage-targeting therapeutic approach and provide a rationale for combining radiotherapy with concomitant immunotherapy to improve treatment response in patients with MBM. Significance: Our study shows that re-education of tumor-associated macrophages by tumoral IFNβ translates into improved clinical outcome in patients with melanoma brain metastases, providing pathomechanistic insights into synergistic type I interferon–inducing therapies with immunotherapies and warranting investigation of IFNβ as a predictive biomarker for combined radioimmunotherapy.">

Since both cell types have been shown to be responsive to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation, we used a recently characterized member of a new class of fluorescent AHR ligands, AGT-5, to modulate streptozotocin-induced T1D in C57BL/6 mice. Prophylactic oral administration of AGT-5 reduced hyperglycemia and insulitis in these mice. Phenotypic and functional analysis of cells in the pancreatic infiltrates of AGT-5-treated mice (at the early phase of T1D) revealed a predominantly anti-inflammatory environment, as evidenced by the upregulation of tolDC and Treg frequency, while CD8+ cell, Th1 and Th17 cells were significantly reduced. Similarly, AGT-5 enhanced the proportion of Treg and tolDC in small intestine lamina propria and suppressed the activation status of antigen-presenting cells through down-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86. The expression levels of Cyp1a1, controlled by the AHR, were increased in CD4+, CD8+ and Treg, confirming the AHR-mediated effect of AGT-5 in these cells. Finally, AGT-5 stimulated the function of regulatory cells in the pancreatic islets and lamina propria by upregulating indoleamine 2,3-dioxigenase 1 (IDO1) in tolDC. These findings were supported by the abrogation of AGT-5-mediated in vitro effects on DC in the presence of IDO1 inhibitor. AGT-5 also increased the expression of CD39 or CD73 ATP-degrading ectoenzymes by Treg. The increase in Treg is further supported by the upregulated frequency of IL-2-producing type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in the lamina propria. Anti-inflammatory effects of AGT-5 were also validated on human tonsil cells, where in vitro exposure to AGT-5 increased the proportion of immunosuppressive dendritic cells and ILC3. These results suggest that AGT-5, by stimulating AHR, may promote a general immunosuppressive environment in the pancreas and small intestine lamina propria at the early phase of disease, and thereby inhibit the severity of T1D in mice.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Glioblastoma (GBM) has a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), largely mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we utilized a retroviral replicating vector (RRV) to deliver Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8), a master regulator of type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) development, in a syngeneic murine GBM model. We hypothesized that RRV-mediated delivery of IRF8 could "reprogram" intratumoral MDSCs into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby restore T-cell responses.


METHODS
Effects of RRV-IRF8 on survival and tumor growth kinetics were examined in the SB28 murine GBM model. Immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression assays. We assayed functional immunosuppression and antigen presentation by ex vivo T-cell-myeloid co-culture.


RESULTS
Intratumoral injection of RRV-IRF8 in mice bearing intracerebral SB28 glioma significantly suppressed the tumor growth and prolonged survival. RRV-IRF8 treated tumors exhibited significant enrichment of cDC1s and CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, myeloid cells derived from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed decreased expression of the immunosuppressive markers Arg1 and IDO1 and demonstrated reduced suppression of naïve T-cell proliferation in ex vivo co-culture, compared to controls. Furthermore, DCs from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed increased antigen presentation compared to those from control tumors. In vivo treatment with azidothymidine (AZT), a viral replication inhibitor, showed that IRF8 transduction in both tumor and non-tumor cells is necessary for survival benefit, associated with a reprogrammed, cDC1- and CD8 T-cell-enriched TIME.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate that reprogramming of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells by in vivo expression of IRF8 may reduce immunosuppression and enhance antigen presentation, achieving improved tumor control.">

        <tr id="PRF1 (perforin 1) is a key cytotoxic molecule that plays a crucial role in the killing function of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Recent studies have focused on PRF1’s role in cancer development, progression, and prognosis. Studies have shown that aberrant PRF1 expression has a significant role to play in cancer development and progression. In some cancers, high expression of the PRF1 gene is associated with a better prognosis for patients, possibly because it helps enhance the body’s immune response to tumors. However, some studies have also shown that the absence of PRF1 may make it easier for tumors to evade the body’s immune surveillance, thus affecting patient survival. Furthermore, recent studies have explored therapeutic strategies based on PRF1, such as enhancing the ability of immune cells to kill cancer cells by boosting PRF1 activity. In addition, they have improved the efficacy of immunotherapy by modulating its expression to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment. Based on these findings, PRF1 may be a valuable biomarker both for the treatment of cancer and for its prognosis in the future. To conclude, PRF1 has an important biological function and has clinical potential for the treatment of cancer, which indicates that it deserves more research and development in the future.">

        <tr id="Introduction Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important tropical and neglected disease and represents a serious global health problem. The initial interaction between the phagocytes and the parasite is crucial to determine the pathogen’s capacity to initiate infection and it shapes the subsequent immune response that will develop. While type-1 T-cells induce IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-12 production by monocytes/macrophages to fight the infection, type-2 T-cells are associated with a regulatory phenotype (IL-10 and TGF-β) and successful infection establishment. Recently, our group demonstrated the role of an important Th1/Th17 T-cell population, the mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, in VL. MAIT cells can respond to L. infantum by producing TNF-α and IFN-γ upon MR1-dependent activation. Objective and methods Here, we describe the impact of the MR1-blockage on L. infantum internalization on the functional profile of circulating neutrophils and monocytes as well as the impact of the MR1-blockage on the soluble mediator signatures of in vitro whole blood cultures. Results Overall, our data showed that VL patients presents higher percentage of activated neutrophils than asymptomatic and non-infected controls. In addition, MR1 blockade led to lower TNF-α and TGF-β production by non-activated neutrophils from asymptomatic individuals. Moreover, TNF-α and IL-10 production by monocytes was higher in VL patients. In the analysis of soluble mediators produced in vitro, MR1-blockade induced a decrease of IFN-γ and an increase of IL-10, IL-27 and IL-33 in the cell cultures of AS group, a cytokine pattern associated with type 2 deleterious response. Discussion and conclusion These data corroborate the hypothesis that MR1-restricted responses are associated to a protective role during Leishmania infection.">

        <tr id="Hypertension (HTN) impacts almost half of adults, predisposing them to cardiovascular disease and renal damage. Salt-sensitive HTN (SSHTN) and angiotensin II (A2)-induced HTN (A2HTN) both involve immune system activation and renal innate immune cell infiltration. Subpopulations of activated [Cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38)] innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), play distinct roles in modulating renal function and blood pressure. It is unknown how these cells become CD38+ or which subtypes are pro-hypertensive. When bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs) were grown in granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and treated with salt or A2, CD38+ macrophages and CD38+ DCs increased. The adoptive transfer of GM-CSF-primed BMDMs into mice with either SSHTN or A2HTN increased renal CD38+ macrophages and CD38+ DCs. Flow cytometry revealed increased renal M1 macrophages and type-2 conventional DCs (cDC2s), along with their CD38+ counterparts, in mice with either SSHTN or A2HTN. These results were replicable in vitro. Either salt or A2 treatment of GM-CSF-primed BMDMs significantly increased bone marrow-derived (BMD)-M1 macrophages, CD38+ BMD-M1 macrophages, BMD-cDC2s, and CD38+ BMD-cDC2s. Overall, these data suggest that GM-CSF is necessary for the salt or A2 induction of CD38+ innate immune cells, and that CD38 distinguishes pro-hypertensive immune cells. Further investigation of CD38+ M1 macrophages and CD38+ cDC2s could provide new therapeutic targets for both SSHTN and A2HTN.">

Methods: IHC and multiplex IHC analysis the relationships among tumour-associated macrophage (TAM), VM and EBV infection in EBV-associated epithelial cancer biopsies. In vitro and in vivo evidence using CRISPR-Cas9 system engineered EBV-infected epithelial cancer cells and mouse models support functional role and mechanism for M2c-like macrophages in the VM formation. The prediction of VM in the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic agent was analysed using clinical datasets. Results: EBV-associated epithelial cancer biopsies revealed that infiltration of the TAM surrounding the VM is closely associated with EBV infection. AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway in EBV-infected epithelial cancer cells control the secretion of CCL5 and CSF-1, enabling the recruitment of monocytes and their differentiation into M2c macrophages which promote VM formation by MMP9. Combination of anti-angiogenesis agents and HIF-1α inhibitor caused marked decreases in CD31-positive micro-vessels, VM, and M2c-like macrophages. VM scores can be used as biomarkers to predict the efficacy of anti-angiogenic agent therapy in EBV-associated epithelial cancers. Conclusions: Our findings define a secretory cross-talk between tumour cells and the immune microenvironment in EBV-associated epithelial cancer, revealing an unexpected role of EBV in epithelial cancer cells, controlling VM formation via M2c-like macrophages.">

        <tr id="The bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) has highly specialized anatomical characteristics that provide a sanctuary place for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that allow appropriate proliferation, maintenance, and self-renewal capacity. Several cell types contribute to the constitution and function of the bone marrow niche. Interestingly, uncovering the secrets of BMM and its interaction with HSCs in health paved the road for research aiming at better understanding the concept of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and their altered niche. In fact, they share many signals that are responsible for interactions between LSCs and the bone marrow niche, due to several biological similarities between LSCs and HSCs. On the other hand, LSCs differ from HSCs in their abnormal activation of important signaling pathways that regulate survival, proliferation, drug resistance, invasion, and spread. Targeting these altered niches can help in better treatment choices for hematological malignancies and bone marrow disorders in general and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in particular. Moreover, targeting those niches may help in decreasing the emergence of drug resistance and lower the relapse rate. In this article, the authors reviewed the most recent literature on bone marrow niches and their relations with either normal HSCs and AML cells/LSC, by focusing on pathogenetic and therapeutic implications.">

        <tr id="Bone metastases, a common and debilitating consequence of advanced cancers, involve a complex interplay between malignant cells and the bone microenvironment. Central to this interaction are interleukins (ILs), a group of cytokines with critical roles in immune modulation and inflammation. This review explores the dualistic nature of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory interleukins in bone metastases, emphasizing their molecular mechanisms, pathological impacts, and therapeutic potential. Pro-inflammatory interleukins, such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, have been identified as key drivers in promoting osteoclastogenesis, tumor proliferation, and angiogenesis. These cytokines create a favorable environment for cancer cell survival and bone degradation, contributing to the progression of metastatic lesions. Conversely, anti-inflammatory interleukins, including IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, exhibit protective roles by modulating immune responses and inhibiting osteoclast activity. Understanding these opposing effects is crucial for developing targeted therapies aimed at disrupting the pathological processes in bone metastases. Key signaling pathways, including NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and MAPK, mediate the actions of these interleukins, influencing tumor cell survival, immune cell recruitment, and bone remodeling. Targeting these pathways presents promising therapeutic avenues. Current treatment strategies, such as the use of denosumab, tocilizumab, and emerging agents like bimekizumab and ANV419, highlight the potential of interleukin-targeted therapies in mitigating bone metastases. However, challenges such as therapeutic resistance, side effects, and long-term efficacy remain significant hurdles. This review also addresses the potential of interleukins as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, offering insights into patient stratification and personalized treatment approaches. Interleukins have multifaceted roles that depend on the context, including the environment, cell types, and cellular interactions. Despite substantial progress, gaps in research persist, particularly regarding the precise mechanisms by which interleukins influence the bone metastatic niche and their broader clinical implications. While not exhaustive, this overview underscores the critical roles of interleukins in bone metastases and highlights the need for continued research to fully elucidate their complex interactions and therapeutic potential. Addressing these gaps will be essential for advancing our understanding and treatment of bone metastases in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="Chronic infection with Schistosoma mansoni parasites is associated with reduced allergic sensitization in humans, while schistosome eggs protects against allergic airway inflammation (AAI) in mice. One of the main secretory/excretory molecules from schistosome eggs is the glycosylated T2-RNAse Omega-1 (ω1). We hypothesized that ω1 induces protection against AAI during infection. Peritoneal administration of ω1 prior to sensitization with Ovalbumin (OVA) reduced airway eosinophilia and pathology, and OVA-specific Th2 responses upon challenge, independent from changes in regulatory T cells. ω1 was taken up by monocyte-derived dendritic cells, mannose receptor (CD206)-positive conventional type 2 dendritic cells (CD206+ cDC2), and by recruited peritoneal macrophages. Additionally, ω1 impaired CCR7, F-actin, and costimulatory molecule expression on myeloid cells and cDC2 migration in and ex vivo, as evidenced by reduced OVA+ CD206+ cDC2 in the draining mediastinal lymph nodes (medLn) and retainment in the peritoneal cavity, while antigen processing and presentation in cDC2 were not affected by ω1 treatment. Importantly, RNAse mutant ω1 was unable to reduce AAI or affect DC migration, indicating that ω1 effects are dependent on its RNAse activity. Altogether, ω1 hampers migration of OVA+ cDC2 to the draining medLn in mice, elucidating how ω1 prevents allergic airway inflammation in the OVA/alum mouse model.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoints (ICPs), such as programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1), is used as a treatment option for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, overall response rate to anti-PD-L1 treatment is limited due to antigen heterogeneity and the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), an ICP as well as a neoexpressed tumor-associated antigen, is previously demonstrated to be a beneficial target in combination with anti-PD-L1. In this study, a nanobody-based trispecific T cell engager (Nb-TriTE) is developed, capable of simultaneously binding to T cells, macrophages, and cancer cells while redirecting T cells toward tumor cells expressing PD-L1- and/or HLA-G. Nb-TriTE shows broad spectrum anti-tumor effects in vitro by augmenting cytotoxicity mediated by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In a humanized immunodeficient murine NSCLC model, Nb-TriTE exhibits superior anti-cancer potency compared to monoclonal antibodies and bispecific T cell engagers. Nb-TriTE, at the dose with pharmacoactivity, does not induce additional enhancement of circulating cytokines secretion from PMBCs. Nb-TriTE effectively prolongs the survival of mice without obvious adverse events. In conclusion, this study introduces an innovative therapeutic approach to address the challenges of immunotherapy and the tumor microenvironment in NSCLC through utilizing the dual ICP-targeting Nb-TriTE.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils are essential components of the innate immune system, playing a pivotal role in immune responses. These cells rapidly migrate to sites of inflammation or tissue injury, facilitating pathogen clearance and tissue repair. The chemotactic signaling network regulating neutrophil recruitment is complex and not fully understood, particularly regarding damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In our previous research, we identified NMI as a DAMP that activates dendritic cells and macrophages, amplifying inflammatory responses and contributing to both acute and chronic inflammation. In this study, we investigated the role of NMI in neutrophil recruitment. We purified and characterized a recombinant murine NMI protein, ensuring endotoxin removal while preserving biological activity. In vivo experiments demonstrated that NMI enhances neutrophil recruitment in both a murine air pouch model and an acute peritonitis model, mediated by macrophage-derived chemokines. In vitro assays revealed a concentration-dependent increase in neutrophil migration induced by NMI, facilitated by chemokine secretion and subsequent migration through the CXCR2 receptor. Importantly, we established that NMI activates chemokine expression via the NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of NMI-induced neutrophil migration, enhancing our understanding of neutrophil recruitment during inflammation.">

        <tr id="The programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) immune checkpoint constitutes an inhibitory pathway best known for its regulation of cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cell-mediated immune responses. Engagement of PD-L1 with PD-1 expressed on CD8+ T cells activates downstream signaling pathways that culminate in T cell exhaustion and/or apoptosis. Physiologically, these immunosuppressive effects exist to prevent autoimmunity, but cancer cells exploit this pathway by overexpressing PD-L1 to facilitate immune escape. Intravenously (IV) administered immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that block the interaction between PD-1/PD-L1 have achieved great success in reversing T cell exhaustion and promoting tumor regression in various malignancies. However, these ICIs can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to off-tumor toxicities which limits their therapeutic potential. Therefore, considerable effort has been channeled into exploring alternative delivery strategies that enhance tumor-directed delivery of PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs and reduce irAEs. Here, we briefly describe PD-1/PD-L1-targeted cancer immunotherapy and associated irAEs. We then provide a detailed review of alternative delivery approaches, including locoregional (LDD)-, oncolytic virus (OV)-, nanoparticle (NP)-, and ultrasound and microbubble (USMB)-mediated delivery that are currently under investigation for enhancing tumor-specific delivery to minimize toxic off-tumor effects. We conclude with a commentary on key challenges associated with these delivery methods and potential strategies to mitigate them.">

        <tr id="HIV-induced persistent immune activation is a key mediator of inflammatory comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurocognitive disorders. While a preponderance of data indicate that gut barrier disruption and microbial translocation are drivers of chronic immune activation, the molecular mechanisms of this persistent inflammatory state remain poorly understood. Here, utilizing the nonhuman primate model of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection with suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), we investigated activation of inflammasome pathways and their association with intestinal epithelial barrier disruption (IEBD). Longitudinal blood samples obtained from rhesus macaques with chronic SIV infection and long-term suppressive ART were evaluated for IEBD biomarkers, inflammasome activation (IL-1β and IL-18), inflammatory cytokines, and triglyceride (TG) levels. Activated monocyte subpopulations and glycolytic potential were investigated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). During the chronic phase of treated SIV infection, elevated levels of plasma IL-1β and IL-18 were observed following the hallmark increase in IEBD biomarkers, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP) and LPS-binding protein (LBP). Further, significant correlations of plasma IFABP levels with IL-1β and IL-18 were observed between 10 and 12 months of ART. Higher levels of sCD14, IL-6, and GM-CSF, among other inflammatory mediators, were also observed only during the long-term SIV + ART phase along with a trend of increase in the frequencies of activated CD14+CD16+ intermediate monocyte subpopulations. Lastly, we found elevated levels of blood TG and higher glycolytic capacity in PBMCs of chronic SIV-infected macaques with long-term ART. The increase in circulating IL-18 and IL-1β following IEBD and their significant positive correlation with IFABP suggest a connection between gut barrier disruption and inflammasome activation during chronic SIV infection, despite viral suppression with ART. Additionally, the increase in markers of monocyte activation, along with elevated TG and enhanced glycolytic pathway activity, indicates metabolic remodeling that could fuel metabolic syndrome. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which gut dysfunction and inflammasome activation contribute to HIV-associated metabolic complications, enabling targeted interventions in people with HIV.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignancy of immature myeloid blast cells with stem-like and chemoresistant cells being retained in the bone marrow through CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling. Current CXCR4 inhibitors mobilize AML cells into the bloodstream where they become more chemosensitive have failed to improve patient survival, likely reflecting persistent receptor localization on target cells. Here we characterize the signaling properties of CXCL12-locked dimer (CXCL12-LD), a bioengineered variant of the dimeric CXCL12 structure. CXCL12-LD binding resulted in lower levels of G protein, β-arrestin, and intracellular calcium mobilization, consistent with the locked dimer being a partial agonist of CXCR4. Further, CXCL12-LD failed to induce chemotaxis in AML cells. Despite these partial agonist properties, CXCL12-LD increased CXCR4 internalization compared to wildtype and locked-monomer forms of CXCL12. Analysis of a previously published AML transcriptomic data showed CXCR4 positive AML cells co-express genes involved in chemoresistance and maintenance of a blast-like state. The CXCL12-LD partial agonist effectively mobilized stem cells into the bloodstream in mice suggesting a potential role for their use in targeting CXCR4. Together, our results suggest that enhanced internalization by CXCL12-LD partial agonist signaling can avoid pharmacodynamic tolerance and may identify new avenues to better target GPCRs.">

Despite this abundance, the functions of porcine γδ T cells are mostly unidentified. In humans and mice, activated γδ T cells exhibit broad innate cytotoxic activity against a wide variety of stressed, infected, and cancerous cells through death receptor/ligand-dependent and perforin/granzyme-dependent pathways. However, so far, it is unknown whether porcine γδ T cells have the ability to perform cytotoxic functions. Methods In this study, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of porcine γδ T cells isolated from blood, lung, and nasal mucosa. To further analyze the cytolytic potential of γδ T cells, in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed using purified γδ T cells as effector cells and virus-exposed or mock-treated primary porcine alveolar macrophages as target cells. Results Our results show that only CD2+ γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers (CD16, NKp46, perforin) with higher perforin and NKp46 expression in γδ T cells isolated from lung and nasal mucosa. Moreover, we found that γδ T cells can exhibit cytotoxic functions in a cell-cell contact and degranulation-dependent manner. However, porcine γδ T cells did not seem to specifically target Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus or swine Influenza A Virus-infected macrophages, which may be due to viral escape mechanisms. Conclusion Porcine γδ T cells express cytotoxic markers and can exhibit cytotoxic activity in vitro. The specific mechanisms by which porcine γδ T cells recognize target cells are not fully understood but may involve the detection of cellular stress signals.">

        <tr id="Currently, only 20-40% of cancer patients benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and characterizing dynamic changes in the immunological landscape during treatment are critical for improving responsiveness to immunotherapy. Here, we identified JNK signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a regulator of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of bladder cancer treated with a JNK inhibitor revealed enhanced cytotoxicity and effector functions of CD8+ T cells. In untreated tumors, CAFs interacted frequently with CD8+ T cells and mediated their exhaustion. JNK inhibition abrogated the immunosuppression function of CAFs by downregulating the expression of TSLP, thereby restoring CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. In addition, blockade of CAF-derived TSLP in combination with anti-PD1 treatment promoted tumor elimination by CD8+ T cells in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that JNK signaling plays an important immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment by promoting expression of TSLP in CAFs and suggest that inhibiting JNK signaling could be a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cervical cancer has the second-highest mortality rate among malignant tumors of the female reproductive system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade are promising therapeutic agents, but their efficacy when combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has not been fully tested, and how they alter the tumor microenvironment has not been comprehensively elucidated. Methods In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing using 46,950 cells from nine human cervical cancer tissues representing sequential different stages of NACT and PD-1 blockade combination therapy. We delineated the trajectory of cervical epithelial cells and identified the crucial factors involved in combination therapy. Cell–cell communication analysis was performed between tumor and immune cells. In addition, THP-1-derived and primary monocyte-derived macrophages were cocultured with cervical cancer cells and phagocytosis was detected by flow cytometry. The antitumor activity of blocking CD74 was validated in vivo using a CD74 humanized subcutaneous tumor model. Results Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that NACT activated cytokine and complement-related immune responses. Cell–cell communication analysis revealed that after NACT therapy, interaction strength between T cells and cancer cells decreased, but intensified between macrophages and cancer cells. We verified that macrophages were necessary for the PD-1 blockade to exert antitumor effects in vitro. Additionally, CD74-positive macrophages frequently interacted with the most immunoreactive epithelial subgroup 3 (Epi3) cancer subgroup during combination NACT. We found that CD74 upregulation limited phagocytosis and stimulated M2 polarization, whereas CD74 blockade enhanced macrophage phagocytosis, decreasing cervical cancer cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions Our study reveals the dynamic cell–cell interaction network in the cervical cancer microenvironment influenced by combining NACT and PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, blocking tumor-associated macrophage-derived CD74 could augment neoadjuvant therapeutic efficacy.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy (HAM) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease with unclear pathogenesis and no effective treatments. We aimed to investigate a novel mechanistic theory and treat HAM patients with rituximab, which can deplete CD20+ B lymphocytes in circulation.


METHODS
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data was analyzed to identify HTLV-1-associated B cells and their effect on T cells. An observational analysis of our HAM cohort was conducted to elucidate changes in the immunological microenvironment of these patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HAM patients were isolated to explore the efficacy of B cell depletion in vitro. To assess the effect of B-cell depletion on HAM patients, eligible participants in our cohort received rituximab therapy (NCT04004819).


RESULTS
ScRNA-seq results suggest a significant effect of HTLV-1-associated B cells on T cells. Additionally, HTLV-1 was found to infect B cells and depletion of B cells inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Number of B cells in HAM patients had positive correlation with the proviral load and infected cell counts. Depletion of B cells led to a reduction in HTLV-1 proviral load in vitro. Furthermore, in clinical trial, 14 HAM patients were enrolled. Three patients (21.4%) who received rituximab failed to achieve remission, compared to 24 (85.7%) patients received any other therapy that failed to achieve remission. With a low level of circulating B cells, the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in CD4+ T cells fell.


INTERPRETATION
This study provided evidence that depleting B-lymphocytes is an innovative strategy for treating patients with HAM and broadens the understanding of the role of B cells in infectious immunity.">

        <tr id="Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might impact disease progression in people living with HIV (PLWH), including those on effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). These individuals often experience chronic conditions characterized by proviral latency or low-level viral replication in CD4+ memory T cells and tissue macrophages. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ, can reactivate provirus expression in both primary cells and cell lines. These cytokines are often elevated in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can modulate HIV reactivation in infected cells. Here, we report that exposure of the chronically HIV-1-infected myeloid cell line U1 to two different SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates (ancestral and BA.5) reversed its latent state after 24 h. We also observed that SARS-CoV-2 exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) initially drove their polarization towards an M1 phenotype, which shifted towards M2 over time. This effect was associated with soluble factors released during the initial M1 polarization phase that reactivated HIV production in U1 cells, like MDM stimulated with the TLR agonist resiquimod. Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2-induced systemic inflammation and interaction with macrophages could influence proviral HIV-1 latency in myeloid cells in PLWH.">

It is targeted at the endolysosomal pathway but can also be secreted to the extracellular milieu or endocytosed by bystander cells. CstF was shown to be significantly increased in tuberculous pleurisy, and during HIV coinfection, pleural fluids display high viral loads. In human macrophages, our previous results revealed a strong upregulation of CstF in phagocytes activated by interferon γ or after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). CstF manipulation using RNA silencing led to increased proteolytic activity of lysosomal cathepsins, improving Mtb intracellular killing. In the present work, we investigate the impact of CstF depletion in macrophages during the coinfection of Mtb-infected phagocytes with lymphocytes infected with HIV. The results indicate that decreasing the CstF released by phagocytes increases the major pro-granzyme convertase cathepsin C of cytotoxic immune cells from peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes. Consequently, an observed augmentation of the granzyme B cytolytic activity leads to a significant reduction in viral replication in HIV-infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes. Ultimately, this knowledge can be crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches to control both pathogens based on manipulating CstF.">

        <tr id="Alloreactive memory T cells have been implicated as central drivers of transplant rejection. Perplexingly, innate cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-12, are also associated with rejection of organ transplants. However, the pathways of innate immune activation in allogeneic transplantation are unclear. While the role of microbial and cell death products has been previously described, we identified alloreactive memory CD4 T cells as the primary triggers of innate inflammation. Memory CD4 T cells engaged MHC II-mismatched dendritic cells (DCs), leading to the production of innate inflammatory cytokines. This innate inflammation was independent of several pattern recognition receptors and was primarily driven by TNF superfamily ligands expressed by alloreactive memory CD4 T cells. Blocking of CD40L and TNFα resulted in dampened inflammation, and mice genetically deficient in these molecules exhibited prolonged survival of cardiac allografts. Furthermore, myeloid cell and CD8 T cell infiltration into cardiac transplants was compromised in both CD40L- and TNFα-deficient recipients. Strikingly, we found that priming of naive alloreactive CD8 T cells was dependent on licensing of DCs by memory CD4 T cells. This study unravels the key mechanisms by which alloreactive memory CD4 T cells contribute to destructive pathology and transplant rejection.">

        <tr id="This study aimed at defining the role of the B-cell adaptor protein BANK1 in the appearance of age-associated B cells (ABCs) in two SLE mouse models (TLR7.tg6 and Imiquimod-induced mice), crossed with Bank1-/- mice. The absence of Bank1 led to a significant reduction in ABC levels, also affecting other B cell populations. To gain deeper insights into their differentiation pathway and the impact of Bank1 on B cell populations, a single-cell transcriptome assay was performed. In the TLR7.tg6 model, we identified 10 clusters within B cells, including an ABC-specific cluster which was decreased in Bank1-deficient mice. In its absence, ABCs exhibited an anti-inflammatory gene expression profile, while being pro-inflammatory in Bank1-sufficient lupus mice. Trajectory analyses revealed that ABCs originated from marginal zone and memory-like B cells, ultimately acquiring transcriptional characteristics associated with atypical memory cells and long-lived plasma cells. Also, Bank1 deficiency normalized the presence of naïve B cells, which were nearly absent in lupus mice. Interestingly, Bank1 deficiency significantly reduced a distinct cluster containing IFN-responsive genes. These findings underscore the critical role of Bank1 in ABC development, impacting early B cell stages towards ABC differentiation, and the presence of IFN-stimulated gene-containing B cells, both populations determinant for autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="Cellular senescence has been increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer, reflecting its association with aging and inflammation, its role as a response to deregulated proliferation and oncogenic stress, and its induction by cancer therapies. While therapy-induced senescence (TIS) has been linked to resistance, recurrence, metastasis, and normal tissue toxicity, TIS also has the potential to enhance therapy response and stimulate anti-tumor immunity. In this review, we examine the Jekyll and Hyde nature of senescent cells (SnCs), focusing on how their persistence while expressing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) modulates the tumor microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Through the SASP, SnCs can mediate both resistance and response to cancer therapies. To fulfill the unmet potential of cancer immunotherapy, we consider how SnCs may influence tumor inflammation and serve as an antigen source to potentiate anti-tumor immune response. This new perspective suggests treatment approaches based on TIS to enhance immune checkpoint blockade. Finally, we describe strategies for mitigating the detrimental effects of senescence, such as modulating the SASP or targeting SnC persistence, which may enhance the overall benefits of cancer treatment.">

        <tr id="Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia diagnosed in adults. Despite advances in medical care, the treatment of AML still faces many challenges, such as treatment-related toxicities, that limit the use of high-intensity chemotherapy, especially in elderly patients. Currently, various immunotherapeutic approaches, that is, CAR-T cells, BiTEs, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, are being tested in clinical trials to prolong remission and improve the overall survival of AML patients. However, early reports show only limited benefits of these interventions and only in a subset of patients, showing the need for better patient stratification based on immunological markers. We have therefore developed and optimized a 30-color panel for evaluation of effector immune cell (NK cells, γδ T cells, NKT-like T cells, and classical T cells) infiltration into the bone marrow and analysis of their phenotype with regard to their differentiation, expression of inhibitory (PD-1, TIGIT, Tim3, NKG2A) and activating receptors (DNAM-1, NKG2D). We also evaluate the immune evasive phenotype of CD33+ myeloid cells, CD34+CD38-, and CD34+CD38+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by analyzing the expression of inhibitory ligands such as PD-L1, CD112, CD155, and CD200. Our panel can be a valuable tool for patient stratification in clinical trials and can also be used to broaden our understanding of check-point inhibitory networks in AML.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly lethal and resistant to immunotherapy. Although immune recognition can be enhanced with immunomodulatory agents including checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines, few patients experience clinical efficacy because the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) is dominated by immunosuppressive myeloid cells that impose T cell inhibition. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) was reported to downregulate metabolic regulators arginase and iNOS in immunosuppressive myeloid cells and enhance immunity against immune-sensitive tumors including head and neck cancers. We show for the first time that combining a PDE5 inhibitor, tadalafil, with a mesothelin-specific vaccine, anti-PD1, and anti-CTLA4 yields antitumor efficacy even against immune-resistant PDAC. To determine immunologic advantages conferred by tadalafil, we profiled the TiME using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA analysis with Domino to infer intercellular signaling. Our analyses demonstrated that tadalafil reprograms myeloid cells to be less immunosuppressive. Moreover, tadalafil synergized with the vaccine, enhancing T cell activation including mesothelin-specific T cells. Tadalafil treatment was also associated with myeloid-T cell signaling axes important for antitumor responses (e.g., Cxcr3, Il12). Our study shows that PDE5 inhibition combined with vaccine-based immunotherapy promotes pro-inflammatory states of myeloid cells, activation of T cells, and enhanced myeloid-T cell crosstalk to yield antitumor efficacy against immune-resistant PDAC.">

        <tr id="Aging is a complex multifactorial process associated with epigenome dysregulation, increased cellular senescence, and decreased rejuvenation capacity. Short-term cyclic expression of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), and cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (cMyc) (OSKM) in wild-type mice improves health but fails to distinguish cell states, posing risks to healthy cells. Here, we delivered a single dose of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) harboring OSK under the control of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a) promoter to specifically partially reprogram aged and stressed cells in a mouse model of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Mice showed reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and extended life spans upon aged cell–specific OSK expression. The bone marrow and spleen, in particular, showed pronounced gene expression changes, and partial reprogramming in aged HGPS mice led to a shift in the cellular composition of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment toward that of young mice. Administration of AAVs carrying Cdkn2a-OSK to naturally aged wild-type mice also delayed aging phenotypes and extended life spans without altering the incidence of tumor development. Furthermore, intradermal injection of AAVs carrying Cdkn2a-OSK led to improved wound healing in aged wild-type mice. Expression of CDKN2A-OSK in aging or stressed human primary fibroblasts led to reduced expression of inflammation-related genes but did not alter the expression of cell cycle–related genes. This targeted partial reprogramming approach may therefore facilitate the development of strategies to improve health and life span and enhance resilience in the elderly. Reprogramming aged cells through targeted overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 leads to beneficial health effects in progeroid and aged mice. Editor’s summary Partial cellular reprogramming via cyclic expression of octamer-binding transcription factor 4, sex-determining region Y-box 2, Kruppel-like factor 4, and cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (OSKM) improves health and life span in mouse models but may lead to tumor induction or organ damage. Here, Sahu and colleagues used adeno-associated viruses to deliver OSK under the control of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (Cdkn2a) promoter to specifically target stressed and senescent cells in a mouse model of Hutchinson-Guilford progeria syndrome. Treatment extended life spans and improved overall fitness, associated with a shift in the transcriptome toward that seen in younger mice. Similar effects occurred in aged wild-type mice and treatment did not increase tumor occurrence, suggesting that targeting partial cellular reprogramming to specific cell populations may be a more viable rejuvenation strategy moving forward. —Melissa L.

        <tr id="Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) is a receptor for formylated peptides and specific pro-resolving mediators, and is involved in various inflammatory processes. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of FPR2 in dendritic cell (DC) function and autoimmunity-related central nervous system (CNS) inflammation by using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. EAE induction was accompanied by increased Fpr2 mRNA expression in the spinal cord. FPR2-deficient (Fpr2 KO) mice displayed delayed onset of EAE compared to wild-type (WT) mice, associated with reduced frequencies of Th17 cells in the inflamed spinal cord at the early stage of the disease. However, FPR2 deficiency did not affect EAE severity after the disease reached its peak. FPR2 deficiency in mature DCs resulted in decreased expression of Th17 polarizing cytokines IL6, IL23p19, IL1β, and thereby diminished the DC-mediated activation of Th17 cell differentiation. LPS-activated FPR2-deficient DCs showed upregulated Nos2 expression and nitric oxide (NO) production, as well as reduced oxygen consumption rate and impaired mitochondrial function, including decreased mitochondrial superoxide levels, lower mitochondrial membrane potential and diminished expression of genes related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and genes related to the electron transport chain, as compared to WT DCs. Treatment with a NO inhibitor reversed the reduced Th17 cell differentiation in the presence of FPR2-deficient DCs. Together, by regulating DC metabolism, FPR2 enhances the production of DC-derived Th17-polarizing cytokines and hence Th17 cell differentiation in the context of neuroinflammation.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Mucosal enrichment of the Adherent-Invasive E. coli (AIEC) pathotype and the expansion of pathogenic IFNγ-producing Th17 (pTh17) cells have been linked to Crohn’s Disease (CD) pathogenesis. However, the molecular pathways underlying the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell transdifferentiation in CD patients remain elusive. To this aim, we created and functionally screened a transposon AIEC mutant library of 10.058 mutants to identify the virulence determinants directly implicated in triggering IL-23 production and pTh17 cell generation. pTh17 cell transdifferentiation was assessed in functional assays by co-culturing AIEC-infected human dendritic cells (DCs) with autologous conventional Th17 (cTh17) cells isolated from blood of Healthy Donors (HD) or CD patients. AIEC triggered IL-23 hypersecretion and transdifferentiation of cTh17 into pTh17 cells selectively through the interaction with CD-derived DCs. Moreover, the chronic release of IL-23 by AIEC-colonized DCs required a continuous IL-23 neutralization to significantly reduce the AIEC-dependent pTh17 cell differentiation. The multi-step screenings of the AIEC mutant’s library revealed that deletion of ybaT or rfaP efficiently hinder the IL-23 hypersecretion and hampered the AIEC-dependent skewing of protective cTh17 into pathogenic IFNγ-producing pTh17 cells. Overall, our findings indicate that ybaT (inner membrane transport protein) and rfaP (LPS-core heptose kinase) represent novel and attractive candidate targets to prevent chronic intestinal inflammation in CD.">

Despite extensive treatments, the prognosis for CCA remains poor, emphasizing the critical need for the development of novel treatments.

In this study, we cultured innate immune cells obtained from the peripheral blood of healthy adults and conducted a comparative analysis of the effector functions against CCA cell lines by Vδ2 γδ T cells and NK cells. This analysis was performed using standard short- and long-term cytotoxicity assays, as well as ELISA for IFN-γ. Vδ2 γδ T cells demonstrated cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production in response to CCA cells in a TCR-dependent manner, particularly in the presence of tetrakis-pivaloyloxymethyl 2-(thiazole-2-ylamino)ethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate, a bisphosphonate prodrug. In contrast, direct killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity were relatively slow and weak. Conversely, NK cells displayed potent, direct cytotoxicity against CCA cells. In summary, both Vδ2 γδ T cells and NK cells show promise as innate immune effector cells for adoptive transfer therapy in the context of CCA.">

        <tr id="The cGAS/STING pathway is a crucial immune activator in cancer biology, triggering innate immunosurveillance against tumors by sensing and reacting to endogenous mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In this issue of Cancer Research, research by Saha and colleagues highlights the significant impact of serine deprivation on this pathway, thereby unveiling its potential for anticancer therapy. Serine is essential for cellular metabolism and influences tumor growth and immune responses. Depriving cells of serine caused mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of mtDNA into the cytosol, activating the cGAS/STING pathway and inducing type I IFN responses. In mouse models, serine deprivation enhanced antitumor immunity, with increased tumoral immune infiltration, including CD4+/CD8+ T cells and type I IFN responses. Clinically, a genetic signature indicative of lower serine enrichment in colorectal cancer patients correlated with immune activation and improved survival. Furthermore, combining serine deprivation with PD1 blockade significantly reduced tumor volume and led to long-term immunity in mice, suggesting that serine depletion enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. These findings propose serine deprivation as a promising strategy to boost antitumor immunity and improve cancer patient outcomes. See related article by Saha et al., p. 2645.">

        <tr id="Tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) greatly contribute to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) resistance of cancer. However, its underlying mechanisms and whether TAMs can be promising targets to overcome ICI resistance remain to be unveiled. Through integrative analysis of immune multiomics data and single‐cell RNA‐seq data (iMOS) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lymphotoxin β receptor (LTBR) is identified as a potential immune checkpoint of TAMs, whose high expression, duplication, and low methylation are correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Immunofluorescence staining shows that the infiltration of LTBR+ TAMs is associated with LUAD stages, immunotherapy failure, and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, LTΒR maintains immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype of TAMs by noncanonical nuclear factor kappa B and Wnt/β‐catenin signaling pathways. Macrophage‐specific knockout of LTBR hinders tumor growth and prolongs survival time via blocking TAM immunosuppressive activity and M2 phenotype. Moreover, TAM‐targeted delivery of LTΒR small interfering RNA improves the therapeutic effect of ICI via reversing TAM‐mediated immunosuppression, such as boosting cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and inhibiting granulocytic myeloid‐derived suppressor cells infiltration. Taken together, we bring forth an immune checkpoint discovery pipeline iMOS, identify LTBR as a novel immune checkpoint of TAMs, and propose a new immunotherapy strategy by targeting LTBR+ TAMs.">

        <tr id="STAT3 is required for Th17-cell differentiation, and dominant-negative STAT3 mutations cause Autosomal Dominant-Hyper-IgE Syndrome (AD-HIES), which is characterized by a lack of Th17-cells and recurrent infections with opportunistic extracellular pathogens. T-cell responses to opportunistic pathogens in AD-HIES patients have however not been characterized. We previously identified an enigmatic population of IL-10 producing CCR6+Th-cells that were largely non-polarised and lacked other subset-defining differentiation markers (“CCR6single-positive(SP)”). Here we report that CCR6SPT-cells are central memory T-cells (TCM) that expressed the stemness-associated transcription factors LEF1 and TCF7, but also RORγt, the lineage-defining transcription factor of Th17-cells. Non-polarized CCR6SPT-cells differentiated spontaneously to Th17-cells upon TCR stimulation, indicating that they were pre-committed to a Th17 fate. Spontaneous Th17 differentiation was promoted by an autocrine loop of STAT3-activating cytokines and inhibited by IL-4. IL-12 induced in addition IFN-γ, and consequently differentiation to Th1/17-cells. CCR6+T-cells were strongly reduced in AD-HIES and Th17- and Tfh17-cells were hardly detectable. However, the residual CCR6+T-cells contained Th1/17- and CCR6SPT-cells that proliferated in vivo. They produced high amounts of IL-10, indicating that, unexpectedly, IL-10 production by human T-cells is STAT3-independent in vivo. Intriguingly, opportunistic pathogens selectively activated CCR6+T-cells in AD-HIES patients to produce IL-10. Opportunistic bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis induced in addition IL-2 and IFN-γ. We conclude that Th17 differentiation is not completely impaired in the absence of STAT3 signalling but arrested at an early stage of CCR6+TCM. These pre-Th17-cells produce IL-10 and require STAT3 to differentiate to Th17-cells and to fight extracellular pathogens but could directly generate Th1/17-cells to contain intracellular bacteria. Significance AD-HIES patients have impaired STAT3 signalling, lack consequently Th17-cells and experience recurrent infections with opportunistic extracellular pathogens. These patients were key to the dogma that Th17-cells control extracellular pathogens, but T-cell responses to these pathogens have surprisingly never been analyzed. Here, we report that Th17 differentiation in response to opportunistic extracellular pathogens in the absence of STAT3 signalling is arrested at an early stage of pre-Th17-cells that produce high levels of IL-10. These otherwise non-polarised T-cells acquired IFN-gamma production with IL-12 that could enable them to contain intracellular bacteria. These surprising findings demonstrates that Th17 differentiation is not completely blocked in the absence of STAT3 signalling, and that IL-10 production by human T-cells is STAT3-independent in vivo.">

        <tr id="Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) arising from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are prominent in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). We have previously shown that CAF formation is triggered by exposure to reactive oxygen species-inducing chemotherapy and that CAF support chemoresistance by donating mitochondria to the cancer cells, through tunnelling nanotubes. In the present study, we show that exposure of MSC to ALL cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and primary cells or their conditioned media can also trigger CAF formation. Using bulk RNA sequencing in cell lines, we show that the MSC to CAF transition is accompanied by a robust interferon pathway response and we have validated this finding in primary cells. Using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we identify the take-up of leukaemia cell-derived mitochondrial dsRNA by MSC as a proximate trigger for the MSC to CAF transition. We show that inhibition of dsRNA formation in ALL cells by treatment with low-dose ethidium or the mitochondrial transcription inhibitor IMT1 or degradation of dsRNA in conditioned media by 100°C exposure ablates the ability of the ALL conditioned media to stimulate MSC to CAF transition. Our data reveal a novel and previously undescribed mechanism by which cancer cells induce a CAF phenotype in stromal cells, showing how B-ALL cells can directly induce the previously described niche-mediated protection within the bone marrow.">

In this issue of the JCI, Cubitt et al. investigated the role of CD8α, a coreceptor present on approximately 40% of human NK cells. IL-15 stimulation of CD8α– NK cells induced CD8α expression via the RUNX3 transcription factor, driving formation of a unique induced CD8α (iCD8α+) population. iCD8α+ NK cells displayed higher proliferation, metabolic activity, and antitumor cytotoxic function compared with preexisting CD8α+ and CD8α– subsets. Therefore, CD8α expression can be used to define a potential dynamic spectrum of NK cell expansion and function. Because these cells exhibit enhanced tumor control, they may be used to improve in NK cell therapies for patients with AML.">

        <tr id="Astrocytes are mediators of homeostasis but contribute to neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mounting evidence suggests involvement of peripheral immune cells in PD pathogenesis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the potential role of peripheral immune secreted cytokines in modulating midbrain astrocyte reactivity. Human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes were exposed to 5% and 10% CD4+ T cell conditioned media (CD4CM) for 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days to assess chronic exposure. Additionally, astrocytes were exposed to the Th17 cell cytokine, IL-17A (10 ng/mL), alone and in combination with TNF-α (0.3 ng/mL) to assess potential synergistic effects of both cytokines at 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days. CD4CM induced acute and chronic alterations in midbrain astrocytes. Increased NFκB translocation to the nucleus, increased expression of the pro-inflammatory genes, IL-1β, CXCL10 at 24 h, C3, LCN2, IL-6 at 24 and 48 h, as well as an increase in their release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and CXCL10 at both these time points were observed. A synergistic response to the combination of IL-17A and TNF-α on increasing inflammatory gene expression and cytokine release occurred. IL-17A and TNF-α increased intensity of S100β at 24 h, decreased nuclear area and increased circularity of astrocytes at 72 h. A synergistic effect on γH2AX intensity at 72 h and an increase in LDH release at 7 days was observed. Our results demonstrate that IL-17A and TNF-α act synergistically, enhancing midbrain astrocyte reactivity to a similar degree as CD4CM. This highlights the importance of the peripheral immune secreted cytokines in increasing the reactivity status of midbrain astrocytes, implicating their role in PD.">

        <tr id="The use of antitumor drugs represents a reliable strategy for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, drug resistance has become increasingly common and contributes to tumor metastasis and local recurrence. The tumor immune microenvironment (TME) consists of immune cells, cytokines and immunomodulators, and collectively they influence the response to treatment. Epigenetic changes including DNA methylation and histone modification, as well as increased drug exportation have been reported to contribute to the development of drug resistance in cancers. In the past few years, the majority of studies on tumors have only focused on the development and progression of a tumor from a mechanistic standpoint; few studies have examined whether the changes in the TME can also affect tumor growth and drug resistance. Recently, emerging evidence have raised more concerns regarding the role of TME in the development of drug resistance. In the present review, it was discussed how the suppressive TME adapts to drug resistance characterized by the cooperation of immune cells, cytokines, immunomodulators, stromal cells and extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it was reviewed how these immunological or metabolic changes alter immuno-surveillance and thus facilitate tumor drug resistance. In addition, potential targets present in the TME for developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve individualized therapy for cancer treatment were revealed.">

        <tr id="Influenza infections result in a significant number of severe illnesses annually, many of which are complicated by secondary bacterial super-infection. Primary influenza infection has been shown to increase susceptibility to secondary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection by altering the host immune response, leading to significant immunopathology. Type III interferons (IFNs), or IFNλs, have gained traction as potential antiviral therapeutics due to their restriction of viral replication without damaging inflammation. The role of IFNλ in regulating epithelial biology in super-infection has recently been established; however, the impact of IFNλ on immune cells is less defined. In this study, we infected wild-type and IFNLR1-/- mice with influenza A/PR/8/34 followed by S. aureus USA300. We demonstrated that global IFNLR1-/- mice have enhanced bacterial clearance through increased uptake by phagocytes, which was shown to be cell-intrinsic specifically in myeloid cells in mixed bone marrow chimeras. We also showed that depletion of IFNLR1 on CX3CR1 expressing myeloid immune cells, but not neutrophils, was sufficient to significantly reduce bacterial burden compared to mice with intact IFNLR1. These findings provide insight into how IFNλ in an influenza-infected lung impedes bacterial clearance during super-infection and show a direct cell intrinsic role for IFNλ signaling on myeloid cells.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains poor. Although serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) family members play crucial roles in tumors, their impact on tumor immunology remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of SRSF10 in HCC immunotherapy.


METHODS
To identify the key genes associated with immunotherapy resistance, we conducted single-nuclear RNA sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence, and The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus database analyses. We investigated the biological functions of SRSF10 in immune evasion using in vitro co-culture systems, flow cytometry, various tumor-bearing mouse models, and patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids.


RESULTS
SRSF10 was upregulated in various tumors and associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, SRSF10 positively regulated lactate production, and SRSF10/glycolysis/ histone H3 lysine 18 lactylation (H3K18la) formed a positive feedback loop in tumor cells. Increased lactate levels promoted M2 macrophage polarization, thereby inhibiting CD8+ T cell activity. Mechanistically, SRSF10 interacted with the 3'-untranslated region of MYB, enhancing MYB RNA stability, and subsequently upregulating key glycolysis-related enzymes including glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase 1 (HK1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), resulting in elevated intracellular and extracellular lactate levels. Lactate accumulation induced histone lactylation, which further upregulated SRSF10 expression. Additionally, lactate produced by tumors induced lactylation of the histone H3K18la site upon transport into macrophages, thereby activating transcription and enhancing pro-tumor macrophage activity. M2 macrophages, in turn, inhibited the enrichment of CD8+ T cells and the proportion of interferon-γ+CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thus creating an immunosuppressive TME. Clinically, SRSF10 could serve as a biomarker for assessing immunotherapy resistance in various solid tumors. Pharmacological targeting of SRSF10 with a selective inhibitor 1C8 enhanced the efficacy of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in both murine and human preclinical models.


CONCLUSIONS
The SRSF10/MYB/glycolysis/lactate axis is critical for triggering immune evasion and anti-PD-1 resistance. Inhibiting SRSF10 by 1C8 may overcome anti-PD-1 tolerance in HCC.">

        <tr id="In both humans and mice, natural killer (NK) cells are important lymphocytes of the innate immune system. They are often considered pro-inflammatory effector cells but may also have a regulatory or pro-resolving function by switching their cytokine profile towards the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β, and by killing pro-inflammatory immune cells. Here, the role of NK cells in the resolution of malaria lung pathology was studied. Malaria complications, such as malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS), are often lethal despite the rapid and efficient killing of Plasmodium parasites with antimalarial drugs. Hence, studying the resolution and healing mechanisms involved in the recovery from these complications could be useful to develop adjunctive treatments. Treatment of Plasmodium berghei NK65-infected C57BL/6 mice with a combination of artesunate and chloroquine starting at the appearance of symptoms was used as a model to study the resolution of MA-ARDS. The role of NK cells was studied using anti-NK1.1 depletion antibodies and NK cell-deficient mice. Using both methods, NK cells were found to be dispensable in the development of MA-ARDS, as shown previously. In contrast, NK cells were crucial in the initiation of resolution upon antimalarial treatment, as survival was significantly decreased in the absence of NK cells. Considerably increased IL-10 expression by NK cells suggested an anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving phenotype. Despite the increase in Il10 expression in the NK cells, inhibition of the IL-10/IL-10R axis using anti-IL10R antibodies had no effect on the resolution for MA-ARDS, suggesting that the pro-resolving effect of NK cells cannot solely be attributed to their IL-10 production. In conclusion, NK cells contribute to the resolution of experimental MA-ARDS.">

        <tr id="Broad T cell phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions were prominent in COVID-19. There are few and inconclusive data about the role of immune checkpoints for T cell exhaustion/activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients.We tested T cell subsets and immune checkpoints in 177 MM patients with COVID-19, as well as in 32 healthy infected controls and 42 uninfected MM patients. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulation and immune checkpoints (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, OX40, and 4-1BB) were evaluated by flow cytometry.We have found that pronounced lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio in severe COVID-19 patients were especially developed within the first month after infection. And T cell subset dysregulation was persistent in severe patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune checkpoints on CD4+ T cells were variable and uncorrelated with the level of adaptive immunity, while the proportion of CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with humoral immune response. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in severe patients and sustained for more than 2 months, which was associated with impaired cellular immune function. Moreover, exhausted molecules PD-1 and TIGIT on T cells were reduced in immunotherapy patients.The prolonged T cell dysregulation after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the close surveillance from reinfection in MM patients even during convalescence. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells could be important prognostic factors to stratify prognosis in MM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, immunotherapy may downregulate the expression of exhausted checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT, leading to T cell overactivation and severe COVID-19.">

 Immunotherapy has had very limited success in pancreatic cancer, due to its low mutational burden and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Our approach consists in redirecting pre- existing antiviral immunity against pancreatic tumors by delivering viral antigens using the tumor penetrating peptide iRGD .This peptide, targets the tumor vasculature through av integrins and neuropilin-1, delivering conjugated or co-administered cargo to tumors. Here we used mouse cytomegalovirus (CMV) as an infection model. CMV is a β-herpesvirus that induces a strong T-cell response in mice and humans, comprising >10% of all circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells mostly with effector-memory phenotype. Importantly, human CMV infects over 60% of the world’s population rendering it a suitable candidate for translation. Methods: Mice latently infected with CMV were orthotopically implanted with KPC pancreatic tumor cells and treated with systemic injections of vehicle or iRGD plus CMV class I and II binding peptides. Another cohort of age matched uninfected mice was used as a control. Tumor growth and mouse weight were monitored twice a week and CMV specific immune responses were measured in spleen, liver and tumor by flow cytometry, using tetramer staining and CMV specific peptide recall. Results: CMV infected mice receiving iRGD+CMV peptides responded to treatment as evidenced by delayed tumor growth associated with increased tumor necrosis and T cell infiltration. In addition, flow cytometry analysis of tumor, liver and spleen showed a significant increase in CMV specific T cells preferentially in the tumor. Surprisingly, these T cells preferentially infiltrated tumors regardless of the use of iRGD for tumor targeting of CMV peptides. Survival studies showed a marked increase in median survival, reaching 42 days in the infected and treated group, compared to 25 days in the vehicle treated one. The survival benefit was very similar in the presence or absence of iRGD. Combining this strategy with anti- PD1 and or anti-IL10R did not significantly improve the benefits of CMV therapy alone. On the other hand, combination with low dose gemcitabine (5mg/kg) significantly improved tumor growth delay and survival in the combination compared to either therapy alone. The median survival reached 49 days in the combination, compared to 39 for gemcitabine or CMV therapy alone and 32 for vehicle.Conclusions: We have recently performed single cell RNA sequencing in tumors from infected and CMV peptide or vehicle treated mice and will analyze the transcriptional profile and TCR sequence of the tumor infiltrating T cells. Preliminary analysis of this data shows a massive T cell infiltration and an increase in dendritic cells and macrophages in infected and treated mice. Taken together, this data shows we can deliver antigens to pancreatic tumors and elicit an anti-tumor immune response that results in delayed tumor growth and has a survival benefit. This is a mutation agnostic approach with high translational value, since more than 60% of the population has previous CMV immunity.

        <tr id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and establish a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respond in vivo to acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12 days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the homeostatic and preactivated microglia population decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hi and CD14hiCD16low CAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.">

        <tr id="Many chronic inflammatory diseases are attributed to disturbances in host-microbe interactions, which drive immune-mediated tissue damage. Depending on the anatomic setting, a chronic inflammatory disease can exert unique local and systemic influences, which provide an exceptional opportunity for understanding disease mechanism and testing therapeutic interventions. The oral cavity is an easily accessible environment that allows for protective interventions aiming at modulating the immune response to control disease processes driven by a breakdown of host-microbe homeostasis. Periodontal disease (PD) is a prevalent condition in which quantitative and qualitative changes of the oral microbiota (dysbiosis) trigger nonresolving chronic inflammation, progressive bone loss, and ultimately tooth loss. Here, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of local sustained delivery of the myeloid-recruiting chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in murine ligature-induced PD using clinically relevant models as a preventive, interventional, or reparative therapy. Local delivery of CCL2 into the periodontium inhibited bone loss and accelerated bone gain that could be ascribed to reduced osteoclasts numbers. CCL2 treatment up-regulated M2-macrophage and downregulated proinflammatory and pro-osteoclastic markers. Furthermore, single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing indicated that CCL2 therapy reversed disease-associated transcriptomic profiles of murine gingival macrophages via inhibiting the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) signaling in classically activated macrophages and inducing protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in infiltrating macrophages. Finally, 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing showed mitigation of microbial dysbiosis in the periodontium that correlated with a reduction in microbial load in CCL2-treated mice. This study reveals a novel protective effect of CCL2 local delivery in PD as a model for chronic inflammatory diseases caused by a disturbance in host-microbe homeostasis.">

        <tr id="Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the main residents in the bone marrow (BM) and have an essential role in the regulation of haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation and proliferation. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a group of myeloid disorders impacting haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSCPs) that are characterised by BM failure, ineffective haematopoiesis, cytopenia, and a high risk of transformation through the expansion of MDS clones together with additional genetic defects. It has been indicated that MSCs play anti-tumorigenic roles such as in cell cycle arrest and pro-tumorigenic roles including the induction of metastasis in MDS and leukaemia. Growing evidence has shown that MSCs have impaired functions in MDS, such as decreased proliferation capacity, differentiation ability, haematopoiesis support, and immunomodulation function and increased inflammatory alterations within the BM through some intracellular pathways such as Notch and Wnt and extracellular modulators abnormally secreted by MSCs, including increased expression of inflammatory factors and decreased expression of haematopoietic factors, contributing to the development and progression of MDSs. Therefore, MSCs can be targeted for the treatment of MDSs and leukaemia. However, it remains unclear what drives MSCs to behave abnormally. In this review, dysregulations in MSCs and their contributions to myeloid haematological malignancies will be discussed.">

Pharmacological inhibition as well as the short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor hindered memory transition and limited the homeostatic turnover of the activated CD8+ T cells. Dexamethasone exposure of CD8+ T cells expanded during a resolving infection with influenza A virus or a γ-herpesvirus promoted conversion of effector cells into memory cells by modulating cellular metabolism and lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Reduced reactive oxygen species levels in the responding effector cells upregulated Bcl2 and enhanced survival. The generated virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells were efficiently recalled following challenge of animals with a secondary infection to control it better. The memory-enhancing effect was predominantly evident at low doses of dexamethasone. Therefore, controlled glucocorticoid signaling within the effector CD8+ T cells is crucial for optimal memory differentiation.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Immune cell populations in the intestinal muscularis propria during colitis are poorly resolved. Maintaining homeostasis in this niche is critical, highlighted by the poorer prognosis of inflammatory bowel disease associated with muscularis propria inflammation.


METHODS
This study utilizes single-cell RNA sequencing to survey the immune cell populations within the muscularis propria of normal colon and dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Findings are validated by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and cell-lineage tracing in vivo, and in vitro assays with muscularis macrophages (MMφ).


RESULTS
In naïve conditions, transcriptional duality is observed in MMφs with 2 major subpopulations: conventional resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs and Lyve1+ MMφs. The Lyve1+ population is phagocytic and expresses several known MMφ markers in mouse and human, confirming their identity as a bona fide MMφ subset. Single-cell transcriptomics indicate that resident MMφs are retained during colitis and exhibit plasticity toward an inflammatory profile. Lyve1+ MMφs, which express anti-inflammatory marker CD163, are absent during colitis, as confirmed by flow cytometry. In contrast, lineage tracing finds that resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs remain during colitis and are not completely replaced by the inflammatory infiltrating monocytes. In vitro studies provide biological evidence of the plasticity of resident Cx3cr1+ MMφs in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), mirroring transcriptional observations in vivo of their inflammatory plasticity. Potential markers for colitic MMφs, validated in animal models and in individuals with ulcerative colitis, are identified.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings contribute to the understanding of the immune system in the muscularis propria niche during colitis by resolving the heterogeneity and origins of colitic MMφs.">

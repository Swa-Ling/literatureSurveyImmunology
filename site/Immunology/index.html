        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="The clearance of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) remains a significant public health challenge due to impaired cellular immune responses and HIV-1 maintenance during acute infection. However, the genetic and epigenetic changes influencing the immune response on host infected cells remain unclear. Here, this study analyzes HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) during early infection (<6 months) using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing. It is observed that HIV-1 hinders the antiviral response, particularly by interfering with the interferon signalling pathway. Multimodal analysis identifies KLF2 as a key transcription factor in infected CD4+ T cells. Moreover, cells harbouring HIV-1 provirus are predominantly identified as Th17 cells, which exhibit elevated KLF2 activity. This suggests an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and a constrained immune response due to the quiescent characteristics of these cells. The finding provides insights into the immune mechanisms and key regulators of HIV-1 maintenance in CD4+ T cells during the early stages of infection.">

        <tr id="Plasmacytoid Dendritic cells (pDCs) are the most potent producers of interferons, which are critical antiviral cytokines. pDC development is, however, compromised following a viral infection, and this phenomenon, as well as its relationship to conventional (c)DC development is still incompletely understood. By using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice as a model system, we observed that DC progenitors skewed away from pDC and towards cDC development during in vivo viral infection. Subsequent characterization of the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3+ (Flt3+) DC progenitors and follow-up studies revealed increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation in different individual DC-progenitors as well as a profound IFN-I-dependent ablation of pre-pDCs, but not pre-DC precursor, after both acute and chronic LCMV infections. In addition, integrated genomic analysis identified altered activity of 34 transcription factors in Flt3+ DC progenitors from infected mice, including two regulators of Glucocorticoid (GC) responses. Subsequent studies demonstrated that addition of GCs to DC progenitors led to downregulated pDC-primed-genes while upregulating cDC-primed-genes, and that endogenous GCs selectively decreased pDC, but not cDC, numbers upon in-vivo LCMV infection. These findings demonstrate a significant ablation of pre-pDCs in infected mice and identify GCs as suppressors of pDC generation from early progenitors. This provides an explanation for the impaired pDC development following viral infection and links pDC generation to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Significance Statement Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play critical roles in antiviral responses. However, adaptations of DC progenitors lead to compromised pDC generation after viral infection. Here, we characterized the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of DC progenitors after infection. We observed widespread changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility, reflecting shifts in proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation potential into various DC subsets. Notably, we identified alterations in the predicted activity of 34 transcription factors, including two regulators of glucocorticoid responses. Our data demonstrate that glucocorticoids inhibit pDC generation by reprogramming DC progenitors. These findings establish a molecular framework for understanding how DC progenitors adapt to infection and highlight the role of glucocorticoid signaling in this process.">

        <tr id="Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is a major oncogenic driver in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promising therapeutic effects, overcoming resistance with immunotherapy becomes necessary when resistance develops. However, various clinical trials have revealed that their efficacies remain limited. To investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) factors contributing to poor immune checkpoint blockade responses in ALK-positive patients, we performed single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors with and without ALK rearrangements. Integrative analysis with additional public LUAD cohorts revealed distinct immune landscapes in ALK-positive tumors, marked by enriched innate immunity and depleted adaptive immunity. ALK-positive malignant cells exhibit higher stemness and aggressive phenotype. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in these tumors predominantly maintain pro-tumoral M2-like states, reinforcing immune suppression. B cells show reduced immune reactivity and impaired tertiary lymphoid structure formation, while CD8+ T cells display bystander-like signatures and reduced tumor reactivity. Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles combined with regulatory network analysis suggest that differences in transcription factor activities, rather than chromatin accessibility, may underlie T cell dysfunction. These findings provide insights into the immunosuppressive TME of ALK-positive LUAD, potentially explaining the failure of recent immunotherapy trials and highlighting targets for improving efficacy.">

Diversion of interferon IFN signaling was associated with increased expression of inflammatory markers, enhanced release of inflammatory cytokines, and delayed contraction of infection-induced CD4+ T cells.

        <tr id="During homeostasis, innate and epithelial cells undergo continuous maturation, shaped by microbial, molecular and cellular interactions. While these cells influence adaptive immunity during steady-state conditions, the reciprocal homeostatic role of adaptive immune cells in the maturation and function of innate and epithelial cells remains underexplored. Here, through computational approaches and murine models, we establish that adaptive immunity shapes innate immune and epithelial homeostatic landscapes. Mechanistically, adaptive immunity acts as a brake on type 1 polarization and diversification of innate lymphocytes (ILCs). Without adaptive immunity, the innate cellular interactions within the mesenteric lymph nodes are dominated by an interferon-gamma (IFNγ) signaling network. Moreover, the innate immune and epithelial cells follow distinct phenotypic and functional trajectories, including ILCs acquiring myeloid markers, monocytes adopting an inflammatory path, and colonic epithelial cells expressing altered antimicrobial peptides and losing Paneth-like features. Depleting ILCs, abolishing IFNγ signaling, or restoring adaptive immunity reduces these IFNγ-driven changes. Thus, our findings highlight a homeostatic function of adaptive immunity in modulating innate and epithelial cell communication, diversity, composition, function, and differentiation, notably by limiting ILC-derived IFNγ.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) generally acquire immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting phenotypes, which may contribute to tumor resistance to immunotherapy. We previously showed that suppression of microRNA activity through genetic Dicer1 inactivation rewires TAM’s transcriptomes and prompts their immunostimulatory activation. This phenotypic switch enhanced recruitment and activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and improved the efficacy of immunotherapy in mouse cancer models. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of whole tumors grown in either wild-type mice or mice with macrophage-specific Dicer1 deletion. The analysis of multiple cell populations, including several discrete monocyte and macrophage subsets, indicated broad and convergent immunostimulatory programming of the tumor microenvironment, which was dependent on CTL-derived interferon-gamma (IFNγ), in mice with DICER-deficient macrophages. Intriguingly, dynamic inferences on monocyte/macrophage ontogeny and differentiation by pseudotime analysis revealed trajectories associated with progression into cell cycle, monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, and transition from an immunostimulatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype in tumors with DICER-proficient macrophages. Dicer1 deficiency interfered with this trajectory and stalled TAMs at an intermediate state between immature monocytes and macrophages with T cell-stimulatory capacity, thereby impeding immunosuppressive TAM development. This translated into enhanced response to antiangiogenic immunotherapy in an immunotherapy-resistant model of non-small cell lung cancer. Cycling/M2-like macrophages were conserved in human melanoma and hepatocellular carcinoma and should represent a more promising therapeutic target than the bulk of TAMs.">

        <tr id="Epigenetic reinforcement of T cell exhaustion is known to be a major barrier limiting T cell responses during immunotherapy. However, the core epigenetic regulators restricting antitumor immunity during prolonged antigen exposure are not clear. We investigated three commonly mutated epigenetic regulators that promote clonal hematopoiesis to determine whether they affect T cell stemness and response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. CD8 T cells lacking Dnmt3a, Tet2, or Asxl1 preserved a progenitor-exhausted (Tpex) population for more than 1 year during chronic antigen exposure without undergoing malignant transformation. Asxl1 controlled the self-renewal capacity of T cells and reduced CD8 T cell differentiation through H2AK119 ubiquitination and epigenetic modification of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase pathway. Asxl1-deficient T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy to improve tumor control in experimental models and conferred a survival advantage to mutated T cells from treated patients. Editor’s summary T cell immunotherapies have been successful in treating some intractable cancers, but there are limitations caused by the inability of T cells to persist after prolonged stimulation. Kang et al. undertook a reverse-translation approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating the durability of T cell responsiveness to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (see the Perspective by Tsui and Kallies). Inspired by clinical observations from individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome, the epigenetic regulators (Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1) associated with clonal hematopoiesis were identified using experimental models of T cell exhaustion. Epigenetic disruption of the polycomb group repressive deubiquitinase complex resulted in preservation of a stem cell–like T cell population that was responsive to immunotherapy. Extending this mechanism to cancer adoptive cell therapy, Asxl1 disruption was found to endow T cells with superior therapeutic efficacy and an ability to synergize with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy —Priscilla N. Kelly INTRODUCTION Sustained stimulation of CD8 T cells promotes the development of functional exhaustion, a terminal cell fate that has been broadly recognized to limit the durability of T cell–based immunotherapies. This state of exhaustion arises though a progressive transition of multipotent progenitor T cells (Tpex) into a terminally differentiated population (Tex) that has been defined as being nonresponsive to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). The molecular determinants dictating the developmental transition are now being investigated as engineering targets to block the progression of T cell exhaustion and preserve the durability of immunotherapy approaches. RATIONALE We recently observed that the long-term survival of a small cohort of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients treated with anti–PD-L1 therapy was coupled to mutation of the ASXL1 gene among their T cells. Mutations in ASXL1, in addition to DNMT3A and TET2, are commonly associated with conferring a survival advantage among hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in subclonal outgrowth referred to as clonal hematopoiesis. Because of their general link to cellular stemness, we investigated the role of these regulators in the developmental transition of Tpex into Tex and the impact of deletion of these regulators on therapeutic durability during anti–PD-L1 treatment. RESULTS To investigate the role of Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1 in the development and maintenance of an ICB-responsive T cell population, we engineered T cells to contain mutations within each of these genes and then exposed them to a chronic source of antigen by adoptively transferring them into mice infected with the clone 13 strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Disruption of these regulators in a canonical model of T cell exhaustion allowed them to maintain their quantity and ICB-responsive state for >1 year during chronic antigen exposure. Despite being stimulated and undergoing antigen-driven proliferation for 1 year, these T cells did not exhibit any signs of malignant outgrowth. Moreover, the total pool of T cells containing each of these mutations was enriched for a large quantity of stem-like Tcf1+ T cells. Fate-tracking adoptive transfer experiments revealed that this Tcf1+ subset of ASXL1 KO T cells could both self-renew and give rise to potent effectors. Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of the knockout (KO) T cells identified Asxl1 as a regulator of the polycomb group–repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, controlling the deubiquitination of histone 2A lysine 119, which serves as a molecular checkpoint for the developmental transition of Tpex into Tex. Extension of this mechanistic insight into tumor models revealed that adoptively transferred T cells with Asxl1 disruption resisted tumor microenvironment–induced exhaustion. Moreover, the adoptively transferred Asxl1 KO T cells synergized with anti–PD-L1 blockade, resulting in heightened tumor control. Finally, we show that Asxl1 disruption of tumor-specific T cells correlates with increased expansion of T cells in MDS patients after treatment with anti–PD-L1. CONCLUSION Results from these studies show that DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 control the developmental checkpoint between Tpex and terminally exhausted T cells. Specific investigation into Asxl1 revealed its role in T cell differentiation through epigenetic modification of the PR-DUB pathway. These data articulate a reverse-translation approach for defining molecular mechanisms that restrict maintenance of the ICB-responsive stem-like T cells within a suppressive tumor microenvironment. Through our mechanistic investigation of genes associated with patient survival, we have established a scientific rationale for specific genetic modification of discrete epigenetic regulators for future engineering to enhance the durability of cancer immunotherapy. Core epigenetic regulators in maintaining therapeutic durable multipotent Tpex populations. Using the canonical murine model system of exhaustion, disruption of Dnmt3a, Tet2, and Asxl1 in CD8 T cells preserved an ICB-responsive Tpex population for >1 year during chronic antigen exposure. Specific investigation into the new epigenetic regulator Asxl1 revealed that this unprecedented maintenance of Tpex is mediated by presence of monoubiqutinated histone 2A lysine 119 (H2AK119Ub) through disruption of the PR-DUB complex.">

        <tr id="Neurotropic alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are critical human pathogens that continually expand to naïve populations and for which there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics. VEEV is highly infectious via the aerosol route and is a recognized weaponizable biothreat that causes neurological disease in humans. The neuropathology of VEEV has been attributed to an inflammatory immune response in the brain yet the underlying mechanisms and specific immune cell populations involved are not fully elucidated. This study uses single-cell RNA sequencing to produce a comprehensive transcriptional profile of immune cells isolated from the brain over a time course of infection in a mouse model of VEEV. Analyses reveal differentially activated subpopulations of microglia, including a distinct type I interferon-expressing subpopulation. This is followed by the sequential infiltration of myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes, also comprising subpopulations with unique transcriptional signatures. We identify a subpopulation of myeloid cells that form a distinct localization pattern in the hippocampal region whereas lymphocytes are widely distributed, indicating differential modes of recruitment, including that to specific regions of the brain. Altogether, this study provides a high-resolution analysis of the immune response to VEEV in the brain and highlights potential avenues of investigation for therapeutics that target neuroinflammation in the brain. Author Summary Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes brain inflammation in both animals and humans when transmitted by mosquito bite or infectious aerosols. The mechanisms underlying disease caused by VEEV, including the role of the immune response in brain pathology, are not well understood. Here we performed a comprehensive assessment of the immune response to VEEV in the brain over time using two advanced sequencing techniques. Following infection, immune cells infiltrate the brain in a sequential fashion and display different activation profiles. Different types of immune cells also display strikingly different spatial patterns throughout the brain. This study provides the most comprehensive description of the immune response to VEEV in the brain performed to date and advances our understanding of immune-driven neuropathology and identification of therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="Tumor endothelial (TECs) cells play a critical role in regulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the mechanisms by which TECs modulate immune cell population remain unclear, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we investigated how NSCLC cells tweak normal endothelial cells (NECs) into TECs and the subsequent effects on immune regulation. NECs were cocultured with various NSCLC cell lines, using 2D and 3D coculture models to evaluate TEC-mediated effects on immune cells. We show that direct coculture led to significant transcriptomic, proteomic and kinomic alterations in TECs, especially in pro-inflammatory pathways. We identified a downregulation of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40L in TECs compared to NECs, suggesting impaired T-cell proliferation support. While TECs showed a limited effect on CD8+ T-cell activation, TECs supported CD4 T-cells polarization into Treg and Th22 subsets. Moreover, TECs also promoted M2-like macrophages polarization, thereby potentially contributing to the TME immunosuppression. State-of-the-art single-cell RNA sequencing of 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) revealed distinct TEC subpopulations, including an inflammatory subset with UPR signature. The latter was absent in 2D-cultured NECs but present in freshly isolated and 2D-cultured TECs from NSCLC patients. Importantly, we also identified within MCTS a perivascular M2-like macrophage subset, predicted to interact with TECs with MIF and Midkine signaling. In conclusion, TECs in NSCLC tumors play a pivotal role in remodeling the TME immune landscape by promoting immune suppression. This study highlights the complex immunoregulatory functions of TECs within our different in vitro models that mimic aspects of the TME. Our data may provide new insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting TECs or regulatory signaling to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in NSCLC.">

In mice, NK cells can kill T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, decreasing somatic hypermutation and vaccine responses. Although human NK cell activation correlates with poor vaccine response, the mechanisms of human NK cell regulation of adaptive immunity are poorly understood. We found that in human ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, broad neutralizers, who were capable of neutralizing Alpha, Beta, and Delta, had fewer NK cells that expressed inhibitory and immaturity markers whereas NK cells from narrow neutralizers were highly activated and expressed interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISG-mediated activation in NK cells from healthy donors increased cytotoxicity and functional responses to induced Tfh-like cells. This work reveals that NK cell activation and dysregulated inflammation may play a role in poor antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 and opens exciting avenues for designing improved vaccines and adjuvants to target emerging pathogens.">

        <tr id="During persistent antigen stimulation, PD-1+CD8 T cells are maintained by progenitor exhausted PD-1+TCF-1+CD8 T cells (Tpex). Tpex respond to PD-1 blockade, and regulation of Tpex differentiation into more functional Tex is of major interest for cancer immunotherapies. Tpex express high levels of Inducible Costimulator (ICOS), but the role of ICOS for PD-1+CD8 T cell responses has not been addressed. In chronic infection, ICOS-deficiency increased both number and quality of virus-specific CD8 T cells, with accumulation of effector-like Tex due to enhanced survival. Mechanistically, loss of ICOS signaling potentiated FoxO1 activity and memory-like features of Tpex. In mice with established chronic infection, ICOS-Ligand blockade resulted in expansion of effector-like Tex and reduction in viral load. In a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma, ICOS inhibition improved cytokine production by tumor-specific PD-1+CD8 T cells and delayed tumor growth. Overall, we show that ICOS limits CD8 T cell responses during chronic antigen exposure.">

The chemokine receptor CXCR4, a central regulator of hematopoiesis, represents an attractive PMN-MDSC target1. Here, we fused a secreted CXCR4 partial agonist TFF2 to mouse serum albumin (MSA) and demonstrated that TFF2-MSA peptide synergized with anti-PD-1 to induce tumor regression or eradication, inhibited distant metastases, and prolonged survival in multiple gastric cancer (GC) models. Using histidine decarboxylase (Hdc)-GFP transgenic mice to track PMN-MDSC in vivo, we found TFF2-MSA selectively reduced the immunosuppressive Hdc-GFP+ CXCR4hi tumor PMN-MDSCs while preserving proinflammatory neutrophils, thereby boosting CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor response together with anti-PD-1. Furthermore, TFF2-MSA systemically reduced PMN-MDSCs and bone marrow granulopoiesis. In contrast, CXCR4 antagonism plus anti-PD-1 failed to provide a similar therapeutic benefit. In GC patients, expanded PMN-MDSCs containing a prominent CXCR4+LOX-1+ subset are inversely correlated with the TFF2 level and CD8+ T cells in circulation. Collectively, our studies introduce a strategy of using CXCR4 partial agonism to restore anti-PD-1 sensitivity in GC by targeting PMN-MDSCs and granulopoiesis.">

        <tr id="Central nervous system (CNS) resident memory CD8 T cells (TRM) that express IFN-γ contribute to neurodegenerative processes, including synapse loss, leading to memory impairments. Here, we show that CCR2 signalling in CD8 TRM that persist within the hippocampus after recovery from CNS infection with West Nile virus (WNV) significantly prevents the development of memory impairments. Using CCR2-deficient mice, we determined that CCR2 expression is not essential for CNS T cell recruitment or virologic control during acute WNV infection. However, transcriptomic analyses of forebrain CCR2+ versus CCR2- CD8 TRM during WNV recovery reveal that CCR2 signalling significantly regulates hippocampal CD8 TRM phenotype and function via extrinsic and intrinsic effects, decreasing the expression of CD103 and granzyme A and IFN-γ, respectively. Consistent with this, WNV-recovered Cd8acreCcr2fl/fl mice exhibit decreased recognition memory. Our findings highlight a neuroprotective role for CCR2 in limiting CD8 T cell-mediated neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for CNS infections.">

        <tr id="Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile bacterium responsible for conditions ranging from mild skin and soft-tissue infections to serious disorders such as pneumonia and sepsis. Monocytes play a role in protection against pathogens by migrating to inflamed tissues and differentiating into macrophages but their specific role in the context of S. aureus pulmonary infection has not been fully elucidated. Using a CCR2-DTR transgenic mouse model we demonstrate that over the course of infection monocyte depletion resulted in worse airway clearance of S. aureus. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of CCR2-DTR mice after S. aureus infection displayed significant decreases in interleukin-12 (IL-12), IFN-γ, IP-10, MIG and RANTES, all IFN-γ regulated, compared to wild-type (WT) infected controls. NK cells were identified as the main producers of IFN-γ, but both NK cells and IFN-γ were dispensable for clearance. We demonstrated through cytokine production and RNA-seq analysis that IL-12 and IL-12 regulated genes are strongly induced in monocytes upon S. aureus infection. Administration of IL-12 during infection restored the bacterial burdens in the BALF and lungs of monocyte-depleted CCR2-DTR mice to the levels of WT mice, independent of IFN-γ. In the absence of monocytes, alveolar macrophages are the primary phagocytic cells, and IL-12 influences their capacity to produce reactive oxygen species and clear S. aureus. These results show that production of IL-12 contributes to the control of S. aureus via its influence on alveolar macrophage function.">

Here, our single-cell RNA sequencing data identify a subpopulation of macrophages expressing high levels of the phagocytic receptor MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK+ macrophages), which is closely associated with melanoma progression and immunotherapy resistance. Adoptive transfer of the MerTK+ macrophages into recipient mice notably accelerated tumor growth regardless of macrophage depletion. Mechanistic studies further revealed that ALK And LTK Ligand 1 (ALKAL1), a target gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), facilitated MerTK phosphorylation, resulting in heightened phagocytic activity of MerTK+ macrophages and their subsequent polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Specifically targeted delivery of AhR antagonist to tumor-associated macrophages with mannosylated micelles could suppress MerTK expression and improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti–programmed cell death ligand 1 therapy. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanism of MerTK+ macrophages and provide strategies for improving the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy.">

Here, we developed a novel high-throughput method to study the transcriptome and adaptive immune receptor repertoire of single cells forming complexes without needing bioinformatic deconvolution. We found that T cells and monocytes forming complexes in blood during active tuberculosis (TB) and dengue hold unique transcriptomic signatures indicative of TCR/MCH-II immune synapses. Additionally, T cells in complexes showed enrichment for effector phenotypes, imaging and transcriptomic features of active TCR signaling, and increased immune activity at diagnosis compared to after anti-TB therapy. We also found evidence for bidirectional RNA exchange between T cells and monocytes, since complexes were markedly enriched for “dual-expressing” cells (i.e., co-expressing T cell and monocyte genes). Thus, studying immune cell complexes at a single-cell resolution offers novel perspectives on immune synaptic interactions occurring in blood during infection. Graphical Abstract">

        <tr id="While naïve CD4+ T cells have historically been considered a homogenous population, recent studies have provided evidence that functional heterogeneity exists within this population. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), we identify five transcriptionally distinct naïve CD4+ T cell subsets that emerge within the single positive stage in the thymus: a quiescence cluster (TQ), a memory-like cluster (TMEM), a TCR reactive cluster (TTCR), an IFN responsive cluster (TIFN), and an undifferentiated cluster (TUND). Elevated expression of transcription factors KLF2, Mx1, and Nur77 within the TQ, TIFN, and TMEM clusters, respectively, allowed enrichment of these subsets for further analyses. Functional studies using sorted cells revealed that naïve T cell subsets have distinctive functional biases upon stimulation. Furthermore, treatment of mice with inflammatory stimuli imparted a state of reduced responsiveness on naïve T cells, evidenced by a reduction in cytokine production ex vivo. In human lupus patients, naïve CD4+ T cell cluster frequencies were distorted, with the TIFN cluster expanding proportionately with disease score. Our data show that naïve T cells are influenced by host environment, with functional consequences manifesting upon activation. These findings highlight a need to explore how naïve T cells can become distorted in cancer, autoimmunity, and infectious diseases. Summary This study describes the transcriptional heterogeneity of murine and human naïve CD4+ T cells as comprising of multiple discrete clusters that impact CD4+ T cell fate and trajectories. Naïve CD4+ T cells experiencing inflammatory environments exhibit an altered transcriptional state that influences their functional trajectory.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) enhances T cell responses against cancer, leading to long-term survival in a fraction of patients. CD8+ T cell differentiation in response to chronic antigen stimulation is highly complex, and it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states at which anatomic sites are critical for the response to ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population in the white pulp of the spleen that underwent substantial expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increased systemic antigen redirected differentiation of this population toward a more circulatory exhausted KLR state, whereas a lack of cross-presented tumor antigen reduced its differentiation in the spleen. An analogous population of exhausted KLR CD8+ T cells in human blood samples exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability. Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role of antigen density within the spleen for the differentiation and expansion of T cell clonotypes in response to ICB. Response to ICB depends on optimal splenic antigen levels, whereas increased antigen induces differentiation to circulatory T cells. Editor’s summary T cell dysfunction is a defining feature of many tumor types, but how tumor-specific T cells progress to a terminally exhausted state and which populations are targeted by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remains incompletely understood. Using single-cell transcriptomics, Morgan et al. profiled T cell differentiation states across different anatomical sites including tumors, draining lymph nodes, and the white pulp of the spleen from tumor-bearing mice treated with ICB. A population of splenic intermediate-exhausted T cells supplied most of the ICB-elicited tumor-specific T cell response, which required low levels of cross-presented tumor antigen in the spleen. Together, these findings identify the spleen as an important site for generating a tumor-specific T cell response after ICB. —Claire Olingy">

We identified overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in HIV-infected CD4⁺ T- cells that survive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) exposure, suggesting a mechanism of CTL resistance. Inhibition of EZH2 with the FDA-approved drug tazemetostat increased surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on CD4⁺ T-cells, counterbalancing HIV Nef–mediated MHC-I downregulation. This improved CTL-mediated elimination of HIV-infected cells and suppressed viral replication in vitro. In a participant-derived xenograft mouse model, tazemetostat elevated MHC-I and the pro-apoptotic protein BIM in CD4⁺ T-cells, facilitating CD8⁺ T-cell–mediated reductions of HIV reservoir seeding. Additionally, tazemetostat promoted sustained skewing of CD8⁺ T-cells toward less differentiated and exhausted phenotypes. Our findings reveal EZH2 overexpression as a novel mechanism of CTL resistance and support the clinical evaluation of tazemetostat to enhance clearance of HIV reservoirs and improve CD8+ T-cell function.">

        <tr id="Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) typically present with widespread metastasis, obscuring a temporal understanding of tumor-immune dynamics. We performed multi-site global proteomics and matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) of CD4+ and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patient samples. The protein expression profiles were ordered by pseudotime, recapitulating metastatic progression observed in the clinic, and providing a framework to explore tumor-immune dynamics from localized to metastatic disease. Metastatic progression correlated with immune cell infiltration and the recruitment of Tregs to counterbalance the effect of γδ and CD4+ T cells. Whilst later-stage metastases recruited Tregs via chemokines induced by SNX8, early-stage tumors relied more on antigen presentation. The exclusion of CD4+ TILs from the epithelium was correlated with metastatic progression, whereas CD8+ TILs were not, likely due to a predominance of exhausted CD8+ T cells. In early-stage tumors, keratin-expressing cancer cells recruited Tregs via MHC class II, resulting in an inflammatory phenotype characterized by limited IFNγ production and non-clonally expanded T cells. Additionally, IFI44L expression on macrophages caused immune exclusion by downregulating CD53 on T cells. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms of immune escape associated with localized disease and metastatic progression in HGSOC, highlighting potential targets to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.">

Despite recent advances, the cellular and molecular regulators that drive maternal immune cell remodeling remain largely unknown. Using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively characterized the immune compartment dynamics in the maternal-fetal interface of both human and mouse and charted the markers and functional pathways associated with these cells. Comparing immune signatures in decidua and tumors of human and mice, we identify conserved gene modules that are activated in natural killer (NK) cells of both compartments, including TFG-β signaling.

        <tr id="Macrophages orchestrate tissue homeostasis and immunity. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), macrophage presence is largely associated with poor prognosis because of their reprogramming into immunosuppressive cells. We investigated the effects of hypoxia, a TME-associated feature, on the functional, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages and found that hypoxia boosts their immunogenicity. Hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are characterized by a cluster of proinflammatory genes undergoing ten-eleven translocation–mediated DNA demethylation and overexpression. These genes are regulated by NF-κB, while HIF1α dominates the transcriptional reprogramming, demonstrated through ChIP-seq and pharmacological inhibition. In bladder and ovarian carcinomas, hypoxic inflammatory macrophages are enriched in immune-infiltrated tumors, correlating with better patient prognoses. Coculture assays and cell-cell communication analyses support that hypoxic-activated macrophages enhance T cell–mediated responses. The NF-κB–associated hypomethylation signature is displayed by a subset of hypoxic inflammatory macrophages, isolated from ovarian tumors. Our results challenge paradigms regarding the effects of hypoxia on macrophages and highlight actionable target cells to modulate anticancer immune responses.">

TNFSF13 is a cytokine important for B cell maturation and function, but roles for epithelial TNFSF13 and putative contribution to inflammatory bowel disease are poorly understood. We evaluated functional consequences of a novel monoallelic TNFSF13 variant using biopsies, tissue-derived colonoids and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived colon organoids. TNFSF13 variant colonoids exhibited a >50% reduction in secreted TNFSF13, increased epithelial proliferation, and reduced apoptosis, which was confirmed in iPSC-derived colon organoids. Single cell RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry, and co-immunoprecipitation identified FAS as the predominant colonic epithelial receptor for TNFSF13. Imaging mass cytometry revealed an increase in epithelial-associated B cells in TNFSF13 variant colon tissue sections. Finally, TNFSF13 variant colonoids co-cultured with memory B cells demonstrated a reduction in the production of IgA+ plasma cells compared to control colonoid co-cultures. Our findings support a role for epithelial TNFSF13 as a regulator of colonic epithelial growth and epithelial crosstalk with B cells.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The microbiota-associated factors that affect host susceptibility and adaptive immunity to influenza A virus (IAV) infection have not been fully elucidated. By comparing the microbiota composition between survivors and mice that succumbed to IAV strain PR8 infection, we identified that the commensal bacterium Blautia coccoides protects antibiotics (Abx)-treated or germ-free (GF) mice from PR8 infection by inducing functionally optimal virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Administration of exogenous acetate reproduced the protective effect of B. coccoides monocolonization in Abx and GF mice, enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis as well as secretion of IFN-γ and granzyme B in virus-specific CD8+ T cells, dependent on GPR43 signaling and acetyl-CoA synthetase 2. Thus, we have demonstrated that microbiota-derived acetate possesses an antiviral effect that induces an optimal virus-specific CD8+ T cell response to IAV PR8 infection via GPR43-dependent metabolic reprogramming.">

        <tr id="CD4 T helper cells (TH cells) play a vital role in coordinating and amplifying the immune response to specific pathogens. They constitutively produce different kinds of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which mediate cell-to cell communication and play diverse roles in immune regulation and inflammatory processes. Here we provide a resource documenting the composition of activated TH cell EVs and demonstrating their ability to instigate pro-inflammatory response in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). EVs were characterized by lipidomics, proteomics, and NanoFCM. The activated TH cells derived EVs (act-EVs) were found to be enriched in TH cell-specific proteins, transmembrane and cytosolic EV marker proteins, and HLA proteins relative to resting CD4 T cells EVs (rest-EVs). The pro-inflammatory effect of act-EVs vs rest-EVs on donor matched APCs were characterized by chemokine and cytokine profiling and flow cytometry analysis. There was no discernible contrast in endotoxin levels between act-EVs and rest-EVs. Functional distinctions were seen to arise from variations in the content and composition of these EVs. Moreover, we validated our findings with an in-vivo investigation in mice, demonstrating the recruitment of monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, and NK cells in the spleen, accompanied by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum after administering act-EVs. In summary, this study sheds light on the role of TH cell released EVs in modulating the immune response during pro-inflammatory responses and this resource provides a foundation for development of novel therapeutics on EV based scaffolds.">

        <tr id="T cell heterogeneity is a cornerstone of the adaptive immune response, with CD8+ T cells playing a pivotal role in mediating cytotoxic responses to pathogens and tumors. While traditional studies have focused on phenotypic and functional diversity through surface marker expression and functional assays, the significance of biophysical properties in delineating T cell subpopulations remains underexplored. Here, we show that resting T cells exhibit a bimodal distribution in buoyant mass, which is not captured by surface marker based canonical immunophenotypes or physical parameters such as volume, density, dry mass, or light scattering. Functionally, we demonstrate that T cells with lower buoyant mass exhibit reduced proliferation, tend towards effector differentiation, and become more exhausted in the presence of innate tumor-secreted factors. Conversely, T cells with higher buoyant mass show greater memory potential and resistance to exhaustion. Our study not only provides insights into T cell biology but also suggests buoyant mass as a promising label-free biomarker to potentiate T cell-based therapies.">

CD8+ T cells are abundant within MS lesions, but their potential role in disease pathology remains unclear. Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we compared CD8+ T cell clones from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of monozygotic twin pairs in which the cotwin had either no or subclinical neuroinflammation (SCNI). We identified peripheral MS-associated immunological and metabolic alterations indicative of an enhanced migratory, proinflammatory, and activated CD8+ T cell phenotype, which was also evident in cotwins with SCNI and in an independent validation cohort of people with MS. Together, our in-depth single-cell analysis indicates a disease-driving proinflammatory role of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and identifies potential immunological and metabolic therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages of the disease. Proinflammatory features of CD8+ T cells in multiple sclerosis may serve as potential therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages. Editor’s summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the nervous system in which CD8 T cells are present in MS lesions, but their role in disease progression remains unclear. Kavaka et al. analyzed CD8 T cells from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of monozygotic twins, where one twin had MS and the other showed no signs or subclinical signs of neuroinflammation (SCNI). CD8 T cells from individuals with MS and cotwins with SCNI exhibited proinflammatory immunological and metabolic features consistent with enhanced activation and migration. These findings were validated in a separate cohort of individuals with MS, providing insights into the role of CD8 T cells in MS progression. —Christiana Fogg">

        <tr id="The relationship between chronic viral infection and cancer response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is poorly understood. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is globally endemic and causes severe disease in the immunocompromised. In immunocompetent individuals the clinical effects of CMV infection are an area of active investigation. Here, in analysis of 396 patients receiving ICB for cancer, we investigate the oncological and immunological consequences of CMV seropositivity. We find that infection with CMV leads to profound skewing of CD8+ T cell subsets towards an effector phenotype, divergence in gene expression, increased total lymphocyte count and reduced neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. These differences are associated with immunologically distinct responses to ICB in patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). We identify a gene set highly-associated with CMV infection which is robustly induced by combination ICB (anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-1, cICB) but not by single-agent anti-PD-1 (sICB) in CMV seronegative individuals. Consequently, CMV seropositivity is associated with prolonged Overall Survival (OS) in those treated with sICB (HR 0.49, P.01) whereas there is no observed survival association of CMV following cICB treatment (HR 0.95, P=.82). We demon- strate these CMV-determined divergent effects are driven by expression of TBX21, encoding the transcription factor T-bet. Expression of TBX21 predicts OS across all patients (HR 0.67, P=0.013 for above-median expression), with durable response to ICB associated with induction of expanded TBX21 expressing CD8+ clones. Unexpectedly, we find CMV infection is associated with reduced cumulative incidence of Grade 3+ immune related adverse events (irAEs) at 6 months (0.31 vs. 0.53, P=2.1x10-5), notably lowering incidence of colitis (P=.00095) and pneumonitis (P=.026), with infected patients requiring fewer steroids or second line immunosuppressants. Finally we link CMV infection to protection against MM, demonstrating lower seropositivity rates in patients with MM, but not early Stage II/III disease, compared to population controls from the UK biobank (OR 0.53, P=.00016). CMV protection is contingent upon melanoma BRAF mutation status, with CMV being associated with reduced development of MM in BRAF mutated patients and later presentation of BRAF wild-type MM. This work reveals a previously unrecognised interaction between CMV infection, melanoma muta- tional state, development of metastatic disease and response to ICB, as well as demonstrating CMV infection protects against ICB irAEs, underpinning the importance of prior infection history and chronic immune activation in development of MM and outcomes to immunotherapy. We anticipate other immunosensitive cancers may show similar interactions between chronic viral infection and response to ICB.">

        <tr id="Respiratory fungal infections pose a significant threat to human health. Animal models do not fully recapitulate human disease, necessitating advanced models to study human-fungal pathogen interactions. In this study, we utilized primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) to recapitulate the lung environment in vitro and investigate cellular responses to two diverse, clinically significant fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. To understand the mechanisms of early pathogenesis for both fungi, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of infected hAECs. Analysis revealed that both fungi induced cellular stress and cytokine production. However, the cell subtypes affected and specific pathways differed between fungi, with A. fumigatus and C. posadasii triggering protein-folding-related stress in ciliated cells and hypoxia responses in secretory cells, respectively. This study represents one of the first reports of single-cell transcriptional analysis of hAECs infected with either A. fumigatus or C. posadasii, providing a vital dataset to dissect the mechanism of disease and potentially identify targetable pathways. Importance Fungal infections in the lungs are dreaded complications for those with compromised immune systems and have limited treatment strategies available. These options are restricted further by the increased prevalence of treatment-resistant fungi. Many studies focus on how our immune systems respond to these pathogens, yet airway epithelial cells remain an understudied component of fungal infections in the lungs. Here, the authors provide a transcriptional analysis of primary human airway epithelial cells stimulated by two distinct fungal pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Coccidioides posadasii. These data will enable further mechanistic studies of the contribution of the airway epithelium to initial host responses and represent a powerful new resource for investigators.">

We investigated the mechanisms by which inflammatory responses generated by tumor-specific T cells delivered to ovarian tumor-bearing mice alone or after oncolytic vaccinia virus-driven immunogenic cancer cell death affect antitumor efficacy. Analyses of the perivascular TME by spatially resolved omics technologies revealed reduced immunosuppression and increased tumoricidal T-cell trafficking and function after moderate inflammatory responses driven by a CXCR4 antagonist-armed oncolytic virus. Neither weak nor high inflammation created a permissive TME for T-cell trafficking. Notably, treatment-mediated differences in T-cell effector programs acquired within the perivascular TME contrasted with comparable antigenic priming in the tumor-draining lymph nodes regardless of the activation mode of antigen-presenting cells. These findings provide new insights into combinatorial treatment strategies that enable tumor-specific T cells to overcome multiple barriers for enhanced trafficking and control of tumor growth. .">

Phenotypic profiling of NK cells revealed profound differences compared with other PWH, but marked similarities to uninfected individuals, with a distinctive prevalence of NKG2C+CD57+ memory-like NK cells. Functional analyses indicated that ECs had limited production of functional molecules upon NK stimulation and consequently reduced natural cytotoxicity against non-HIV target cells. Importantly, ECs showed an exceptional ability to kill primary HIV-infected cells by the antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity adaptive mechanism, which was achieved by a specific memory-like NK population expressing CD16, NKG2A, NKG2C, CD57, and CXCR3. In-depth single-cell RNA-seq unveiled a unique transcriptional signature in these NK cells linked to increased cell metabolism, migration, chemotaxis, effector functions, cytokine secretion, and antiviral response. Our findings underscore a pivotal role of NK cells in the immune control of HIV and identify specific NK cells as emerging targets for immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="MALT1 protease is an intracellular signaling molecule that promotes tumor progression via cancer cell-intrinsic and cancer cell-extrinsic mechanisms. MALT1 has been mostly studied in lymphocytes, and little is known about its role in tumor-associated macrophages. Here, we show that MALT1 plays a key role in glioblastoma (GBM)-associated macrophages. Mechanistically, GBM tumor cells induce a MALT1-NF-κB signaling axis within macrophages, leading to macrophage migration and polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Inactivation of MALT1 protease promotes transcriptional reprogramming that reduces migration and restores a macrophage “M1-like” phenotype. Preclinical in vivo analysis shows that MALT1 inhibitor treatment results in increased immuno-reactivity of GBM-associated macrophages and reduced GBM tumor growth. Further, the addition of MALT1 inhibitor to temozolomide reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, which may enhance the efficacy of this standard-of-care chemotherapeutic. Together, our findings suggest that MALT1 protease inhibition represents a promising macrophage-targeted immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of GBM. Graphical abstract.

        <tr id="Chronic infections drive a CD8 T cell program termed T cell exhaustion, characterized by reduced effector functions. While cell-intrinsic mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell exhaustion have been extensively studied, the impact of the metabolic environment in which exhausted CD8 T cells (Tex) operate remains less clear. Using untargeted metabolomics and the murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection model we investigated systemic metabolite changes early and late following acute versus chronic viral infections. We identified distinct short-term and persistent metabolite shifts, with the most significant differences occurring transiently during the acute phase of the sustained infection. This included nutrient changes that were independent of viral loads and partially associated with CD8 T cell-induced anorexia and lipolysis. One remarkable observation was the elevation of medium- and long-chain fatty acid (FA) and acylcarnitines during the early phase after chronic infection. During this time, virus-specific CD8 T cells from chronically infected mice exhibited increased lipid accumulation and uptake compared to their counterparts from acute infection, particularly stem-like Tex (TexSTEM), a subset that generates effector-like TexINT which directly limit viral replication. Notably, only TexSTEM increased oxidative metabolism and ATP production upon FA exposure. Consistently, short-term reintroduction of FA during late chronic infection exclusively improved TexSTEM mitochondrial fitness, percentages and numbers. This treatment, however, also reduced TexINT, resulting in compromised viral control. Our study offers a valuable resource for investigating the role of specific metabolites in regulating immune responses during acute and chronic viral infections and highlights the potential of long-chain FA to influence TexSTEM and viral control during a protracted infection. Significance This study examines systemic metabolite changes during acute and chronic viral infections. Notably, we identified an early, transient nutrient shift in chronic infection, marked by an increase in medium- and long-chain fatty acid related species. Concomitantly, a virus-specific stem-like T cell population, essential for maintaining other T cells, displayed high lipid avidity and was capable of metabolizing exogenous fatty acids. Administering fatty acids late in chronic infection, when endogenous lipid levels had normalized, expanded this stem-like T cell population and enhanced their mitochondrial fitness. These findings highlight the potential role of fatty acids in regulating stem-like T cells in chronic settings and offer a valuable resource for studying other metabolic signatures in both acute and persistent infections.">

        <tr id="Immunotherapy has changed the treatment paradigm for many types of cancer, but immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have not shown benefit in prostate cancer (PCa). Chronic inflammation contributes to the immunosuppressive prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) and is associated with poor response to ICIs. The primary source of inflammatory cytokine production is the inflammasome. Here, we identify PIM kinases as important regulators of inflammasome activation in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs). Analysis of clinical data from a cohort of treatment naïve, hormone responsive PCa patients revealed that tumors from patients with high PIM1/2/3 display an immunosuppressive TME characterized by high inflammation (IL-1β and TNFα) and a high density of repressive immune cells, most notably TAMs. Strikingly, macrophage-specific knockout of PIM reduced tumor growth in syngeneic models of prostate cancer. Transcriptional analyses indicate that eliminating PIM from macrophages enhanced the adaptive immune response and increased cytotoxic immune cells. Combined treatment with PIM inhibitors and ICIs synergistically reduced tumor growth. Immune profiling revealed that PIM inhibitors sensitized PCa tumors to ICIs by increasing tumor suppressive TAMs and increasing the activation of cytotoxic T cells. Collectively, our data implicate macrophage PIM as a driver of inflammation that limits the potency of ICIs and provides preclinical evidence that PIM inhibitors are an effective strategy to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in prostate cancer.">

        <tr id="Although the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway has been prior investigated for its prometastatic and immuno- suppressive roles in the tumor microenvironment, evidence on the spatiotemporal regulation of these hallmarks has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate that CXCL12 forms a gradient specifically around cancer cell intravasation doorways, also known as Tumor Microenvironment of Metastasis (TMEM) doorways, thus facilitating the chemotactic translocation of prometastatic tumor cells expressing CXCR4 toward the perivascular TMEM doorways for subsequent entry into peripheral circulation. Fur- thermore, we demonstrate that the CXCL12-rich micro-environment around TMEM doorways may cre- ate immunosuppressive niches, whereby CD8+ T cells, despite being attracted to these regions, often exhibit reduced effector functions, limiting their efficacy. While the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway can mini- mally influence the overall composition of immune cell populations, it biases the distribution of CD8+ T cells away from TMEM doorways, justifying its prior-established role as immunosuppressive factor for CD8+ T cells. Our research suggests that the complex interactions between CXCL12 and the various tumor and immune cell types contributes not only to the completion of the initial steps of the metastatic cascade, but also offers an immunological “sanctuary” to prometastatic tumor cells homed around TMEM doorways. Overall, our study enhances our current understanding on the mechanisms, via which CXCL12 orchestrates tumor cell behavior and immune dynamics, potentially guiding future thera- peutic strategies to combat breast cancer metastasis and improve anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are among the most abundant immune cells associated with tumors, which often exhibit immune regulatory phenotypes that promote tumor growth and confer resistance to anti-tumor immune therapies. Despite extensive efforts in developing immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at controlling the recruitment or reprogramming of TAMs, success has been limited due to strategic caveats, underscoring the need for a novel approach targeting the TAMs. PU.1, a lineage-dependent transcription factor, is highly expressed throughout the lifespan of macrophages. We have found that inhibition of PU.1 by the small molecule DB2313 suppresses melanoma tumor growth in mice through enhanced tumor recruitment of CD4+ T helper cells and cytotoxic T/NK cells mediated by TAMs. Whole transcriptome and targeted gene expression analyses revealed that DB2313 upregulates CXCL9 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and TAMs. The anti-tumor effects of DB2313 were abolished by depleting macrophages with clodronate or inhibiting the CXCL9-CXCR3 chemokine axis using neutralizing antibodies against CXCL9 or CXCR3. Collectively, these results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PU.1 suppresses tumor growth by promoting tumor infiltrating lymphocytes through the CXCL9-CXCR3 chemokine axis. Our study establishes a framework for developing TAM-modulating immunotherapies by targeting the transcriptional factor PU.1.">

        <tr id="Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) acts as a crucial component of the innate immune system. Upon TLR7 binding to its ligand, myeloid cells, including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, are activated and play vital roles in initiating adaptive immunity. Consequently, TLR7 agonists have been employed in cancer immunotherapy. We have synthesized DSP-0509, a systemic injectable TLR7 agonist, and in this investigation, we examined the effects of DSP-0509 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in a mouse model bearing tumors. Our results demonstrated that DSP-0509 induced an expansion of immune cell populations, such as Natural Killer (NK) cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Subsequently, we combined an Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor with DSP-0509 to enhance the antitumor efficacy by reducing Tregs, as DSP-0509 led to an increase in Treg presence within tumors. Our findings demonstrated that this combination therapy effectively reduced Treg infiltration within the tumor, leading to enhanced antitumor activity. To further prevent CD8+ T cell exhaustion, we combined DSP-0509 with an anti-PD-1 antibody and assessed the alterations in TILs using scRNA-seq. Our results indicated that the combination treatment significantly increased the cluster of CD8+ T cells expressing Gzmb, Prf1, Ctla4, and Icos, when compared to the administration of DSP-0509 alone. Additionally, we observed a marked rise in the M1-like macrophage cluster in the combination treatment group compared to the group receiving only DSP-0509. To validate the potential of modulating myeloid cells within the tumor to enhance antitumor efficacy, we combined DSP-0509 with an inhibitor targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. In bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), the AXL inhibitor further amplified DSP-0509-stimulated TNFα secretion while reducing IL-10 secretion. As a final step, we evaluated the antitumor activity by combining DSP-0509 and the AXL inhibitor in an in vivo tumor model, which demonstrated increased efficacy. In summary, our study elucidated the effects of DSP-0509 on immune activity within the tumor microenvironment. These findings provided valuable insights that pave the way for the development of novel combination immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of insulin producing pancreatic β-cells. Macrophages infiltrate islets early in T1D pathogenesis, preceding the influx of T- and B-lymphocytes. The integrated stress response (ISR), a cellular pathway activated during stress, coordinates adaptive changes in gene expression to maintain cell function and survival. To study the ISR in macrophages, bone-marrow derived macrophages were treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of the ISR (ISRIB) and polarized to a proinflammatory M1-like state. We found a reduction in the number of proinflammatory macrophages as well as a reduction in iNOS mRNA and protein levels with ISRIB treatment. RNA-sequencing revealed a reduction in pathways related to stress responses, including ER stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and autophagy as well as migration pathway genes. ISRIB treatment led to decreased macrophage migration after stimulation in vitro and decreased macrophages to the site of injury after tailfin cut in zebrafish in vivo. Pre-diabetic female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice administered ISRIB demonstrated an overall reduction in the macrophage numbers in the pancreatic islets. Additionally, the insulitic area of pancreata from ISRIB treated NOD mice had increased PD-L1 levels. Our study provides new insights into ISR signaling in macrophages and demonstrates that the ISR might serve as a potential target for intervention in macrophages during early T1D pathogenesis.">

This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) reduces the expansion of TFH cells and the associated autoantibody production in lupus-prone mice. Integrated cellular, transcriptomic, epigenetic and metabolic analyses showed that 2DG reversed the enhanced cell expansion and effector functions, as well as mitochondrial and lysosomal defects in lupus TFH cells, which include an increased chaperone-mediated autophagy induced by TLR7 activation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of 2DG-reprogrammed TFH cells protected lupus-prone mice from disease progression. Orthologs of genes responsive to 2DG in murine lupus TFH cells were overexpressed in the TFH cells of SLE patients, suggesting a therapeutic potential of targeting glycolysis to eliminate aberrant TFH cells and curb the production of autoantibodies inducing tissue damage.">

However, we still lack mechanistic understanding of the factors regulating immunity induced by this platform, especially innate pathways. We utilized a human tonsil organoid model to study the regulation of adaptive responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Innate activation and cytokine release occurred within 24 hours and T and B cell activation and antigen-specific antibody secretion occurred during the ensuing 14-day culture. Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-α was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-α-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-α and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells, including TFH. These data provide key insights into innate pathways regulating ChAdOx1-induced immunity and highlights the promise of this model for vaccine platform mechanistic studies.

        <tr id="A hallmark of HIV infection is disruption of intestinal barrier integrity that persists in people with HIV (PWH) despite treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART). This disruption is central to HIV disease progression, yet the causes remain incompletely understood. We report a novel mechanism by which immunometabolic defects in colon resident CD8+ T cells in PWH lead to intestinal epithelial apoptosis and disruption of intestinal barrier integrity. We show that in PWH, these cells downregulate the lipid sensor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), which results in reduced intracellular lipid droplets, impaired fatty acid oxidation, and acquisition of lipids by CD8+ T cells from intestinal epithelial cells, which then contributes to epithelial cell death. Our findings indicate that HIV-associated immunometabolic dysregulation of colon CD8+ T cell leads to loss of intestinal epithelial homeostasis. These results identify potential new strategies to reduce comorbidities in PWH and other disorders with disrupted intestinal barrier integrity.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs) are critical for tumor progression and therapy resistance in glioblastoma (GBM), a type of incurable brain cancer. We previously identified lysyl oxidase (LOX) and olfactomedin like-3 (OLFML3) as essential macrophage and microglia chemokines, respectively, in GBM. Here, single-cell transcriptomics and multiplex sequential immunofluorescence followed by functional studies demonstrate that macrophages negatively correlate with microglia in the GBM tumor microenvironment. LOX inhibition in PTEN-deficient GBM cells upregulates OLFML3 expression via the NF-κB-PATZ1 signaling pathway, inducing a compensatory increase of microglia infiltration. Dual targeting macrophages and microglia via inhibition of LOX and the CLOCK-OLFML3 axis generates potent anti-tumor effects and offers a complete tumor regression in more than 60% of animals when combined with anti-PD1 therapy in PTEN-deficient GBM mouse models. Thus, our findings provide a translational triple therapeutic strategy for this lethal disease.">

        <tr id="The intratumoral microbiome has recently emerged as a new hallmark of cancer, with implications for response or resistance to therapy. While bacteria can either promote or inhibit cancer growth, intratumoral bacteria can also be engineered using synthetic biology to remodel the tumor microenvironment. Here, we engineered the probiotic bacterium E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to express the human chemokine CXCL13, a critical component of germinal center (GC) formation. The GC reaction is a fundamental aspect of adaptive immunity by which antibody affinity develops in secondary lymphoid organs for defense against pathogens. Using orthotopic models of bladder cancer, engineered CXCL13-expressing EcN colonized bladder tumors and elicited GC responses in bladder tumor–draining lymph nodes after intravesical delivery. Furthermore, when combined with PD-1 blockade, engineered EcN amplified the antitumor antibody response and promoted long-term survival and protective immunity upon tumor rechallenge. Thus, we demonstrate that synthetically engineered CXCL13-expressing EcN can enhance the efficacy of PD-1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy by amplifying tumor-specific humoral immunity.">

        <tr id="The cGAS sensor activates STING/IFN signaling, which is crucial for immune defense against pathogens and triggers inflammation in autoimmune diseases and antitumor responses. This study investigated the cGAS-mediated immune response in tumorigenesis using the MC-38 tumor model. Cgas-/- mice exhibited significantly larger tumors and lower survival rates than wild-type (WT) mice. Tumors in Cgas-/- mice showed increased fibrosis and neovascularity. WT mice mounted a more robust T-cell-mediated antitumor response, with higher levels of NK and effector T cells, while Cgas-/- mice showed an expansion of B cells, including regulatory B cells producing IL-10. B cells from tumor-bearing Cgas-/- mice survived better in the tumor- conditioned medium than those from WT mice. B cell depletion significantly reduced tumor size in WT mice but had minimal effect in Cgas-/- mice, where fibrosis and tumor vasculature persisted. Despite B cell depletion, B cells remained in the tumors of Cgas-/- mice, in contrast to WT mice, where their reduction correlated with an increase in CD8+ infiltrating cells. Expression of Tlr7 and Tlr9 remained elevated and unaffected by B cell depletion in Cgas-/- tumors, while Baff expression was higher and further increased after B cell depletion. Cgas-/- B cells promoted angiogenesis, as indicated by enhanced endothelial tube formation. In summary, cGAS deficiency fosters a tumor microenvironment that supports B cell survival, promotes a pro-tumor immune environment, and enhances angiogenesis, contributing to tumor progression.">

        <tr id="Emphysema in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by progressive inflammation. Preclinical studies suggest that lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) treatment dampen inflammation. We investigated the effects of bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) and LVRS on circulating and pulmonary immune cell profiles in emphysema patients using mass cytometry. Blood and resected lung tissue were collected at the first LVRS (L1). Following 6–10 weeks of recovery, patients received a placebo or intravenous administration of 2 × 106 cells/kg bodyweight BM-MSC (n = 5 and n = 9, resp.) in week 3 and 4 before the second LVRS (L2), where blood and lung tissue were collected. Irrespective of BM-MSC or placebo treatment, proportions of circulating lymphocytes including central memory CD4 regulatory, effector memory CD8 and γδ T cells were higher, whereas myeloid cell percentages were lower in L2 compared to L1. In resected lung tissue, proportions of Treg (p = 0.0067) and anti-inflammatory CD163− macrophages (p = 0.0001) were increased in L2 compared to L1, while proportions of pro-inflammatory CD163+ macrophages were decreased (p = 0.0004). There were no effects of BM-MSC treatment on immune profiles in emphysema patients. However, we observed alterations in the circulating and pulmonary immune cells upon LVRS, suggesting the induction of anti-inflammatory responses potentially needed for repair processes.">

To date, it remains elusive how the duration of TN-DC interactions and integration of activation signals are controlled in vivo. Here, we report that lymphoid stroma-secreted ligands for CCR7 constrained interaction duration by gradually inducing CD8+ T cell release from DCs. At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses. In sum, our findings uncover that lymphoid stromal chemokines act as built-in “disruptors” of T cell-DC interactions for long-term preservation of TEFF functionality.">

        <tr id="Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common cause of invasive aspergillosis (IA), a devastating infection in immunocompromised patients. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) regulate host defense against IA by enhancing neutrophil antifungal properties in the lung. Here, we define the pDC activation trajectory during A. fumigatus infection and the molecular events that underlie the protective pDC - neutrophil crosstalk. Fungus-induced pDC activation begins after bone marrow egress and results in pDC-dependent regulation of lung type I and type III IFN levels. These pDC-derived products act on type I and type III IFN receptor-expressing neutrophils and control neutrophil fungicidal activity and reactive oxygen species production via STAT1 signaling in a cell-intrinsic manner. Mechanistically, neutrophil STAT1 signaling regulates the transcription and expression of Cybb, which encodes one of five NADPH oxidase subunits. Thus, pDCs regulate neutrophil-dependent immunity against inhaled molds by controlling the local expression of a subunit required for NADPH oxidase assembly and activity in the lung. Graphic abstract pDC activation in the infected lung coincides with type I and type III interferon production. pDCs represent a major, but not exclusive source of type I and type III IFN in the Aspergillus-infected lung. These pDC-derived products act on type I and type III IFN receptor+ lung neutrophils via STAT1 signal transduction. STAT1-dependent neutrophil fungal killing and ROS production is attenuated in the absence of pDCs. expression regulates Cybb transcription and CYBB protein levels in neutrophils, but does not regulate the transcription or translation of other subunits of neutrophil NADPH oxidase.">

        <tr id="STING gain-of-function (GOF) mutations are associated with the severe autoinflammatory disease designated STING Associated Vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI). Mice with the STING GOF V154M mutation develop profound T cell lymphopenia, partly due to a blockage of T cell development in the thymus. To better characterize the mechanisms of peripheral T cell dysfunctions, we conducted a transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis on sorted splenic CD4+ and CD8+ mature T cells from STING GOF V154M mice. We identify a T cell exhaustion phenotype that manifests at a terminal stage, acquired early in life but only after reaching the peripheral environment. This phenotype is independent of type I interferons and does not rely on intrinsic STING activation in either T cells or stromal cells. Mechanistically, the limited number of mature T cells that reach the periphery appear to be quickly impacted by the lymphopenic environment, experiencing heightened stimulation of the IL-7 receptor and TCR pathways, including the NFAT pathway, a key factor in T cell exhaustion. By performing transplantation experiments with STING GOF long term-hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) along with supportive wild-type bone marrow (BM) cells, we were able to prevent the T cell exhaustion of STING GOF T cells in the resulting non-lymphopenic context, demonstrating that lymphopenia is a major driver of T cell exhaustion in STING GOF mice. T cell exhaustion, although less severe, was also observed in lymphopenic mice carrying Rag1 hypomorphic mutations. In conclusion, our results, which highlight T cell exhaustion induced by lymphopenia, could have important implications for the management of patients with severe immune deficiencies. Highlights We describe a phenotype of T cell exhaustion in STING GOF V154M mice, which is acquired early in life and in the periphery. STING GOF-associated T cell exhaustion is independent of type I IFNs, and STING GOF/activation in T cells or in stromal cells is not sufficient for T cell exhaustion. Lymphopenia is a major driver of T cell exhaustion in STING GOF mice, and increased antigenic/IL-7 stimulation of T cells in the lymphopenic context of STING GOF mice could be implicated in the induction of T cell exhaustion.">

        <tr id="Immune checkpoint inhibitors have substantial advanced tumor treatment, but their limited benefits and strong responses in only a subset of patients remain challenging. In this study, we explored the immunomodulatory function of contactin-4 (CNTN4). CNTN4 was highly expressed in tumor tissues, and expression impaired the antitumor function of T cells. CNTN4 bound to amyloid precursor protein (APP) on T cells, which attenuated conjugation between cancer cells and T cells, and diminished T cell receptor signaling cascades. We developed an anti-CNTN4 antibody (GENA-104A16) and an anti-APP antibody (5A7) that blocked the binding between CNTN4 and APP. Administration of either GENA-104A16 or 5A7 promoted antitumor T cell responses in a syngeneic mouse model and increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in vivo. Furthermore, elevated CNTN4 levels were associated with poor prognosis and negatively correlated with various cytotoxic immune-related markers. These results suggest that CNTN4-APP is an inhibitory checkpoint in T cells and represents a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Targeting the CNTN4-APP axis may boost anticancer immunity and improve conventional immunotherapy efficacy. Editor’s summary Contactin-4 (CNTN4) is an adhesion molecule known to engage amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain, but the function of this axis in T cells and antitumor immunity is not known. Jeon et al. explored the immunomodulatory role of CNTN4-APP, finding that CNTN4 expressed on tumor cells prevents T cell activation by engaging APP on T cells. They developed an anti-CNTN4 antibody (GENA-104A16) and an anti-APP antibody (5A7) and found that blocking the CNTN4-APP interaction promoted tumor killing. Expression of APP on T cells negatively correlated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with cancer. These findings indicate that CNTN4-APP functions as an inhibitory checkpoint in T cells. —Hannah Isles">

To define the molecular features underlying CZS in a relevant human cell model, we evaluated ZIKV infection and neurodevelopment in primary fetal brain explants and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mixed neural cultures at single cell resolution. We identified astrocytes as key innate immune sentinel cells detecting ZIKV and producing IFN-β. In contrast, neural progenitor cells displayed impaired innate immunity and supported high levels of viral replication. ZIKV infection of neurons suppressed differentiation and synaptic signaling networks and programmed a molecular switch from neurogenesis to astrogliogenesis. We identified a universal ZIKV-driven cellular stress response linked to intrinsic apoptosis and regulated by IFN-β. These findings reveal how innate immune signaling intersects with ZIKV-driven perturbations in cellular function to influence CZS outcomes including neuron developmental dysfunction and apoptotic cell death.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND Immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, altering their energy production in response to HIV infection. During acute HIV infection, CD4+ T cells increase glycolysis to fuel viral replication and defense, but prolonged activation leads to immune exhaustion, with reduced T cell function and impaired pathogen elimination, contributing to AIDS progression. However, the details Metabolic dynamics of Immune Cells during HIV Infection (UT) and after receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains unknown. Communication between Immune cells will be modified to response HIV infection, which can be mediated by metabolites. In this study, we deciphered Metabolic pathway dynamics of all Immune Cells by comparing UT and ART with seronegative controls (SN). Additionally, we investigate alteration of metabolite-mediated cell-cell communications in HIV Infection. METHODS Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of PBMC from SN, UT and ART were analyzed with KEGG Metabolic pathways by irGSEA and algorithm MEBOCOST to study cell-cell communications mediated by metabolites from sender cells and sensor proteins on receiver cells. RESULTS lots of differentially expressed Metabolic Pathways were identified for immune cells, including Energy Production and Utilization, Lipid Metabolism, Amino Acid Metabolism, Glycosylation and Glycan Biosynthesis and Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense. CONCLUSIONS The analysis highlights the intricate metabolic interplay between monocytes and other immune cells, reflecting their central role in orchestrating immune responses through metabolite exchange. These insights may open avenues for therapeutic interventions, targeting metabolic pathways to enhance immune function or inhibit pathogen survival.">

To address this, we tested inhaled GM-CSF treatment in the Pneumonia Virus of Mice (PVM) mouse model. Our findings show that local GM-CSF therapy during PVM disease increased local neutrophilia and monocyte-derived cell influx, but diminished CD8+ T cells responses. Despite this, the observed effects on T cells and myeloid cells did not result in an altered clinical outcome during PVM infection.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease characterized by expanding demyelinating lesions, leading to severe and irreversible disability. The mechanisms driving lesion expansion, however, remain poorly understood. Here, using a multi-omics approach, we identified foamy microglia as primary contributors to the molecular profile of lesions and disease progression in secondary progressive MS. Lesions with foamy microglia are marked by the accumulation of cholesterol esters, bismonoacylglycerolphosphates (BMP), and oxylipins, along with high B-cell infiltration, increased levels of immunoglobulin G1, and elevated expression of Fcγ- and complement receptors. Lesions with foamy GPNMB+-microglia display markers of enhanced phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, lysosomal dysfunction, and antigen presentation, but lack classical pro-inflammatory markers. Our data suggest that sustained phagocytosis of myelin overwhelms microglial endo-lysosomal capacity, leading to lipid droplet and oxylipin formation. This microglial phenotype may induce further recruitment of adaptive immune cells, axonal damage, drive lesion expansion and prevent remyelination. Monoacylglycerol lipase, involved in producing oxylipin precursors, was identified as a potential therapeutic target to disrupt this cycle and prevent chronic lesion expansion.">

        <tr id="Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are the regenerative force of the gut epithelium. Lgr5+-ISC have been shown to respond to changes in their microenvironment by coping with different metabolites, adapting to caloric changes, and recovering from injury and inflammation. However, how pathogenic bacteria affect adult stem cell regeneration and, as a consequence, the overall tissue adaption to infection has yet to be explored in depth. Here, we interrogated early Lgr5+ ISC responses to an enteric intracellular pathogen by profiling individual IECs from the mouse small intestine. Utilizing GFP-labeled Salmonella enterica, we isolated intracellular invaded cells to elucidate invasion programs of epithelial cell subsets. In particular, we identified a Salmonella-specific infection signature comprised of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, including the Defensin gene family. Our findings demonstrate that Salmonella enterica targets differentiated Paneth, enterocytes, and stem/progenitor cells at these early stages of infection. In response, a rapid Lg5+ ISC-driven cellular remodeling to enterocyte and Paneth lineages expressing AMP genes is initiated to combat the intruders. Importantly, we uncovered an ISC differentiation program via inflammasome activation to protect the crypt environment, while eliminating infected stem cells from the overall stem cell pool. This novel Lgr5+ stem cell defense mechanism not only protects the gut epithelium from persistent bacterial infection but also promotes tissue regeneration. We propose epithelial remodeling to AMP-secreting cells as a novel innate immune response to handle different gut stresses mediated by Lgr5+ ISCs to maintain organizational principles of gut homeostasis and physiology.">

        <tr id="The identification of specific markers for microglia has been a long-standing challenge. Recently, markers such as P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls have been proposed as microglia-specific and widely used to explore microglial functions within various central nervous system (CNS) contexts. The specificity of these markers was based on the assumption that circulating monocytes retain their distinct signatures even after infiltrating the CNS. However, recent findings reveal that infiltrating monocytes can adopt microglia-like characteristics while maintaining a pro-inflammatory profile upon permanent engraftment in the CNS.In this study, we utilize bone marrow chimeras, single-cell RNA sequencing, ATAC-seq, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that engrafted monocytes acquire expression of established microglia markers—P2ry12, TMEM119, Fcrls—and the pan-myeloid marker Iba1, which has been commonly mischaracterized as microglia-specific. These changes are accompanied by alterations in chromatin accessibility and shifts in chromatin binding motifs that are indicative of microglial identity. Moreover, we show that engrafted monocytes dynamically regulate the expression of CX3CR1, CCR2, Ly6C, and transcription factors PU.1, CTCF, RUNX, AP-1, CEBP, and IRF2, all of which are crucial for shaping microglial identity. This study is the first to illustrate that engrafted monocytes in the retina undergo both epigenetic and transcriptional changes, enabling them to express microglia-like signatures. These findings highlight the need for future research to account for these changes when assessing the roles of monocytes and microglia in CNS pathology. Significance Statement Monocytes can express putative microglia markers P2ry12, TMEM119, and Fcrls upon engraftment into the retina. Given their involvement in neuroinflammation, it is crucial to consider this overlap when utilizing these markers for experimental analysis.">

        <tr id="Factors governing the coagulopathy and pneumonitis associated with severe viral infections remain unresolved. We previously found that the expression of protein S (PROS1) is increased in lung epithelium of patients with mild COVID-19 as compared to severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that PROS1 may exert a local effect that protects the upper airway against severe inflammation by modulating epithelial and myeloid cell responses. To test this, in vitro air-interface cultures, seeded from primary healthy human lung epithelial cells, were infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. This model, validated by single-cell RNAseq analysis, recapitulated the dynamic cell-profile and pathogenic changes of COVID-19. We showed that PROS1 was located in the basal cells of healthy pseudostratified epithelium. During SARS-Cov-2 infection, PROS1 was released by basal cells, which was partially mediated by interferon. Transcriptome analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced proinflammatory phenotypes (CXCL10/11high, PTGS2posF3high, S100A8/A9high) of basal and transitional cells. PROS1 strongly downregulated these cells and transformed the proinflammatory CXCL10/11high basal cells into the regenerative S100A2posKRThigh basal cell phenotype. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection elevated M-CSF secretion from epithelium, which induced MERTK, a receptor for PROS1, on monocytes added into 3D lung epithelial culture. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 drives monocyte phenotypes expressing coagulation (F13A1) and complement (C1Ǫ) genes. PROS1 significantly downregulated these phenotypes and induced higher expression of MHC class II. Overall, this study demonstrated that the epithelium-derived PROS1 during SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits the proinflammatory epithelial phenotypes, favours basal cell regeneration, and inhibits myeloid inflammation while enhancing antigen presentation. These findings highlight the importance of basal epithelial cells and PROS1 protection from viral infection induced severe lung pathology. 1) SARS-CoV2 infection of the epithelium results in release of IFN. 2) IFN secretion has an autocrine effect on epithelial cells 3) Infection and IFN cause release of PROS1 from the basal cells, as well as M-CSF from the epithelium 4) PROS1 acts on basal cells which express MERTK, a PROS1 receptor 5) PROS1 downregulated the proinflammatory phenotypes expanded by viral infection, while upregulating KRThigh basal cells with repair phenotypes 6) The secreted M-CSF drives MERTK expression on monocytes in cocultures with epithelium. 7) PROS1 induces downregulation of monocyte clusters characteristic of viral infection that express pro-coagulation and complement genes, while upregulating clusters with higher MHC class II. 8) In summary, PROS1 mediates phenotypic switch of SARS-Cov2 induced pathogenic myeloid clusters with complement and coagulation phenotypes into phenotype with efficient antigen presentation, reduces proinflammatory activation of epithelium and induces epithelial barrier repair, resulting in mild COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Myeloid cells including brain-resident (microglia) and peripheral macrophages play a crucial role in various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). They respond to disruption of tissue homeostasis associated with disease conditions by acquiring various transcriptional and functional states. Experimental investigation of these states is hampered by the lack of tools that enable accessible and robust reprogramming of human macrophages toward Alzheimer’s disease-relevant molecular and cellular phenotypes in vitro. In this study, we investigated the ability of a cytokine mix, including interleukin-4 (IL4), colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1/MCSF), interleukin 34 (IL34) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), to induce reprogramming of cultured human THP-1 macrophages. Our results indicate this treatment led to significant transcriptomic changes, driving THP-1 macrophages towards a transcriptional state reminiscent of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and lipid-associated macrophages (LAM) collectively referred to as DLAM. Transcriptome profiling revealed gene expression changes related to oxidative phosphorylation, lysosome function, and lipid metabolism. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an increased proportion of DLAM clusters in cytokine mix-treated THP-1 macrophages. Functional assays demonstrated alterations in cell motility, phagocytosis, lysosomal activity, and metabolic and energetic profiles. Our findings provide insights into the cytokine-mediated reprogramming of macrophages towards disease-relevant states, highlighting their role in neurodegenerative diseases and potential for therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Severe viral pneumonia can induce rapid expansion of KRT5+ basal-like cells in small airways and alveoli; this forms a scar-like structure that persists in the injured alveoli and impedes normal alveolar epithelium regeneration. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which viral infection induced this remodeling response. Through comparing different lung-injury models, we demonstrated that infection induced strong IFN-γ signal–stimulated dysplastic KRT5+ cell formation. Inactivation of interferon receptor 1 (Ifngr1) reduced dysplastic cell formation, ameliorated lung fibrosis, and improved lung-function recovery. Mechanistically, IFN-γ regulated dysplastic cell formation via the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) pathway. Inhibiting FAK/Src diminished IFN-γ–induced YAP nuclear translocation and dysplastic cell formation. Inhibiting YAP during viral infection prevented dysplastic cell formation, whereas inhibiting YAP in persistent KRT5+ cells led to their conversion into distal club cells. Importantly, human dysplastic cells exhibited elevated FAK and YAP activity, and IFN-γ treatment promoted the transformation of human alveolar progenitor cells into dysplastic cells. These findings uncover the role of infection-induced inflammatory response in alveolar remodeling and may provide potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of alveolar remodeling in patients with severe viral pneumonia.">

        <tr id="Background and objectives: Immunotherapies targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 are key components of the treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC). However, they have distinct safety profiles and resistance to treatment can occur. We assess soluble TIM-3 (sTIM-3) in the plasma of mccRCC patients as a potential theranostic biomarker, as well as its source and biological significance. Methods: We analyzed the association of sTIM-3 with overall survival (OS), tumor response, and common clinical and biological factors across two mccRCC cohorts treated with anti-PD-1 (n = 27), anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 (n = 124). The origin and role of sTIM-3 are studied on tumor and blood samples, using multiplex immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry as well as a syngeneic tumor model with antitumor vaccination. We also reanalyzed publicly available single-cell transcriptomic (scRNAseq) data and mass cytometry data. Key findings and limitations: sTIM-3 is elevated in the plasma of patients with mccRCC and shows distinct associations with survival on anti-PD-1 vs anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4. sTIM-3 is independent from other clinical and biological factors. Myeloid immune cells appear as the prominent source of sTIM-3, which may indicate their dysfunctional role in the antitumor immune response. Future investigations are warranted in patients treated with anti-PD-1 + antiangiogenic therapies. Further functional studies are needed to confirm its theranostic value and clarify its role in the immune response. Conclusions and clinical implications: sTIM-3 appears to be a promising biomarker for optimizing treatment strategies in ccRCC as well as a potential therapeutic target.">

Central to the function of TLS are DCs, professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that coordinate the adaptive immune response, and which can be classified into different subsets, with specific functions, and markers. In this article, we review current data on the contribution of different DC subsets to TLS function in cancer and autoimmunity, two opposite sides of the immune response. Different DC subsets can be found in different tumor types, correlating with cancer prognosis. Moreover, DCs are also present in TLS found in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, contributing to disease development. Broadly, the presence of DCs in TLS appears to be associated with favorable clinical outcomes in cancer while in autoimmune pathologies these cells are associated with unfavorable prognosis. Therefore, it is important to analyze the complex functions of DCs within TLS in order to enhance our fundamental understanding of immune regulation but also as a possible route to create innovative clinical interventions designed for the specific needs of patients with diverse pathological diseases.">

        <tr id="Dysregulated myeloid states are associated with disease severity in both sepsis and COVID-19. However, their relevance in non-COVID-19 viral infection, the factors driving their induction, and their role in tissue injury remain poorly understood. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,622,180 myeloid cells from 890 COVID-19 or sepsis patients and controls across 19 published blood scRNA-seq datasets, which revealed severity-associated gene programs in both neutrophils and monocytes pointing to emergency myelopoiesis (EM). Using published bulk transcriptional data from 562 individuals with non-COVID-19 viral disease, we show that these signatures are similarly upregulated during severe influenza and RSV infection. Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic responses in tocilizumab-treated COVID-19 patients show that IL-6 signaling blockade results in a partial reduction of EM signatures and a compensatory increase in the growth factor G-CSF. Using a cellular model of human myelopoiesis, we show that both IL-6 and G-CSF stimulate the production of myeloid cells that express EM signatures in vitro. Using a mouse model of severe influenza infection, we demonstrate the effect of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling blockade on EM-associated myeloid cells, and highlight the opposing effects of EM-induced neutrophils and monocytes on tissue injury. Our study demonstrates the link between systemic cytokines and myeloid dysregulation during severe infection in humans, and highlights the cooperative role of IL-6 and G-CSF signaling in driving infection-induced myelopoiesis.">

        <tr id="Functional tumor-specific CD8+ T cells are essential for an effective anti-tumor immune response and the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In comparison to other organ sites, we found higher numbers of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in primary, metastatic liver tumors in murine tumor models. Despite their abundance, CD8+ T cells in the liver displayed an exhausted phenotype. Depletion of CD8+ T cells showed that liver tumor-reactive CD8+ T failed to control liver tumors but was effective against subcutaneous tumors. Similarly, analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from patients showed a higher frequency of exhausted tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells in liver metastasis compared to paired primary colon cancer. High-dimensional, multi-omic analysis combining proteomic CODEX and scRNA-seq data revealed enriched interaction of SPP1+ macrophages and CD8+ tumor-reactive T cells in profibrotic, alpha-SMA rich regions in the liver. Liver tumors grew less in Spp1-/- mice and the tumor-specific CD8+ T cells were less exhausted. Differential pseudotime trajectory inference analysis revealed extrahepatic signaling promoting an intermediate cell (IC) population in the liver, characterized by co-expression of VISG4, CSF1R, CD163, TGF-βR, IL-6R, SPP1. scRNA-seq of a third data set of premetastatic adenocarcinoma showed that enrichment of this population may predict liver metastasis. Our data suggests a mechanism by which extrahepatic tumors facilitate the formation of liver metastasis by promoting an IC population inhibiting tumor-reactive CD8+ T cell function.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the resident immune cells of the Central Nervous System (CNS), play crucial roles in homeostasis, immune responses, and the modulation of neuronal functions. In brain tumors, microglia are difficult to distinguish from infiltrating macrophages and are collectively called Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs). While these cells exhibit plasticity, support tumor growth, and suppress antitumor immune responses, their identity and function remain largely unknown. Cellular senescence, a state of growth arrest associated with the upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4A (Cdkn2a), can both suppress and promote tumor progression via the secretion of inflammatory and tissue remodeling factors, collectively known as Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). By leveraging existing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of murine brain tumors, we identified a population of Cdkn2a-positive TAMs involved in immune regulation and neurogenesis, characterized by high expression of Emb and Cd93, which we named MECC (Microglia-like, and Emb-, CD93- and Cdkn2a-positive) cells. In humans, these cells were more prevalent in recurrent glioblastoma and associated with poorer prognosis. Comparative analysis of brain samples from patients with neurodegeneration and healthy older individuals revealed the specificity of MECCs for brain tumors. These findings suggest that MECCs are a unique and distinct cell population associated with aggressive brain tumors, which could potentially serve as targets for novel treatments.">

Bregs have been shown to maintain immune homeostasis and modulate inflammatory responses. Bregs are an exciting cellular target across a range of diseases, including Breg induction in autoimmunity, allergy and transplantation, and Breg suppression in cancers and infection. Bregs exhibit a remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, rendering their unequivocal identification a challenging task. The lack of a universally accepted and exclusive surface marker set for Bregs across various studies contributes to inconsistencies in their categorization. This review paper presents a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the phenotypic and functional properties of human Bregs while addressing the persisting ambiguities and discrepancies in their characterization. Finally, the paper examines the promising therapeutic opportunities presented by Bregs as their immunomodulatory capacities have gained attention in the context of autoimmune diseases, allergic conditions, and cancer. We explore the exciting potential in harnessing Bregs as potential therapeutic agents and the avenues that remain open for the development of Breg-based treatment strategies.">

        <tr id="Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that lacks hormone receptors and HER2 amplification, making it unresponsive to standard hormone or HER2-targeted therapies. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in tumors with high lymphocyte infiltration, their efficacy remains limited in tumors with minimal lymphocyte infiltration. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel approach to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) from an immunosuppressive to an inflammatory phenotype within the tumor microenvironment (TME), aiming to enhance therapeutic outcomes in TNBC. Methods We designed a chimeric cytokine receptor (ChCR) that triggers STAT1 signaling upon stimulation with IL-10 or TGFβ, cytokines prevalent in the TME that typically drive immunosuppression. Human primary macrophages were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing the ChCR, and changes in their phenotype, secretome, and transcriptome were analyzed following stimulation. The anti-tumoral activity of these reprogrammed macrophages was assessed using co-culture assays with 3D TNBC spheroids. Results ChCR expressing macrophages showed robust STAT1 activation in response to IL-10 or TGFβ stimulation, resulting in an inflammatory phenotype similar to IFNγ activation, as confirmed by phenotypic markers, and transcriptomic profiling. These ChCR-stimulated macrophages demonstrated significant anti-tumoral effects in 3D TNBC spheroids. Moreover, ChCR stimulation led to the upregulation of genes associated with good response to ICIs, among others CXCL9 and CXCL10, chemokines essential for lymphocyte recruitment. Secretion of CXCL10 was also confirmed by ELISA. Conclusion We successfully engineered a ChCR that reprograms TAMs within an IL-10- and TGFβ-rich environment, inducing an inflammatory phenotype and anti-tumoral activity. The expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 further supports lymphocyte recruitment, potentially facilitating greater lymphocyte infiltration and disrupting the immunosuppressive TME. This approach offers a promising strategy to improve immunotherapy outcomes in TNBC patients, particularly those with low immune cell infiltration, thereby addressing a critical unmet clinical need.">

Our study highlights the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1, predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, as a crucial regulator of their physiological functions. We discovered a strong correlation between increased Hv1 expression and poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. Depleting Hv1 significantly extended survival in a mouse model of glioma. Employing multiple novel transgenic mouse lines, we demonstrated that Hv1 is upregulated in response to tumor presence, with glioma-associated macrophages as the principal contributors. Specifically, we identified that Hv1 in infiltrating macrophages as the major driver of survival phenotype differences. Through a combination of in vivo two-photon imaging, spectral flow cytometry, and spatial transcriptomic sequencing, we found that Hv1 depletion leads to reduced macrophage infiltration and enhanced antigen presentation, ultimately fostering a stronger adaptive immune response. These findings establish the Hv1 channel as a crucial new immune regulator within the brain tumor milieu, offering a promising target for reprogramming macrophage function to combat glioblastoma.">

In this study, 21 Rhesus macaques (RMs) were SIV-infected, of which 13 were assessed during acute infection and 8 following ART initiation four days post-infection.

Finally, frequencies of CD39+ DN Tregs increased during acute HIV and SIV infections and remained elevated despite ART. Altogether, acute HIV/SIV infections significantly changed DN T-cell and DN Treg frequencies and altered their immune phenotype, while these changes were not fully normalized by early ART, suggesting persistent HIV/SIV-induced immune dysregulation despite early ART initiation.">

        <tr id="Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection can result in either productive or latent infection, the latter being the basis for the virus life-long persistence. Intriguingly, monocytes, which support latent infection, become permissive to productive infection upon differentiation to macrophages. However, the molecular factors explaining these differentiation-driven differences are not fully understood and have been so far attributed to chromatin-mediated repression of the viral genome. Here, by using metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA early in monocyte and macrophage infection, we discover a major early block in viral gene expression, and viral transcripts are barely detected in infected monocytes. By unbiasedly analyzing the changes between monocytes and their differentiated counterparts, we reveal that the levels of several cell surface proteins involved in HCMV entry are upregulated upon monocyte to macrophage differentiation, and correspondingly we uncover HCMV entry into monocytes compared to macrophages is extremely inefficient. Remarkably, ectopic expression of a canonical HCMV entry receptor in monocytes facilitates productive infection of these cells, demonstrating that given efficient viral entry, monocytes, like macrophages, have the capacity to support productive infection. Among the cell surface proteins that are upregulated upon monocyte differentiation are several integrins, which we show play an important role in HCMV entry into macrophages, partially explaining the differences in viral entry. Overall, our findings reveal that a previously unrecognized major barrier for productive infection in monocytes is entry, adding a critical layer to the paradigm of HCMV latency.">

        <tr id="Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, is the most common major complication of preterm birth. Supplemental oxygen administration, while lifesaving in the neonatal period, remains a key determinant of BPD pathophysiology. Exposure of the immature lung to increased levels of oxygen elicits an inflammatory response resulting in abnormal lung development. However, not every premature infant is equally sensitive to develop BPD. Using genetically diverse mouse strains, we show that the innate immune response activated in the lungs of mice sensitive to hyperoxia that develop BPD-like lung injury differs from mice resilient to disease. Specifically, we identified a selective upregulation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) on lung macrophages and monocytes in the hyperoxia-sensitive C57BL/6J mouse strain. We show that loss of function of TREM2 signaling in myeloid cells resulted in a dramatically improved phenotype after neonatal hyperoxia exposure characterized by a dampened immune response, preserved alveolar structure, and preserved cell proliferative potential supporting normal lung development. At the molecular level, inhibition of TREM2 signaling dampened the magnitude of p53 activation and resulted in cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis. These findings show that TREM2 is a critical regulator of the pathogenic innate immune response to hyperoxia and highlight its importance as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating injury in the hyperoxia-exposed developing lung.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Limited activation and infiltration of CD8+ T cells are major challenges facing T cell-based immunotherapy for most solid tumors, of which the mechanism is multilayered and not yet fully understood. Methods Levels of CD93 expression on monocytes from paired non-tumor, peritumor and tumor tissues of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were evaluated. The underlying mechanisms mediating effects of CD93+ monocytes on the inhibition and tumor exclusion of CD8+ T cells were studied through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results In this study, we found that monocytes in the peritumoral tissues of HCC significantly increased levels of CD93 expression, and these CD93+ monocytes collocated with CD8+ T cells, whose density was much higher in peritumor than intratumor areas. In vitro experiments showed that glycolytic switch mediated tumor-induced CD93 upregulation in monocytes via the Erk signaling pathway. CD93 on the one hand could enhance PD-L1 expression through the AKT-GSK3β axis, while on the other hand inducing monocytes to produce versican, a type of matrix component which interacted with hyaluronan and collagens to inhibit CD8+ T cell migration. Consistently, levels of CD93+ monocytes positively correlated with the density of peritumoral CD8+ T cells while negatively correlated with that of intratumoral CD8+ T cells. Targeting CD93 on monocytes not only increased the infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells but also enhanced tumor sensitivity to anti-PD-1 treatment in mice in vivo. Conclusion This study identified an important mechanism contributing to the activation and limited infiltration of CD8+ T cells in solid tumors, and CD93+ monocytes might represent a plausible immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.">

Treg cells leverage combined IFNγ and interleukin 10 (IL-10) stimulation of ISCs to nurture the growth of intestinal organoids through the activation of the mTORC1 and Myc pathways. Similarly, Treg cells or the combined addition of recombinant IFNγ and IL-10 promote the regeneration of organoids after irradiation. Exposure of organoids to Wnt- or EGF-free culture conditions revealed distinct growth factor-like properties of IFNγ and IL-10. While IFNγ induced epithelial proliferation and differentiation, combined addition of IFNγ and IL-10 led to balanced proliferation, ensuring ISC maintenance. Our results uncover a context-dependent role of inflammatory signaling in ISC, through which Treg cells promote epithelial repair.">

        <tr id="The nasal, oropharyngeal, and bronchial mucosa are primary contact points for airborne pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), SARS-CoV-2, and influenza virus. While mucosal surfaces can function as both entry points and barriers to infection, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) facilitate early immune responses to mucosal antigens. MALT contains a variety of specialized epithelial cells, including a rare cell type called a microfold cell (M cell) that functions to transport apical antigens to basolateral antigen-presenting cells, a crucial step in the initiation of mucosal immunity. M cells have been extensively characterized in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in murine and human models. However, the precise development and functions of human airway M cells is unknown. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), we generated an atlas of cells from the human adenoid and identified 16 unique cell types representing basal, club, hillock, and hematopoietic lineages, defined their developmental trajectories, and determined cell-cell relationships. Using trajectory analysis, we found that human airway M cells develop from progenitor club cells and express a gene signature distinct from intestinal M cells. Surprisingly, we also identified a heretofore unknown epithelial cell type demonstrating a robust interferon-stimulated gene signature. Our analysis of human adenoid cells enhances our understanding of mucosal immune responses and the role of M cells in airway immunity. This work also provides a resource for understanding early interactions of pathogens with airway mucosa and a platform for development of mucosal vaccines.">

        <tr id="Proliferating tumor cells take up glutamine for anabolic processes engendering glutamine deficiency in the tumor microenvironment. How this might impact immune cells is not well understood. Using multiple mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, glutamine antagonists, as well as genetic and pharmacological inhibition of glutamine utilization, we found that the number and frequency of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) is dependent on microenvironmental glutamine levels. cDCs comprise two distinct subsets – cDC1 and cDC2, with the former subset playing a critical role in antigen cross-presentation and tumor immunity. While both subsets show dependence on Glutamine, cDC1s are particularly sensitive. Notably, glutamine antagonism did not reduce the frequency of DC precursors but decreased proliferation and survival of cDC1s. Further studies suggest a role of the nutrient sensing mTOR signaling pathway in this process. Taken together, these findings uncover glutamine dependence of cDC1s that is coopted by tumors to escape immune responses. One Sentence Summary Type 1 conventional dendritic cells require glutamine to maintain their number in non-lymphoid tissue. Significance Immune evasion is a key hallmark of cancer; however, the underlying pathways are diverse, tumor-specific and not fully elucidated. Many tumor cells avidly import glutamine to support their anabolic needs, creating a glutamine-deficient tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, using mouse models of soft tissue sarcomas, we show that glutamine depletion in TME leads to reduced type 1 conventional dendritic cells – a cell type that is critical for adaptive immune responses. This work is a paradigm for how tumor cell metabolism can regulate anti-tumor immune responses and will be foundational to future efforts targeting glutamine metabolism for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background Smooth muscle cell (SMC) plasticity and phenotypic switching play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, but their role in tumorigenesis is unknown. We investigated whether and how SMC diversity and plasticity plays a role in tumor angiogenesis and the tumor microenvironment. Methods and Results We use SMC-specific lineage-tracing mouse models and single cell RNA sequencing to observe the phenotypic diversity of SMCs participating in tumor vascularization. We find that a significant proportion of SMCs adopt a phenotype traditionally associated with macrophage-like cells. These cells are transcriptionally similar to ‘resolution phase’ M2b macrophages, which have been described to have a role in inflammation resolution. Computationally predicted by the ligand-receptor algorithm CellChat, signaling from BST2 on the surface of tumor cells to PIRA2 on SMCs promote this phenotypic transition; in vitro SMC assays demonstrate upregulation of macrophage transcriptional programs, and increased proliferation, migration, and phagocytic ability when exposed to BST2. Knockdown of BST2 in the tumor significantly decreases the transition towards a macrophage-like phenotype, and cells that do transition have a comparatively higher inflammatory signal typically associated with anti-tumor effect. Conclusion As BST2 is known to be a poor prognostic marker in multiple cancers where it is associated with an M2 macrophage-skewed TME, these studies suggest that phenotypically switched SMCs may have a previously unidentified role in this immunosuppressive milieu. Further translational work is needed to understand how this phenotypic switch could influence the response to anti-cancer agents and if targeted inhibition of SMC plasticity would be therapeutically beneficial.">

        <tr id="Influenza A virus (IAV) is known for causing seasonal epidemics ranging from flu to more severe outcomes like pneumonia, cytokine storms, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The innate immune response and inflammasome activation play pivotal roles in sensing, preventing, and clearing the infection, as well as in the potential exacerbation of disease progression. This study examines the complex relationships between donor-specific characteristics and cytokine responses during H3N2 IAV infection using an ex vivo model. At 24 h post infection in 31 human lung explant tissue samples, key cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) were upregulated. Interestingly, a history of lung cancer did not impact the acute immune response. However, cigarette smoking and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on macrophages significantly increased IL-2 levels. Conversely, age inversely affected IL-4 levels, and diabetes mellitus negatively influenced IL-6 levels. Additionally, both diabetes mellitus and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression on CD3+/CD4+ T cells negatively impacted TNF-α levels, while body mass index was inversely associated with IFN-γ production. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression emerged as crucial in mediating acute innate and adaptive immune responses. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between individual physiological traits and immune responses during influenza infection, underscoring the importance of tailored and personalized approaches in IAV treatment and prevention.">

        <tr id="A principal reason for the high global morbidity and mortality of tuberculosis (TB) is the lack of efficacy of the only licensed TB vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), as parenteral BCG does not induce local pulmonary immune memory. Animal studies have shown that mucosal BCG vaccination provides superior protection against TB due to generation of lung resident memory T cells (TRM). Here, we demonstrated that following mucosal vaccination with the genetically modified virulent BCG strain, BCG::RD1, distal airway epithelial progenitors were mobilized to assist with restoration of alveolar epithelium. By way of their migration-mediated activation of latent TGF-β, lung CD8+ TRM differentiation was induced. Mucosal vaccinations using nonvirulent strains of BCG in which airway epithelial progenitors were not mobilized, as well as genetic inhibition of migration-mediated activation of TGF-β, resulted in significantly lower numbers of lung CD8+ TRM. In addition, we discovered CD8+ cells with ex-lung and stem-like TRM phenotypes that persisted in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes for up to four months following mucosal BCG vaccination. These results link airway epithelial progenitor-mediated repair of injured lung tissue with induction of resident T cell memory and delineate why persistence of TRM in the lung is short-lived. These findings may explain why mucosal vaccination with virulent BCG strains is more protective against TB and thus have notable implications for future TB vaccine development. One Sentence Summary Following lung damage due to inhalation of virulent BCG, distal airway epithelial progenitor cells interact with lung CD8+ T cells to induce their differentiation into resident memory T cells via migration-mediated activation of TGF-β.">

        <tr id="Introduction This is a prospective, rigorous inquiry into the systemic immune effects of standard adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, for WHO grade 4, glioblastoma. The purpose is to identify peripheral immunologic effects never yet reported in key immune populations, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which are critical to the immune suppressive environment of glioblastoma. We hypothesize that harmful immune-supportive white blood cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, expand in response to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide, essentially promoting systemic immunity similar what is seen in chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Methods 16 patients were enrolled in a single-institution, observational, immune surveillance study where peripheral blood was collected and interrogated by flow cytometry and RNAseq. Tumor tissue from baseline assessment was analyzed with spatial proteomics to link peripheral blood findings to baseline tissue characteristics. Results We identified an increase in myeloid-derived suppressor cells during the final week of a six-week treatment of chemoradiotherapy in peripheral blood of patients that were not alive at two years after diagnosis compared to those who were living. This was also associated with a decrease in CD8+ T lymphocytes that produced IFNγ, the potent anti-tumor cytokine. Discussion These data suggest that, as in chronic inflammatory disease, systemic immunity is impaired following delivery of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Finally, baseline investigation of myeloid cells within tumor tissue did not differ between survival groups, indicating immune surveillance of peripheral blood during adjuvant therapy may be a critical missing link to educate our understanding of the immune effects of standard of care therapy for glioblastoma.">

Higher CD45⁺ infiltration correlated with worse survival, establishing CD45⁺ density as a prognostic marker. In CD45high tumors, ccRCC cells losing epithelial markers showed increased expression of mesenchymal markers such as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), vimentin (VIM), and PD-L1, indicating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

        <tr id="Background Immune therapies are emerging as a critical component of cancer treatment, capable of delivering durable and potentially curative responses. While CAR-T cell therapy has proven effective for hematological malignancies, it faces challenges in treating solid tumors due to tumor antigen heterogeneity, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and physical barriers hindering CAR-T cell infiltration. NK cells, particularly adaptive NK (aNK) cells, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to recognize and kill tumor cells without prior sensitization and their resistance to immunosuppressive environments. Purpose The study investigates the role of cytokines, specifically IL-21 and IL-15, in enhancing aNK cell expansion and activation using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Methods Buffy coats and GBM TILs were collected from Karolinska Hospital. NK cells were isolated and expanded in vitro with IL-15 and IL-21 cytokines and feeder cells (K562 and K562E). Furthermore, tumor lysate was added in the cultures to boost memory responses in aNK cells. NK cell functionality, cytotoxicity, and phenotyping was assessed using flow cytometry and statistical analysis (t-test and two-way ANOVA) used to validate the results. Further animal model was used to validate the cytotoxicity capacities of these cells against GBM tumors using a zebrafish model. Results IL-21 drives the expansion of aNK better than IL-15 controls, data shown in PBMCs and TILs derived from GBM patients and IPLA OVCA patients. Additionally, the use of tumor lysate as a booster for restimulation further amplifies the cytotoxic capacity of aNK cells against autologous tumors. The zebrafish model validates this method, by decreasing the tumor size in zebrafish animals after 3 days of injection. Conclusion The results demonstrate that IL-21 is essential for the specific expansion of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. Additionally, tumor lysate significantly increases the cytotoxic efficacy of aNK cells upon restimulation with the same tumor cells. These findings suggest that IL-21 plays a crucial role in the specific expansion and activation of aNK cells, enhancing their aggressiveness towards tumor cells. By optimizing the expansion protocol, this method aims to advance the clinical application of aNK cells in immunotherapies for solid tumors, offering a potential solution to the limitations faced by current CAR-T therapies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) T regulatory cells are critical for maintaining self-tolerance, immune homeostasis, and regulating the immune system. Methods We investigated interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) signalling on T regulatory cells (Tregs) during Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) infection using a mouse model on a BALB/c background, specifically with IL-4Rα knockdown in Tregs (Foxp3creIL-4Rα−/lox). Results We showed an impairment of Treg responses, along with a decreased bacterial burden and diminished tissue pathology in the liver and spleen, which translated into better survival. Mechanistically, we observed an enhancement of the Th1 signature, characterised by increased expression of the T-bet transcription factor and a greater number of effector T cells producing IFN-γ, IL-2 following ex-vivo stimulation with heat-killed L. monocytogenes in Foxp3creIL-4Rα-/lox mice. Furthermore, CD8 T cells from Foxp3creIL-4Rα-/lox mice displayed increased cytotoxicity (Granzyme-B) with higher proliferation capacity (Ki-67), better survival (Bcl-2) with concomitant reduced apoptosis (activated caspase 3). In contrast to L. monocytogenes, Foxp3creIL-4Rα-/lox mice displayed similar bacterial burdens, lung pathology and survival during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection, despite increased T cell numbers and IFN-γ, TNF and IL-17 production. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that the diminished IL-4Rα signalling on Foxp3+ T regulatory cells resulted in a loss of their functionality, leading to survival benefits in listeriosis but not in tuberculosis.">

        <tr id="Aberrant Notch, which is a defining feature of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, regulates intercellular communication in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). This includes tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment through Notch-dependent cytokine secretion, contributing to an immunosuppressive TIME. Despite the low response rate of TNBC to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), here, we report that inhibition of Notch-driven cytokine-mediated programs reduces TAMs and induces responsiveness to sequentially delivered ICB. This is characterized by the emergence of GrB+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the primary tumor. A more impressive effect of sequential treatment is observed in the lung where TAM depletion and increased CTLs are accompanied by near-complete abolition of metastases. This is due to (i) therapeutic reduction in Notch-dependent, prometastatic circulating factors released by the primary tumor, and (ii) elevated PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) in lung metastases, rendering them profoundly sensitive to ICB. These findings highlight the potential of combination cytokine inhibition and ICB as an immunotherapeutic strategy in TNBC.">

        <tr id="Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is primarily categorized into basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most prevalent form of skin cancer, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), the second most common type. Both BCC and cSCC represent a significant health burden, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. The immune system plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of NMSC, making it a critical focus for therapeutic interventions. This review highlights key immunological targets in BCC and cSCC, with a focus on immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4, which regulate T cell activity and contribute to immune evasion. This review also highlights anti-tumor immune cell subsets within the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and dendritic cells. Additionally, it examines the immunosuppressive elements of the TME, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as well as their roles in NMSC progression and resistance to therapy. Emerging strategies targeting these immune elements, such as monoclonal antibodies, are also discussed for their potential to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve clinical outcomes. By elucidating the immunological landscape of BCC and cSCC and drawing comparisons to melanoma, this review highlights the transformative potential of immunotherapy in treating these malignancies.">

        <tr id="Abstract High-grade serous ovarian cancer remains a poorly understood disease with a high mortality rate. Although most patients respond to cytotoxic therapies, a majority will experience recurrence. This may be due to a minority of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells (CSC) that survive chemotherapy and are capable of repopulating heterogeneous tumors. It remains unclear how CSCs are supported in the tumor microenvironment (TME) particularly during chemotherapy exposure. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) make up half of the immune population of the ovarian TME and are known to support CSCs and contribute to cancer progression. TAMs are plastic cells that alter their phenotype in response to environmental stimuli and thus may influence CSC maintenance during chemotherapy. Given the plasticity of TAMs, we studied the effects of carboplatin on macrophage phenotypes using both THP1- and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)–derived macrophages and whether this supports CSCs and ovarian cancer progression following treatment. We found that carboplatin exposure induces an M1-like proinflammatory phenotype that promotes SOX2 expression, spheroid formation, and CD117+ ovarian CSCs, and that macrophage-secreted CCL2/MCP-1 is at least partially responsible for this effect. Depletion of TAMs during carboplatin exposure results in fewer CSCs and prolonged survival in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. This study supports a role for platinum-based chemotherapies in promoting a transient proinflammatory M1-like TAM that enriches for CSCs during treatment. Improving our understanding of TME responses to cytotoxic drugs and identifying novel mechanisms of CSC maintenance will enable the development of better therapeutic strategies for high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Significance: We show that chemotherapy enhances proinflammatory macrophage phenotypes that correlate with ovarian cancer progression. Given that macrophages are the most prominent immune cell within these tumors, this work provides the foundation for future translational studies targeting specific macrophage populations during chemotherapy, a promising approach to prevent relapse in ovarian cancer.">

        <tr id="The colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) plays a pivotal role in orchestrating cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Although the CSF-1R has been extensively studied in myeloid cells, the expression of this receptor and its emerging role in other cell types in the TME need to be further analyzed. This review explores the multifaceted functions of the CSF-1R across various TME cellular populations, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), dendritic cells (DCs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells (ECs), and cancer stem cells (CSCs). The activation of the CSF-1R by its ligands, colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and Interleukin-34 (IL-34), regulates TAM polarization towards an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype, promoting tumor progression and immune evasion. Similarly, CSF-1R signaling influences MDSCs to exert immunosuppressive functions, hindering anti-tumor immunity. In DCs, the CSF-1R alters antigen-presenting capabilities, compromising immune surveillance against cancer cells. CSF-1R expression in CAFs and ECs regulates immune modulation, angiogenesis, and immune cell trafficking within the TME, fostering a pro-tumorigenic milieu. Notably, the CSF-1R in CSCs contributes to tumor aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance through interactions with TAMs and the modulation of stemness features. Understanding the diverse roles of the CSF-1R in the TME underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment, aiming at disrupting pro-tumorigenic cellular crosstalk and enhancing anti-tumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Glioblastoma is known to be highly immunosuppressive in nature. Plasmacytoid dendritic cell infiltration is known to be associated with glioblastoma progression and promotes tumor immunosuppression. We provide important details to indicate that glioblastoma cell-secreted CCL21 plays a dual role both in recruiting plasmacytoid dendritic cells via binding to CCR7 and activating plasmacytoid dendritic cells through the CCR7/ACKR4—β-arrestin/CIITA pathway. Our result also provides a rationale to therapeutically target CCL21 as a potential novel treatment for glioblastoma. Abstract Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that are traditionally divided into two distinct subsets: myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). pDCs are known for their ability to secrete large amounts of cytokine type I interferons (IFN- α). In our previous work, we have demonstrated that pDC infiltration promotes glioblastoma (GBM) tumor immunosuppression through decreased IFN-α secretion via TLR-9 signaling and increased suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) via increased IL-10 secretion, resulting in poor overall outcomes in mouse models of GBM. Further dissecting the overall mechanism of pDC-mediated GBM immunosuppression, in this study, we identified CCL21 as highly upregulated by multiple GBM cell lines, which recruit pDCs to tumor sites via CCL21-CCR7 signaling. Furthermore, pDCs are activated by CCL21 in the GBM microenvironment through intracellular signaling of β-arrestin and CIITA. Finally, we found that CCL21-treated pDCs directly suppress CD8+ T cell proliferation without affecting regulatory T cells (Tregs) differentiation, which is considered the canonical pathway of immunotolerant regulation. Taken together, our results show that pDCs play a multifaced role in GBM immunosuppression, and CCL21 could be a novel therapeutic target in GBM to overcome pDC-mediated immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives In multiple sclerosis (MS), immune cells invade the CNS and destroy myelin. Macrophages contribute to demyelination and myelin repair, and their role in each process depends on their ability to acquire specific phenotypes in response to external signals. In this article, we assess whether defects in MS patient macrophage responses may lead to increased inflammation or lack of neuroregenerative effects. Methods CD14+CD16− monocytes from patients with MS and healthy controls (HCs) were activated in vitro to obtain homeostatic-like, proinflammatory, and proregenerative macrophages. Macrophage activation profiles were assessed through RNA sequencing and metabolomics. Surface molecule expression of CD14, CD16, and HLA-DR and myelin phagocytic capacity were evaluated with flow cytometry. Macrophage supernatant capacity to influence oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation toward an astrocytic or oligodendroglia fate was also tested. Results We observed that MS patient monocytes ex vivo recapitulate their preferential activation toward the CD16+ phenotype, a subset of proinflammatory cells overrepresented in MS lesions. Functionally, MS patient macrophages display a decreased capacity to phagocytose human myelin and a deficit of processing myelin after ingestion. In addition, MS patient macrophage supernatant favors astrocytes over oligodendrocyte differentiation when compared with HC macrophage supernatant. Furthermore, even when exposed to homeostatic or proregenerative stimuli, MS patient macrophages uphold a proinflammatory transcriptomic profile with higher levels of cytokine/chemokine. Of interest, MS patient macrophages exhibit a distinct metabolic signature with a mitochondrial energy metabolism blockage. Transcriptomic data are further substantiated by metabolomics studies that reveal perturbations in the corresponding metabolic pathways. Discussion Our results show an intrinsic defect of MS patient macrophages, reminiscent of innate immune cell memory in MS, lifting macrophage importance in the disease and as potential therapeutic targets.">

        <tr id="There is a complex interplay between viral infection and host innate immune response regarding disease severity and outcomes. Neutrophil hyperactivation, including excessive release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), is linked to exacerbated disease in acute COVID-19, notably in hospitalized patients. Delineating protective versus detrimental neutrophil responses is essential to developing targeted COVID-19 therapies and relies on high-quality translational animal models. In this study, we utilize a previously established feline model for COVID-19 to investigate neutrophil dysfunction in which experimentally infected cats develop clinical disease that mimics acute COVID-19. Specific pathogen-free cats were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2; Delta variant) (n = 24) or vehicle (n = 6). Plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissues were collected at various time points over 12 days post-inoculation. Systematic and temporal evaluation of the kinetics of neutrophil activation was conducted by measuring markers of activation including myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated histone H3 (citH3) in SARS-CoV-2-infected cats at 4 and 12 days post-inoculation (dpi) and compared to vehicle-inoculated controls. Cytokine profiling supported elevated innate inflammatory responses with specific upregulation of neutrophil activation and NET formation-related markers, namely IL-8, IL-18, CXCL1, and SDF-1, in infected cats. An increase in MPO-DNA complexes and cell-free dsDNA in infected cats compared to vehicle-inoculated was noted and supported by histopathologic severity in respiratory tissues. Immunofluorescence analyses further supported correlation of NET markers with tissue damage, especially 4 dpi. Differential gene expression analyses indicated an upregulation of genes associated with innate immune and neutrophil activation pathways. Transcripts involved in activation and NETosis pathways were upregulated by 4 dpi and downregulated by 12 dpi, suggesting peak activation of neutrophils and NET-associated markers in the early acute stages of infection. Correlation analyses conducted between NET-specific markers and clinical scores as well as histopathologic scores support association between neutrophil activation and disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection in this model. Overall, this study emphasizes the effect of neutrophil activation and NET release in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a feline model, prompting further investigation into therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating excessive innate inflammatory responses in COVID-19.">

        <tr id="Neutrophils play a crucial role in various pathophysiological conditions, yet targeting them for therapeutic intervention has been discouraged due to the associated risk of infections. Thus, identification of neutrophil subsets and their involvement in inflammatory conditions is warranted for targeted therapeutic strategies. This study, through screening of surface proteins on neutrophils isolated from different tissue microenvironments, identified a distinct neutrophil subset, CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils, expressing Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1). Interestingly, these Sca1pos neutrophils were more abundant in the liver than BM, blood, and lungs. Further analysis revealed that Sca1pos neutrophils are mature and activated with enhanced effector functions, including superoxide generation, phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis. Tracing studies demonstrated ageing-independent characteristics of Sca1pos neutrophils. Remarkably, Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophils promote T cell proliferation through ROS, while inhibition of Sca-1 restores T cell proliferation and ROS generation. Intriguingly, inflammatory as well as metabolic cues induce the transition of conventional neutrophils (Sca1neg) to Sca1pos neutrophils and differentiation of progenitors (granulocyte monocyte progenitors, GMPs) into Sca1pos neutrophils. Furthermore, in vivo models of acute inflammation, peritonitis, and chronic inflammatory condition, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), exhibit an increase of Sca1pos neutrophils at inflammatory sites, while the pharmacological approach using NAC specifically mitigates the expansion of these pro-inflammatory neutrophils. Collectively, our findings unveil a novel subset of Sca1pos neutrophils with implications for inflammation. Significance Statement Neutrophilic inflammation remains the leading driver in infectious and inflammatory diseases. Targeting neutrophil populations remained un-recommended due to hampering the immunological functions of neutrophils. The heterogeneity of neutrophils provides the perspective to target altered neutrophil subsets, but subtle changes defining neutrophil subsets make it complex and ambiguous. Our study identified abundant expression of Sca1on distinct neutrophils under steady state and inflammation. Thus, we reported previously undefined Sca1pos pro-inflammatory neutrophil subsets and elucidated their regulation. This study further established their involvement in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. This understanding may further pave the way toward targeting specific neutrophil subsets in pathologies characterized by neutrophilic inflammation. Graphical Abstract Highlights CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophil subset identified with <1% presence in BM and >40% frequency in the liver. These neutrophils are mature and activated, demonstrating enhanced effector functions. Sca1pos neutrophils promote T cell proliferation and display pro-inflammatory characteristics. Conventional Sca1neg neutrophils transition into Sca1pos neutrophils in response to inflammatory signals, while progenitors undergo differentiation. Both acute and chronic inflammatory models show the expansion of CD11b+Ly6G+Sca1+ neutrophils.">

        <tr id="Introduction Patients with chronic HBV infection (CHI) exhibit defective anti-viral immune-response whose underlying causes still remain unclear. Monocytes act as immune sentinels for pathogens and can regulate immunity via interaction with other immune-cells, apart from differentiating into macrophages. Immune-checkpoint molecules (ICMs) expressed by immune-cells, including monocytes are known to negatively regulate immune-responses. Here, we evaluated the expression of ICMs, namely, Gal-9, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 on monocytes in different phases of CHI, identified the viral and the host factors causing their aberrant expression and investigated their impact during interaction of monocytes with T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells and also on monocyte to macrophage differentiation. Influence of Tenofovir therapy on the expression of monocytic ICMs was also studied. Methods Collection of blood and liver-tissue samples from HBV infected patients and controls, flow-cytometry, cell sorting, cell culture and immune-fluorescence were performed for this study. Results Gal-9+ and PD-L1+-monocytes were significantly increased in HBeAg-positive as well as HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients than healthy controls (HC). In immune-tolerant (IT) subjects, only Gal-9+-monocytes and in inactive carriers (IC), PD-L1+-monocytes were higher than HC while CTLA-4+-monocytes remained comparable among groups. High serum Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) concentration in CHB as well as IT and TNF-α in CHB triggered monocytic Gal-9-expression whereas, PD-L1 was induced by elevated TNF-α and IL-4 in CHB and IL-1β in CHB and IC. Purified monocytes from CHB and IT having high Gal-9 expression led to expansion of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+-Tregs, CD19+IL-10+-Bregs and CD19+CD27-CD21–atypical memory B-cells and these monocytes also preferentially differentiated into M2-macrophages. These phenomena were reversed by anti-Gal-9-antibody. Parallelly, PD-L1+-monocytes in CHB and IC reduced IL-2/IFN-γ and IL-6 production by HBV-specific T- and B-cells respectively, which were restored by anti-PD-L1-antibody. Both Gal-9+- and PD-L1+-monocytes caused decline in IFN-γ+-NK-cells but enhanced IL-10-expressing HBV-specific-T-cells and NK-cells. Increased intrahepatic CD14+Gal-9+ and CD14+PD-L1+-monocytes were noted in CHB patients than HC. One-year tenofovir therapy failed to reduce monocytic Gal-9 and PD-L1 along with the levels of HBsAg, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-4. Conclusions Monocytic Gal-9 and PD-L1, expressed heterogeneously in different phases of CHI, exert diverse inhibitory effects on immune-responses and their therapeutic targeting could boost anti-HBV immunity.">

        <tr id="Development of novel therapeutic strategies that reactivate latent HIV and sensitize reactivated cells to apoptosis is crucial towards elimination of the latent viral reservoir. Among the clinically relevant latency reversing agents (LRA) under investigation, the γc-cytokine IL-15 and the superagonist N-803 have been shown to reactivate latent HIV ex vivo and in vivo. However, their clinical benefit can be hindered by IL-15 promoting survival of infected cells. We previously identified a small molecule, HODHBt, that sensitizes latently infected cells to death upon reactivation with γc-cytokines through a STAT-dependent pathway. In here, we aimed to identify and evaluate FDA-approved compounds that could also sensitize HIV-infected cells to apoptosis. Using the Connectivity Map (CMap), we identified the retinol derivative 13-cis-retinoic acid (Isotretinoin) causes similar transcriptional changes as HODHBt. Isotretinoin enhances IL-15-mediated latency reversal without inducing proliferation of memory CD4 T cells. Ex vivo analysis of PBMCs from ACTG A5325, where Isotretinoin was administered to ART-suppressed people with HIV, showed that Isotretinoin treatment enhances IL-15-mediated latency reversal. Furthermore, we showed that a combination of IL-15 with Isotretinoin promotes the reduction of translation-competent reservoirs ex vivo. Mechanistically, combination of IL-15 and Isotretinoin increases caspase-3 activation specifically in HIV-infected cells but not uninfected cells. Our results suggest that Isotretinoin can be a novel approach to target and eliminate translation-competent HIV reservoirs.">

They are crucial in the host-response to invading pathogens, especially during acute illness, and are associated with poor prognosis in many infectious diseases. However, their gene expression profile and contribution to disease outcomes are not well described. We conducted a meta-analysis of gene expression datasets from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), focusing on patients with viral and bacterial infections. We identified a consensus set of 2,798 differentially expressed genes. Among these, 49 genes were commonly found in both the neutrophil degranulation pathway and the granule lumen-specific community. To validate this signature, we evaluated its expression in RNA-seq datasets, finding consistent upregulation of 24 genes in severe infections, 17 of them overlapped with genes overexpressed in CD16int cells. We also investigated the abundance of LDN-related proteins in a PBMC proteomics dataset from a cohort of sepsis and septic shock patients, identifying 13 proteins with significantly higher levels in sepsis and septic shock patients compared to healthy controls. In conclusion, our study identified a pattern of 17 upregulated LDN genes, common to PBMC-transcriptome and RNA-seq, and up-regulated in CD16int, associated with acute infections and severe clinical outcomes, marking the first time these genes have been collectively presented as a potential signature of LDNs in relation to disease severity. Further research with prospective cohorts is needed to validate this LDN signature and explore its clinical implications.

        <tr id="Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment, with oncolytic adenoviruses showing power as immunotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the immunotherapeutic potential of an adenovirus construct expressing CXCL9, CXCL10, or IL-15 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumor models. Our results demonstrated robust cytokine secretion upon viral treatment, suggesting effective transgene expression. Subsequent analysis using resistance-based transwell migration and microfluidic chip assays demonstrated increased T-cell migration in response to chemokine secretion by infected cells in both 2D and 3D cell models. Flow cytometry analysis revealed CXCR3 receptor expression across T-cell subsets, with the highest percentage found on CD8+ T-cells, underscoring their key role in immune cell migration. Alongside T-cells, we also detected NK-cells in the tumors of immunocompromised mice treated with cytokine-encoding adenoviruses. Furthermore, we identified potential immunogenic antigens that may enhance the efficacy and specificity of our armed oncolytic adenoviruses in ccRCC. Overall, our findings using ccRCC cell line, in vivo humanized mice, physiologically relevant PDCs in 2D and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) in 3D suggest that chemokine-armed adenoviruses hold promise for enhancing T-cell migration and improving immunotherapy outcomes in ccRCC. Our study contributes to the development of more effective ccRCC treatment strategies by elucidating immune cell infiltration and activation mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and highlights the usefulness of PDOs for predicting clinical relevance and validating novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Overall, our research offers insights into the rational design and optimization of viral-based immunotherapies for ccRCC.">

        <tr id="Microglia, the brain’s resident macrophages, can be reconstituted by surrogate cells - a process termed “microglia replacement.” To expand the microglia replacement toolkit, we here introduce estrogen-regulated (ER) homeobox B8 (Hoxb8) conditionally immortalized macrophages, a cell model for generation of immune cells from murine bone marrow, as a versatile model for microglia replacement. We find that ER-Hoxb8 macrophages are highly comparable to primary bone marrow-derived (BMD) macrophages in vitro, and, when transplanted into a microglia-free brain, engraft the parenchyma and differentiate into microglia-like cells. Furthermore, ER-Hoxb8 progenitors are readily transducible by virus and easily stored as stable, genetically manipulated cell lines. As a demonstration of this system’s power for studying the effects of disease mutations on microglia in vivo, we created stable, Adar1-mutated ER-Hoxb8 lines using CRISPR-Cas9 to study the intrinsic contribution of macrophages to Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS), an inherited interferonopathy that primarily affects the brain and immune system. We find that Adar1 knockout elicited interferon secretion and impaired macrophage production in vitro, while preventing brain macrophage engraftment in vivo - phenotypes that can be rescued with concurrent mutation of Ifih1 (MDA5) in vitro, but not in vivo. Lastly, we extended these findings by generating ER-Hoxb8 progenitors from mice harboring a patient-specific Adar1 mutation (D1113H). We demonstrated the ability of microglia-specific D1113H mutation to drive interferon production in vivo, suggesting microglia drive AGS neuropathology. In sum, we introduce the ER-Hoxb8 approach to model microglia replacement and use it to clarify macrophage contributions to AGS.">

        <tr id="In the previous studies, anti-TGF-β/PD-L1 bispecific antibody YM101 is demonstrated, with superior efficacy to anti-PD-L1 monotherapy in multiple tumor models. However, YM101 therapy can not achieve complete regression in most tumor-bearing mice, suggesting the presence of other immunosuppressive elements in the tumor microenvironment (TME) beyond TGF-β and PD-L1. Thoroughly exploring the TME is imperative to pave the way for the successful translation of anti-TGF-β/PD-L1 BsAb into clinical practice. In this work, scRNA-seq is employed to comprehensively profile the TME changes induced by YM101. The scRNA-seq analysis reveals an increase in immune cell populations associated with antitumor immunity and enhances cell-killing pathways. However, the analysis also uncovers the presence of immunosuppressive CCR5+ T cells in the TME after YM101 treatment. To overcome this hurdle, YM101 is combined with Maraviroc, a widely used CCR5 antagonist for treating HIV infection, suppressing CCR5+ T cell accumulation, and optimizing the immune response. Mechanistically, YM101-induced neutrophil activation recruits immunosuppressive CCR5+ T cells via CCR5 ligand secretion, creating a feedback loop that diminishes the antitumor response. Maraviroc then cleared these infiltrating cells and offset YM101-mediated immunosuppressive effects, further unleashing the antitumor immunity. These findings suggest selectively targeting CCR5 signaling with Maraviroc represents a promising and strategic approach to enhance YM101 efficacy.">

However, its role in developmental and steady-state myelopoiesis outside the lung is largely unexplored.

GM-CSF producing ILC2s foster the development of a hitherto undescribed phagocyte subset, which we named adenophages. Detailed analysis focusing on phenotypic and transcriptional profiling revealed that adenophages display shared aspects of both, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). We found them to be homogenously distributed across the SG, but always in close proximity to GM-CSF producing ILC2s and myoepithelial cells. Importantly, adenophages were present throughout all analyzed exocrine glands such as lacrimal glands and mammary glands, and were also identified in human SG sections, indicating a conserved role in exocrine glands across species.">

        <tr id="Harnessing the immunogenic potential of senescent tumor cells provides an opportunity to remodel tumor microenvironment (TME) and boost antitumor immunity. However, this potential needs to be sophisticatedly wielded to avoid additional immunosuppressive capacity of senescent cells. Our study shows that blocking the JAK2/STAT3 pathway enhances immunogenic efficacy of Aurora kinase inhibitor alisertib (Ali)–induced senescence by reducing immunosuppressive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) while preserving immunogenic SASP. Hypothesizing that SASP reprogramming with Ali and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Rux) will benefit cancer immunotherapy, we create nanoparticulate crystals (Ali-Rux) composed of Ali and Rux with a fully active pharmaceutical ingredient. Immunization with Ali-Rux–orchestrated senescent cells promotes stronger activation of antigen-presenting cells, enhancing antitumor immune surveillance. This approach remodels the TME by increasing CD8+ T cell and NK recruitment and activation while decreasing MDSCs. Combined with PD-L1 blockade, Ali-Rux elicits a durable antitumor immune response, suggesting the TME reshaping approach as a potential cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Pregnancy is associated with profound changes in immunity. However, pregnancy-related respiratory immune adaptations in response to influenza infection and their impact on disease severity remain unclear. Here, we describe, in a preclinical model of mid-gestation pregnancy, a mechanism of enhanced host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) localized to the nasal cavity that limits viral replication and reduces the magnitude of intrapulmonary immune responses. Consequently, the pregnant mice show reduced pulmonary pathology and preserved airway function after IAV infection. The early restriction of viral replication is independent of type I interferon (IFN) but dependent on increased antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) driven by interleukin-17+ (IL-17+) γδ+ T cells within the nasal passages. This pathway of host defense against IAV infection in the upper airways during pregnancy restricts early viral infection and prevents virus dissemination into the lung supporting maternal fitness.">

        <tr id="Abstract Mounting evidence indicates the involvement of peripheral immunity in the regulation of brain function, influencing aspects such as neuronal development, emotion, and cognitive abilities. Previous studies from our laboratory have revealed that neonatal hepatitis B vaccination can downregulate hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and spatial learning memory. In the current post-epidemic era characterized by universal vaccination, understanding the impact of acquired immunity on neuronal function and neuropsychiatric disorders, along with exploring potential underlying mechanisms, becomes imperative. We employed hepatitis B vaccine-induced CD3 positive T cells in immunodeficient mice to investigate the key mechanisms through which T cell subsets modulate hippocampal neurogenesis and anxiety-like behaviours. Our data revealed that mice receiving hepatitis B vaccine-induced T cells exhibited heightened anxiety and decreased hippocampal cell proliferation compared to those receiving phosphate-buffered saline-T cells or wild-type mice. Importantly, these changes were predominantly mediated by infiltrated CD8+ T cells into the brain, rather than CD4+ T cells. Transcriptome profiling of CD8+ T cells unveiled that C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 positive (CXCR6+) CD8+ T cells were recruited into the brain through microglial and astrocyte-derived C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16 (CXCL16). This recruitment process impaired neurogenesis and induced anxiety-like behaviour via tumour necrosis factor-α-dependent mechanisms. Our findings highlight the role of glial cell derived CXCL16 in mediating the recruitment of CXCR6+CD8+ T cell subsets into the brain. This mechanism represents a potential avenue for modulating hippocampal neurogenesis and emotion-related behaviours after hepatitis B vaccination.">

        <tr id="Tumor immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach in cancer treatment in recent years, offering vast potential. This method primarily involves targeting and inhibiting the suppressive checkpoints present in different immune cells to enhance their activation, ultimately leading to tumor regression. However, tumor cells exploit the surrounding immune cells and tissues to establish a tumor microenvironment (TME) that supports their survival and growth. Within the TME, the efficacy of effector immune cells is compromised, as tumor cells exploit inhibitory immune cells to suppress their function. Furthermore, certain immune cells can be co-opted by tumor cells to facilitate tumor growth. While significantly enhancing the body’s tumor immunity can lead to tumor regression, it can also result in severe toxic side effects and an inflammatory factor storm. As a consequence, patients often discontinue treatment due to immune-related adverse events (irAEs) or, in extreme cases, succumb to toxic side effects before experiencing tumor regression. In this analysis, we examined several remission regimens for irAEs, each with its own drawbacks, including toxic side effects or suppression of tumor immunotherapy, which is undesirable. A recent research study, specifically aimed at downregulating intestinal epithelial barrier permeability, has shown promising results in reducing the severity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) while preserving immune function. This approach effectively reduces the severity of IBD without compromising the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ, which are crucial for maintaining the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. Based on the substantial similarities between IBD and ICI colitis (combo immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced colitis), this review proposes that targeting epithelial cells represents a crucial research direction for mitigating irAEs in the future.">

In this review, we will discuss various ICs in the context of GBM, their interplay with the tumor immune microenvironment, relevant pre-clinical and clinical studies, and the impact of current treatment modalities on GBM IC blockade therapy. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive ICs, and how they contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is critical in advancing IC inhibition therapy in GBM.

        <tr id="Aims/hypothesis Surviving beta cells in type 1 diabetes respond to inflammation by upregulating programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) to engage immune cell programmed death-1 (PD-1) and limit destruction by self-reactive immune cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo can serve as biomarkers of beta cell health and contribute to islet intercellular communication. We hypothesized that the inflammatory milieu of type 1 diabetes increases PD-L1 in beta cell EV cargo and that EV PD-L1 may protect beta cells against immune-mediated cell death. Methods Beta cell lines and human islets were treated with proinflammatory cytokines to model the proinflammatory type 1 diabetes microenvironment. EVs were isolated using ultracentrifugation or size exclusion chromatography and analysed via immunoblot, flow cytometry, and ELISA. EV PD-L1: PD-1 binding was assessed using a competitive binding assay and in vitro functional assays testing the ability of EV PD-L1 to inhibit NOD CD8 T cells. Plasma EV and soluble PD-L1 were assayed in plasma of individuals with islet autoantibody positivity (Ab+) or recent-onset type 1 diabetes and compared to non-diabetic controls. Results PD-L1 protein colocalized with tetraspanin-associated proteins intracellularly and was detected on the surface of beta cell EVs. 24-h IFN-α or IFN-□ treatment induced a two-fold increase in EV PD-L1 cargo without a corresponding increase in number of EVs. IFN exposure predominantly increased PD-L1 expression on the surface of beta cell EVs and beta cell EV PD-L1 showed a dose-dependent capacity to bind PD-1. Functional experiments demonstrated specific effects of beta cell EV PD-L1 to suppress proliferation and cytotoxicity of murine CD8 T cells. Plasma EV PD-L1 levels were increased in islet Ab+ individuals, particularly in those with single Ab+, Additionally, in from individuals with either Ab+ or type 1 diabetes, but not in controls, plasma EV PD-L1 positively correlated with circulating C-peptide, suggesting that higher EV-PD-L1 could be protective for residual beta cell function. Conclusions/interpretation IFN exposure increases PD-L1 on the beta cell EV surface. Beta cell EV PD-L1 binds PD1 and inhibits CD8 T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Circulating EV PD-L1 is higher in islet autoantibody positive patients compared to controls. Circulating EV PD-L1 levels correlate with residual C-peptide at different stages in type 1 diabetes progression. These findings suggest that EV PD-L1 could contribute to heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes progression and residual beta cell function and raise the possibility that EV PD-L1 could be exploited as a means to inhibit immune-mediated beta cell death. Research in context What is already known about this subject? (maximum of 3 bullet points) Extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve as paracrine effectors in the islet microenvironment in health and disease. Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and IFN-gamma (IFN-□) are key cytokines contributing to type 1 diabetes pathophysiology and islet IFN signalling increases beta cell programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Up-regulation of beta cell PD-L1 in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model delays progression of type 1 diabetes. What is the key question? (one bullet point only; formatted as a question) Do beta cells exposed to IFNs upregulate EV PD-L1 and can these changes be detected in circulation? What are the new findings? (maximum of 3 bullet points) IFN-α or IFN-□ exposure increases beta cell EV PD-L1 cargo in beta cell lines and human islets. PD-L1 is present on the surface of beta cell EVs, binds PD-1 and EV PD-L1 inhibits proliferation, activation and cytotoxicity of murine CD8 T cells. EV PD-L1 levels are higher in islet autoantibody positive individuals compared to nondiabetic controls and levels of circulating EV PD-L1 positively correlate with residual beta cell function in islet autoantibody positive individuals as well as in individuals with recent-onset type 1 diabetes.

        <tr id="Background Broad T cell phenotypic alterations and potential dysfunctions were prominent in COVID-19. There are few and inconclusive data about the role of immune checkpoints for T cell exhaustion/activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Methods We tested T cell subsets and immune checkpoints in 177 MM patients with COVID-19, as well as in 32 healthy infected controls and 42 uninfected MM patients. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulation and immune checkpoints (PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4, OX40, and 4-1BB) were evaluated by flow cytometry. Results We have found that pronounced lymphopenia and inverted CD4/CD8 ratio in severe COVID-19 patients were especially developed within the first month after infection. And T cell subset dysregulation was persistent in severe patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immune checkpoints on CD4+ T cells were variable and uncorrelated with the level of adaptive immunity, while the proportion of CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with humoral immune response. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells were significantly elevated in severe patients and sustained for more than 2 months, which was associated with impaired cellular immune function. Moreover, exhausted molecules PD-1 and TIGIT on T cells were reduced in immunotherapy patients. Conclusion The prolonged T cell dysregulation after severe SARS-CoV-2 infection highlights the close surveillance from reinfection in MM patients even during convalescence. PD-1 and TIGIT on CD8+ T cells could be important prognostic factors to stratify prognosis in MM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, immunotherapy may downregulate the expression of exhausted checkpoints PD-1 and TIGIT, leading to T cell overactivation and severe COVID-19.">

        <tr id="COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, triggers a complex immune response, with T regulatory cells (Tregs) playing a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation. The current study investigates the function of T regulatory cells during COVID-19 infection and the subsequent recovery period, emphasizing their impact on immune regulation and inflammation control. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of Treg subpopulations in peripheral blood samples from COVID-19 patients at different stages: acute infection, early convalescence, and long-term recovery. Flow cytometry was employed to quantify Tregs including “naïve”, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector cells (TEMRA). Additionally, the functional state of the Tregs was assessed by the expression of purinergic signaling molecules (CD39, CD73). Cytokine profiles were assessed through multiplex analysis. Our findings indicate a significant decrease in the number of Tregs during the acute phase of COVID-19, which correlates with heightened inflammatory markers and increased disease severity. Specifically, we found a decrease in the relative numbers of “naïve” and an increase in EM Tregs, as well as a decrease in the absolute numbers of “naïve” and CM Tregs. During the early convalescent period, the absolute counts of all Treg populations tended to increase, accompanied by a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Despite this, one year after recovery, the decreased subpopulations of regulatory T cells had not yet reached the levels observed in healthy donors. Finally, we observed the re-establishment of CD39 expression in all Treg subsets; however, there was no change in CD73 expression among Tregs. Understanding these immunological changes across different T regulatory subsets and adenosine signaling pathways offers important insights into the disease’s pathogenesis and provides a broader view of immune system dynamics during recovery.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Cervical cancer remains a global health challenge. The identification of new immunotherapeutic targets may provide a promising platform for advancing cervical cancer treatment. Objective This study aims to investigate the role of CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) in cervical cancer progression and evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target. Methods We performed comprehensive analyses using patient cohorts and preclinical models to examine the association between CDCP1 expression and cervical cancer prognosis. Then in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse models, we further investigated the impact of CDCP1 on the tumor immune microenvironment, focusing on its effects on tumor-infiltrating T cells, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Mechanistic studies were performed to elucidate the pathways involved in CDCP1-mediated immune modulation, in particular its interaction with the T cell receptor CD6 and the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Results Our results show that CDCP1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and T cell infliction in cervical cancer. Specifically, it affects the activity of CTLs and Tregs. Mechanistically, CDCP1 binds to CD6 and inhibits the JAK-STAT pathway of T cells. The study further demonstrates that targeting CDCP1 with the inhibitor 8-prenylnaringenin (8PN) effectively suppresses tumor growth in vivo and enhances antitumor immunity. Conclusions CDCP1 plays a critical role in cervical cancer progression by modulating the tumor immune microenvironment. Targeting CDCP1 offers a promising therapeutic strategy to improve the outcome of patients with cervical cancer.">

        <tr id="Background: Gastrointestinal mucosal damage due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection leads to microbial translocation and immune activation, contributing to the development of non-infectious comorbidities (NICM) in people living with HIV (PLWH). Additionally, persistent proviral HIV-1 in the gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) can trigger immunological changes in the epithelial environment, impacting the mucosal barrier. However, the role of zonulin, a modulator of epithelial tight junctions in GALT during HIV infection, remains poorly understood. Methods: We measured zonulin in serum and intestinal tissue sections from five treatment-naive (HIV+NAIVE) and 10 cART-treated (HIV+cART) HIV+ individuals, along with 11 controls (CTRL). We compared zonulin levels with clinical characteristics, inflammatory markers (IFN-α, CXCR3, and PD-1), and the viral reservoir in peripheral blood (PB) and terminal ileum (TI). Results: Upon HIV infection, TI was found to harbor more HIV DNA than PB. Circulating zonulin levels were highest in HIV+NAIVE compared to HIV+cART or CTRL. Surprisingly, in the gut tissue sections, zonulin levels were higher in CTRL than in HIV+ individuals. Elevated circulating zonulin levels were found to be correlated with CD4+T-cell depletion in PB and TI, and with intestinal IFN-α. Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate a shift in zonulin levels from the gut to the bloodstream in response to HIV infection. Furthermore, elevated systemic zonulin levels are associated with the depletion of intestinal CD4+ T cells and increased gut inflammation, suggesting a potential link between systemic zonulin and intestinal damage. Gaining insight into the regulation of gut tight junctions during HIV infection could offer valuable understanding for preventing NICM in PLWH.">

        <tr id="Severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during early life has been linked to gut dysbiosis, which correlates with increased disease severity and a higher risk of developing asthma later in life. However, the impact of such early-life RSV infections on intestinal immunity in adulthood remains unclear. Herein, we show that RSV infection in 3-week-old mice induced persistent differential natural killer (NK) and T cell profiles within the lungs and gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoid tissues (GALT) in adulthood. Notably, male mice exhibited more pronounced RSV-induced changes in immune cell populations in both the lungs and GALT, while female mice displayed greater resilience. Importantly, early-life RSV infection was associated with the chronic downregulation of CD69-expressing T lymphocytes, particularly T regulatory cells in Peyer’s patches, which could have a significant impact on T cell functionality and immune tolerance. We propose that RSV infection in early life is a trigger for the breakdown in immune tolerance at mucosal surfaces, with potential implications for airways allergic disease, food allergies, and other GI inflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, iron toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) are widely held to drive tissue damage, yet the specific roles of central nervous system (CNS)- resident versus CNS-invading MPs remain unclear. Here, by combining single-cell profiling with conditional gene targeting, we systematically dissected and interfered with ROS production across CNS MPs in a preclinical model for neuroinflammation. We show that CNS-invading monocyte derived cells (MdCs) exhibit a higher oxidative stress gene signature and produce more ROS compared to CNS-resident microglia. While NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), a phagocytic source of ROS, proved redundant, our findings underscore the critical role of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) in driving oxidative tissue damage. Quenching mtROS through mitocatalase overexpression in MdCs, but not microglia, significantly alleviated neuroinflammation in mice. Thus, our study resolves a longstanding controversy, identifying MdCs as the primary driver of ROS-mediated neuropathology.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary Gliomas are diverse types of tumors originating from glial cells. Among these tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form and has a poor prognosis and high mortality rate, with treatment success largely influenced by patient age, tumor location, and genetic mutations. Glioma cells can reprogram their tumor microenvironment (TME) to support tumor proliferation and survival, interacting with other cells through cytokines and growth factors. The TME of gliomas is highly heterogeneous, complex, and often immunosuppressive, interfering with treatment strategies. Current therapeutic strategies focus on modulating immune cell activities and enhancing anti-tumor responses. T-cell-based immunotherapies are being explored to target glioma cells. These include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy, which involve engineering T cells to recognize tumor antigens. However, these therapies face multiple challenges including tumor heterogeneity, immunosuppression by T cell exhaustion, and altered antigen presentation, etc. Future research should focus on boosting T cell functions, targeting immune checkpoints, and developing more effective delivery methods to improve treatment outcomes for glioma patients. Abstract Glioma is known for its immunosuppressive microenvironment, which makes it challenging to target through immunotherapies. Immune cells like macrophages, microglia, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and T lymphocytes are known to infiltrate the glioma tumor microenvironment and regulate immune response distinctively. Among the variety of immune cells, T lymphocytes have highly complex and multifaceted roles in the glioma immune landscape. T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, are known for their pivotal roles in anti-tumor responses. However, these cells may behave differently in the highly dynamic glioma microenvironment, for example, via an immune invasion mechanism enforced by tumor cells. Therefore, T lymphocytes play dual roles in glioma immunity, firstly by their anti-tumor responses, and secondly by exploiting gliomas to promote immune invasion. As an immunosuppression strategy, glioma induces T-cell exhaustion and suppression of effector T cells by regulatory T cells (Tregs) or by altering their signaling pathways. Further, the expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors on the glioma cell surface leads to T cell anergy and dysfunction. Overall, this dynamic interplay between T lymphocytes and glioma is crucial for designing more effective immunotherapies. The current review provides detailed knowledge on the roles of T lymphocytes in the glioma immune microenvironment and helps to explore novel therapeutic approaches to reinvigorate T lymphocytes.">

TME induces T cell exhaustion through long-term antigen stimulation, upregulation of immune checkpoints, recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. CD8+ Tex may be both the reflection of cancer progression and the reason for poor cancer control. The successful outcome of the current cancer immunotherapies, which include immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell treatment, depends on CD8+ Tex.

        <tr id="Adaptive anti-tumor immunity is currently dependent on the natural immune system of the body. The emergence of tumor immunotherapy has improved prognosis and prolonged the survival cycle of patients. Current mainstream immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockade, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy, and monoclonal antibody therapy, are linked to natural immunity. The cGAS-STING pathway is an important natural immunity signaling pathway that plays an important role in fighting against the invasion of foreign pathogens and maintaining the homeostasis of the organism. Increasing evidence suggests that the cGAS-STING pathway plays a key role in tumor immunity, and the combination of STING-related agonists can significantly enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and reduce the emergence of immunotherapeutic resistance. However, the cGAS-STING pathway is a double-edged sword, and its activation can enhance anti-tumor immunity and immunosuppression. Immunosuppressive cells, including M2 macrophages, MDSC, and regulatory T cells, in the tumor microenvironment play a crucial role in tumor escape, thereby affecting the immunotherapy effect. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway can bi-directionally regulate this group of immunosuppressive cells, and targeting this pathway can affect the function of immunosuppressive cells, providing new ideas for immunotherapy. In this study, we summarize the activation pathway of the cGAS-STING pathway and its immunological function and elaborate on the key role of this pathway in immune escape mediated by the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment.

        <tr id="The precise conditions by which cytokines drive cancer is relevant to improving immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) responses while decreasing toxicity. In this issue of the JCI, Kao et al. investigated T helper cell pathways in patients with solid tumors receiving ICI. The authors evaluated T cell populations, cytokine signatures, immune related adverse events (irAEs), and survival outcomes. Patients with a history of autoimmune disorders were more likely to develop irAEs. Notably, blood samples from patients on treatment showed that elevations in IL-5, IL-6, IL-17f, and TNF-α were associated with an increased risk for grade 2 or higher irAEs. Moreover, IL-6 was associated with decreased objective response rate and worse cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. These findings may help guide decisions for optimizing ICI efficacy while minimizing toxicity and suggest that IL-6 blockade may improve response and decrease toxicity in solid tumors.">

Here, we show that mature IL-18 is generated in the thymus following numerous distinct forms of tissue damage, all of which cause caspase-1-mediated immunogenic cell death. We report that IL-18 stimulated cytotoxic NK cells limit endogenous thymic regeneration, a critical process that ensures restoration of immune competence after acute insults like stress, infection, chemotherapy, and radiation. NK cells suppressed thymus recovery by aberrantly targeting thymic epithelial cells (TECs), which act as the master regulators of organ function and regeneration. Together these studies reveal a novel pathway regulating tissue regeneration in the thymus and offer IL-18 as a potential therapeutic target to boost thymic function. Moreover, given the enthusiasm for IL-18 as a cancer immunotherapy for its capacity to elicit a type-1 immune response, these findings also offer insight into potential off-target effects.">

However, the molecular connections between mechanobiological inputs and outputs and the designated immune activities remain largely unclear. Here, we show that partial inhibition of non-muscle myosin II (NM II) augmented the traction force exerted by T cells and potentiated T cell cytotoxicity against tumors. By using T cells from mice and patients with cancer, we found that NM II is required for the activity of NKX3-2 in maintaining the expression of ADGRB3, which shapes the filamentous actin (F-actin) organization and ultimately attributes to the reduced traction force of T cells in the tumor microenvironment. In animal models, suppressing the NM II–NKX3-2–ADGRB3 pathway in T cells effectively suppressed tumor growth and improved the efficacy of the checkpoint-specific immunotherapy. Overall, this work provides insights into the biomechanical regulation of T cell cytotoxicity that can be exploited to optimize clinical immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Clinical trial data underscores the need to improve oncolytic virus (OV) distribution within tumors, a challenge compounded by the lack of predictive biomarkers and limited opportunities for post-treatment analysis. To decipher the factors influencing treatment outcomes, we employed multimodal bioluminescence imaging (MM-BLI) in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor OV infection, replication, and tumor viability in orthotopic brain glioma mouse models. This approach revealed two distinct therapeutic responses: “Responders” with tumor regression and “Non-Responders” with tumor progression. In-depth analysis of individual brains from both groups uncovered dynamic interactions between the OV and the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the involvement of Iba-1+ microglia and tumor necrosis in hindering OV distribution within the tumor. To address this, we incorporated a CSF-1 receptor inhibitor (PLX3397), which improved tumor control by enhancing OV’s direct cytopathic effects and reducing microglial interference. Our findings highlight microglia as a significant barrier to effective OV therapy, suggesting that targeting brain-resident immune cells could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of OVs in resistant brain tumors.">

        <tr id="Macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quality by assessing cell surface Calreticulin (Calr), an “eat-me” signal induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using zebrafish genetics, we identified Beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) as a crucial “don’t eat-me” signal on blood stem cells. A chemical screen revealed inducers of surface Calr that promoted HSC proliferation without triggering ROS or macrophage clearance. Whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening showed that Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) signaling regulated b2m expression. Targeting b2m or tlr3 reduced the HSC clonality. Elevated B2m levels correlated with high expression of repetitive element (RE) transcripts. Overall, our data suggest that RE-associated double-stranded RNA could interact with TLR3 to stimulate surface expression of B2m on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. These findings suggest that the balance of Calr and B2m regulates macrophage-HSC interactions and defines hematopoietic clonality. Editor’s summary During embryonic development, macrophages interact with blood stem cells, removing those exhibiting high levels of cellular stress. The surviving hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can proliferate and give rise to blood cell linages in adults. Pessoa Rodrigues et al. used zebrafish models and mammalian systems to investigate signals within HSPCs that could prevent macrophages from engulfing them. Molecules associated with innate immune nucleic acid sensing promoted the expression of Beta-2-microglobulin on the surface of HSPCs to increase their survival when they interacted with macrophages. Impairing this pathway decreased the number of distinct stem cell clones in adult zebrafish. —Sarah H. Ross  INTRODUCTION Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) produce mature blood cells throughout life. During this process, HSPCs engage in interactions with the variety of cells present in the marrow niche, including macrophages. These macrophages mediate a myriad of processes by releasing cytokines and chemokines and patrolling to remove stressed, dead, or aging cells. In this manner, macrophages contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During hematopoiesis, macrophages ensure the quality of normal blood stem cells and determine the number of hematopoietic clones that participate in adult hematopoiesis. They then either engulf a stem cell completely, referred to as “dooming,” or capture portions of the stem cell’s cellular material, referred to as “grooming.” After grooming, the stem cell continues to divide, whereas the doomed HSPC clone is eliminated. RATIONALE Past work has shown that the HSPC-macrophage interaction is mediated by an “eat-me” signal, calreticulin (Calr), on the surface of HSPCs. Surface Calr levels are increased in stem cells with higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and this triggers macrophages to engulf and kill stem cells that have high amounts of stress-activated proteins. However, the specific molecular cues that regulate the dooming versus grooming behavior are still unknown. RESULTS To investigate the cues mediating grooming versus dooming, we screened a panel of 1200 bioactive small molecules in human cells and identified 93 compounds that robustly increased surface CALR in a dose-dependent manner. Of these compounds, 22 also facilitated interactions between macrophages and stem cells in zebrafish. Compounds that depended on ROS to increase CALR showed higher dooming ratios and, conversely, animals treated with ROS-independent compounds exhibited a higher probability of grooming events despite increased CALR and increased macrophage–stem cell interactions. To investigate the signals involved in interactions under ROS-independent conditions, we undertook a genome-wide screen in human cells. We identified Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as a CALR inducer in the “don’t eat me” context. Next, we found that TLR3 expression was required for the expression of the “don’t eat me” signal Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). Antibody staining and studies of a b2m knockout zebrafish line showed that b2m on stem cells was required for preventing the macrophage dooming. To determine whether the increased dooming observed in the b2m mutant affected clonal dominance, we generated mosaic deletions using the zebrabow color barcoding system (TWISTR) as a lineage tracer. Mosaic deletion of b2m reduced the number of myeloid clones but increased clonal dominance. The dominant clones in these fish were wild type for b2m that were resistant to dooming and overtook the adult marrow. TLR3 signaling is activated by double-stranded RNA, which can sometimes be found in cells due to the expression of transcripts associated with repetitive elements (REs), including long terminal repeats (LTRs) and endogenous retroviruses. RE expression in HSPCs positively correlated with elevated levels of B2m. Moreover, overexpressing ltr4 in zebrafish led to higher HSPC proliferation, indicative of decreased dooming. Impairing the TLR3-B2M pathway by disrupting the expression of TLR3, IRF3, or B2M expression decreased the number of blood cell clones in zebrafish. Using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor CM272 to promote up-regulation of REs amplified the proliferation of already established HSPC clones in zebrafish embryos. CONCLUSION Our findings support a model in which endogenous TLR3 ligands lead to expression of b2m, thereby providing a blockade against macrophage-induced dooming and determining hematopoietic stem cell clonality by monitoring stem cell quality with macrophages. The balance of Calr and B2m governs the number of long-lived HSC clones that contribute to the adult blood system through macrophage-mediated quality assurance. This sheds light on the intricate interplay between HSPC clonal expansion and immune-regulated cell clearance. We propose that this protective mechanism may also operate in adulthood in response to environmental stress, such as during infections or in clonal stem cell disorders. Manipulating the levels of “don’t eat-me” and “eat-me” signals may have important therapeutic implications for immune therapy by harnessing the macrophage-selective removal of a mutated stem cell clone. ROS and TLR3 signaling mediates the “eat-me” and “don’t eat me” signals that determine stem cell clonal selection by macrophages. Shown is a schematic overview of the proposed model showing the balance between the Calr-mediated “eat-me” and B2m-mediated “don’t eat-me” signals that influence macrophage behavior.">

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive, poorly immunogenic cancer and non-responsive to all currently available treatments, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. As survival rates remain low (13%), there is an urgent need for new therapeutic options. A hallmark of PDAC is the limited infiltration of anti-tumor cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data of PDAC tumors from treatment naïve patients reveals high expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) on tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. PSGL-1 is an intrinsic negative regulator of CD8+ T cells that promotes the development of functional exhaustion. We therefore hypothesized that PSGL-1-mediated immune suppression is a critical barrier to effective anti-tumor immunity in PDAC. To test this, we used preclinical models of orthotopic injection PDAC tumor cells into pancreata, recapitulating patient responses to PDAC with limited T cell infiltrates and uncontrolled tumor growth in C57BL/6 (wildtype) control mice and compared anti-tumor immune responses in PSGL-1KO (C57BL/6 background) mice. At 28 days post-injection of KPC.4662 PDAC tumor cells, tumor burden in PSGL-1KO mice was reduced by >50% compared to controls, with 45% of PSGL-1KO animals exhibiting >70% reduction. Total immune infiltration (CD45+) was 2-fold greater in tumors from PSGL-1KO mice, with significant increases in infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Detailed analyses revealed that infiltrating CD8+ T cells from PSGL-1KO mice were less terminally differentiated towards exhaustion. PSGL-1KO PD-1+ CD8+ T cells expressed less TOX expression and fewer cells co-expressed CD38 and CD101 while more expressed CX3CR1 compared to controls. Intratumoral PSGL-1KO CD8+ T cells also retained greater functionality as well as indicated by inflammatory cytokine production (IFNg, TNFa) and Granzyme B expression. Moreover, PSGL-1KO mice showed protection against metastatic disease to the lungs. We find that protection by PSGL-1KO mice is T cell dependent as transient depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells prior to tumor cell implantation results in the loss of PDAC tumor growth inhibition by PSGL-1KO mice. Less-differentiated, proliferation-competent precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX) are essential to PD-1 ICB responsiveness in patients and preclinical models. Given that PSGL-1-deficiency limits terminal differentiation of CD8+ T cells in PDAC, we hypothesized that PSGL-1-deficiency would promote responsiveness to PD-1 ICB, which is ineffective as a monotherapy in PDAC patients and mouse models. While therapeutic treatment with anti-PD-1 had no effect on the tumor growth in the control animals, PD-1 ICB resulted in tumor ablation in 85% of PSGL-1KO animals, demonstrating a profound synergistic effect of PD-1 inhibition in the absence of PSGL-1. From these studies, we conclude that PSGL- 1 is a critical inhibitor anti-tumor T cell immunity in PDAC and represents a novel ICB target with high translational potential for promoting immune responses to PDAC tumors.

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent form of liver cancer that poses significant challenges regarding morbidity and mortality rates. In the context of HCC, immune cells play a vital role, especially concerning the presentation of antigens. This review explores the intricate interactions among immune cells within HCC, focusing on their functions in antigen presentation and the modulation of T-cell responses. We begin by summarizing the strategies that HCC uses to escape immune recognition, emphasizing the delicate equilibrium between immune surveillance and evasion. Next, we investigate the specific functions of various types of immune cells, including dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and CD8+ T cells, in the process of antigen presentation. We also examine the impact of immune checkpoints, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and the pathways involving programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), on antigen presentation, while taking into account the clinical significance of checkpoint inhibitors. The review further emphasizes the importance of immune-based therapies, including cancer vaccines and CAR-T cell therapy, in improving antigen presentation. In conclusion, we encapsulate the latest advancements in research, propose future avenues for exploration, and stress the importance of innovative technologies and customized treatment strategies. By thoroughly analyzing the interactions of immune cells throughout the antigen presentation process in HCC, this review provides an up-to-date perspective on the field, setting the stage for new therapeutic approaches.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a malignancy with significant immunosuppressive properties and limited immune activation. This immunosuppression is linked to reduced cytotoxic T-cell activity, impaired antigen presentation, and elevated levels of immunosuppressive cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules. Studies demonstrate that cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration correlates with improved survival, while increased regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are associated with worse outcomes and therapeutic resistance. Th1 cells are beneficial, whereas Th17 cells, producing interleukin-17 (IL-17), contribute to tumor progression. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1/PD-L1 and TIM-3 are also linked to advanced stages of PCa. Chemotherapy holds promise in converting the "cold" tumor microenvironment (TME) to a "hot" one by depleting immunosuppressive cells and enhancing tumor immunogenicity.


SUMMARY
This comprehensive review examines the immune microenvironment in PCa, focusing on the intricate interactions between immune and tumor cells in the TME. It highlights how TAMs, Tregs, cytotoxic T cells, and other immune cell types contribute to tumor progression or suppression and how PCa's low immunogenicity complicates immunotherapy.


KEY MESSAGES
The infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and Th1 cells correlates with better outcomes, while elevated Tregs and TAMs promote tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance. TANs and NK cells exhibit dual roles, with higher NK cell levels linked to better prognoses. Immune checkpoint molecules like PD-1, PD-L1, and TIM-3 are associated with advanced disease. Chemotherapy can improve tumor immunogenicity by depleting Tregs and MDSCs, offering therapeutic promise.">

        <tr id="Bladder cancer remains a prevalent and challenging malignancy. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have emerged as key contributors to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, facilitating tumor progression, immune evasion, and resistance to therapies. This review explores the role of MDSC in bladder cancer, highlighting their involvement in immune regulation; tumor progression; and resistance to therapies such as bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) therapy, chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We also discuss their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets, with current evidence suggesting that targeting MDSCs, either alone or in combination with existing treatments such as BCG and ICIs, may enhance anti-tumor immunity and improve clinical outcomes. However,, challenges remain, particularly regarding the identification and therapeutic modulation of MDSC subpopulations. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate their role in bladder cancer and to optimize MDSC-targeted therapies.">

They have recently emerged as targets for restoring an effective antitumor response and limiting tumor growth. In the present study, we investigated the potential of IL-27 neutralization to modify macrophage polarization and thus the tumor immune microenvironment. We monitored the effect of IL-27 neutralization on human macrophages and in vivo in a murine colon adenocarcinoma model. In this study, we demonstrated the importance of IL-27 in the generation of human immunoregulatory macrophages. Mechanistically, IL-27 neutralization reduced the immunosuppressive properties of macrophages. These modifications led to a reduction in the ability of macrophages to inhibit the function of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of IL-27 reduced MC38 tumor growth. Collectively, we uncovered the role of IL-27 in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. IL-27 neutralization thus appears as a promising strategy to target macrophages in immunosuppressive TME and improve the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy protocols.">

 Glioblastoma (GBM) has a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), largely mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Here, we utilized a retroviral replicating vector (RRV) to deliver Interferon Regulatory Factor 8 (IRF8), a master regulator of type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) development, in a syngeneic murine GBM model. We hypothesized that RRV-mediated delivery of IRF8 could “reprogram” intratumoral MDSCs into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and thereby restore anti-tumor T-cell responses.



 Effects of RRV-IRF8 on survival and tumor growth kinetics were examined in the SB28 murine GBM model. Immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and gene expression assays. We assayed functional immunosuppression and antigen presentation by ex vivo T-cell-myeloid co-culture.



 Mice with RRV-IRF8 pre-transduced intracerebral tumors had significantly longer survival and slower tumor growth compared to controls. RRV-IRF8 treated tumors exhibited significant enrichment of cDC1s and CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, myeloid cells derived from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed decreased expression of the immunosuppressive markers Arg1 and IDO1 and demonstrated reduced suppression of naïve T-cell proliferation in ex vivo co-culture, compared to controls. Further, intra-tumoral and cervical lymph node DCs from RRV-IRF8 tumors showed increased antigen presentation compared to those from control tumors. To assess mechanism of action, mice were treated azidothymidine (AZT), a viral replication inhibitor. Untreated mice maintained a superior survival benefit, which demonstrated that viral replication through proliferating cells is necessary for tumor control. This showed that IRF8 transduction in both tumor and non-tumor cells is necessary for survival benefit, associated with a reprogrammed, cDC1- and CD8 T-cell-enriched TIME. Moreover, subset of mice with RRV-IRF8 treated tumors achieved complete tumor clearance and further rejected subcutaneous GBM tumors, indicating the presence of immunological memory.



 Our results indicate that reprogramming of glioma-infiltrating myeloid cells by in vivo expression of IRF8 may reduce immunosuppression and enhance antigen presentation in situ, achieving improved tumor control and conferring a significant survival benefit.

        <tr id="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are immunocompromised and highly vulnerable to serious recurrent infections. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are principal sensors of infection and are essential in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses to resolve infection. This study identified significant deficiencies in six functionally distinct DC subsets in blood of untreated CLL (UT-CLL) patients and selective normalization of pDCs in response to acalabrutinib (a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor) therapy. DCs are continuously replenished from hematopoiesis in bone marrow (BM). Four BM developmental intermediates that give rise to cDCs and pDCs were examined and significant reductions of these were identified in UT-CLL patients supporting a precursor/progeny relationship. The deficiencies in blood DCs and BM DC progenitors were significantly associated with alterations in the Flt3/FL signaling pathway critical to DC development and function. Regarding clinical parameter, cDC subset deficiencies are associated with adverse prognostic indicators of disease progression, including IGHV mutation, CD49d, CD38, and ZAP-70 status. Importantly, UT-CLL patients with shared DC subset deficiencies had shorter time-to-first treatment (TTFT), uncovering a profound alteration in innate immunity with the potential to instruct therapeutic decision-making.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary The tumor microenvironment (TME) refers to the area immediately surrounding a cancerous tumor that influences the tumor’s behavior and how the immune system reacts to it. Central to the TME environment are special immune cells—tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)—that, rather than restrict the tumor, actually facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, targeting these TAMs can help to eliminate cancer. In this article, we review the biology of TAMs and delve into the signaling mechanisms underlying the polarization of macrophage phenotypes, their plasticity, and therapeutic implications. Abstract Within the tumor microenvironment, myeloid cells constitute a dynamic immune population characterized by a heterogeneous phenotype and diverse functional activities. In this review, we consider recent literature shedding light on the increasingly complex biology of M2-like immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), including their contribution to tumor cell invasion and metastasis, stromal remodeling (fibrosis and matrix degradation), and immune suppressive functions, in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This review also delves into the intricate signaling mechanisms underlying the polarization of diverse macrophage phenotypes, and their plasticity. We also review the development of promising therapeutic approaches to target these populations in cancers. The expanding knowledge of distinct subsets of immunosuppressive TAMs, and their contributions to tumorigenesis and metastasis, has sparked significant interest among researchers regarding the therapeutic potential of TAM depletion or phenotypic modulation.">

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies, particularly PD-1 blockade and anti-CTLA-4 treatments, have changed the treatment landscape of virous cancers, showing great potential in the treatment of different cancer patients, but sensitivity to these therapies is limited to certain individuals. This review offers a comprehensive survey of the functions and therapeutic implications of the four principal RNA modifications, particularly highlighting the significance of m6A in the realms of immune cells in tumor and immunotherapy. This review starts by providing a foundational summary of the roles RNA modifications assume within the immune cell community, focusing on T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. We then discuss how RNA modifications influence the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing immune checkpoint expression, modulation of ICI efficacy, and prediction of ICI treatment outcomes, and review drug therapies targeting genes regulated by RNA modifications. Finally, we explore the role of RNA modifications in gene editing, cancer vaccines, and adoptive T cell therapies, offering valuable insights into the use of RNA modifications in cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Clever-1 functions as a scavenger and adhesion receptor, promoting tolerogenic activities in macrophages and subsets of endothelial cells, thereby contributing to cancer progression. High Clever-1 expression associates with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors and combined targeting of Clever-1 with anti-PD-1 enhances response in refractory mouse tumor models. A Clever-1–targeting humanized IgG4 antibody, bexmarilimab, is investigated in clinical trials as a macrophage-reprogramming therapy to treat solid tumors (NCT03733990) and hematological malignancies (NCT05428969). Here we describe a secreted form of (s)Clever-1 enriched in plasma of cancer patients, that was decreased upon bexmarilimab treatment. With the production of a recombinant sClever-1, mimicking the one found in human plasma, we show that sClever-1 can selectively bind activated T cells and disrupt T cell receptor signalling leading to impaired Th1 expansion. We demonstrate that sClever-1 binds to insulin growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) on T cells via its mannose-6-phosphate modification and further show that sClever-1 contributes to the immunosuppressive properties of macrophage-secreted extracellular vesicles, driving T cell tolerance and impairing anti-PD-1 efficacy. These findings suggest that Clever-1 exerts a systemic immunosuppressive effect independently of the cells it is expressed on, highlighting its potential as a target in cancer immunotherapy and a valuable biomarker for disease detection.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a critical role in resistance to immunotherapy. In this study, we identified epidermal growth factor-like 6 (Egfl6) as a regulator of myeloid cell functions. Our analyses indicated that Egfl6, via binding with β3 integrins and activation of p38 and SYK signaling, acts as a chemotactic factor for myeloid cell migration and promotes their differentiation toward an immunosuppressive state. In syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer (OvCa), tumor expression of Egfl6 increased the intratumoral accumulation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) MDSCs and TAMs and their expression of immunosuppressive factors, including CXCL2, IL-10, and PD-L1. Consistent with this, in an immune ‘hot’ tumor model, Egfl6 expression eliminated response to anti-PD-L1 therapy, while Egfl6 neutralizing antibody decreased the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD206+ TAMs and PMN-MDSCs and restored the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. Supporting a role in human tumors, in human OvCa tissue samples, areas of high EGFL6 expression colocalized with myeloid cell infiltration. scRNA-Seq analyses revealed a correlation between EGFL6 and immune cell expression of immunosuppressive factors. Our data provide mechanistic insights into the oncoimmunologic functions of EGFL6 in mediating tumor immune suppression and identified EGFL6 as a potential therapeutic target to enhance immunotherapy in patients with OvCa.">

        <tr id="Simple Summary CD59 prevents the formation of membrane attack complex, enabling tumor cells to escape complement-mediated cytotoxicity. It appears that the expression of CD59 significantly impacts survival outcomes due to its interaction with immune cells. The associations between CD59 and immune suppressive cells such as T-regulatory cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, and macrophage create an immune suppressive environment in cervical, brain, head and neck, and stomach cancers. However, kidney cancer has less or no association, leading to better survival outcomes. Thus, assessing the levels of CD59 and its immune cell associations is crucial as it plays a predictive role in deciding prognostic outcomes. Abstract Background: CD59, a GPI-anchored membrane protein, protects cancer cells from complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) by inhibiting the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). It has been demonstrated to be overexpressed in most solid tumors, where it facilitates tumor cell escape from complement surveillance. The role of CD59 in cancer growth and interactions between CD59 and immune cells that modulate immune evasion has not been well explored. Methods: Using cancer patient database from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other public databases, we analyzed CD59 expression, its prognostic significance, and its association with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, identifying associated genomic and functional networks and validating findings with invitro cell-line experimental data. Results: This article describes the abundant expression of CD59 in multiple tumors such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), as well as in pan-cancer, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and confirmed using multiple cancer cell lines. The expression of CD59 significantly alters the overall survival (OS) of patients with multiple malignancies such as CESC, GBM, HNSC, and STAD. Further, the correlation between CD59 and Treg and/or MDSC in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has shown to be strongly associated with poor outcomes in CESC, GBM, HNSC, and STAD as these tumors express high FOXP3 compared to KIRC. Moreover, unfavorable outcomes were strongly associated with the expression of CD59 and M2 tumor-associated macrophage infiltration in the TME via the IL10/pSTAT3 pathway in CESC and GBM but not in KIRC. In addition, TGFβ1-dominant cancers such as CESC, GBM, and HNSC showed a high correlation between CD59 and TGFβ1, leading to suppression of cytotoxic T cell activity. Conclusion: Overall, the correlation between CD59 and immune cells predicts its prognosis as unfavorable in CESC, GBM, HNSC, and STAD while being favorable in KIRC.">

        <tr id="ISG15, an IFN-stimulated gene, plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses during viral infections. Its upregulation is part of the host's defense mechanism against viruses, contributing to the antiviral state of cells. However, altered ISG15 expression can also lead to immune dysregulation and pathological outcomes, particularly during persistent viral infections. Understanding the balance of ISG15 in promoting antiviral immunity while avoiding immune-mediated pathology is essential for developing targeted therapeutic interventions against viral diseases. In this article, using Usp18-deficient, USP18 enzymatic-inactive and Isg15-deficient mouse models, we report that a lack of USP18 enzymatic function during persistent viral infection leads to severe immune pathology characterized by hematological disruptions described by reductions in platelets, total WBCs, and lymphocyte counts; pulmonary cytokine amplification; lung vascular leakage; and death. The lack of Usp18 in myeloid cells mimicked the pathological manifestations observed in Usp18-/- mice and required Isg15. Mechanistically, interrupting the enzymes that conjugate/deconjugate ISG15, using Uba7-/- or Usp18C61A mice, respectively, led to accumulation of ISG15 that was accompanied by inflammatory neutrophil accumulation, lung pathology, and death similar to that observed in Usp18-deficient mice. Moreover, myeloid cell depletion reversed pathological manifestations, morbidity, and mortality in Usp18C61A mice. Our results suggest that dysregulated ISG15 production and signaling during persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection can produce lethal immune pathology and could serve as a therapeutic target during severe viral infections with pulmonary pathological manifestations.">

        <tr id="Cancer is a major global health concern, with immune suppression hindering treatment. Immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint blockage on T cells, has revolutionized cancer treatment. T-cell exhaustion is an abnormal activation state that develops when continuous exposure to antigens, like cancer. In this context, recent evidence suggests that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) plays a previously underappreciated role in fostering an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Further, blocking PTHrP activity reduces primary tumor growth, prevents metastasis, and prolongs survival in mice with various cancers. Here, we confirm that administration of anti-PTHrP monoclonal antibodies can reduce the growth of B16-PDL1 melanoma tumors and that although the therapy did not alter the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs, we noted that all stages of T-cell exhaustion were reduced. Further, the expression of cytolytic proteins PERFORIN and GZMB also increased. By contrast, anti-PTHrP therapy increased the relative presence of pre-pro B cells with a decline in mature B cells in the bone marrow. Overall, our data indicates that anti-PTHrP therapy acts by reducing T-cell exhaustion and by affecting B-cell development. These provide further mechanistic evidence to support the application of anti-PTHrP blockade as an alternate therapeutic approach to boost anti-tumor immunity.">

Bone marrow-derived monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for one to three days and then typically migrate into tissues, where they differentiate into macrophages. Circulatory monocytes represent 5% of the nucleated cells in normal adult blood. Following differentiation, macrophages are distributed into various tissues and organs to take residence and maintain body homeostasis. Emerging evidence has highlighted the critical role of monocytes/macrophages in oncogenic viral infections, mainly their crucial functions in viral persistence and disease progression. These findings open opportunities to target innate immunity in the context of oncogenic viruses and to explore their potential as immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Introduction Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be released by any cell and are crucial for cell-to-cell communications. EVs have been characterized in patients with solid and hematological tumors, where they play an important role in tumor progression and metastasis. EVs may express different surface proteins derived from the parental cells, including immunomodulatory molecules, such as HLA-G and PDL1. Methods We isolated EV from bone marrow (BM) samples of patients with Neuroblastoma (NB) and healthy controls and we analyzed the expression of CD56, GD2 and immune checkpoints on EV by flow cytometry. Next, we analyzed the function of T cells in vitro in the presence or absence of NB patients' BM-derived EV, in terms of proliferation and cytokine production. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the expression of immune checkpoints on EV and the clinical outcome of patients. Results We found a higher expression of CD56 on EVs derived from BM of patients with NB than in those from healthy donors (HD). However, CD56 expression was not dependent on BM infiltration of NB cells. Moreover, the analysis of GD2 expression revealed that only a small fraction of EVs was released by infiltrating NB cells, whereas the majority may derive from BM-resident cells. BM-derived EVs from NB patients display a higher expression of HLA-G and PD-L1 than those derived from HD. Nonetheless, such EVs are able to modulate T cell immune responses. We measured a robust response, in vitro, towards a common bacterial antigen, including the release of GM-CSF and proinflammatory cytokines, like IFN-a and IL-6, from mononuclear cells. Some of these immunomodulatory features are dependent on the expression of HLA-G and PD-L1, whereas others may rely on other mechanism(s). Finally, a high expression of CD56, HLA-G and PD-L1 on BM-derived EVs may represent a good prognostic factor. Conclusions We described the presence of HLA-G and PDL1-bearing EVs in the BM of NB patients, which may represent a mechanism performed by resident BM cells to counteract the inflammation occurring in the BM microenvironment of NB patients.">

        <tr id="Alemtuzumab induction with belatacept/rapamycin-based maintenance immunotherapy (ABR) prevents kidney allograft rejection and specifically limits early costimulation blockade-resistant rejection (CoBRR). To evaluate the mechanisms by which this regimen alters CoBRR, we characterized the phenotype and functional response of preexisting memory cells to allogeneic endothelial cells using intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. IL-7-induced lymphocyte proliferation in the presence or absence of rapamycin was assessed to characterize the phenotype of proliferating cells. Lymphocytes from 40 recipients who underwent transplant using the ABR regimen were studied longitudinally. The rapid immunoresponses of preexisting alloreactive cells to allogeneic endothelial cells were predominantly CD8+TNF-α+/IFN-γ+ cells. These cells were effector memory (TEM) and terminally differentiated effector memory cells lacking CD28 expression, and most were CD57+PD1-. Neither rapamycin nor belatacept directly inhibited these cells. IL-7, a cytokine induced during lymphopenia postdepletion, provoked dramatic CD8+ TEM cell proliferation and a low level of CD8+CD57+PD1- cell expansion in vitro. The IL-7 stimulation induced CD8+ cell mTOR phosphorylation, and rapamycin treatment markedly inhibited IL-7-induced TEM and CD57+PD1- cell expansion. This effect was evident in patients receiving the ABR in that the repopulation of CD8+CD57+PD1- TEM cells was substantially suppressed for at least 36 mo after transplant. These findings help define one mechanism by which a costimulation blockade/rapamycin-based therapy following alemtuzumab induction minimizes CoBRR, namely that in the presence of rapamycin, costimulation-resistant alloreactive cells are disproportionately ineffective at repopulating following post-transplant T cell depletion.">

        <tr id="Background: Breast cancer represents one of the leading causes of death among women. Surgery can be effective, but once breast cancer has metastasized, it becomes extremely difficult to treat. Conventional therapies are associated with substantial toxicity and poor efficacy due to tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance and disease relapse. Moreover, immune checkpoint blockade appears to offer limited benefit in breast cancer. The poor tumor immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment result in scarce T-cell infiltration, leading to a low response rate. Thus, there is considerable interest in the development of improved active immunotherapies capable of sensitizing a patient’s immune system against tumor cells. Methods: We evaluated the in vitro anti-tumor activity of a personalized vaccine based on dendritic cells generated in the presence of interferon (IFN)-α and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (IFN-DC) and loaded with an oxidized lysate from autologous tumor cells expanded as 3D organoid culture maintaining faithful tumor antigenic profiles. Results: Our findings demonstrate that stimulation of breast cancer patients’ lymphocytes with autologous IFN-DC led to efficient Th1-biased response and the generation in vitro of potent cytotoxic activity toward the patients’ own tumor cells. Conclusions: This approach can be potentially applied in association with checkpoint blockade and chemotherapy in the design of new combinatorial therapies for breast cancer.">

        <tr id="Type I NKT cells, also known as Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells, are a subpopulation of unconventional, innate-like T (ILT) cells which can proficiently influence downstream immune effector functions. Type I NKT cells express a semi-invariant αβ T cell receptor (TCR) that recognises lipid-based ligands specifically presented by the non-classical cluster of differentiation (CD1) protein d (CD1d) molecule. Due to their potent immunomodulatory functional capacity, type I NKT cells are being increasingly considered in prophylactic and therapeutic approaches towards various diseases, including as vaccine-adjuvants. As viruses do not encode lipid synthesis, it is surprising that many studies have shown that some viruses can directly impede type I NKT activation through downregulating CD1d expression. Therefore, in order to harness type I NKT cells for potential anti-viral therapeutic uses, it is critical that we fully appreciate how the CD1d-iNKT cell axis interacts with viral immunity. In this review, we examine clinical findings that underpin the importance of type I NKT cell function in viral infections. This review also explores how certain viruses employ immunoevasive mechanisms and directly encode functions to target CD1d expression and type I NKT cell function. Overall, we suggest that the CD1d-iNKT cell axis may hold greater gravity within viral infections than what was previously appreciated.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has led to unprecedented success in treating relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The most common CAR-T cell products currently in the clinic for DLBCL differ in their co-stimulation moiety, containing either CD28 or 4-1BB, which initiate distinct signalling pathways. Previous work has highlighted the importance of T cell metabolism in fuelling anti-cancer function. We have studied the metabolic characteristics induced by CD28 versus 4-1BB co-stimulation in patient CAR-T cells ex vivo. Our data show that in patients, CD28 and 4-1BB drive significantly divergent metabolic profiles. CD28 signalling endows T cells with a preferentially glycolytic metabolism supporting an effector phenotype and increased expansion capacity, while 4-1BB co-stimulation preserves mitochondrial fitness and results in memory-like differentiation. Despite this divergent programming, T cells in patients responding successfully to therapy were metabolically similar, irrespective of co-stimulator, suggesting that efficient fuelling of CAR-T cells in lymphoma requires a ‘balanced’ metabolism. In contrast, CAR-T cells in non-responders were pushed to their metabolic extremes. One sentence summary CD28 and 4-1BB signalling drive divergent metabolic profiles in patient CAR-T cells, however patients that respond to therapy have CAR-T cells that maintain metabolic balance.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are suppressors of anti-tumor immunity that exert multifaceted functions by signaling surrounding cells. We revealed Tregs use their high-level surface lymphotoxin (LT)α1β2 to preferentially stimulate LTβ receptor (LTβR) nonclassical NFκB signaling on both tumor and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) to accelerate tumor growth and metastasis. Selectively targeting LTβR nonclassical NFκB pathways on both tumors and LECs cocultured with Tregs, inhibited tumor growth and migration in vitro. Further, we identified protumorigenic chemokines and interferon-stimulated response genes selectively driven by LTβR nonclassical NFκB in melanoma cells. Endothelial specific genes related to oncogenic process such as SOX18 and FLRT2 were identified to be driven under LTβR nonclassical NFκB in LECs. Leveraging in vivo Treg LTα1β2 interactions with LTβR on tumor and LECs, transfer of WT but not LTα-deficient Tregs promoted transplanted WT B16F10 growth and tumor cell-derived CXCL1 and CXCL10 secretion in LTβR-deficient host mice, and increased endothelial specific genes related to tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, in WT mice bearing LTβR-depleted melanoma. Selectively blocking LTβR nonclassical NFκB pathways remarkably suppressed tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis by reducing tumor cell and LEC-derived CXCL1 and CXCL10 production, restricting Treg and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) recruitment to tumor. It also retained intratumoral effector T cells, especially IFNγ+ CD8 T cells by restraining Treg facilitated lymphatic vessel permeability. Our data revealed that Treg LTα1β2 promotes LTβR nonclassical NFκB signaling in tumor cells and LECs providing a rational strategy to modulate Treg-mediated protumorigenic molecules to prevent tumor growth and metastasis.">

        <tr id="Dendritic cells (DCs) are recognized as the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and act as intermediaries between the innate and adaptive immune systems. The maturation and function of DCs are significantly influenced by autophagy. Hence, the current research evaluated the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an autophagy inhibitor, on the maturation and activation of monocyte-derived DCs. Monocytes were cultured and induced to differentiate into monocyte-derived DCs by the addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) cytokines. After five days, the immature DCs were exposed to HCQ and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), followed by a 24-hour incubation period. On the sixth day, the flow cytometry technique was employed to assess the impact of HCQ on the phenotypic characteristics of the DCs. Finally, the expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes in the HCQ-treated and untreated DCs groups was examined using the real-time PCR method.  DCs that were subjected to treatment with HCQ exhibited a notable augmentation in the expression of CD11c, CD86, and HLA-DR, which are markers associated with maturation and antigen presentation. Furthermore, the DCs treated with HCQ demonstrated a significant reduction in the expression of IL-10, TGF-β, and IDO genes, while displaying an increase in the expression of TNF-α and IL-12 when compared to the control group. These findings indicate that targeting autophagy can induce a shift in DCs towards an immunogenic state. However, further investigations are necessary to assess the impact of HCQ-treated DCs on T cell responses both in vitro and in vivo in tumor-bearing animal models.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Despite success in treating some hematological malignancies, CAR-T cells have not yet produced similar outcomes in solid tumors due, in part, to the tumor microenvironment, poor persistence, and a paucity of suitable target antigens. Importantly, the impact of the CAR components on these challenges remains focused on the intracellular signaling and antigen-binding domains. In contrast, the flexible hinge and transmembrane domains have been commoditized and are the least studied components of the CAR. Here, we compared the hinge and transmembrane domains derived from either the CD8ɑ or CD28 molecule in identical GUCY2C-targeted third-generation designs for colorectal cancer. While these structural domains do not contribute to differences in antigen-independent contexts, such as CAR expression and differentiation and exhaustion phenotypes, the CD8ɑ structural domain CAR has a greater affinity for GUCY2C. This results in increased production of inflammatory cytokines and granzyme B, improved cytolytic effector function with low antigen-expressing tumor cells, and robust anti-tumor efficacy in vivo compared with the CD28 structural domain CAR. This suggests that CD8α structural domains should be considered in the design of all CARs for the generation of high-affinity CARs and optimally effective CAR-T cells in solid tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Severe infections such as malaria are on the rise worldwide, driven by both climate change and increasing drug-resistance. It is therefore paramount that we better understand how the host’s organism responds to severe infection. Hematopoiesis is particularly of interest in this context because hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) maintain the turnover of all blood cells, including all immune cells. Severe infections have been widely acknowledged to affecting HSPCs, however this disruption has been mainly studied during the acute phase, and the process and level of HSPC recovery remains understudied. Using a self-resolving model of natural rodent malaria, infection by Plasmodium chabaudi, here we systematically assess HSPCs’ acute response and recovery upon pathogen clearance. We demonstrate that during the acute phase of infection the most quiescent and functional stem cells are depleted, multipotent progenitor compartments are drastically enlarged, and oligopotent progenitors virtually disappear, underpinned by dramatic, population-specific and sometimes unexpected changes in proliferation rates. HSPC populations return to homeostatic size and proliferation rate again through specific patterns of recovery. Overall, our data demonstrate that HSPC populations adopt different responses to cope with severe infection and suggest that the ability to adjust proliferative capacity becomes more restricted as differentiation progresses.">

        <tr id="Tumors often evolve to engage numerous strategies to circumvent detection by the immune system. Our group recently discovered elevated neolacto-series glycosphingolipids (nsGSL) surface levels as a possible immune evasion mechanism of tumors. We demonstrated a direct disruption of both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity in vitro when expression of nsGSLs was upregulated on established target cells. It remains unclear however, whether in vivo nsGSLs play an active role in tumor development and can aid tumors in evading immune responses. To investigate whether nsGSLs facilitate tumor progression in vivo, we first established a murine model system using MC38-OVA cell lines with varying cell surface levels of nsGSLs. In vitro analysis revealed reduced MHC-I accessibility on tumor cells with elevated nsGSLs profiles, leading to diminished activation of OVA-specific OT-I T cells as evidenced by decreased expression of CD25, CD69, and production of IFNγ, which subsequently resulted in decreased tumor cell death. Subsequent in vivo experiments investigating tumor outgrowth after engraftment of subcutaneously injected MC38-OVA cell lines with low or high cell surface levels of nsGSLs demonstrated better growth of nsGSL-rich tumor cells compared to nsGSL-poor tumors which could be controlled. Together these results suggest that nsGSLs expressed by tumors can facilitate immune evasion and subsequent tumor progression. These data pave the way to explore whether targeting of the GSL pathway with specific inhibitors could be advantageous as a therapy against tumors with high nsGSL levels.">

 The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is ground zero for the massive and sustained CD4 T cell depletion during acute HIV-1 infection. To date, the molecular mechanisms governing this fundamental pathogenic process remain unclear. HIV-1 infection in the GI tract is associated with chronic inflammation due to a disrupted epithelial barrier that results in microbial translocation. Here, we utilized the Lamina Propria Aggregate Culture model to demonstrate that the profound induction of Granzyme B (GZB) by bacteria in primary gut CD4 T cells ex vivo significantly contributes to HIV-1-mediated CD4 T cell death. Counterintuitively, a substantial fraction of gut GZB+ CD4 T cells harboring high levels of HIV-1 infection survive via a pathway linked to CD120b/TNFR2. Our findings underscore novel mechanisms governing the death and survival of gut CD4 T cells during HIV-1 infection that could inform strategies to counter HIV-1 pathogenesis and persistence in this critical tissue compartment.">

        <tr id="Currently, only 20-40% of cancer patients benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and characterizing dynamic changes in the immunological landscape during treatment are critical for improving responsiveness to immunotherapy. Here, we identified JNK signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a regulator of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of bladder cancer treated with a JNK inhibitor revealed enhanced cytotoxicity and effector functions of CD8+ T cells. In untreated tumors, CAFs interacted frequently with CD8+ T cells and mediated their exhaustion. JNK inhibition abrogated the immunosuppression function of CAFs by downregulating the expression of TSLP, thereby restoring CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. In addition, blockade of CAF-derived TSLP in combination with anti-PD1 treatment promoted tumor elimination by CD8+ T cells in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate that JNK signaling plays an important immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment by promoting expression of TSLP in CAFs and suggest that inhibiting JNK signaling could be a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.">

 Background: Identification of effective immunomodulatory strategies remains a major unmet need in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Agonistic anti-CD40 antibody (aCD40) exhibits direct cytotoxicity on tumor cells and augments antigen presentation. Subasumstat(SUB), a sumoylation inhibitor, augments innate and adaptive immune responses by increasing interferon signaling. We hypothesized that SUB+aCD40 combination would promote an effective antitumor immune response in an aggressive orthotopic model of PDAC. Methods: 2000 KPC 46 cells were implanted in the pancreas of four groups of F1 hybrid (initial survival, CD8+ T-cell depletion, and clodronate liposome depletion) and nude mice, enrolled when tumors had reached 3-5mm. The vehicle (veh) group received 80ul SUB vehicle (q48 hrs) and 100 ug blank IgG (qwk); SUB only group received 15mg/kg q48h; aCD40 only group received 100ug qwk; SUB+aCD40 group received 15mg/kg SUB q48h and 100 ug aCD40 qwk. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) was conducted on n=2 tumors from each group. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on veh and SUB+aCD40 tumors for macrophage infiltration using F4/80. Flow cytometry (FC) was employed for the presence of lymphoid and myeloid markers in veh, SUB+aCD40, and clodronate depleted SUB+aCD40 (SUB+aCD40+clod) groups. Results: Mice receiving SUB+aCD40 had a significantly improved median survival over those receiving monotherapy or vehicle (24.5d vs. SUB:15.5d, aCD40:20d, veh: 19d). scRNASeq revealed increased tumor infiltrating CD8+ T-cell and myeloid populations when comparing veh and monotherapy to SUB+aCD40. F4/80 IHC confirmed increased macrophage infiltration in SUB+aCD40 vs veh (p = 0.01). The survival advantage conferred by SUB+aCD40 was preserved in both CD8+ T-cell depleted mice (p=0.025) and nude mice (p=0.037), while clodronate eliminated the treatment survival advantage (p=0.39). FC showed increased tumor macrophage/monocyte infiltration in SUB+aCD40 vs veh (veh:11.9%, SUB+aCD40:22.5%, p=0.03) and reduction in SUB+aCD40+clod (12.6%, p=0.01). CD8+ T-cell CD69 expression decreased in the SUB+aCD40+clod group (SUB+aCD40:19%, SUB+aCD40+clod:6%, p< 0.01). CD8 T-cell infiltration (SUB+aCD40:4.95%, SUB+aCD40+clod:3.85%, p=0.27) and CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio (veh: 1.26, SUB+aCD40:0.52, SUB+aCD40+clod:0.69, p=0.09) were not affected by clodronate. Conclusion: SUB+aCD40 therapy confers a survival advantage in the KPC46 model of PDAC in a T-cell independent manner by increasing macrophage/monocyte infiltration. SUB+aCD40 promotes CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activation, but they do not contribute to survival advantage, possibly due to exhaustion. Future work will include addition of therapeutics to mitigate/reverse T-cell exhaustion to harness both innate and adaptive immunity in treating PDAC.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Lung cancer remains a major global health threat due to its complex microenvironment, particularly the role of neutrophils, which are crucial for tumor development and immune evasion mechanisms. This study aimed to delve into the impact of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on neutrophil functions and their potential implications for lung cancer progression.


METHODS
Employing in vitro experimental models, this study has analyzed the effects of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on neutrophil IL-8 and IFN-γ secretion, apoptosis, PD-L1 expression, and T-cell proliferation by using techniques, such as ELISA, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and CFSE proliferation assay. The roles of IL-8/PD-L1 in regulating neutrophil functions were further explored using inhibitors for IL-8 and PD-L1.


RESULTS
Lung cancer cell lines were found to secrete higher levels of IL-8 compared to normal lung epithelial cells. The conditioned media from lung cancer cells significantly reduced apoptosis in neutrophils, increased PD-L1 expression, and suppressed T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion. These effects were partially reversed in the presence of IL-8 inhibitors in Tumor Tissue Culture Supernatants (TTCS), while being further enhanced by IL-8. Both apoptosis and PD-L1 expression in neutrophils demonstrated dose-dependency to TTCS. Additionally, CFSE proliferation assay results further confirmed the inhibitory effect of lung cancer cell-conditioned media on T-cell proliferation.


CONCLUSION
This study has revealed lung cancer cell-conditioned media to modulate neutrophil functions through regulating factors, such as IL-8, thereby affecting immune regulation and tumor progression in the lung cancer microenvironment.">

        <tr id="Stem cell therapy has shown immense promise in treating genetic disorders, particularly muscular diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This study investigates a novel method to enhance the viability of stem cell transplants in DMD by upregulating Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) through preconditioning with hypoxia and/or interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to mitigate T cell immune rejection. MuSCs were treated with 5% hypoxia for 72 h and further treated with IFN-γ to enhance PD-L1 expression. Additionally, gain and loss experiments using a PD-L1 inhibitor (BMS-1) were conducted to investigate cellular expression profiles in vitro and cell transplantation outcomes in vivo. Our results showed significant upregulation of PD-L1 in MuSCs under hypoxia and IFN-γ conditions without affecting cellular proliferation and differentiation in vitro. In vivo, these preconditioned MuSCs led to decreased infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in implanted limb muscles of mouse models. Blocking PD-L1 reduced graft survival in muscles treated with MuSCs. Conversely, increased PD-L1 expression and reduced T cell infiltration correlated with improved graft survival, as identified by pre-labeled LacZ + MuSCs following transplantation. This study provides evidence that hypoxia and IFN-γ preconditioning of MuSCs can significantly enhance the efficacy of cell therapy for DMD by mitigating immune rejection. Our strategic approach aimed to improve donor cell survival and function post-transplantation by modifying immune responses towards the donor cells.">

        <tr id="Hypoxia occurs in settings where stringent control of inflammation is mandatory to avoid tissue damage. Here, we analyzed how hypoxia-induced mediators alter recognition of pathogen-derived molecular patterns (PAMPs). The most relevant finding was that hypoxia selectively targets IFN-α induced upon stimulation with nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLR7/8 and -9) in PBMC. Notably, IFN-α secretion was reduced, but IFN-α producing capacity preserved. Corroborating these findings IFN-dependent cytokines IP-10 and IL-12 p70 were reduced under hypoxia, while other cytokines such as TNF remained unaffected. A role for hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) was confirmed with prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitors CoCl2 and DMOG. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) were identified as the major source of IFN-α and experiments in B cell/PDC and monocyte/PDC cocultures indicated that T cells are not required and both lymphoid and myeloid cells equally support inhibition of IFN-α. Moreover, supernatants from unstimulated PBMC generated under hypoxic conditions were not suppressive but further experiments indicated that hypoxia-specific release of IFN-α regulators lactate and TGF-β can contribute to the IFN-α blockage and might synergize with PGE2. However, each one of these factors alone is insufficient to block IFN-α secretion. These findings suggest that control of the PDC response occurs via combined soluble factors and cell contact-dependent mechanisms, thereby enabling a fine-tuning of the anti-microbial immune response in hypoxia.">

        <tr id="Dormant cancer stem cells (DCSCs) exhibit characteristics of chemotherapy resistance and immune escape, and they are a crucial source of tumor recurrence and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. We demonstrate that enriched Gzmk+ CD8+ T cells within the niche of esophageal DCSCs restrict the outgrowth of tumor mass. Nonetheless, DCSCs can escape immune elimination by enhancing PD-L1 signaling, thereby maintaining immune equilibrium. Quiescent fibroblast-derived quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) promotes the expression of PD-L1 and its own expression in DCSCs by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, high QSOX1 in the dormant tumor niche contributes to the exclusion of CD8+ T cells. Conversely, blocking QSOX1 with Ebselen in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy can effectively eradicate residual DCSCs by reducing PD-L1 expression and promoting CD8+ T cell infiltration. Clinically, high expression of QSOX1 predicts a poor response to anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with esophageal cancer. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism whereby QSOX1 promotes PD-L1 upregulation and T cell exclusion, facilitating the immune escape of DCSCs, and QSOX1 inhibition, combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, represents a promising therapeutic approach for eliminating DCSCs and preventing recurrence.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Fulminant myocarditis (FM) is a myocardial inflammatory disease that can result from either viral diseases or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we have determined the treatment effects of immunomodulatory drugs on FM.


EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
FM was induced in A/JGpt mice by intraperitoneal administration of coxsackievirus B3, after which immunoglobins were administered daily by intraperitoneal injection. On the seventh day, the cardiac structure and function were determined using echocardiography and cardiac catheterisation. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to evaluate CD45+ cells in the heart.


KEY RESULTS
Immunoglobin, a typical immunomodulatory drug, dramatically reduced mortality and significantly improved cardiac function in mice with FM. ScRNA-seq revealed that immunoglobin treatment effectively modulated cardiac immune homeostasis, particularly by attenuating overactivated innate immune responses. At the cellular level, immunoglobin predominantly targeted Plac8+ monocytes and S100a8+ neutrophils, suppressing their proinflammatory activities, and enhancing antigen processing and presentation capabilities, thereby amplifying the efficiency and potency of the immune response against the virus. Immunoglobin benefits are mediated by the modulation of multiple signalling pathways, including relevant receptors on immune cells, direction of inflammatory cell chemotaxis, antigen presentation and anti-viral effects. Subsequently, Bst2-ILT7 ligand-receptor-mediated cellular interactions manipulated by immunoglobin were further confirmed in vivo.


CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Immunoglobin treatment significantly attenuated FM-induced cardiac inflammation and improved cardiac function by inhibiting overactivated innate immune responses.">

        <tr id="Purpose Type I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) play a key role in priming anti-tumor cytotoxic T cells and inducing immune tolerance for self-antigens and tumor antigens. However, it remains unclear whether cDC1 has a protective or pathogenic role in multiple myeloma. We investigated a role of cDC1 in myeloma progression. Methods A myeloma mouse model was performed by intravenous transplantation of Vk*MYC myeloma cells into XCR1-Diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) knock-in or wild-type mice. Following injection with Diphtheria toxin (DT), monoclonal (M)-proteins and myeloma cells were analyzed by ELISA and flow cytometry. Results Here we show that inducible depletion of cDC1 after myeloma transplantation markedly suppressed the progression of myeloma in the bone marrow and extramedullary sites, such as the spleen. cDC1 appeared in the bone marrow and spleen of myeloma-transplanted mice, which highly expressed CD103 and lowly produced interleukin (IL)-12. Consequently, the frequencies of exhausted CD8 T cells and regulatory T cells significantly decreased in the bone marrow of cDC1-depleted mice. Conclusions cDC1 supports the progression of myeloma inducing exhausted CD8 T cells and regulatory T cells.">

        <tr id="Immunosenescence impacts both the innate and adaptive immune systems, predominantly affecting certain immune cell types. A notable manifestation of immunosenescence is the diminished efficacy of adaptive immunity. The excessive senescence of immune cells, particularly T cells, leads to marked immune deficiency, consequently escalating the risk of infections, tumors, and age-associated disorders. Lymphocytes, especially T cells, are subject to both replicative and premature senescence. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase have multifaceted roles in regulating cellular behavior, possessing the ability to counteract both replicative and premature senescence in lymphocytes. This review encapsulates recent advancements in understanding immunosenescence, with a focus on T cell senescence, and the regulatory mechanisms involving TERT/telomerase. Additionally, it comprehensively discusses strategies aimed at inhibiting immunosenescence by augmenting TERT/telomerase activity.">

        <tr id="Although mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are as effective as MSCs in the suppression of allergic airway inflammation, few studies have evaluated the immunomodulatory capacity of MSC-derived EVs in patients with asthma. Thus, we assessed the effects of adipose stem cell (ASC)-derived EVs on cytokine expression and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of asthmatic patients. PBMCs (1 × 106 cells/mL) were isolated from asthmatic patient and healthy controls and co-cultured with 1 μg/mL of ASC-derived EVs. Th (T helper) 1-, Th2-, and Treg-related cytokine expression, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells, and co-stimulatory molecules were analyzed before and after ASC-derived EV treatment. The expression levels of IL-4 and costimulatory molecules such as CD83 and CD86 were significantly higher in PBMCs of asthmatic patients than in control PBMCs. However, ASC-derived EV treatment significantly decreased the levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD83 and CD86 in the phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated PBMC of asthmatic patients. Furthermore, ASC-derived EVs remarkably increased the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) levels and expression of Tregs in the PBMC of asthmatic patients. ASC-derived EVs induce Treg expansion and have immunomodulatory effects by downregulating IL-4 and upregulating TGF-β in PBMCs of asthmatic patients.">

        <tr id="Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) promote immune evasion, cancer cell proliferation, and metastasis. Ongoing research is focused on finding ways to prevent tumor growth by inhibiting TAM polarization, which has shown a correlation with unfavorable prognosis in clinical studies. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor (PAUF) is a protein secreted from pancreatic cancer (PC) and acts as a TME modulator that affects the TME by acting on not only cancer cells but also stromal cells and immune cells. Tumor cells can evade the immune system by PAUF binding to Toll-like receptor (TLR) in monocytes, as this research shows. In this study, the examination centered around the recruitment of human monocytes by PAUF and the subsequent differentiation into macrophages. In an in vitro chemotaxis assay, PAUF induced chemotactic migration of TLR2-mediated monocytes. In addition, PAUF induced differentiation of monocytes into M2 macrophages, which was verified based on expressing surface markers and cytokines and morphological analysis. The inhibition of T cell proliferation and function was observed in differentiated M2 macrophages. To conclude, these findings indicate that PAUF functions as a promoter of cancer progression by regulating the recruitment and differentiation of macrophages within TMEs, ultimately causing immunosuppression.">

        <tr id="S100A9, a multifunctional protein mainly expressed by neutrophils and monocytes, poses an immunological paradox. In virus infections or sterile inflammation, it functions as an alarmin attracting innate immune cells, as well as mediating proinflammatory effects through TLR4 signaling. However, in cancer, S100A9 levels have been shown to associate with poor prognosis and lack of response to immunotherapy. Its expression by myeloid cells has been related to an immune suppressive phenotype, the so-called myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Targeting S100A9 in cancer has therefore been proposed as a potential way to relieve myeloid-mediated immune suppression. Surprisingly, we found that blocking the extracellular TLR4 signaling from S100A9 using the inhibitor Paquinimod, resulted in increased tumor growth and a detrimental effect on anti-PD-L1 efficacy in the CT26 tumor model. This effect was caused by a reduction in the tumor immune infiltration to about half of untreated controls, and the reduction was made up of a 5-fold decrease in Ly6Chigh monocytic cells. The suppressive Ly6G+ myeloid cells compartment was not reduced by Paquinimod treatment, suggesting alternative mechanisms by which S100A9 contributes to myeloid-mediated suppression. Intratumoral injection of recombinant S100A9 early after mice inoculation with CT26 cells had an anti-tumor effect. These findings indicate an important yet understudied role of S100A9 as an alarmin and immune stimulatory signal in cancer settings, and highlight the potential to exploit such signals to promote beneficial anti-tumor responses.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) remains the leading cause of neurological disability among young adults worldwide, underscoring the urgent need to define the best therapeutic strategy. Recent advances in proteomics have deepened our understanding of treatment mechanisms and revealed promising biomarkers for predicting therapeutic outcomes. This study focuses on the identification of a protein profile of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from neurons, oligodendrocytes, and B and T cells able to differentiate treatment responders and non-responders in 80 patients with MS. In the patients who responded to treatment, T cell-derived EVs were enriched in LV151, a protein involved in the promotion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, whereas Bcell-derived EVs showed elevated PSMD6 and PTPRC, related to immunoproteasome function. Oligodendrocyte- and neuron-derived EVs showed upregulated CO6A1 and COEA1, involved in extracellular matrix reorganisation, as well as LAMA5, NonO, SPNT, and NCAM, which are critical for brain repair. In contrast, non-responders showed higher levels of PSMD7 and PRS10 from B cell-derived EVs, associated with DNA damage, and increased levels of PERM and PERL from T cell-derived EVs, linked to nuclear factor kappa B activation and drug-resistant proteins such as HS90A and RASK. These findings highlight a distinct panel of proteins in EVs that could serve as an early indicator of treatment efficacy in MS.">

 Glioblastomas (GBMs) are aggressive brain tumors with strong immunosuppressive properties. In epithelial cancers, mesenchymal cells expressing fibroblast activation protein (FAP) play an important role in modulating the T cell response. We have recently shown that FAP+ mesenchymal cells are present in human GBMs. The aim of this study was to determine their effect on T cell abundance and function.



 GBM tumors (16 samples) were mechanically and enzymatically dissociated and analyzed for immune cell subpopulations by flow cytometry. Expression of T cell related genes was analyzed by qRT-PCR in GBMs selected based on FAP protein concentration determined by ELISA (14 FAP high [upper tercile], 16 FAP low [lower tercile]). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to compare the number of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in GBMs with high (upper tercile, n=21) and low abundance of FAP+ stroma (lower tercile, n=20). Co-localization of FAP+ mesenchymal cells and CD3, PD-L1 and PD-L2 was evaluated by immunofluorescence in frozen sections. 8 FAP+ mesenchymal and 3 glioblastoma stem-like cell cultures were derived from human GBMs and PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was determined using ELISA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy donors´ buffy coats. Proliferation of stimulated T cells in conditioned media from FAP+ mesenchymal cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.



 The percentage of T cells in CD45+ cells from GBMs positively correlated with FAP expression. Expression of the T cell inhibitory molecule PD-L2 was higher in FAP high GBMs. Immunohistochemisty revealed that the numbers of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells were higher in GMBs with a high abundance of FAP+ stroma and T cells were frequently in close proximity to FAP+ mesenchymal cells, which were often PD-L2 positive. In vitro, FAP+ mesenchymal cells expressed more PD-L2 than glioblastoma stem-like cells. T cell proliferation was decreased after exposure to conditioned media from FAP+ mesenchymal cells.



 FAP+ mesenchymal cells influence T cell abundance in GBMs and may affect T cell functions by limiting their proliferation via soluble factors or cell-cell contact.

        <tr id="Background Dysregulated innate immune responses underlie multiple inflammatory diseases, but clinical translation of preclinical innate immunity research in mice is hampered by the difficulty of studying human inflammatory reactions in an in vivo context. We therefore sought to establish in vivo human inflammatory responses in NSG-QUAD mice that express four human myelopoiesis transgenes to improve engraftment of a human innate immune system. Methods We reconstituted NSG-QUAD mice with human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), after which we evaluated human myeloid cell development and subsequent human responses to systemic and local lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges. Results NSG-QUAD mice already displayed engraftment of human monocytes, dendritic cells and granulocytes in peripheral blood, spleen and liver at 6 weeks after HSPC reconstitution, in which both classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes were present. These huNSG-QUAD mice responded to intraperitoneal and intranasal LPS challenges with production of NF-κB-dependent human cytokines, a human type I interferon response, as well as inflammasome-mediated production of human IL-1β and IL-18. The latter were specifically abrogated by the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950, while LPS-induced human monocyte death was not altered. Besides providing proof-of-principle for small molecule testing of human inflammatory reactions in huNSG-QUAD mice, this observation suggests that LPS-induced in vivo release of human NLRP3 inflammasome-generated cytokines occurs in a cell death-independent manner. Conclusion HuNSG-QUAD mice are competent for the NF-κB, interferon and inflammasome effectors of human innate immunity, and can thus be utilized to investigate signaling mechanisms and pharmacological targeting of human inflammatory responses in an in vivo setting.">

        <tr id="Background & Aims Intestinal tuft cells have recently been the interest of studies in several human gastrointestinal diseases. However, the impact of tuft cell deletion on intestinal physiological functions are not fully understood. This study investigated the effects of acute tuft cell loss on nutrient absorption and cell lineage differentiation. Methods Tuft cell deletion was induced in DCLK1-IRES-GFP-CreERT2/+;Rosa-DTA (DCLK1-DTA) mice by a single tamoxifen injection concomitant with littermate controls. Intestinal tissues were analyzed two-, four-, or seven-days post tamoxifen injection. Results DCLK1-DTA mice showed significantly shortened small intestinal length and body weight loss on day 4. Impaired activities of Na+-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) were observed in Ussing chamber experiments. Tissue immunostaining revealed a transient deletion of intestinal and biliary tuft cells, which was maximal on day 4 and recovered by day 7. On day 4 post tamoxifen, cholecystokinin (CCK)+ enteroendocrine cell numbers were increased particularly in the ileum. Correlated with the tuft cell reduction, the frequency of mislocalized Paneth cells, which were co-labeled by Paneth and goblet cell markers, was increased in the villus regions. In the lamina propria, fewer mast cells and leukocytes were found in the day 4 DCLK1-DTA mice than in controls. Conclusion Ablation of intestinal tuft cells may induce nutrient malabsorption through alterations in epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation along with changes in mucosal defense response. These observations elucidate a new role for tuft cells in regulating intestinal absorption and mucosal regeneration.">

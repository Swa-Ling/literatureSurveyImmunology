        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by immune dysregulation, including alterations in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations and aberrant cytokine signaling. Methotrexate (MTX) is the preferred first-line treatment for RA, yet its precise mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. This study employed a multi-omics strategy—combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunophenotyping—to identify key effector peripheral immune cells and their cellular responses in RA patients over 12 weeks of MTX treatment. In our study, MTX was associated with significant immune modulation, including the restoration of naïve T and B cells and reductions in T cell memory subsets with these effects detectable as early as three weeks post-treatment. Plasmablast levels also emerged as a potential biomarker for early therapeutic response, reflecting MTX’s impact on immune homeostasis. Transcriptional analysis revealed modulation of key pathways, including TNF-α signaling, B cell receptor signaling, and T cell receptor-mediated apoptosis. Network analysis identified critical regulatory hubs, such as EGR1, JAK2, and SOCS1, in monocytes and CD4 memory T cells, highlighting these cell types as key mediators of MTX’s effects. In conclusion, these findings advance our understanding of MTX’s effects on immune cell dynamics at different stages of treatment, showing for the first time the early cellular changes leading to immune modulation in RA. Altogether, our results provide the foundation for further mechanistic investigations into MTX.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) signaling blockade by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) effectively restores immune surveillance to treat melanoma. However, chronic interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-induced immune homeostatic responses in melanoma cells contribute to immune evasion and acquired resistance to ICI. Poly ADP ribosyl polymerase 14 (PARP14), an IFNγ-responsive gene product, partially mediates IFNγ-driven resistance. PARP14 inhibition prolongs PD-1 blockade responses in preclinical models, but fails to achieve full tumor clearance, suggesting the involvement of additional resistance mechanisms. Methods We identified a robust PARP14 catalytic inhibitor gene signature and evaluated its association with patient survival. Using preclinical models and single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated immune and tumor cell adaptations to PARP14 inhibition combined with PD-1 blockade. Results Combining PARP14 inhibition and PD-1 blockade suppressed tumor-associated macrophages while increasing proinflammatory memory macrophages. Moreover, this combination mitigated the terminal exhaustion of cytotoxic T cells by inducing a quiescent state, thereby preserving functionality. Despite the enhanced immune responses, tumor cells developed adaptive resistance by engaging alternative immune evasion pathways. Conclusions Although adaptive resistance mechanisms re-emerge, PARP14 inhibition combined with PD-1 blockade offers a promising strategy to enhance treatment outcomes and overcome ICI resistance in melanoma, as immune cells are primed for further therapeutic interventions that leverage the quiescent state.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. HPV-negative HNSCC, which arises in the upper airway mucosa, is particularly aggressive, with nearly half of patients succumbing to the disease within five years and limited response to immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to other cancers. There is a need to further explore the complex immune landscape in HPV-negative HNSCC to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here, we integrated two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from 29 samples and nearly 300,000 immune cells to investigate immune cell dynamics across tumor progression and lymph node metastasis. Notable shifts toward adaptative immune cell populations were observed in the 14 distinct HNSCC-associated peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) and 21 tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) considering disease stages. All PBMCs and TICs revealed unique molecular signatures correlating with lymph node involvement; however, broadly, TICs increased ligand expression among effector cytokines, growth factors, and interferon-related genes. Pathway analysis comparing PBMCs and TICs further confirmed active cell signaling among Monocyte-Macrophage, Dendritic cell, Natural Killer (NK), and T cell populations. Receptor-ligand analysis revealed significant communication patterns shifts among TICs, between CD8+ T cells and NK cells, showing heightened immunosuppressive signaling that correlated with disease progression. In locally invasive HPV-negative HNSCC samples, highly multiplexed immunofluorescence assays highlighted peri-tumoral clustering of exhausted CD8+ T and NK cells, alongside their exclusion from intra-tumoral niches. These findings emphasize cytotoxic immune cells as valuable biomarkers and therapeutic targets, shedding light on the mechanisms by which the HNSCC sustainably evades immune responses.">

        <tr id="The functional plasticity of tumor-infiltrating B (TIL-B) cells spans from anti-tumor responses to non-canonical immune suppression. Yet, how tumor microenvironment (TME) influences TIL-B development is still underappreciated. Our current study integrated single cell transcriptomics and BCR (B cell receptor) sequencing to profile TIL-B phenotypes and clonalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using trajectory and gene regulatory network analysis, we were able to characterize plasma cells, memory and naïve B cells within the HCC TME and further revealed a downregulation of BCR-signaling genes in plasma cells and a subset of inflammatory TNF+ memory B cells. Within the TME, non-switch memory B cell subset acquires an age-associated B cell phenotype (TBET+, CD11c+) and expressed higher levels of PD-L1, CD25 and granzyme B. We further demonstrated that the presence of HCC tumor cells could confer suppressive functions on peripheral blood B cells which in turn, dampen T cell co-stimulation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent novel mechanisms of non-canonical immune suppression in HCC. While previous studies identified atypical memory B cells in chronic hepatitis and across several solid cancer types, we further highlighted their potential role as regulatory B cells (Bregs) within both the TME and peripheral blood of HCC patients.">

        <tr id="Arming T cells with a synthetically orthogonal IL-9 receptor (o9R) permits facile engraftment and potent anti-tumor functions. We considered whether the paucity of natural IL-9R expression could be exploited for T cell immunotherapy given that, in mice, high doses of IL-9 were well-tolerated without discernible immune modulation. Compared to o9R, T cells engineered with IL-9R exhibit superior tissue infiltration, stemness, and anti-tumor activity. These qualities are consistent with a stronger JAK/STAT signal, which in addition to STAT1/3/5, unexpectedly includes STAT4 (canonically associated with IL-12 but not common γ-chain cytokines). IL-9R T cells are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations of proximal signaling, including structure-guided attenuation, amplification, and rebalancing of JAK/STAT signals. Biased IL-9R mutants uncover STAT1 as a rheostat between proliferative stem-like and terminally differentiated effector states. In summary, we identify native IL-9/IL-9R as a natural cytokine-receptor pair with near-orthogonal qualities and an optimal JAK/STAT signaling profile for engineered T cell therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Anti‐melanoma differentiation‐associated gene 5‐positive dermatomyositis (anti‐MDA5+ DM) is a rare inflammatory autoimmune disorder often complicated by life‐threatening rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP‐ILD). The underlying mechanisms driving immune dysfunction and lung injury, however, remain poorly understood. The study aims to gain insights into the disrupted immune landscape in peripheral and pulmonary compartments of severe anti‐MDA5+ DM and explore potential therapeutic targets. Methods We employed single‐cell RNA sequencing to examine cellular constituents within five patients’ bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Luminex assay and flow cytometry were further applied to validate the results. Results Our analysis revealed starkly contrasting immune landscapes between the periphery and lungs, with peripheral immune suppression juxtaposed against pulmonary immune hyperactivation. Central to this dysregulation was the monocyte–macrophage lineage. Circulating monocytes exhibited an immunosuppressive phenotype, characterised by diminished cytokine production, reduced MHC II expression, and features resembling myeloid‐derived suppressor cells. These monocytes were recruited to the lungs, where they differentiated into monocyte‐derived alveolar macrophages (Mo‐AMs) with robust proinflammatory and profibrotic activities. Mo‐AMs drove cytokine storms and produced chemokines that amplified inflammatory cell recruitment and lung tissue remodelling. Additionally, peripheral T and NK cells exhibited increased cell death and active migration into the lungs, which may be the cause of lymphopenia. Conclusions Our study underscores the pivotal role of monocyte–macrophage dynamics in the immunopathogenesis of anti‐MDA5+‐associated RP‐ILD, offering critical insights into compartment‐specific immune dysregulation. These findings suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting monocyte recruitment and macrophage activation to mitigate disease progression. Key points Peripheral immune suppression and pulmonary immune hyperactivation characterise the distinct immune landscapes in anti‐MDA5+DM with RP‐ILD. Circulating monocytes transition from an immunosuppressive phenotype in the periphery to proinflammatory and profibrotic Mo‐AMs in the lungs. Chemokines produced by Mo‐AMs drive monocyte and other immune cell recruitment to the lungs, amplifying pulmonary inflammation.">

Metabolic and immunologic dysfunction are archetypal findings in critically ill patients with sepsis, but whether these factors are mechanistically linked remains incompletely defined. We characterized functional metabolic properties of human CD4 T cells from critically ill patients with and without sepsis and healthy adults. CD4 T cells in critical illness showed increased subset-specific metabolic plasticity, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) acquiring glycolytic capacity that stabilized suppressive markers FOXP3 and TIGIT and correlated with clinical illness severity. Single-cell transcriptomics identified differential kynurenine metabolism in Tregs, which was validated ex vivo as a mechanism of Treg glycolytic adaptation and suppressive rewiring. These findings underscore immunometabolic dysfunction as a driver of CD4 T cell remodeling in sepsis and suggest therapeutic avenues to restore an effective immune response.">

        <tr id="Cells of the myeloid lineage, particularly monocytes and macrophages, play a key role in HIV infection by contributing to viral replication, immune response, and maintaining immune balance during suppressive therapy. We hypothesized that metabolic reprogramming and altered chemokine signaling in people living with HIV (PWH) on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) affect monocyte transport and polarization due to ongoing inflammation. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the mechanism of impaired monocyte/macrophage function in PWH on well-treated ART that can lead to clinical intervention strategies to improve health. Single-cell RNA sequencing, immune-phenotyping, and metabolic modeling identified altered expression of chemokine and metabolite receptors and altered metabolic flux in PWH monocytes that decreased monocyte migration. The plasma secretome revealed a nonclassical inflammatory microenvironment in PWH. Integrative multi-omics and single-cell proteomics of differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) detected metabolic reprogramming orchestrated by α-ketoglutarate (AKG) that affected macrophage function and HIV infection. Increased levels of AKG in plasma were shown to occur in PWH under ART. Therefore, when differentiating MDM with serum from PWH or AKG, macrophage function was found polarized towards an M2-like state. AKG alone was shown to increase CCR5 levels and increase HIV-1 infection in MDM. Here, we utilize systems biology-driven identification and ex vivo assays to show impaired macrophage polarization, due to metabolic training, can leads to a low-grade nonclassical inflammatory environment in well-treated PWH.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are critical mediators of antiviral immunity, yet their role in lymphoid tissues—key reservoirs of HIV persistence—remains poorly defined. Here, we uncover a distinct cytotoxic signature of tonsil-resident NK cells essential for targeting HIV-infected CD4⁺ T cells. Using a human tonsillar model of HIV infection and extracellular matrix-based functional assays, we identify a subset of NK cells co-expressing CD69, CD49a, CD103, and the adaptive marker NKG2C as potent effectors against autologous HIV-infected tissue CD4⁺ T cells. Both CD16⁺ and CD16⁻ NK subsets exhibited cytotoxic antiviral activity. However, HIV infection induced profound functional alterations in these NK cells, including dysregulated expression of CD9, TRAF2, ITGA1, suggesting disrupted activation, signaling, and tissue residency. Functional assays corroborated a significant impairment in the cytotoxic capacity, indicating HIV-driven NK cell dysfunction. Intriguingly, a subset of immature CD16⁻CD69⁺ NK cells underwent functional reprogramming, transitioning into a migration-competent, and metabolically primed state, driven by the upregulation of NUMAI, LCP1, SLC38A1, MT-ND2, NUMA1, MYH9, and CD44. Functional assays confirmed this transition, revealing changes in the expression of immune checkpoint receptors and a gain of cytotoxic function in these reprogrammed cells. These findings advance our understanding of NK cell biology in HIV infection and highlight novel avenues for NK-cell-based therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Haemophilus ducreyi causes the genital ulcer disease chancroid and cutaneous ulcers in children. To study its pathogenesis, we developed a human challenge model in which we infect the skin on the upper arm of human volunteers with H. ducreyi to the pustular stage of disease. The model has been used to define lesional architecture, describe the immune infiltrate into the infected sites using flow cytometry, and explore the molecular basis of the immune response using bulk RNA-seq. Here, we used single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics to simultaneously characterize multiple cell types within infected human skin and determine the cellular origin of differentially expressed transcripts that we had previously identified by bulk RNA-seq. We obtained paired biopsies of pustules and wounded (mock infected) sites from five volunteers for scRNA-seq. We identified 13 major cell types, including T- and NK-like cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, as well as other cell types typically found in the skin. Immune cell types were enriched in pustules, and some subtypes within the major cell types were exclusive to pustules. Sufficient tissue specimens for spatial transcriptomics were available from four of the volunteers. T- and NK-like cells were highly associated with multiple antigen presentation cell types. In pustules, type I interferon stimulation was high in areas that were high in antigen presentation—especially in macrophages near the abscess—compared to wounds. Together, our data provide a high-resolution view of the cellular immune response to the infection of the skin with a human pathogen. IMPORTANCE A high-resolution view of the immune infiltrate due to infection with an extracellular bacterial pathogen in human skin has not yet been defined. Here, we used the human skin pathogen Haemophilus ducreyi in a human challenge model to identify on a single cell level the types of cells that are present in volunteers who fail to spontaneously clear infection and form pustules. We identified 13 major cell types. Immune cells and immune-activated stromal cells were enriched in pustules compared to wounded (mock infected) sites. Pustules formed despite the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and type I interferon. Interferon stimulation was most evident in macrophages, which were proximal to the abscess. The pro-inflammatory response within the pustule may be tempered by regulatory T cells and cells that express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, leading to failure of the immune system to clear H. ducreyi.">

        <tr id="Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd), either due to inherited or somatic mutation, is prevalent in colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers. While anti-PD-1 therapy is utilized in both local and advanced disease, up to 50% of MMRd CRC fail to respond. Using animal and human models of MMRd, we determined that interactions between MHC+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and TCF+ BHLHE40+ PRF1+ T cell subsets are associated with control of MMRd tumor growth, during anti-PD-1 treatment. In contrast, resistance is associated with upregulation of TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, and PD-1 expression on T cells, and infiltration of the tumor with immunosuppressive TREM2+ macrophages and monocytes. By combining anti-PD-1 with anti-LAG3/CTLA4/TREM2, up to 100% tumor eradication was achieved in MMRd CRC and remarkably, in >70% in MMRp CRC. This study identifies key T cell and macrophage subsets mediating the efficacy of immunotherapy in overcoming immune escape in both MMRd and MMRp CRC settings. Highlights Anti-PD-1 therapy leads to the accumulation and colocalization of MHCI/II+ C1Q+ CXCL9+ macrophages and DCs with TCF+ CCL5+ T cells that have high TCR diversity. Resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy involves multiple T cell checkpoints, TREM2+ macrophages, IL1B+ TREM1+ monocytes and neutrophils, and IFITM+ tumor cells. Simultaneous blockade of PD-1, LAG3, CTLA-4 and TREM2 dramatically prevents progression of both MMRd and MMRp tumors. Combination therapy completely eliminates tumors by leveraging MHC+ macrophage, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell interactions, facilitating durable anti-tumor effects.">

        <tr id="Although IgA+ long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) generated following mucosal viral infection provide durable protection against reinfection, little is known about their generation. Here, we show that oral RV infection induces gut-resident LLPCs that produce highly mutated protective IgA. Unlike RV-specific IgG+ LLPCs, IgA+ LLPCs were generated independently of MHCII expression by dendritic cells – rather MHCII expression by B cells was both necessary and sufficient. B cell MHCII was also sufficient to induce a unique population of T-bet+ follicular helper T (TFH1) cells which were crucial for RV-specific IgA+ LLPC accumulation in the gut via IFNγ- and CXCR3-dependent mechanisms. Similar to RV infection, TFH1 cells were required for influenza-specific IgA response. However, unlike RV infection, B cell MHCII was not sufficient to induce influenza-specific IgA+ LLPCs, suggesting the operation of mucosal site-specific priming mechanisms. Collectively, our data reveal that unconventionally primed TFH1 cells support IgA responses to mucosal viral infections.">

        <tr id="Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is characterized by immune dysregulation that facilitates chronic infection. Objective: To investigate the role of T cells in the immunopathology of CL by characterizing the immune landscape of skin lesions using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods: We performed scRNA-seq to profile T cells from PBMC and skin lesions of CL patients. Results: We analyzed the transcriptional profile of distinct populations of CD4+ and CD8+ migratory T cells in CL lesions. CD8+ resident T cells displayed expression of exhaustion markers and were categorized into progenitor, transitional, and terminal stages, with HAVCR2 (TIM-3) identified as a potential driver of dysfunction. Compared to psoriasis and healthy skin, CL lesions showed a reduced frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), potentially linked to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased apoptosis. We also detected double-negative (DN) gd T cells, suggesting their potential role in antigen presentation via MHC class II through TGF-b signaling. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into immune evasion mechanisms in CL, identifying TIM-3, Treg modulation, and the functional role of DN gd T cells as distinct potential targets for future immunotherapies.">

However, under certain activation conditions, such as chronic viral infections or cancer, these cells may develop functional defects. In this study, we compared the functional quality of memory CD8 T cells generated following tumor rejection with those arising from an acute viral infection. We found that tumor-induced (Tum-CD8) memory cells exhibited a distinct phenotype and transcriptomic profile compared with viral-induced (Vir-CD8) memory cells. These memory cells are characterized by the expression of inhibitory receptors and displayed altered functions including reduced IFNγ and TNFα production as well as changes in integrin expression. Additionally, the protective capacity of Tum-CD8 memory cells was flawed relative to that of Vir-CD8 memory cells. Importantly, the functional defects of Tum-CD8 persisted upon viral recall. Together, these findings indicate that transient tumoral stimulation can imprint a stable partial exhaustion-like program on memory CD8 T cells.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are critical regulators of HIV immunity, but the mechanisms behind their expansion and value as a therapeutic target remain unclear. We investigated MDSC function in HIV using a humanized mouse model. Acute HIV-1 infection triggered the systemic expansion of polymorphonuclear MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs), with their frequency correlating positively with plasma viral load. Notably, PMN-MDSC expansion increased further when natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were depleted, suggesting these immune cells restrain MDSC proliferation. We identified Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis as a regulatory mechanism, as MDSCs expressed high levels of TRAIL receptor 2 (R2), while NK cells and CTLs upregulated TRAIL expression during HIV infection. Treating HIV-1-infected mice with a TRAIL-R2 agonist significantly reduced MDSC levels to those of uninfected mice and significantly improved NK cell and CTL immune function. Crucially, in viremic humanized mice, the treatment prevented CD4+ T cell loss, a hallmark of HIV-1 pathogenesis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) progression. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential of targeting MDSC apoptosis to mitigate CD4+ T cell depletion and enhance HIV-specific immunity, offering a new clinical target to prevent AIDS and insights into MDSC– NK/CTL cross-regulation during HIV-1 infection.">

        <tr id="Natural resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in some people with HIV (PWH) is unexplained. We performed single cell RNA-sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells, unstimulated or ex vivo stimulated with Mtb, for 7 PWH who were TST & IGRA positive (called LTBI) and 6 who were persistently TST & IGRA negative (called resisters). Alveolar macrophages (AM) from resisters displayed a baseline M1 macrophage phenotype while AM from LTBI did not. Resisters displayed alveolar lymphocytosis, with enrichment of all T cell subpopulations including IFNG-expressing cells. In both groups, mycobactericidal granulysin was expressed almost exclusively by a T cell subtype that co-expressed granzyme B, perforin and NK cell receptors. These poly-cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) over-expressed activating NK cell receptors and were increased in resister BAL. Following challenge with Mtb, only Intraepithelial Lymphocytes-like cells from LTBI participants responded with increased transcription of IFNG. AM from resisters responded with a stronger TNF signature at 6h post-infection while at 24h post-infection AM from LTBI displayed a stronger IFN-γ signature. Conversely, at 24h post-infection only AM from resisters displayed a significant upregulation of MICA transcripts which encode an activating ligand for poly-CTL. These results suggest that poly-CTL and AM mediate the resister phenotype in PWH.">

To identify potential targets for CLAD prevention, T cells from explanted CLAD lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes, as well as diseased and nondiseased controls were isolated and single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing were performed. TCR sequencing revealed a clonally expanded population of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) with high cytotoxic potential, including upregulation of KLRK1, encoding the co-receptor NKG2D. These cytotoxic CD8+ TRMs accumulated around the CLAD airways and had a 100-fold increase in clonal overlap with lung-draining lymph nodes when compared with non-CLAD lungs. Using a murine model of orthotopic lung transplantation, we confirmed that cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation was due to chronic rejection and not transplantation alone. Furthermore, blocking NKG2D in vivo attenuated the airway remodeling following transplantation and diminished airway accumulation of CD8+ T cells. Our findings support NKG2D as a potential therapeutic target for CLAD, affecting cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T (Treg) cells contribute to solid organ cancer progression, except in colorectal cancer (CRC) despite being abundantly present. Here, we demonstrate that two distinct tumoral IL-10⁺ and IL-10⁻ Treg cell subsets exert opposing functions by counteracting and promoting CRC tumor growth, respectively. The tumor restraining activity of IL-10⁺ Treg cells was mediated by their suppression of effector CD4 T cell production of IL-17, which directly stimulates CRC tumor cell proliferation. Consistently, IL-10⁻ Treg cells were more abundant in both mouse and human CRC tumors than in tumor-adjacent normal tissues, whereas IL-10+ Treg cells exhibited the opposite distribution. Furthermore, relative abundance of IL-10⁺ and IL-10⁻ Treg cells correlated with better and worse disease prognoses in human CRC, respectively. This functional dichotomy between Treg cell subsets provides a rationale for therapeutic strategies to selectively target pro-tumoral Treg cells while preserving their anti-tumoral counterparts across barrier tissue cancers that harbor both subsets.">

        <tr id="Introduction Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia remains a major contributor to clinical complications in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, including organ injury, morbidity and mortality. Given their critical role in antiviral defense, CD8+ T cells are essential for protective immunity against CMV. Methods Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated the transcriptional signatures and developmental lineages of CD8+ T cells in eight immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who received organs from CMV-seropositive donors. Results were validated in a cohort of 62 KTRs using immunophenotyping. Results Our data revealed a significant influence of CMV serostatus on transcriptional variance of CD8+ memory T cells, associating with the first principal component from a global analysis of CD8+ T cells (p =0.0406), forming a continuum with five principal differentiation trajectories driven by CMV primary infection or reactivation. Following CMV primary infection, CD8+ T cells were hallmarked by restrained effector-memory differentiation. CD8+ T cells during CMV reactivation diverged non-linearly into senescent-like cells with signatures of arrested cell cycle, diminished translational activity and downregulated ZNF683 and longitudinally expanding effector cells with robust cytotoxic potential and upregulated ZNF683, acting as a reservoir for long-lived effector cells supporting long-term protection. Notably, CD28lo KLRG1hi IL-7R (CD127)lo HLA-DRhi CD8+ T cells present prior to the detection of viremia in CMV-seropositive patients emerged as a key feature distinguishing patients who did or did not undergo CMV reactivation after prophylaxis discontinuation (p =0.0163). Frequencies of these cells were also positively correlated with CMV-stimulated secretion of IFN-γ (p =0.0494), TNF-α (p =0.0358), MIP-1α (p =0.0262), MIP-1β (p =0.0043). Discussion These results provide insights into the transcriptional regulation that influences the generation of CD8+ T cell immunity to CMV and may inform strategics for monitoring host immune response to CMV to better identify and introduce therapeutic intervention to patients at risk of developing clinically significant CMV viremia.">

        <tr id="Durable T cell immunity against cancer depends on the continual replenishment of effector CD8+ T cells. Thymic output has been correlated with favorable prognosis in cancer patients across a range of ages, suggesting that the thymus is an important source for replenishing T cells capable of controlling cancer progression. However, the effector potential of thymic mature CD8+ T cells and their regulation have not been clearly defined. In this study, we identified the ability of thymic single positive CD8+ T cells to gain effector potential after thymic selection, but they are subject to the regulation of PD-1. We found a previously undisclosed role of PD-1 in limiting both the cytotoxic and exhaustion potential of thymic and peripheral CD8+ T cells. Our results show that although PD-1 inhibition facilitates the expansion of effector CD8+ T cells, effector CD8+ cells gradually lose their antitumor activity within tumor tissues due to advanced exhaustion in the absence of PD-1. Thus, although the preset effector potential in thymic mature CD8+ T cells allows them to rapidly respond to malignant cells in the periphery, PD-1, as a checkpoint, is embedded in the thymic mature CD8+ T cells after positive selection to balance their effector function from exaggeration and exhaustion. Therefore, we propose that a strategy capable of upholding the cytotoxic capacity and avoiding exhaustion of CD8+ T cells during the early stages of PD-1 inhibition therapy is needed to achieve durable antitumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Memory CD8 T cells play a vital role in providing lasting immune protection, yet their origins remain incompletely understood. Contrary to classical models, emerging evidence suggests that heterogeneity within the naïve T cell pool may influence fate decisions prior to antigen encounter. However, the markers of naïve T cell heterogeneity have not yet been clearly defined. Here, we describe intraclonal heterogeneity within the naïve T cell population marked by the protein Dapl1. Using novel monoclonal antibodies and a reporter-knockout mouse model, we found that Dapl1-positive naïve CD8 T cells exhibit distinct phenotypes compared to their Dapl1-negative counterparts. Furthermore, this population includes a subset of pre-programmed precursors biased toward memory lineage fate. The differentiation of these precursors is independent of Dapl1 but relies on the transcription factor Bcl11b, resulting in the generation of Dapl1-positive central memory-like CD8 T cells in response to infection, and stem-like memory cells in response to cancer. Notably, naïve Dapl1-positive T cells originate among mature thymocytes and gradually appear in the periphery within several days after birth. Our findings suggest that committed memory precursors in the Dapl1-positive population may represent an alternative pathway for memory CD8 T cell generation, offering new avenues for therapeutic application.

Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1-/- mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1-/- animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng-/- mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1-/- animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal 5-year survival rate of only 10% in the United States. While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown efficacy in many solid tumors, PDAC remains largely unresponsive. Agonistic CD40 antibodies can activate PDAC-associated myeloid cells, enhancing innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity. However, clinical trials with agonistic CD40 antibodies have demonstrated only modest efficacy and significant hepatotoxicity. We previously reported that IL-1 pathway blockade enhances CD40 agonist efficacy against melanoma by depleting polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs; CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G+). Since PMN-MDSCs also cause liver toxicity. This study investigates the impact of IL-1R1 blockade on the efficacy and toxicity of CD40 agonist therapy in PDAC. We found that treatment with an agonistic CD40 antibody induced immune activation and significantly prolonged survival in orthotopic PDAC-bearing mice. The transcriptomic profile revealed that IL-1R1 blockade as monotherapy downregulated innate and adaptive immune response and exacerbated tumor growth. However, the combination therapy of agonistic CD40 antibody and IL-1R1 blockade upregulated several immune-related pathways (GO enrichment analysis), including JAK-STAT signaling, antigen processing, and presentation, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, boosted innate and adaptive immune responses, compared to CD40 agonist treatment alone. Paradoxically, despite these immunostimulatory effects, IL-1R1 blockade failed to improve the overall anti-tumor efficacy of CD40 agonist therapy and exacerbated liver toxicity. Liver toxicity was assessed by serum ALT and AST levels, and transcriptomic profiling of the liver revealed several pathways related to immune infiltration, liver metabolism, viral carcinogenesis and alcoholic liver disease were associated with hepatotoxicity. To further investigate the role of PMN-MDSCs in PDAC and understand the failure of anti-IL-1R1 therapy, we depleted these cells using an anti-Ly6G antibody in mice treated with an agonistic CD40 antibody. Unexpectedly, Ly6G depletion reduced the efficacy of CD40 agonist therapy, suggesting that, contrary to expectations, Ly6G+ immune cells (PMN-MDSCs or neutrophils) exhibit an anti-tumor rather than an immunosuppressive role in PDAC. Our findings underscore the complex role of IL-1 signaling in modulating immune responses in PDAC and caution against pursuing IL-1R1 blockade, either as a monotherapy or in combination with CD40 agonist antibodies, in future clinical trials for PDAC.">

        <tr id="It is estimated that two billion people are latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Latent Mtb infection (LTBI) can occur in multiple organs, including the lymphatics. The risk of LTBI reactivation increases in immunocompromised conditions, such as coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and during treatment of autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation. The immunological correlates of protection against TB, including against reactivation of LTBI, remain largely elusive. Here, we used a mouse model of latent lymphatic Mtb infection to dissect the immunological mechanisms underlying LTBI containment versus reactivation. We show that immunosuppression-mediated reactivation of lymphatic LTBI and the subsequent spread to non-lymphatic organs can be prevented by vaccination with multiple recombinant BCG (rBCG) strains despite the deficiency of CD4+ T cells. Using spatial transcriptomics, multi-parameter imaging, network analysis and bioinformatic integration of histopathological images, we reveal that immunosuppression is associated with a distinct repositioning of non-CD4 immune cells at the edge of TB lesions within the infection-draining cervical lymph nodes. While B cells increased in numbers, they are dispensable for the containment of LTBI. Lymphatic Mtb infection in different immune cell-deficient mouse strains, antibody-mediated cell depletion and adoptive transfer experiments into highly susceptible mice unequivocally show that vaccination-mediated prevention of LTBI reactivation is critically dependent on CD8+ T cells. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of immunity to TB and the management of LTBI. Graphical Abstract">

We elaborate on the precise mechanisms by which memory cells contribute to autoimmune diseases, highlighting insights from current research on how pathogenic memory responses are formed and sustained in autoimmunity. Finally, we explore potential therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating memory cells to prevent or treat autoimmune disorders, including B cell-depleting therapies (e.g., Rituximab), T cell-targeting agents (e.g., Abatacept), and cytokine inhibitors (e.g., IL-17 or IL-23 blockers) that are currently used in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis.">

Using a mouse model of chronic autoinflammatory disease, we demonstrated the presence of extramedullary HSCs in blood, spleen, and inflamed tails and paws. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed a unique expression profile in extramedullary HSCs, with significant upregulation of Cd53, MHCII-associated, and immunosuppressive genes. We further demonstrated that extramedullary CD53+ HSCs act as antigen-presenting cells, promoting the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to control chronic inflammation at extramedullary sites. Conversely, Tregs exert a protective role on extramedullary HSCs.

        <tr id="Uncertainty persists regarding the contribution of tissue macrophages to HIV reservoirs, largely due to insufficient characterization of these reservoirs within their native tissue microenvironments. This study aimed to characterize and quantify macrophage reservoirs in human lymph node (LN) tissues in terms of their phenotype, location, and their potential for sustained productive infection during suppressive antiretroviral therapy. We examined the topology, nature, and size of macrophage reservoirs in lymph nodes (LNs) from 45 PLWH subtype C on suppressive ART and 14 matched controls using in situ imaging and multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy. Germinal center CD68+ macrophages harbored HIV gag-pol DNA, HIV gag-pol RNA and Gagp24 protein. Digital droplet PCR confirmed the presence of proviral reservoirs in myeloid cells within LNs. High-resolution imaging techniques revealed that infected macrophages within GCs displayed distinct morphological characteristics, featuring larger and irregular shapes. In contrast, phagocytic macrophages exhibited intracellular staining for CD4+ T cells, had regular shapes, and were predominantly found outside the GCs. Our findings provide detailed quantitative, spatial, and phenotypic characterization of macrophage reservoirs in LNs, offering a clear estimation of the extent to which macrophages contribute to persistent HIV reservoirs in these tissues. These findings establish a basis for developing targeted strategies aimed at the elimination of these reservoirs in LN tissues. Author summary HIV hides in reservoirs within immune cells across the body in the blood and various tissues, making it a complex challenge to cure. Therefore, it is essential to identify and understand all sources of HIV reservoirs aid the development of an HIV cure. Macrophages are increasingly recognized as key contributors of viral reservoir persistence. However, the role of macrophages as latent HIV reservoirs remains unclear due to limited studies in human tissues. In this study we investigated macrophage reservoirs in human lymph nodes to answer key questions: where do they hide, how can we identify them, what is their contribution to the lymph node reservoir burden, and are they truly able to support productive viral replication? We found that macrophages residing within lymph node germinal centers, identified by CD68 expression, contained HIV DNA, RNA, and Gagp24 protein. Moreover, using high resolution microscopy, we were able to distinguish between productively infected macrophages from those that engulfed T cells. By unveiling these unique features of macrophage reservoirs, our research paves the way for the design of targeted therapy aimed at eliminating these reservoirs, towards an HIV cure.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, especially in advanced stages where limited treatment options result in poor prognosis. The immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), characterized by low immune cell infiltration and exhaustion, limits immunotherapy efficacy. To address this, our study investigates the role of C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) in modulating the HCC TIME. Methods We analyzed CCL3 expression in human HCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, focusing on its correlation with inflammatory gene signatures and immune cell infiltration. High-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), flow cytometry, and multiplex immunofluorescence were used to investigate CCL3’s effects on macrophage function and T cell activation. The biological impact of CCL3 on macrophages was assessed using co-culture systems, confocal imaging, metabolite detection, and inhibition assays. Preclinical HCC models and ex vivo tumor fragment assays further explored how CCL3 modulates immune responses and enhances immune checkpoint blockade efficacy. Results Our study shows that CCL3 is suppressed in the tumor microenvironment and positively correlates with immune infiltration and inflammatory responses. Targeted liver delivery of rAAV-Ccl3 reprograms the immune microenvironment in HCC, promoting immune cell recruitment and tertiary lymphoid structure formation, thus suppressing tumor growth via immune engagement. Through scRNA-seq, flow cytometry, and multiplex immunofluorescence, we found that CCL3 enhances macrophage antigen uptake and activates cytotoxic T cells. In vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed that CCL3 facilitates T cell infiltration and upregulates MHC II expression on macrophages, enhancing antigen presentation. The CCL3-CCR5 pathway also boosts macrophage metabolism, increasing lysosomal activity and antigen uptake, thereby strengthening adaptive immune responses and increasing sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade therapies in preclinical models. Conclusions This study highlights the pivotal role of CCL3 in reshaping the TIME and enhancing antitumor immunity in HCC. By promoting immune cell recruitment and enhancing antigen presentation, CCL3 demonstrates significant potential to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy, particularly in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Targeting CCL3 may help to overcome the immunosuppressive TIME in HCC and improve patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge, particularly in the context of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Host-directed therapies (HDTs) have been proposed as adjunctive therapy to enhance immune control of infection. Recently, one such HDT, pharmacologic modulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), has been proposed to treat MDR-TB. While MDSCs have been well characterized in cancer, their role in TB pathogenesis remains unclear. To investigate whether MDSCs or other myeloid suppressor populations contribute to TB granuloma microenvironments (GME), we performed spatial transcriptional profiling and single-cell immunophenotyping on eighty-four granulomas in lung specimens from three individuals with active disease. Granulomas were histologically classified based on H&E staining, and transcriptional signatures were compared across regions of interest (ROIs) at different states of granuloma maturation. Our analysis revealed that immune suppression within granuloma was not primarily driven by classical MDSCs but rather by multiple myeloid cell subsets, including dendritic cells expressing indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase-1 expressing (IDO1+ DCs). IDO1+ DCs were the most frequently observed suppressive myeloid cells, particularly in cellular regions, and their spatial proximity to activated T cells suggested localized immunosuppression. Importantly, granulomas at different stages contained distinct proportions of suppressor myeloid cells, with necrotic and cellular regions showing different myeloid phenotypes that may influence granuloma progression. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further indicated that elevated IDO1 expression was associated with a complex immune response that balanced suppressive signaling, immune activation, and cellular metabolism. These findings suggest that classical MDSCs, as defined in tumor microenvironments, likely play a minor role in TB, whereas IDO1+ DCs may be key regulators of immune suppression in granulomas influencing local Mtb control in infected lung. A deeper understanding of the role of IDO1+ suppressive myeloid cells in TB granulomas is essential to assessing their potential as therapeutic targets in TB treatment.">

        <tr id="LAIR1 is an inhibitory receptor broadly expressed on human immune cells, including B cells. LAIR1 has been shown to modulate BCR signaling, however, it is still unclear whether its suppressive activity can be a negative regulator for autoreactivity. In this study, we demonstrate the LAIR1 expression profile on human B cells and prove its regulatory function and relationships to B cell autoreactivity. We show that both the frequency and level of LAIR1 expression decreases during B cell differentiation. LAIR1 expressing (LAIR1+) switched memory (SWM) B cells have a transcriptional profile less differentiated toward a plasma cell (PC) phenotype, harbor more autoreactive B cells and exhibit less PC differentiation in vitro than the LAIR1 negative (LAIR1-) counterpart. These data suggests that LAIR1 functions as a B cell tolerance checkpoint. We confirm previous data showing that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) express less LAIR1 on B cells, implying a breakdown of the checkpoint, consistent with the enhanced PC differentiation seen in SLE. We further demonstrate that LAIR1 expression is down-regulated through the IL-21/STAT3 pathway which is known to be upregulated in SLE. These data suggest therapeutic targets that might decrease the aberrant PC differentiation observed in SLE.">

        <tr id="Suppressive myeloid cells play a central role in cancer escape from anti-tumor immunity. Beyond their immunosuppressive function, these cells are capable of exerting multiple other pro-tumoral activities, including the promotion of cancer cell survival, invasion and metastasis. The ability of some myeloid subsets to induce cancer stemness has recently emerged. Here we demonstrated that human immunosuppressive myeloid cells, generated in vitro or isolated from breast cancer patients, promoted the acquisition of mesenchymal-like breast cancer stemness properties. This cancer-stemness-inducing function was restricted to a myeloid subset expressing the glycoprotein CD52. Single cell transcriptomic- and surface proteome-based interactome analysis pointed towards membrane-bound TGF-β1 as a potential factor involved in cancer stemness induction. Functional inhibition of the TGF-β1 pathway blocked the emergence of cancer stem cells induced by suppressive myeloid cells. These results therefore identified the underlying mechanisms of a new tumor-promoting function of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, which may potentially be targeted.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how B cell depleting therapies modulate the immune landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16+ monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. This was accompanied by increases in TNFα messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNFα treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion induced changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT+ regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4+ T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different cell-type specific reprogramming as a result of B cell depletion treatment in MS.">

Why immunity fails after initially controlling infection is unknown. C57BL/6 mice control Mycobacterium tuberculosis for up to a year but ultimately succumb to disease. We hypothesize that the development of CD4 T cell dysfunction permits bacterial recrudescence. We developed a reductionist model to assess antigen-specific T cells during chronic infection and found evidence of CD4 T cell senescence and exhaustion. In C57BL/6 mice, CD4 T cells upregulate coinhibitory receptors and lose effector cytokine production. Single cell RNAseq shows that only a small number of CD4 T cells in the lungs of chronically infected mice are polyfunctional. While the origin and causal relationship between T- cell dysfunction and recrudescence remains uncertain, we propose T cell dysfunction leads to a feed-forward loop that causes increased bacillary numbers, greater T cell dysfunction, and progressive disease.">

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by recurrent inflammatory relapses and neurodegeneration. Myeloid cells play a critical role in shaping the inflammatory environment and influencing disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that activation of the Wnt signaling pathway reprograms myeloid cells into an immunoregulatory phenotype, leading to reduced neuroinflammation and disease severity. Using both experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and human-derived myeloid cells, we show that Wnt agonist treatment promotes the expression of inhibitory molecules such as PD-L1 and PD-L2, suppressing pro-inflammatory responses. In the chronic and relapsing-remitting EAE models, Wnt activation significantly reduced disease severity, immune cell infiltration into the CNS, and pathogenic T cell responses. Notably, in relapsing-remitting EAE, Wnt treatment prevented new relapses in a PD-L1–dependent manner, highlighting the crucial role of myeloid cell–mediated immune regulation. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for Wnt signaling in myeloid cell immunoregulation and suggest that targeting this pathway could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for MS and other autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is a debilitating pulmonary disorder that occurs due to persistent exposure to beryllium (Be) particles in the workplace. Be-exposure causes activation of the innate immune system, resulting in the secretion of interleukins and chemokines that drive the accumulation of B and T cells in the lungs. However, the mechanisms by which innate molecules influence the recruitment of B cells and B cell-mediated protection in CBD are poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiple approaches to examine the role of innate immune signaling and CD4+ T cells in B cell recruitment and function in the lungs. We show that the absence or blocking of IL-1R1 signaling prevents the recruitment of B cells to the lungs of BeO-exposed mice. Additionally, we show that B cell recruitment to the lungs depends on the chemokine receptor, CXCR5, and CD4+ T cells. In BeO-exposed mice, lung B cells down-regulate IgM but showed an increased IgD and CD44 surface expression. Further, RNA sequencing of pulmonary tissue-specific B cells in CBD revealed distinct gene signatures compared to splenic B cells, with increased expression of pathways involved in antigen presentation, tight junction interactions, and interferon signaling. Overall, our study shows that B cell recruitment and aggregate formation during CBD depend on sequential activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.">

        <tr id="A key mechanism of immune escape from CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor control occurs via downregulation of NLRC5, the IFNγ-induced transcriptional activator of MHC class-I. As NLRC5 deficiency does not abrogate CD8+ T cell development, we investigated whether NLRC5-dependent antitumor immune mechanisms are required for immune surveillance. Development of 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced endogenous fibrosarcoma was studied in Nlrc5-/- mice with Nlrc5+/+ and Rag1-/- mice serving as controls. Nlrc5-/- and Rag1-/- mice showed increased propensity to develop MCA-induced tumors with elevated growth rate compared to Nlrc5+/+ mice, and displayed significantly reduced survival. Tumors from Nlrc5+/+ and Nlrc5-/-mice, but not from Rag1-/- mice, contained necrotic areas and displayed T cell infiltration. Tumor cell lines established from MCA- induced tumors were evaluated for their sensitivity to immune-mediated growth control following implantation into immunocompetent C57BL/6 and immunodeficient Rag1-/- hosts. Tumors formed by Nlrc5+/+ tumor cell lines progressed unhindered in C57BL/6 hosts that reflected their immunoedited status, whereas cell lines from Nlrc5-/- and Rag1-/-tumors were efficiently controlled, indicating their non-immunoedited status. Proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry followed by pathway analysis revealed enrichment of granzyme-mediated cytolytic pathway in Nlrc5+/+ tumors that were absent in Nlrc5-/- tumors, which showed enrichment of humoral and innate immune pathways. Overall, our findings show that NLRC5 is required for robust tumor immune surveillance and tumor immunoediting and that compensatory humoral and innate immune mechanisms activated by the loss of NLRC5 are insufficient for cancer immune surveillance and cancer immunoediting.">

Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are bone marrow (BM)-derived cells with potent suppressive properties, implicated in T cell inhibition and tumour dissemination. In Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), circulating MDSCs constitute the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, while the contribution of BM MDSCs in disease pathogenesis remains elusive. In the present study we aimed to evaluate both the frequencies as well as the molecular signatures of MDSCs in blood and BM from newly diagnosed DLBCL patients prior to treatment initiation and from age matched healthy donors. Circulating levels of total, monocytic (M-) and polymorphonuclear (PMN-) MDSCs were found increased in DLBCL compared to healthy control, while in DLBCL patients the BM MDSCs were significantly increased compared to blood. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significantly different molecular fingerprints to characterize circulating and BM M-MDSCs, implying that MDSCs exhibit their function with distinct mechanisms depending on the anatomical compartment. Despite that MDSC frequencies did not demonstrate any significant correlation with disease characteristics and outcome, our findings propose that gene expression profiling should be evaluated for their potential prognostic impact. Overall, the findings presented here, provide new insights in the immunosuppressive networks that operate in DLBCL and importantly propose new molecular mechanisms expressed by BM MDSCs which may be explored therapeutically.">

        <tr id="Cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes (CTL) are crucial in antiviral immune responses. However, their recruitment to infection sites renders them at risk of viral infection that could modulate their effector activity. CTL express RIG-I that detects cytosolic viral RNA and subsequently induce antiviral gene expression. Here, we investigated how influenza A virus (IAV) infection influence TCR-dependent effector responses. IAV infection of CTL stimulated RIG-I, and activated downstream pathways including TBK1 and NF-⍰B, resulting in type-I interferon secretion. Transfection of CTL with a pure RIG-I ligand, tri-phosphorylated double stranded RNA(3p-dsRNA), not only stimulated these pathways but also enhanced CTL proliferation in vitro and protected them from IAV infection. Analogous with a positive effect on CD8 effector function, both IAV infection and RIG-I ligand transfection enhanced CTL degranulation and cytokine secretion. Conversely, activation of CTL via CD3/CD28-crosslinking increased their susceptibility to IAV infection. Altogether, RIG-I stimulation either by IAV infection or 3p-dsRNA transfection promoted cell intrinsic antiviral pathways and enhanced CD8 effector functions. These findings suggest that RIG-I agonists could enhance and prolong CTL effector function in immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are capable of mounting an adequate antimicrobial inflammatory response to pathogens while tolerating commensals. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of immune sensitivity remain incompletely understood, particularly in the context of human IECs. To enhance our understanding of the immune response of IECs to bacterial epithelial barrier breach, we investigated whether epithelial responsiveness is contingent on cell identity and cell polarization. We exposed human intestinal organoids to bacterial antigens to study their immune responses. Notable discrepancies were observed in the specific reactions exhibited by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enterocytes. It was determined that basolateral exposure of IECs to bacterial antigens resulted in a robust response, whereas apical exposure elicited a significantly more modest response. We identified ISCs as the responders, while the reaction of enterocytes was found to be attenuated. The regulation of bacterial responsiveness in enterocytes occurs at multiple levels, including the modulation of NFκB activation and post-transcriptional control of mRNA stability. Our findings demonstrate that differentiated non-responsive enterocytes can be sensitized to bacterial antigens through the activation of the WNT pathway. These findings extend the crucial role of WNT signaling for intestinal epithelial homeostasis and regulation of stem cell maintenance, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue architecture in the gut. Additionally, they reveal a new function of WNT signaling in regulating microbial responses within the intestinal environment.">

The immense potential MSC-EVs hold as tumour-targeted therapeutics warrants an understanding of potential adverse events to support clinical translation. This study aimed to determine whether MSC-EVs would elicit an immune response following administration in tumour-bearing immunocompetent animals. Secreted EVs were isolated from both human and murine bone marrow derived MSCs and characterized. hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs were administered intravenously into 4T1 breast tumour-bearing Balb/c mice or healthy controls. Tumour tissue, draining lymph nodes and spleens were harvested, dissociated into a single cell suspension and flow cytometry performed targeting T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The 4T1 model immune profile was first determined by comparing the spleen of tumour-bearing animals to healthy controls. T cells were increased in tumour-bearing animals (CD4+/CD25+ p=0.041; CD8+/CD25+ p=0.02). A significant elevation of GR-1+ MDSCs (p=0.002), CD11b+ macrophages (p=0.023) and CD11c+ dendritic cells (p=0.001) was also observed. In contrast, CD27+ NK cells were significantly decreased compared to the spleen of healthy animals (p=0.006). Collectively this data validated the immune profile and supported the determination of any changes in response to hMSC-EVs or mMSC-EVs administration. No significant activation of CD4+ (p=0.20) or CD8+ (p=0.57) T cells were seen in tumour tissue in both groups. The percentage of GR-1+ MDSCs (28% vs 27%, p=0.92), CD11b+, CD11c+ and CD27+ cells were similar regardless of EV origin. No significant changes in T cells, MDSCs, macrophages, dendritic or NK cells were observed in the lymph node or spleen of animals that received hMSC-EV versus mMSC-EVs. In conclusion, human MSC-EVs elicited no discernible immune response in mice, supporting the hypothesis that MSC-EVs retain the immune privilege of the secretory cell. This reinforces the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs.">

        <tr id="Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is considered a Th1-mediated disease, supported by the over-expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in the intestinal lamina propria. To evaluate the response of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to IFN-γ, we established small intestinal organoids (enteroids) derived from non-IBD controls and CD patients. IFN-γ stimulated programmed cell death (PCD) of IECs in both control and CD enteroids in a dose-dependent manner. Pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis were activated in enteroids, suggesting that PANoptosis was the main process of IFN-γ-induced PCD in IECs. The response to IFN-γ depends on the cell type of the IECs. IFN-γ induced depletion of enterocytes with upregulation of PANoptosis-associated genes, while leading to expansion of goblet cells without significant change in PANoptosis-associated gene expression. Individual PCD inhibitors were insufficient to block IFN-γ-induced cytotoxicity, whereas the selective JAK1 inhibitor (upadacitinib) effectively blocked IFN-γ-induced cytotoxicity and PANoptosis. Furthermore, PANoptosis was significantly activated in surgically resected tissues and in publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of intestinal tissues from patients with CD. In conclusion, IFN-γ induces PANoptosis in enterocytes, which can be treated with a selective JAK1 inhibitor in patients with CD.">

        <tr id="Invariant Natural Killer T (NKT) cells represent a unique subset of innate-like T cells that express both NK cell and T cell receptors. These cells are rapidly activated by glycolipid antigens presented via CD1d molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages, or through cytokine-dependent mechanisms. Their ability to produce a wide range of cytokines and express costimulatory molecules underscores their critical role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity. B cells, traditionally recognized for their role in antibody production, also act as potent APCs due to their high expression of CD1d, enabling direct interactions with iNKT cells. This interaction has significant implications for humoral immunity, influencing B cell activation, class-switch recombination (CSR), germinal center formation, and memory B cell differentiation, thus expanding the conventional paradigm of T cell–B cell interactions. While the influence of iNKT cells on B cell biology and humoral responses is well-supported, many aspects of their interaction remain unresolved. Key questions include the roles of different iNKT cell subsets, the diversity of APCs, the spatiotemporal dynamics of these interactions, especially during early activation, and the potential for distinct glycolipid ligands to modulate immune outcomes. Understanding these factors could provide valuable insights into how iNKT cells regulate B cell-mediated immunity and offer opportunities to harness these interactions in immunotherapeutic applications, such as vaccine development. In this review, we examine these unresolved aspects and propose a novel perspective on the regulatory potential of iNKT cells in humoral immunity, emphasizing their promise as a target for innovative vaccine strategies.">

        <tr id="Staphylococcus aureus poses an enormous burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Making an efficacious vaccine has however proven extremely challenging. Due to colonizing interactions, pre-existing S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells are often found in the human population and yet a detailed characterization of their phenotypes and how they might in turn impact vaccine efficacy are thus far unknown. Using an activation induced marker assay to sort for S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells in an effector function-independent manner, single cell transcriptomic analysis was conducted. Remarkably, S. aureus-specific CD4+ T cells consisted not only of a broader spectrum of conventional T cells (Tcon) than previously described but also of regulatory T cells (Treg). As compared to polyclonally-activated CD4+ T cells, S. aureus-specific Tcon were enriched for the expression of the Th17-type cytokine genes IL17A, IL22 and IL26, while higher percentages of S. aureus-specific Treg expressed the T Cell Immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), a pleiotropic immune checkpoint. Notably, the antagonistic anti-TIGIT mAb Tiragolumab increased IL-1β production in response to S. aureus in vitro. Therefore, these results uncover the presence of S. aureus-specific TIGIT+ Treg in the blood of healthy subjects that could blunt responses to vaccination and indicate TIGIT as a potential targetable biomarker to overcome pre-exposure-induced immunosuppression.">

For this reason, recent therapeutic algorithms include immunotherapeutic agents that target such cell populations for the treatment of patients with a variety of solid tumors. In contrast to solid tumors, such immunotherapeutic strategies failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this reason, the study of immunophenotypic and molecular changes in cytotoxic effector cell populations in patients with such disorders would provide the necessary evidence for the development of novel immunotherapies. In this review, we provide an overview of experimental studies describing the modulation of CD8+ T cell populations in patients with myeloid neoplasms, focusing on whether and how specific cell phenotypes are linked to disease progression and treatment.">

        <tr id="The current approach to minimize transplant-associated complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) includes long-term pharmacological immune suppression frequently accompanied by unwanted side effects. Advances in targeted immunotherapies regulating alloantigen responses in the recipient continue to reduce the need for pan-immunosuppression. Here, in vivo targeting of the TNF superfamily receptor 25 (TNFRSF25) and the high affinity IL-2 receptor with a TL1A-Ig fusion protein and low dose IL-2, respectively, was used to pretreat recipient mice prior to allogeneic-HSCT (aHSCT). Pretreatment induced Treg expansion persisting early post-aHSCT leading to diminished GVHD and improved transplant outcomes. Expansion was accompanied by an increase in frequency of stable and functionally active Tregs as evidenced by in vitro assays using cells from major GVHD target tissues including colon, liver, and eye. Importantly, pretreatment supported epithelial cell function/integrity, a diverse microbiome including reduction of pathologic bacteria overgrowth and promotion of butyrate producing bacteria, while maintaining physiologic levels of obligate/facultative anaerobes. Notably, using a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor agonist to sequester T cells in lymphoid tissues, we found that the increased tissue Treg frequency included resident CD69+CD103+FoxP3+ hepatic Tregs. In contrast to infusion of donor Treg cells, the strategy developed here resulted in the presence of immunosuppressive target tissue environments in the recipient prior to the receipt of donor allo-reactive T cells and successful perseveration of GVL responses. We posit strategies that circumvent the need of producing large numbers of ex-vivo manipulated Tregs, may be accomplished through in vivo recipient Treg expansion, providing translational approaches to improve aHSCT outcomes.

        <tr id="T cells play diverse roles in cancer immunology, acting as tumor suppressors, cytotoxic effectors, enhancers of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and immune suppressors; providing memory and surveillance; modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME); or activating innate immune cells. However, cancer cells can disrupt T cell function, leading to T cell exhaustion and a weakened immune response against the tumor. The expression of exhausted T cell (Tex) markers plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune landscape of multiple cancers. Our aim was to systematically investigate the role of known T cell exhaustion (Tex) markers across multiple cancers while exploring their molecular interactions, mutation profiles, and potential implications for immunotherapy. The mRNA expression profile of six Tex markers, LAG-3, PDCD1, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CXCL13, and LAYN was investigated in pan-cancer. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), and other repositories, we characterized the differential expression of the Tex markers, their association with the patients’ survival outcome, and their mutation profile in multiple cancers. Additionally, we analyzed the effects on cancer-related pathways and immune infiltration within the TME, offering valuable insights into mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and progression. Finally, the correlation between their expression and sensitivity to multiple anti-cancer drugs was investigated extensively. Differential expression of all six markers was significantly associated with KIRC and poor prognosis in several cancers. They also played a potential activating role in apoptosis, EMT, and hormone ER pathways, as well as a potential inhibitory role in the DNA damage response and RTK oncogenic pathways. Infiltration of different immune cells was also found to be associated with the expression of the Tex-related genes in most cancer types. These findings underline that the reviving of exhausted T cells can be used to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="The discovery of immune checkpoints and the rapid growth of immuno-oncology (IO) have sparked tremendous efforts to utilize the immune system to treat a wide range of cancer types/subtypes. While the major focus of IO over the past decades has been to manipulate the adaptive immune system, recent attention has been given to manipulating the innate immune system to treat cancer and/or to enhance adaptive responses. In this work we detail the intracellular protein, Dual Specificity Phosphatase 11 (DUSP11), as an innate immune checkpoint (iIC) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Expression of this atypical phosphatase is correlated with patient survival for multiple cancer types, and we show here that its activity is important for the viability of lung cancer cells in vitro. Specifically, we demonstrate that DUSP11 knockdown in LUAD cells induces apoptosis and an innate immune response capable of activating other cells in vitro, and we provide evidence that these phenotypes are primarily mediated by the pattern recognition receptor, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I). Finally, we show that expression of DUSP11 is important for tumor engraftment and growth of human LUAD in mice. Overall, these data are the first to establish DUSP11 as an immunosuppressive, pro-neoplastic, and potentially targetable protein in LUAD. In addition, our data suggests that the anti-cancer mechanisms induced by diminishing the activity of DUSP11 are likely to be generalizable to other cancer types such as breast cancer, warranting future investigation and therapeutic development.">

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

Here, we developed tissue models of HIV latency using human tonsillar, intestinal and cervicovaginal tissues. These models revealed differential HIV infection across CD4+ T cell subpopulations, with ART partially restoring CD4+ T cells and reducing intact HIV DNA. T follicular helper cells (TFH CD69+ CCR7-) were the primary inducible reservoir in tonsils, while tissue-resident memory cells (TRM CD69+ CD49a+) dominated in the intestine. Identification of markers for inducible reservoirs revealed that CD69, CD45RO, and PD-1 were shared across tissues, while CXCR5 in the tonsils and CD49a in the intestine served as tissue-specific markers. Furthermore, using different latency reversal agents (LRAs) we found that Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDACis) failed to induce HIV in any tissue, the SMAC mimetic AZD5582 was effective only in a resident-memory CD4+ T cell subpopulation in the intestine, and IL15 exhibited the broadest reactivation potential across tissues and CD4+ T subsets. These models recapitulate key aspects of HIV infection providing insights into the inducible reservoir’s composition in different tissues and informing strategies for its elimination.">

        <tr id="Squalene-based adjuvants like MF59, and its research alternative AddaVax, induce transient muscle injury, but their working mechanisms downstream of muscle injury remain unclear. We show that an AddaVax-adjuvanted quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (QIV) intramuscular injection triggers muscle regeneration-like immune processes and increases CX3CR1+Ly6C+ macrophages in the muscle and inguinal lymph nodes by day 4 post-injection. This leads to a Th2 skewed vaccine response with higher levels of vaccine specific IgG1 titers, and Th2-associated cytokines in the lungs 5 days after subsequent influenza viral challenge. In aged mice, the macrophage recruitment and polarization is diminished, which is consistent with age-associated muscle mass loss, reflecting the age-related decline in muscle regeneration. Unlike young mice, aged mice exhibit a reduction in magnitude and skewing of AddaVax-mediated Th2 responses to QIV. We found that adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived macrophages derived from young mice into aged mice at the moment of vaccination leads to their infiltration into the injected muscle, where they collect vaccine antigens, drain to the lymph node, and enhance the Th2 response, recapitulating the young host response but in an older host. However, rescuing the Th2-skewing effects of AddaVax alone was not sufficient to enhance protection against mismatched subsequent influenza viral infection in aged mice, suggesting additional factors at play in the diminished vaccine response in aged hosts. This underscores the importance of the macrophage-driven muscle regenerative response in the mechanism of action for squalene-based adjuvants like AddaVax and emphasizes the need to study how muscle damage and regenerative pathways in intramuscular vaccine responses contribute to vaccine effectiveness.">

        <tr id="To provide protection, anticipatory T cell–dependent immunity is reliant on the generation and maintenance of a naïve T cell repertoire, which is sufficiently diverse to ensure recognition of newly encountered antigens. Therefore, under steady-state conditions, a given individual needs to maintain a large pool of naïve T cells, ready to respond to potential threats. Here, we demonstrate that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (Ndrg3) is essential for naïve T cell stability. Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) ranks as the fifth most prevalent malignant neoplasm globally, with an increased death rate despite recent advancements in research and therapeutic options. Different molecular subtypes of GC have distinct interactions with the immune system, impacting the tumor microenvironment (TME), prognosis, and reaction to immunotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the TME are crucial for preventing tumor growth and metastasis, as evidenced by research showing that patients with GC who have a significant density of TILs have better survival rates. But cancer cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, both sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 15 (Siglec-15) and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) playing a pivotal role in the development of an immunosuppressive TME. They prevent T cell activation and proliferation resulting in a decrease in the immune system’s capacity to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. These immune checkpoint molecules function via different but complementary mechanisms, the expression of Siglec-15 being mutually exclusive with PD-L1 and, therefore, providing a different therapeutic approach. The review explores how TILs affect tumor growth and patient outcomes in GC, with particular emphasis on their interactions within the TME and potential targeting of the PD-L1 and Siglec-15 pathways for immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT CD8+ tissue‐resident memory T cells (TRM) are strategically located in peripheral tissues, enabling a rapid response to local infections, which is different from circulating memory CD8+ T cells. Their unique positioning makes them promising targets for vaccines designed to enhance protection at barrier sites and other organs. Recent studies have shown a correlation between CD8+ TRM cells and favorable clinical outcomes in various types of cancer, indicating their potential role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, the dual nature of CD8+ TRM cells presents challenges, as their inappropriate activation may lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review highlights significant advancements in the field, focusing on the differentiation pathways and phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8+ TRM cells across different tissues and disease states. We also review their protective roles in various contexts and the implications for vaccine development against infections and treatment strategies for tumors. Overall, this comprehensive review outlines the common features of CD8+ TRM cell differentiation and biological functions, emphasizing their specific characteristics across diverse tissues and disease states, which can guide the design of therapies against infections and tumors while minimizing the risk of autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (AHST) can cure patients with many diseases, but harmful acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) remains a challenge. Many immune cells are implicated in the pathogenesis and control of alloreactive T-cell responses causing aGvHD, but the functionally dominant cells at different times remain unknown. Using mass cytometry to simultaneously assess alloreactive and immunoregulatory cell populations after AHST, we identified a robust early immune signature predictive of aGvHD rich in CD4 effector memory T-cells and deficient in functionally allosuppressive NK cells. Additionally, network analysis identified a heterogeneous immunoregulatory cell group (IRCG) that more accurately predicted aGVHD than any individual cell populations or established serum biomarkers. Immune signatures preceding aGvHD evolved over time, with qualitative and quantitative changes in both the alloreactive T-cell compartment and the constituent components of the IRCG. In mapping how alloreactive and immunoregulatory cell populations evolve temporally, we provide mechanistic insight into dynamic control of alloreactivity supporting development of time-sensitive targeted strategies to reduce aGvHD.

 Background:
 EV has high antitumor activity and improved survival in advanced urothelial cancer both as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. We hypothesized that EV primes a systemic immune response for effective T cell mediated killing.
 Methods:
 We conducted a retrospective analysis of mUC patients treated with EV at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to evaluate its impact on peripheral blood immune cells. PBMCs were isolated from 32 patients with mUC on C1D1 and C2D1 of EV monotherapy. A 32-color spectral flow cytometry panel was used to identify T-cell subsets, and their correlation with treatment response using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Response was determined by an independent radiologist’s assessment of the first on-treatment scan according to RECIST v1.1 criteria.
 Results:
 Of 32 patients, 75% were men with median age 73. 81.3% received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and 93.8% received prior PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Partial response (PR) was observed in 16 patients, while 16 had stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). At C1D1, CD8+ T cell frequencies did not correlate with response; however, a reduction in circulating CD8+ T cells at C2D1 correlated with poor response (SD + PD, p < 0.05). At baseline, high frequency of CD8+PD-1+ T cells correlated with poor response (p < 0.05). Baseline high frequencies of CD8+PD-1+LAG3+ and CD8+PD-1-LAG3+ T cells were also associated with poor response (p < 0.05). At C2D1, high frequency of CD8+TIM3+ (p < 0.05) and CD8+LAG3+ (p < 0.05) T cells correlated with non-response. Additional activation markers on CD8+ T cells at C1D1 were analyzed (Table). Within the memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cell compartments, patients with higher circulating naïve memory cells (CD45RA+CCR7+) at baseline were less likely to respond to EV (p < 0.05), while those with higher frequencies of T effector memory (CD45RA-CCR7-) and effector T cells (CD45RA+CCR7-) were more likely to respond to EV (p < 0.05). No significant correlations were found between memory T cells and response at C2D1.
 Conclusions:
 At baseline and on treatment, distinct immunophenotypes are detected in the peripheral blood of EV treated patients, potentially correlating with treatment response. Ongoing studies aim to further elucidate the influence of prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and the combination of EV with pembrolizumab on these immunophenotypic profiles.

        <tr id="Monocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) play a pivotal role in surveillance and homeostasis, and can exacerbate pathogenic processes during injury, infection, or inflammation. CD14+CD16+ monocytes exhibit diverse functions and contribute to neuroinflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HIV-NCI). Analysis of human CD14+CD16+ monocytes matured in vitro by single-cell RNA sequencing identified a heterogenous population of nine clusters. Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in each cluster identified increased migratory and inflammatory pathways for a group of clusters, which we termed Group 1 monocytes. Group 1 monocytes, distinguished by increased ALCAM, CD52, CD63, and SDC2, exhibited gene expression signatures implicated in CNS inflammatory diseases, produced higher levels of CXCL12, IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, and ROS, and preferentially transmigrated across a human in vitro blood-brain barrier model. Thus, Group 1 cells within the CD14+CD16+ monocyte subset are likely to be major contributors to neuroinflammatory diseases.">

        <tr id="Mucosal-associated invariant T cells are highly conserved innate-like T cells in mammals recognized for their high baseline frequency in human blood and cytotoxic effector functions during infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer. While the majority of these cells express a conserved CD8αβ+ TRAV1-2 T cell receptor recognizing microbially-derived Vitamin B2 intermediates presented by the evolutionarily conserved major histocompatibility complex I-related molecule, MR1, there is an emerging appreciation for diverse subsets that may be selected for in humans with distinct functions, including subpopulations that co-express CD4. Prior work has not examined T cell receptor (TCR) heterogeneity in CD4+ MAIT cells, largely due to bias of identifying human MAIT cells as CD8+ TRAV1-2+ cells. In this study, we adopted an unbiased single-cell TCR-sequencing approach of total MR1-5-OP-RU-tetramer-reactive T cells and discovered that CD4+ MAIT cells express highly diverse TRAV1-2 negative TCRs. To specifically characterize this TCR repertoire, we analyzed VDJ sequences of single MR1-5-OP-RU tetramer+ MAIT cells across two datasets and identified distinct TCR usage among CD4+ MAIT cells including TRAV21, TRAV8 (TRAV8-1, TRAV8-2, TRAV8-3), and TRAV12 families (TRAV12-2, TRAV12-3), as well as more variable J chain and CDR3 sequences. Non-TRAV1-2 MAIT cell TCRs were also enriched after in vitro expansion, including with Mycobacterial tuberculosis. These results indicate that mature human CD4+ MAIT cells adopt distinct TCR usage from the canonical TRAV1-2+ CD8+ subset and suggest that alternative MR1 ligands in addition to riboflavin intermediates may select them.">

        <tr id="Many inflammatory stimuli can induce progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells as part of the process of emergency myelopoiesis. These events are associated with innate training and can have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27 deficient mice are pre-disposed towards the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.">

        <tr id="Eosinophils exert antimicrobial, cytotoxic and immunoregulatory effects, but their function in cutaneous tissue still remains poorly understood. Here, we used a mouse model of chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania (L.) mexicana to investigate the function and transcriptomic signature of eosinophils in the skin. In C57BL/6 wild-type mice, L. mexicana infection induced local and systemic eosinophilia that was dependent on type 2 innate lymphoid cells and interleukin-5. Genetic and pharmacological depletion of eosinophils led to complete clinical resolution of disease, which was accompanied by a more pronounced Th1 and M1-like macrophage response. Bioinformatic analyses revealed a novel inflammatory and tissue-specific transcriptional trajectory in skin-infiltrating eosinophils. Skin-imprinted eosinophils strongly expressed the high-affinity glucose transporter 3 (Slc2a3), deprived the environment of glucose and directly impeded the function of Th1 cells. Together, our results demonstrate that disease progression and chronicity of L. mexicana infection is caused by inflammatory eosinophils and linked to their metabolic program. Short Summary The authors describe that depletion of eosinophils prevents chronic cutaneous disease caused by Leishmania mexicana. They identify a novel, tissue-specific transcriptomic profile of inflammatory skin eosinophils and demonstrate that skin-imprinted eosinophils show strong glucose uptake and directly repress Th1 responses.

        <tr id="Background: Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate among all cancers, for which immunotherapy can frequently lead to drug resistance. To understand the molecular mechanisms behind immune escape in patients with lung cancer and develop predictive and therapeutic targets, we carried out analytical experiments using single-cell sequencing. Methods: We collected eight tumor tissue samples from eight patients with lung adenocarcinoma and categorized them based on the positive reactions for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels. Single-cell sequencing analysis was employed to create a comprehensive cellular landscape. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection was used to show the proportion of immune and endothelial cells, along with a map depicting the distribution of different cell types. Cells were subdivided according to molecular markers; the subpopulations were grouped based on PD-L1 levels and tumor marker-positive reactions. The correlation between the occurrence of the PD-L1 reaction and the response time of immune cells was explored; differential gene expression between the groups was elucidated. Finally, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to examine the relationship between key differentially expressed genes and PD-L1 immune escape checkpoint response. Results: A total of 58,810 single cells were analyzed, identifying seven distinct cell types. In the PD-L1-positive sample group, B cells, astrocytes, endothelial cells, outer skin cells, and tissue stem cells were present in higher proportions, whereas T and dendritic cells were the main cells in the PD-L1-negative sample group. According to the molecular markers, the seven cell types were divided into 17 cell clusters, with one cluster classified as tumor cells, showing PD-L1 positivity. Eleven molecular markers with different expression levels were simultaneously screened (NAPSA, MUC1, WFDC2, MYO6, LYZ, IGHG4, IGLL5, IGHM, IGKC, AQP3, and IGFBP7), and their association with the PD-L1/PD-1 immune escape axis response was confirmed by qPCR. Conclusion: Our study suggests that PD-L1-mediated immune escape may occur at a later stage of tumor progression, involving both PD-L1-positive and negative immune cells. Additionally, we identified 11 differentially expressed genes that could provide insights into the potential mechanisms of immune escape in patients with lung cancer. These findings offer promising molecular targets for the detection and treatment of immune escape in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Aging significantly diminishes T cell immunity, increasing susceptibility to infections and reducing vaccine efficacy in older individuals. Metabolism plays a key role in T cell function, shaping their energy requirements, activation, and differentiation. Recent studies highlight altered metabolic signaling as a pivotal factor in T cell aging, influencing the ability of T cells to maintain quiescence, respond to activation, and differentiate into functional subsets. Aberrant metabolic pathways disrupt the quiescence of aged T cells and skew their differentiation toward short-lived, pro-inflammatory effector T cells while hindering the generation of long-lived memory and T follicular helper cells. These changes contribute to a hyper-inflammatory state, exacerbate chronic low-grade inflammation, and compromise immune homeostasis. In this review, we explore how metabolic signaling is altered during T cell aging and the resulting functional impacts. We also discuss therapeutic approaches aimed at restoring proper T cell differentiation, improving vaccine responses, and rejuvenating immune function in older populations.">

        <tr id="Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has emerged as a critical epigenetic regulator in tumor progression and immune modulation, positioning it as a promising target for enhancing cancer immunotherapy. This work comprehensively explores HDAC3’s multifaceted roles, focusing on its regulation of key immune-modulatory pathways such as cGAS-STING, ferroptosis, and the Nrf2/HO-1 axis. These pathways are central to tumor immune evasion, antigen presentation, and immune cell activation. Additionally, the distinct effects of HDAC3 on various immune cell types—including its role in enhancing T cell activation, restoring NK cell cytotoxicity, promoting dendritic cell maturation, and modulating macrophage polarization—are thoroughly examined. These findings underscore HDAC3’s capacity to reshape the tumor immune microenvironment, converting immunologically “cold tumors” into “hot tumors” and thereby increasing their responsiveness to immunotherapy. The therapeutic potential of HDAC3 inhibitors is highlighted, both as standalone agents and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, to overcome resistance and improve treatment efficacy. Innovative strategies, such as the development of selective HDAC3 inhibitors, advanced nano-delivery systems, and integration with photodynamic or photothermal therapies, are proposed to enhance treatment precision and minimize toxicity. By addressing challenges such as toxicity, patient heterogeneity, and resistance mechanisms, this study provides a forward-looking perspective on the clinical application of HDAC3 inhibitors. It highlights its significant potential in personalized cancer immunotherapy, paving the way for more effective treatments and improved outcomes for cancer patients.">

One of the manifestations is an atypical non-ulcerated cutaneous leishmaniasis (NUCL), which occurs in some locations of Central America with few cases of VL. We conducted a transcriptomic analysis of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) on blood samples from NUCL, AS, VL patients from Amapala, Honduras, and healthy controls. RNA-seq revealed a similar perturbation of gene expression in NUCL and AS. Eight gene signatures of CMI were found in NUCL involved in CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration, reactive oxygen species generation, PD-1 receptor ligand, inflammasome assembly, chemotaxis, complement receptor and suppressor immune cell infiltration. NUCL was distinguished from VL by its up-regulation of differently expressed genes (DEGs) related to T lymphocyte exhaustion, adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes, and down-regulation of oxidative stress genes. In contrast, VL exhibited up-regulated DEGs involved in antigen cross-presentation, and similar to VL from Brazil, down-regulated DEGs involved in innate immunity. Corroborating the transcriptome findings, both the Leishmanin skin test, and the immunopathology of NUCL skin lesion defined NUCL as a proinflammatory condition, intermediate between the AS and VL clinical outcomes. That condition may be the underlying element for the benign nature of the NUCL.">

        <tr id="Adaptive immunity, mediated by T and B cell responses, is essential for defending against infections and cancers while also being implicated in autoimmune diseases. Tracking T and B cell repertoires in situ at single-cell resolution is essential for understanding adaptive immune responses. To address the lack of tools for in situ single-cell T/BCR (XCR) sequencing, we developed Stereo-XCR-seq, an efficient strategy for retrieving and sequencing TCR and BCR from Stereo-seq cDNA libraries at subcellular resolution. Stereo-XCR-seq provides unbiased full-length XCR reads alongside spatial transcriptomics, enabling the identification of heterogeneous lymphoid aggregates with distinct clonal activities in cancers and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We identified plasma cell aggregates that differ from tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in both transcriptomic profiles and clonal activities, with spatial positioning potentially mediating unique immune responses. Collectively, Stereo-XCR-seq enables in situ single-cell profiling of T and B cell clonal activities within tissue microenvironments, providing insights into lymphocyte adaption to environmental stimuli. This technology provides potential for advancing our understanding of tissue immunity and the development of therapeutic strategies for immune disorders.">

        <tr id="Efficient recognition and elimination of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTLs) require target cell engagement and the formation of a well-organized immunological synapse. Surface proteins belonging to the SLAM family are known to be crucial for stabilizing the immunological synapse and regulating antiviral responses during lymphotropic viral infections. In the context of HIV-1, there have been reports of SLAMF6 down-regulation in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells; however, the significance of this modulation for CTL function remains unclear. In this investigation, we used CTL lines from People living with HIV (PLWH) to examine the impact of SLAMF6 blockade on three pivotal processes: (1) the formation of CD8+-CD4+ T-cell conjugates, (2) the establishment of the immunological synapse, and (3) the killing and cytokine production capacity of HIV-1-specific CTLs during HIV-1 infection. Our findings reveal that the inability to form CD8+-CD4+ T-cell conjugates following incubation with an anti-SLAMF6 blocking antibody is primarily attributable to a defect in actin ring formation at the immunological synapse. Furthermore, SLAMF6 blockade leads to a reduction in the killing efficiency of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells by HIV-1-specific CTLs, underscoring the critical role of SLAMF6 in cytolytic function. This study highlights the importance of SLAMF6 receptors in modulating cytotoxic antiviral responses, shedding light on potential avenues for manipulation and enhancement of this pathway in the context of HIV and other lymphotropic viral infections.">

 Background:
 Immune checkpoint blockade is a standard-of-care treatment for mRCC patients, but the immune mechanisms driving clinical benefit remain underexplored. In the I-RENE trial (NCT04891055), we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) and lymphoid dynamics and their impact on the efficacy of nivolumab.
 Methods:
 The I-RENE study is a prospective, translational, real-world multicenter trial involving mRCC patients treated with nivolumab after failure of previous VEGFR-targeted therapies. Sixty patients were enrolled between December 2018 and August 2022. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected at baseline and at 2, 4, and 12 weeks, as well as at disease progression. PBMCs were analyzed by high-resolution flow cytometry (profiling 144 lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets), and plasma was assessed using multiplex analysis (69 soluble factors). CD14+ monocytes from PB and tumor tissue were subjected to RNA sequencing.
 Results:
 Significant immune modulations in PB were detectable as early as 2 weeks into treatment across all patients, regardless of clinical response, and persisted throughout the 3-month observation period. These changes included substantial alterations in the profiles of immune cells and plasma soluble factors. Responders to nivolumab exhibited a marked reduction in monocyte subsets associated with immune suppression, such as CD14+HLA-DR- cells, CD14+PD-L1+ cells, and intermediate monocytes. In contrast, non-responders showed a progressive increase in suppressive monocytes and a concomitant decrease in CD14+ cells involved in anti-tumor immunity, including non-classical monocytes and CD14+ cells expressing HLA-DR and CX3CR1. Lymphoid compartment analysis revealed that responders experienced an increase in CD8+ T cells and CD4+ effector memory T cells, along with a reduction in CD38+ T cells. Conversely, non-responders showed significant upregulation of senescent CD8+ T cells (KLRG1+CD28-CD57+) and CD38+ T cells. All progressing patients showed a notable resurgence of suppressive myeloid cells (HLA-DR-, PD-L1+), confirmed by an enriched MDSC gene signature, as well as an increase in PB CD38+ and senescent T cells. Notably, the detrimental role of myeloid-driven immune suppression in non-responders was further confirmed by an enriched MDSC gene signature in matched tumor samples.
 Conclusions:
 The pervasive and detrimental impact of myeloid cells committed to immune suppression is evident even before radiological progression in mRCC patients and persists despite immunotherapy. These findings highlight the need for early identification of immune-suppressive infiltrates and the development of strategies to overcome or reprogram these cells, both at the systemic and tumor level, following diagnosis.

In addition to presenting antigens to T cells, DCs must also provide co-stimulatory signals along with cytokines for T cells to induce an appropriate cellular immune response. Tolerance is also established and maintained by DCs under homeostatic circumstances. There is remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity in DCs, each with different functional flexibility and specific expression of various markers. The three primary categories of DCs comprise conventional DCs (cDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). Langerhans cells (LCs) are another type of DCs, which are found in the skin's epidermal layer. DCs may be positioned or triggered inappropriately as a result of dysregulation of DC. This phenomenon can cause an imbalance in immune responses and even immune-related pathological disorders, i.e., autoimmune diseases and malignancies. Herein, by reviewing the ontogeny, biology, characteristics, and function of DCs subsets in immune system, we discuss the contribution of these cells in the mentioned immune-related disorders.">

        <tr id="Chronic inflammation is a well-established risk factor for cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using a mouse model of colitis, we demonstrate that colonic stem cells retain an epigenetic memory of inflammation following disease resolution, characterized by a cumulative gain of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor activity. Further, we develop SHARE-TRACE, a method that enables simultaneous profiling of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and clonal history in single cells, enabling high resolution tracking of epigenomic memory. This reveals that inflammatory memory is propagated cell-intrinsically and inherited through stem cell lineages, with certain clones demonstrating dramatically stronger memory than others. Finally, we show that colitis primes stem cells for amplified expression of regenerative gene programs following oncogenic mutation that accelerate tumor growth. This includes a subpopulation of tumors that have exceptionally high AP-1 activity and the additional upregulation of pro-oncogenic programs. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic link between chronic inflammation and malignancy, revealing how long-lived epigenetic alterations in regenerative tissues may contribute to disease susceptibility and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate cancer risk in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Adaptive immune resistance in cancer describes the various mechanisms by which tumors adapt to evade anti-tumor immune responses. IFN-γ induction of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was the first defined and validated adaptive immune resistance mechanism. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is central to adaptive immune resistance as immune modulatory secreted and integral membrane proteins are dependent on ER. Sigma1 is a unique ligand-regulated integral membrane scaffolding protein enriched in the ER of cancer cells. PD-L1 is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is translated into the ER and processed through the cellular secretory pathway. At the cell surface, PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint molecule that binds PD-1 on activated T-cells and blocks anti-tumor immunity. PD-L1 can also be incorporated into cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), and EV-associated PD-L1 can inactivate T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that a selective small molecule inhibitor of Sigma1 can block IFN-γ mediated adaptive immune resistance in part by altering the incorporation of PD-L1 into cancer cell-derived EVs. Sigma1 inhibition blocked post-translational maturation of PD-L1 downstream of IFN-γ/STAT1 signaling. Subsequently, EVs released in response to IFN-γ stimulation were significantly less potent suppressors of T-cell activation. These results suggest that by reducing tumor derived immune suppressive EVs, Sigma1 inhibition may promote antitumor immunity. Sigma1 modulation presents a novel approach to regulating the tumor immune microenvironment by altering the content and production of EVs. Altogether, these data support the notion that Sigma1 may play a role in adaptive immune resistance in the tumor microenvironment.">

This persistent activation leads to immune cell exhaustion. HIV-1 can activate type I IFN responses via several pathways, including the STING pathway, which is activated by e.g., virus-derived oligonucleotides. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms creating HIV-1-mediated immune dysfunction and role of type I IFNs using a DC and T cell co-culture model. HIV-1 exposure in the DC-T cell co-culture promoted the expansion of suppressive T cells with diminished proliferation and effector functions. The impairment required type I IFNs and subsequent IFN-α/β receptor signaling, initiated by HIV-derived ssDNA activation of IFI16/cGAS followed by STING signaling in the DCs. Targeting IFNAR1 with Anifrolumab restored the immune functions of both DCs and T cells, as well as T cell proliferation and T cell effector functions, including their secretion of IL-2, IFN-γ, and granzyme B. Our findings support that the immune impairments existing in untreated or antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated HIV-infected individuals are mediated, if not fully in part by type I IFN’s negative effect on DC and T cells. Therapeutics targeting IFN-α/β receptors, such as Anifrolumab, hold potential as combination treatment alongside ART, to achieve a more complete immune restoration and contribute to improved quality of life among people living with HIV.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, with over 1 billion people worldwide living with obesity. It is associated with an increased risk of over 200 chronic co-morbidities, including an increased susceptibility to infection. Numerous studies have highlighted the dysfunction caused by obesity on a wide range of immune cell subsets, including dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are innate immune sentinels that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems. DCs provide critical signals that instruct and shape the immune response. Our group has previously reported that DCs from people with obesity display defective cytokine production; however, the mechanisms underpinning these defects are unclear. Methods We investigated the functional responses of DCs using a murine-specific single-stranded RNA virus, Sendai virus, in mice on a standard diet and in a model of diet-induced obesity. Results Here, we demonstrate that GM-CSF cultured bone marrow–derived DCs (GM-DCs) from mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) have reduced cytokine production following viral challenge. This was associated with a dysfunctional metabolism through reduced translation in the HFD GM-DCs. Conclusions We propose that obesity-mediated effects on DCs have downstream consequences on their ability to effectively mediate subsequent immune responses, especially during viral infection.">

        <tr id="T cell exhaustion is important to protect the host from immunopathology during chronic viral infection, but it also impairs T cell anti-tumor immunity1–5. A fundamental unresolved question is whether and how T cell exhaustion is determined at the onset of TCR signaling6–8. Here we report an unexpected role of Themis, a TCR-proximal signaling molecule9, in T cell exhaustion. Chronic viral infection in mice usually leads to T cell exhaustion and survival of the host. Surprisingly, Themis T-cell conditional knockout mice died from severe CD8+-dependent lung immunopathology in chronic viral infection, showing Themis’ importance in establishing T cell exhaustion. We found that Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells were hyperactivated at the single-cell level - producing more TNF and IFNγ compared to wild-type counterparts - but defective in population-level expansion. Moreover, TCF-1 and TOX expression were inhibited in Themis-deficient CD8+ T cells, thereby impairing differentiation of exhausted T cell precursors (T-pex) and maintenance of terminally exhausted T cells (T-ex), respectively. Mechanistically, Themis initially promotes TCR signaling to induce PD-1 expression and subsequently mediates PD-1 signaling. In the latter, Themis binds to PD-1 and promotes PD-1 phosphorylation and its recruitment of SHP2, thereby acting as a negative regulator to inhibit T cell effector functions. Without Themis, the orderly regulation of TCR and PD-1 signaling, and therefore exhaustion, is disrupted. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that Themis-mediated early TCR signaling plays a decisive role in T cell exhaustion and provide a novel mechanism of PD-1 signaling through Themis.">

        <tr id="Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is known as an inflammasome-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in T-cell-driven autoimmune diseases. In mice, T-cells were reported to instruct myeloid cells to produce IL-1β via an inflammasome-independent mechanism, that engages TNFR and Fas-caspase-8-dependent signalling pathways. In this study, we explored T-cell-driven myeloid IL-1β production in humans. Co-culturing of autologous primary T-cells (memory CD4+ and CD8+) with myeloid cells (monocyte, macrophage and dendritic cells) revealed that both memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induce IL-1β secretion. Also, caspase-1 rather than caspase-8 cleaves pro-IL-1β in human myeloid cells. This process depends on TNF-α, CD40L and IFN-γ together rather than TNF-α alone, leading to upregulated pro-IL-1β expression in human myeloid cells. We additionally show that TNF-α, CD40L and IFN-γ independently enhance IL-1β secretion. Together, our study highlights that, despite the shared biology in T-cell-instructed IL-1β production between humans and mice, different underlying molecular pathways are implicated. Summary Like murine cells, human T-cells stimulate IL-1β secretion from myeloid cells. However, the underlying mechanisms differ, with IL-1β production in humans being driven by TNF-α, CD40L, IFN-γ, and Caspase-1, whereas in mice, it is primarily regulated by TNF-α and Caspase-8.">

However, we observe MHC-I deficiency in human and murine urologic tumors, posing daunting challenges for successful immunotherapy. We herein report an unprecedented nanosonosensitizer of one-dimensional bamboo-like multisegmented manganese dioxide@manganese–bismuth vanadate (BMMBV) to boost multiple branches of immune responses targeting MHC-I–deficient tumors. BMMBV markedly augments sonodynamic activity contributed by manganese heteroatoms in the lattice of bismuth vanadate with narrowing bandgaps. Under sonoirradiation, BMMBV enhances tumor antigen spreading and emission of adjuvant signals, which potentiate dendritic cell maturation, thereby eliciting high aptitude of CTLs. This therapy substantially up-regulates MHC expression on tumor cells, which are reversely sensitive to CTLs. Alongside, extensive innate immune cells complement the cytolytic activity of CTLs for eliminating mouse urologic tumors.

Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating leukocytes in human, and heterogeneous neutrophils have been increasingly recognized as important players in tumor progression. They play double “edge-sward” by either supporting or suppressing the tumor growth, including driving angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling to promote tumor growth, participating in antitumor adaptive immunity, or killing tumor cells directly to inhibit the tumor growth. The complex role of neutrophils in various tumors depends on the tumor microenvironment (TME) they are located, and emerging evidence has suggested that neutrophils may determine the success of tumor immunotherapy in the context of the immune checkpoint blockade, innate immune training, or drug-loaded extracellular microvesicles therapy, which makes them become an exciting target for tumor immunotherapy, but still with challenges. Here, we summarize the latest insights on how to activate neutrophils in antitumor immunity and discuss the advances of neutrophil-targeted immunotherapy strategies.">

        <tr id="Avian γδ T lymphocytes are highly abundant in the intestinal mucosa and play a critical role in immune defense against infectious diseases in chickens. However, their specific contributions to infection control remain poorly understood. To investigate the role of γδ T cells and their possible compensation, we studied wild-type and γδ T cell knockout chickens following infection with Salmonella Enteritidis. Bacterial loads in the liver, cecal content, and cecal wall were quantified. Immune cell populations in blood, spleen, and cecum were analyzed using flow cytometry. Immune gene transcription in sorted T cell subsets and cecal tissue was measured by RT-qPCR. Strikingly, chickens lacking γδ T cells had significantly higher bacterial loads in the liver and more extensive Salmonella invasion in the cecal wall during the early stages of infection compared to wild-type birds. In the blood, infected γδ T cell knockout chickens displayed a significantly increased percentage of CD25+ NK-like cells. In both blood and tissue, infected wild-type chickens demonstrated an increased absolute number of CD8αα++ γδ T cells. Conversely, γδ T cell knockout chickens exhibited an augmented cell count of a CD8αα++CD4- non-γδ T cell population after infection, which might include αβ T cells. At 7 days post infection (dpi), gene expression analysis revealed elevated transcription of the activation marker IL-2Rα and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IFN-γ) in CD8αα++CD4- non-γδ T cells from γδ T cell knockout chickens compared to CD8αα++ γδ T cells from wild-type birds. By 12 dpi, these differences diminished as transcription levels increased in γδ T cells of wild-type animals. Our findings demonstrate that γδ T cells play a role in early immune protection against Salmonella Enteritidis infection in chickens. In later stages of the infection, the γδ T cells and their functions appear to be replaced by other cells.">

Studies in mouse models have illuminated key mechanisms underlying B-cell activation, differentiation, class-switch recombination, and somatic hypermutation. However, the extent to which these findings translate to human biology remains unclear. To address this, we developed a human primary B-cell culture system using feeder cells engineered to express CD40L, supplemented with the cytokines BAFF, IL-4, and IL-21. Using a Design of Experiments (DOE) approach, we optimized critical parameters and dissected the individual contributions of each specific factor. Our results reveal that BAFF plays a negligible role, and IL-21 has more subtle effects, whereas CD40L and IL-4 are critical determinants of cell viability, proliferation and IgE class-switching. Furthermore, we find that engineered feeder cells can serve equally well as a source of cytokines, but providing these in purified form increases the flexibility of the system. This platform enables detailed investigation of human B-cell biology, offering insights into intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of antibody responses and providing a foundation for in vitro production of human primary antibodies.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is associated with dysregulated/chronic inflammation. The immune system has multiple roles including beneficial effects such as clearing alpha synuclein aggregates. However, peripheral immune cells entering the brain may also contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. To identify which cells might have a negative impact and could be potential therapeutic targets, we compared immune signatures of patients and healthy controls.


METHODS
Multicolor flow cytometry was used to determine the frequencies of major immune cell subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PD patients and controls. Because of the major impact of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on the distribution of immune cell subsets, particularly cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T-cells, all participants were tested for CMV seropositivity.


RESULTS
Although the cohort of 35 PD patients exhibited the well-established T-cell differentiation signature driven by CMV infection, there were no differences in the frequencies of differentiated or pro-inflammatory T-cells, B-cells or natural killer cells (NK-cells) attributable to the disease. However, percentages of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were higher in PD patients than controls. Moreover, percentages of CD14+CD16+ (intermediate) monocytes expressing the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) correlated with disease severity assessed by the Movement Disorder Society's revised version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) score and disease duration.


CONCLUSIONS
A comprehensive evaluation of the major subsets of circulating immune cells in PD patients revealed differences in myeloid cells between PD and healthy controls and some correlation of monocyte abundance with disease severity.">

        <tr id="Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents significant clinical challenges due to its limited treatment options and aggressive behavior, often associated with poor prognosis. This study focuses on Kindlin-2, an adaptor protein, and its role in TNBC progression, particularly in hematopoiesis-mediated immune evasion. TNBC tumors expressing high levels of Kindlin-2 induce a notable reshaping of hematopoiesis, promoting expansion of myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM) and spleen. This shift correlated with increased levels of neutrophils and monocytes in tumor-bearing mice over time. Conversely, genetic knockout of Kindlin-2 mitigated this myeloid bias and fostered T cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, indicating Kindlin-2's pivotal role in immune modulation. Further investigations revealed that Kindlin-2 deficiency led to reduced expression of PD-L1, a critical immune checkpoint inhibitor, in TNBC tumors. This molecular change sensitized Kindlin-2-deficient tumors to host anti-tumor immune responses, resulting in enhanced tumor suppression in immune-competent mouse models. Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA-seq, and immunohistochemistry data supported these findings by highlighting enriched immune-related pathways and increased infiltration of immune cells in Kindlin-2-deficient tumors. Therapeutically, targeting PD-L1 in Kindlin-2-expressing TNBC tumors effectively inhibited tumor growth, akin to the effects observed with genetic Kindlin-2 knockout or PD-L1-KO. Our data underscore Kindlin-2 as a promising therapeutic target in combination with immune checkpoint blockade to bolster anti-tumor immunity and counteract resistance mechanisms typical of TNBC and other immune evasive solid tumors. Implications: Kindlin-2 regulates tumor immune evasion through the systemic modulation of hematopoiesis and PD-L1 expression, which warrants therapeutic targeting of Kindlin-2 in TNBC patients.">

 Three novel therapies have shown promise in managing moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC): fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, and targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Individually, these treatment approaches face issues with either safety concerns or limited efficacy due to disease relapses. Yet, the development of better strategies is hampered by limited knowledge about the cellular mechanisms driving chronic inflammation and disease relapse in UC. In UC, the number of aberrantly differentiated tissue resident MSCs in the colonic mucosa is increased. The mechanisms behind this abnormal MSC differentiation and how they affect MSC therapy in UC remain unclear. JAK2 signaling is involved in the differentiation of bone marrow derived (BM)-MSCs and previously we observed that stimulation of BM-MSCs with UC relevant microbial ligand LPS upregulated JAK2. We hypothesized that dysbiotic microbial ligands in UC promote aberrant MSC differentiation through JAK2 activation, reducing the efficacy of MSC therapy.



 Mesenchymal progenitor cells were isolated from human UC tissue. Wild-type and MyD88 mesenchymal lineage conditional knockout mice (Grem1CreMyD88KO) were used in two models of experimental colitis (TNBS-induced and oxazolone-induced colitis). Murine FMT and syngeneic MSC transplant were also used in these studies.



 Analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA seq data showed increased numbers of mesenchymal cells co-expressing stem cell (POU5F1) and progenitor markers (Grem1), along with JAK2, in inflamed colon tissue from UC patients. Bulk RNA seq analysis of healthy colonic mesenchymal cells from normal tissue stimulated with the Gram-negative bacteria-derived TLR4 ligand, LPS, revealed upregulation of inflammatory genes IL-6, IL-33, PD-L1, and JAK2 signaling. Deletion of MyD88 in MSCs during the acute phase of TNBS-induced colitis improved symptoms and decreased UC-relevant inflammation concomitantly with downregulation of JAK2. In the oxazolone-induced model of colitis, depletion of dysbiotic microbiota with antibiotics and subsequent FMT resulted in reduced JAK2 expression in the colonic mucosa, and when combined with MSC therapy shown superior efficacy in improvement of clinical sign of colitis, improvement of colonic tissue architecture and reduction of UC-relevant inflammatory responses when compared to FMT or MSCs therapy alone.



 Dysbiotic microbial ligands in UC contribute to the generation of abnormally differentiated MSCs with active JAK2 signaling and downstream molecules supporting inflammation in UC and this process involves MSC intrinsic MyD88 signaling. Further, our data suggests depletion of the dysbiotic microbiota in combination of FMT/MSCs therapy could counteract this effect and may offer a more effective approach to treating UC.

 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become a successful mainstay of therapy for cancer; however, the use of ICIs is limited by their unique inflammatory toxicities including ICI-colitis, which involves the infiltration of both CD8 and CD4 T cells. The precise immune pathogenesis of ICI-colitis remains incompletely understood. Pathogenesis of other immune-mediated colitis including acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), Crohn’s disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) also involves T-cell-mediated immune response against intestinal tissues. We hypothesized that T cell subtypes and the immune milieu surrounding damaged colonic epithelium in ICI-colitis are distinct from other types of immune-mediated colitis. We aimed to compare transcriptomic landscape of immune microenvironment in ICI-colitis with other immune-mediated colitis using transcriptomic and spatial profiling. We retrospectively identified formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded distal colonic biopsies demonstrating histopathologic features of ICI-colitis (n=3), aGVHD (n=3), CD (n=3), and UC (n=3) and normal distal colon (n=2) from age- and gender-matched patients. Transcriptomic analysis was first performed using bulk RNA-seq. Differentially expressed genes were further analyzed by CompBio, a novel knowledge engine to define molecular pathways. Spatial transcriptomic analysis was performed using the 10x Genomics Xenium platform with a pre-designed human colon panel (322 genes) on all biopsies. Data were analyzed in R by Seurat. Dimensionality reduction was done using UMAP. The Louvain algorithm was used for clustering. Analysis was further subdivided into microdomains of colonic surface and crypt bases. Bulk RNA-seq and pathway analysis revealed upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine production in all colitis types when they were compared to normal colon. Transcriptomic alterations in ICI-colitis compared with all other colitis included pathways upregulated in T-cell chemotaxis, particularly CCL5, and downregulated in IL4/IL13 mediated Th2 activation. Louvain clustering of the spatial transcriptomic data showed an increase in DUOX2 expressing inflamed enterocytes across all colitis types compared with normal colon and a similar overall abundance of inflammatory cells across sample types(Figure 1). Spatial microdomain analysis showed higher numbers of activated CD8+ T cells neighboring enterocytes and goblet cells in ICI-colitis relative to other types of colitis (Figure 2). The increase in neighboring activated CD8+ T cells was present in both the crypt base and surface epithelium and was accompanied with increased neighboring CCL5+ cells in both microdomains in ICI-colitis. Our results show that an increase in activated T cells and CCL5 expression in the immune microenvironment of damaged colonic epithelium differentiates ICI-colitis from other types of immune-mediated colitis.

        <tr id="The combination of chemotherapeutic agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, its success is often limited by insufficient immune priming in certain tumors, including pediatric malignancies. In this report, we explore clinical trials currently investigating the use of immunogenic cell death (ICD)-inducing chemotherapies in combination with ICIs for both adult and pediatric cancers. Given the limited clinical data available for pediatric tumors, we focused on recent preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy of these combinations in neuroblastoma (NB). Finally, to address this gap, we propose an innovative strategy to assess the impact of ICD-inducing chemotherapies on antitumor immune responses in NB. Using tumor spheroids derived from a transgenic NB mouse model, we validated our previous in vivo findings concerning how anthracyclines, specifically mitoxantrone and doxorubicin, significantly enhance MHC class I surface expression, stimulate IFNγ and granzyme B production by CD8+ T cells and NK cells, and promote immune cell recruitment. Importantly, these anthracyclines also upregulated PD-L1 expression on NB spheroids. This screening platform yielded results similar to in vivo findings, demonstrating that mitoxantrone and doxorubicin are the most potent immunomodulatory agents for NB. These data suggest that the creation of libraries of ICD inducers to be tested on tumor spheroids could reduce the number of combinations to be tested in vivo, in line with the principles of the 3Rs. Furthermore, these results highlight the potential of chemo-immunotherapy regimens to counteract the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in NB, paving the way for improved therapeutic strategies in pediatric cancers. They provide compelling evidence to support further clinical investigations of these combinations to enhance outcomes for children with malignancies.">

        <tr id="High-risk pediatric neuroblastoma patients have a dismal survival rate despite intensive treatment regimens. New treatment options are thus required. Even though HLA expression in neuroblastoma is low and immune cell infiltrates are limited, the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is indicative for better patient survival. Here, we show that most tumor lesions contain viable immune cell infiltrates after induction chemotherapy, with high percentages of CD3+ T cells. We therefore expanded the TILs and tested their anti-tumoral activity. With sufficient starting material, TIL expansion was as efficient as for adult solid tumors. However, whereas TIL products from adult tumors almost exclusively contained αβ T cells, in neuroblastoma-derived TILs, γδ T cells expanded with similar efficacy as αβ T cells. Importantly, the anti-tumor responses in response to autologous tumor digest primarily originated from (Vδ1- and Vδ3-expressing) γδ T cells, and not from αβ T cells. In conclusion, this finding creates a window of opportunity for immunotherapy for neuroblastoma patients, with γδ T cells as potential prime responders.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Since their first description in 2008, T‐bet+ B cells have emerged as a clinically important B cell subset. Now commonly known as ABCs (Age‐associated B Cells), they are uniquely characterized by their expression of the transcription factor T‐bet. Indeed, this singular factor defines this B cell subset. This review will describe the discovery of T‐bet+ B cells, their role in bacterial infection as T cell‐independent (TI) plasmablasts, as well as long‐term follicular helper T cell‐dependent (TD) IgM+ and switched memory cells (i.e., T‐bet+ ABCs), and later discoveries of their role(s) in diverse immunological responses. These studies highlight a critical, although limited, role of T‐bet in IgG2a class switching, a function central to the cells' role in immunity and autoimmunity. Given their association with autoimmunity, pharmacological targeting is an attractive strategy for reducing or eliminating the B cells. T‐bet+ ABCs express a number of characteristic cell surface markers, including CD11c, CD11b, CD73, and the adenosine 2a receptor (A2aR). Accordingly, A2aR agonist administration effectively targeted T‐bet+ ABCs in vivo. Moreover, agonist treatment of lupus‐prone mice reduced autoantibodies and disease symptoms. This latter work highlights the potential therapeutic use of adenosine agonists for treating autoimmune diseases involving T‐bet+ ABCs.">

Natural killer cells (NK cells) play a key role in liver immunosurveillance, but in the tumor microenvironment, NK cells are readily depleted, as evidenced by down-regulation of activating receptors, reduced cytokine secretion, and attenuated killing function. The up-regulation of inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3, further exacerbates the depletion of NK cells. Combined blockade strategies targeting these immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as the combination of PD-1 inhibitors with other inhibitory pathways (eg. TIM-3 and LAG-3), have shown potential to reverse NK cell exhaustion in preclinical studies. This article explores the promise of these innovative strategies in HCC immunotherapy, providing new therapeutic directions for optimizing NK cell function and improving drug sensitivity.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Non‐lymphoid tissue Tregs (NLT‐Tregs) are critical for tissue homeostasis, inflammation control, and induction of tissue repair. Recent single‐cell RNA sequencing data identified the expression of CD83 as part of an NLT‐Treg signature, which is an essential molecule for the stability and differentiation of lymphoid Tregs. However, the biological significance of CD83 expression for NLT Tregs has not yet been elucidated. The present study explores for the first time the role of CD83 expression by lung‐resident Tregs in the steady state and during asthma to understand its importance in barrier tissues. We evaluated the effect of Treg‐specific CD83 deletion (CD83cKO) on the lung‐resident T‐cell compartment and cytokine profile. CD83‐deficient lung Tregs are less differentiated but more activated, resulting in unrestrained T‐cell activation. Further, CD83cKO mice were challenged in an asthma model and showed an accelerated disease progression, driven by Th2‐biased T‐cell responses. CD83cKO Tregs exhibited enhanced responsiveness to IL‐4, leading to insufficient control of Th2‐differentiation from naïve T cells. These findings underscore the pivotal role of CD83 in the NLT‐Treg‐mediated modulation of Th2 responses. Overall, our results highlight CD83 as a key player in tissue homeostasis and inflammatory responses, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for inflammatory disorders such as asthma.">

The integration of invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells into PDO platforms presents an innovative approach for studying immune–tumor dynamics and advancing cancer immunotherapy. iNKT cells, known for their ability to modulate immune responses and target tumors, face challenges in suppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs), which limit their therapeutic potential. PDOs provide a physiologically relevant platform to explore strategies to counteract TME-induced immunosuppression, such as modulating tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), or tumor metabolism. Additionally, PDOs enable the testing of combination therapies, including iNKT cell-based treatments and immune checkpoint inhibitors, to amplify anti-tumor efficacy.

In this review, we first provide an overview of Tregs in cancer immunology, discussing their immunosuppressive roles and properties specific to the TME. We then examine the metabolic requirements for Treg activation and migration under normal conditions, followed by a discussion of how hypoxia, lactate accumulation, nutrient limitation, oxidative stress, and other TME-specific factors alter Treg metabolism and contribute to cancer immune evasion. Finally, we explore therapeutic strategies that target Treg metabolism within the TME, including pharmacological modulation of specific metabolic pathways to diminish Treg-mediated immunosuppression. Thus, we could suggest future directions and clinical implications for Treg-targeted metabolic modulation as a complementary approach in cancer treatment, setting the stage for novel strategies in immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="In the realm of oncology, the tumor microenvironment (TME)—comprising extracellular matrix components, immune cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells—plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis, progression, and response to therapeutic interventions. Initially, the TME exhibits tumor-suppressive properties that can inhibit malignant transformation. However, as the tumor progresses, various factors induce immune tolerance, resulting in TME behaving in a state that promotes tumor growth and metastasis in later stages. This state of immunosuppression is crucial as it enables TME to change from a role of killing tumor cells to a role of promoting tumor progression. Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract with an alarmingly high mortality rate. While chemotherapy has historically been the cornerstone of treatment, its efficacy in prolonging survival remains limited. The emergence of immunotherapy has opened new therapeutic pathways, yet the challenge of immune tolerance driven by the gastric cancer microenvironment complicates these efforts. This review aims to elucidate the intricate role of the TME in mediating immune tolerance in gastric cancer and to spotlight innovative strategies and clinical trials designed to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches. By providing a comprehensive theoretical framework, this review seeks to advance the understanding and application of immunotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND AND AIMS
Innate immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes (Mono), macrophages (Mac), natural killer (NK), and innate lymphoid cells (ILC), contribute to chronic inflammation in lymphoid tissues. Here, we characterized the innate immune cell landscape in inflamed mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) at the single-cell level.


METHODS
Surgically resected colonic MLNs were obtained from patients with Crohn's disease (CD; n = 3), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 3), non-inflamed UC (n = 1), and non-IBD (n = 2). CD45+CD3-CD19- non-T/non-B cells were FACS-sorted to capture rare innate immune cells. Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) was performed on the BD Rhapsody platform alongside multiparameter flow cytometry staining.


RESULTS
CITE-seq analysis unveiled the molecular signature of 11 Mono/Mac/DC (MMDC) and 7 NK/ILC enriched clusters in human MLNs. DC clusters included 3 newly characterized DC clusters such as CD1c/CD163/VCAN/CD64-expressing DC3; AXL-expressing DCs; and a CD103+ DC subset, expressing LTB, S100B, and IL22RA2 (encoding IL22BP). Mono/Mac clusters comprised inflammatory monocytes, which accumulated in IBD compared to non-IBD MLNs. Among NK/ILC clusters, we identified a cytotoxic ILC subset (IL7R, KLRD1, GNLY), previously not reported in MLNs, reminiscent of cytotoxic ILC1-like cells found in inflamed gut mucosa.


CONCLUSION
CITE-seq and flow-cytometry analyses of colonic MLNs from patients with active IBD reveal the molecular signature and cell distribution of previously uncharacterized DC and ILC subpopulations in human MLNs. These findings expand our understanding of immune responses during chronic inflammation in IBD.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with increased rates of severe disease, hospitalization, and death in elderly individuals. Clearance of RSV is frequently delayed within this demographic, contributing to the more severe disease course. Geriatric cotton rats mimic this prolonged clearance kinetic and serve as a useful animal model for studying age-associated immunological deficits during RSV infection. Treatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen restores RSV clearance, indicating that inflammation contributes to impaired clearance in geriatric cotton rats. Here, we further characterize a compromised immune response in geriatric cotton rats and identify an inflammatory pathway that contributes to this deficiency. Dendritic cell (DC) activation and migration to mediastinal lymph nodes are decreased during early infection in geriatric cotton rats, resulting in delayed generation of cytotoxic T cells and virus clearance. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which reduces DC migration through the elevation of D-type prostanoid 1 receptor (DP1 receptor), is elevated in the airways of infected geriatric cotton rats. Reducing PGD2 production by inhibiting COX-2 or PGD2 synthase improves RSV clearance kinetics through DC activation and RSV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in geriatric cotton rats, whereas activation of DP1 receptor through an agonist resulted in delayed viral clearance in adult cotton rats. These results indicate that PGD2 contributes to delayed antigen presentation and CD8+ T-cell responses to RSV in geriatric cotton rats. Inhibiting PGD2 generation or signaling may be a useful mechanism of therapeutic intervention in elderly individuals. IMPORTANCE Elderly adults are at increased risk of severe disease resulting from infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), characterized in part by delayed clearance (removal of the virus from airways). Understanding the immunological factors that lead to this delayed clearance may allow for the development of therapies to improve disease outcomes in elderly individuals infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Here, we describe an inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats, the preferred small animal laboratory model for RSV, that impairs the generation of an effective immune response. We show that inhibiting this inflammatory pathway in geriatric cotton rats improves immune parameters and speeds clearance of RSV. These results contribute to our understanding of delayed RSV clearance in elderly individuals with possible applications for improving immune responses to RSV in clinical settings.">

        <tr id="Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were first recognized over twenty years ago as a key immunomodulatory cell population. Since their initial identification, a growing body of literature points to the importance of MDSC as a heterogeneous, immunosuppressive cell population and as a therapeutic target in adults with cancer. MDSC are potent suppressors of T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells and can be helpful or harmful to the host depending on the pathophysiology. For example, MDSC are beneficial in pregnancy and prevent spontaneous abortion by promoting maternal-fetal tolerance. Increased MDSC are also associated with improved outcomes in patients with graft vs. host disease by decreasing T cell-driven inflammation. However, MDSC can also be harmful and are known to be pathologic in adults with cancer and chronic infections by promoting tumor escape and impairing pathogen clearance, respectively. Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of MDSC and their immune suppression effects in adults, much less is known regarding the role of MDSC in children. Research investigating MDSC in children lags significantly behind adult studies. In fact, while over 5,000 publications on PubMed discuss MDSC in immune regulation, fewer than 50 of these publications focus specifically on their role in children. This review aims to summarize the existing literature on the role of MDSC in children and identify important directions for future research, including targeting these cells in the pediatric population to improve clinical outcomes.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Some patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) despite programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. To address the mechanism of ICI resistance in PD-L1-positive NSCLC, we investigated the role of tumor-cell-intrinsic function of PD-L1 in interleukin (IL)-6-mediated immunosuppression.


METHODS
Cohorts of NSCLC patients treated with ICI and public datasets were analyzed. PD-L1-overexpressing and PD-L1-knockdown NSCLC cells were submitted to RNA-seq, in vitro analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR, CUT&Tag, and biochemical assays. Human myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were co-cultured with NSCLC cells and then assessed for their immunosuppressive activity on T-cells. Mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells with PD-L1 overexpression or knockdown were subcutaneously injected into wild-type or PD-1-knockout C57BL/6 mice in the presence of IL-6 and/or PD-1 blockade.


RESULTS
In the ICI cohort with RNA-seq data, the IL-6/Jak/Stat3 pathway was enriched, and IL-6 expression was higher in patients with PD-L1-high NSCLCs who did not respond to ICIs. In another cohort, a higher baseline serum IL-6 level was associated with poor clinical outcomes after ICI therapy. IL-6 expression and the IL-6/Jak/Stat3 pathway were enhanced in PD-L1-high NSCLCs in the ICI cohorts and The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis. IL-6 expression correlated positively with tumor-infiltrating MDSCs in NSCLCs. In NSCLC cells, PD-L1 activated Jak2/Stat3 signaling by binding to and inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B. PD-L1 also bound to p-Stat3 in the nucleus, thus promoting the activity of p-Stat3 in the transcription of several cytokines (IL-6, TGF-β, TNF-α, IL-1β) and chemokines. PD-L1-overexpressing NSCLC cells enhanced the migration and immunosuppressive activity of human MDSCs in vitro, mediated by IL-6 and CXCL1. In both wild-type and PD-1-knockout mice, PD-L1-overexpressing LLC tumors were infiltrated by increased MDSCs with high immunosuppressive function, increased Tregs, and decreased granzyme B+ or IFNγ+ CD8 T-cells. These responses were mediated by IL-6 secreted from PD-L1-overexpressing tumor cells. Combined blockade of PD-1 and IL-6 was effective in tumor control and decreased MDSCs while increasing granzyme B+ or IFNγ+ CD8 T-cells.


CONCLUSIONS
The tumor-cell-intrinsic function of PD-L1 drives immunosuppression and tumor progression through the PD-L1/Jak/Stat3/IL-6/MDSC axis. This pathway represents a potential therapeutic target to improve ICI efficacy in PD-L1-high NSCLC.">

        <tr id="A diverse naive CD8 T cell repertoire is essential to provide broad protection against infection and cancer. Aging diminishes naive T cells, reducing potential diversity and leading to lymph node contraction. Here, we revealed that this decline occurs earlier in males, resulting in significant sex differences in immunity during middle age. Earlier in life, naive CD8 T cells in males become virtual memory cells prone to premature senescence. Due to androgen-driven thymic atrophy in males, naïve CD8 T cells are insufficiently replenished. Therapeutic thymus rejuvenation via testosterone ablation restored naive CD8 T cells in lymph nodes of middle-aged male mice, leading to enhanced tumor recognition. These findings show the crucial role of sex and age on lymph node T cell repertoires and suggest potential strategies to restore immune function in males during aging.">

        <tr id="PD-1 pathway inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy. However, most patients do not durably benefit, highlighting the need for biomarkers to stratify patients as responders or non-responders. While CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been associated with immune checkpoint therapy response, there is not a consensus on which CD8+ TIL subpopulations have the most prognostic value. Preclinical studies have focused on progenitor-like exhausted CD8+ T cells (TPEX), since TPEX proliferate more in response to PD-1 inhibitors than other exhausted T cell (TEX) subpopulations. However, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment drives TPEX differentiation into other TEX populations that can mediate anti-tumor immunity. These data complicate the ability to identify prognostically important T cell populations in patients that predict ICI treatment response. In this study, we found that advanced melanoma patients with ≥20% of CD8+ TILs co-expressing PD-1 and CTLA-4 (termed CPHi TILs) had better objective response rates and survival following PD-1 monotherapy than those below this threshold. Characterization of the CPHi TIL subset using bulk and single cell RNA sequencing showed that while TPEX-like cells were present within the CPHi subset, they were in the minority of these cells. Rather, the CPHi population was numerically dominated by other subsets, including cycling, terminally exhausted, cytotoxic-like, and/or resident memory-like TEX populations, and a subset enriched for glycolytic genes. Collectively, these data show that CPHi TILs correlate with response in melanoma, but this TIL subset is a heterogenous mix of different subpopulations that may differentially contribute to anti-tumor immunity following checkpoint blockade.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that poses a severe threat to human health. A variety of highly immunogenic tuberculosis proteins have been used as targets in vaccine development to mitigate the spread of TB. Although Th1-type immunity has long been considered a crucial part of resistance to Mtb, γδ T cells, the predominant source of IL-17, are not negligible in controlling the early stages of TB infection. In addition to classical phosphoantigens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat-resistant antigens (HAg), a complex containing 564 proteins obtained from live tuberculosis bacteria after heat treatment at 121 °C for 20 min, have been confirmed to be highly effective γδ T cell stimulators as well. Several studies have demonstrated that HAg-activated γδ T cells can participate in TB immunity by secreting multiple cytokines against Mtb or by interacting with other innate immune cells. In this review, we present a possible mechanism of HAg stimulation of γδ T cells and the role of HAg-activated γδ T cells in anti-TB immunity. We also highlight the limitations of studies on HAg activation of γδ T cells and suggest further research directions on the relationship between HAg and γδ T cells.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT The occurrence of inflammation subsequent to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is associated with an elevated risk of transplant‐related mortality (TRM). However, the duration of inflammation and the potential efficacy of anti‐inflammatory agents in reducing TRM remain uncertain. We performed a comprehensive investigation to examine the post‐transplantation alterations of inflammatory mediators and to ascertain the correlation between inflammation level and TRM through the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, ELISAs and cytometric bead array. The findings revealed that the 30‐day interval following transplantation is characterised by the most pronounced inflammatory response in both human and murine subjects, thereby elevating the risk of TRM. The inflammation is primarily caused by myeloid bias during haematopoietic reconstitution, which is a commonly overlooked aspect in clinical transplantation, additionally, a lesser extent of irradiation‐induced injury. The administration of the anti‐inflammatory agent resveratrol has the potential to reduce systemic inflammation and TRM by suppressing the NOD‐like receptor signalling pathway and slowing down granulocyte implantation in HSCT mice. This approach did not impair the differentiation potential of haematopoietic stem cells. These findings demonstrate that the 30‐day post‐transplant period represents an opportunity to facilitate HSCT colonisation, mitigate transplant‐related adverse effects, and potentially reap the benefits of anti‐inflammatory treatments.">

        <tr id="Tissue-specific T cell immune responses play a critical role in maintaining organ health but can also drive immune pathology during both autoimmunity and alloimmunity. The mechanisms controlling intratissue T cell programming remain unclear. Here, we leveraged a nonhuman primate model of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to probe the biological underpinnings of tissue-specific alloimmune disease using a comprehensive systems immunology approach including multiparameter flow cytometry, population-based transcriptional profiling, and multiplexed single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed substantial biological differences between T cells infiltrating the lung and liver during aGVHD. These included enrichment for transcriptional pathways controlling extracellular matrix remodeling and chemotaxis in the lung and enrichment for transcriptional pathways linked to nucleic acid metabolism and proliferation in the liver. Single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing substantiated divergent organ-specific transcriptional programing of tissue-infiltrating T cells, which was linked to clonal expansion, with expanded clones progressively enriched for C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1)-expressing CD8 effector T cells in the lung and eomesodermin (EOMES)-expressing CD8 effector-memory T cells in the liver. This divergent evolution of T cells was maintained even for T cells sharing the same TCRs, indicating its independence from antigen specificity. Together, these results provide insights into the role that tissue microenvironment-derived signals play in local T cell transcriptional programming during alloimmune-mediated clonal expansion and suggest potential opportunities to develop tissue-specific therapeutics to curtail pathogenic immunity after transplant.">

Systemic administration of allogenic EVs derived from epithelial and mesenchymal cells has been shown to be safe, despite carrying an array of functional molecules, including thousands of proteins. To address whether epithelial cell-derived EVs can be modified to acquire the capacity to induce an immune response, we engineered 293T EVs to harbor the immunomodulatory molecules CD80, OX40L, and PD-L1. We demonstrated abundant levels of these proteins in the engineered cells and EVs. Functionally, the engineered EVs efficiently elicited positive and negative costimulation of human and murine T cells. In the setting of cancer and autoimmune hepatitis, the engineered EVs modulated T cell functions and altered disease progression. OX40L EVs also provided enhanced antitumor activity in combination with anti-CTLA-4 in melanoma-bearing mice. In addition, we added multiple immunomodulatory proteins in EVs (EVmIM), attempting to elicit an immune response in both lymphoid and myeloid compartments. The EVmIM containing CD80, 4-1BBL, CD40L, CD2, and CD32 engaged both T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) in melanoma tumors, demonstrating the capacity for EVmIM to elicit antitumor activity.

        <tr id="B cell receptor (BCR) signaling plays a central role in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas, making it a crucial therapeutic target. The advent of BCR-targeted inhibitors, particularly those directed at PI3K and BTK, has revolutionized treatment for B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). However, therapeutic resistance remains a significant clinical challenge. Increasing evidence suggests that the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, is crucial in driving cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. The BM microenvironment provides a specialized niche where lymphoma cells can evade therapy through interactions with stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) contribute significantly to this resistance. In this study, we developed an in vitro 3D model to better understand B cell lymphoma biology and drug resistance mechanisms. We co-cultured lymphoma cell lines with primary BMSCs in a 3D fibrin gel matrix using a high-throughput and automated system. Our results revealed that BMSCs modulate lymphoma cell growth and reduce their sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib and the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. Furthermore, this model allowed us to identify IGFBP-3, Serpin E1, and PTX-3 as potential mediators of therapeutic resistance. These findings underscore the value of using 3D co-culture models in preclinical settings to more accurately study drug resistance, as they more closely simulate the BM microenvironment’s complexity than traditional 2D models, thus improving the predictive value of drug testing in B cell lymphomas.

However, the majority of studies have been limited to analyzing immune responses at a single time point, and so, little is known about the spatiotemporal changes that underlie successful tumor rejection after cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we used the CODEX multiplex imaging system with a 32-plex antibody panel to longitudinally characterize the spatial changes in the lymphoid and myeloid cell populations that were previously identified by scRNA-Seq and CyTOF to be associated with complete tumor rejection in mice treated with the combination of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 (combo ICT) in our well-characterized mouse T3 MCA sarcoma model. T3 tumor-bearing mice were treated with control antibody or combo ICT, tumors were harvested at multiple time points (day 7, 9, 10, 11 and 13), fresh frozen, sectioned, and subjected to CODEX multiplex imaging. A total of 42 tumors were imaged with the full range of the tumor-immune boundary. A hierarchical cell clustering approach developed in-house was used to profile 13,051,156 cells resulting in the identification of 13 distinct cell types. Our results show that after ICT the decrease in T3 cells in the tumor tissue starts on day 10 and culminates in the complete elimination of tumor cells by day 13. This immune-mediated response is driven by an increase in CD4+ T cells, which allows them to more frequently co-localize with CD8+ T cells and type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1), forming three-cell clusters with increased cell contacts. This change in cell-to-cell interactions is followed by a broader reorganization of the TME as noted by the expansion of a lymphoid-rich cellular neighborhood (CN) that harbors the majority of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, this CN becomes a hub for T cell effector functions, characterized by an enrichment of GZM-B+ and KI67+ T cells, and exhibits spatial dynamics throughout tumor regression. While both GZM-B+ and KI67+ T cells are observed in proximity to blood vessels on days 7 and 9, they begin to spatially separate into distinct regions after day 10, indicating that cytotoxic T cells move towards areas with tumor cells, while proliferating T cells are more frequently observed at the periphery. This dynamic behavior was further confirmed by assessing the communication rules between CNs, which showed that the lymphoid-rich CN acts by eliminating layers of tumor cells at the tumor boundary and by modulating nearby myeloid populations. Additionally, integration of CODEX dataset with scRNA-seq revealed CD4+ T cells produce Interferon-gamma and a change in the molecular chemotactic pathways orchestrating lymphoid and myeloid communication. Overall, this study provides a detailed spatial view of the cellular events that result in successful ICT and allows us to propose a computational model of the actions of T cells in coordinating the antitumor response after α-CTLA-4/α-PD1.

        <tr id="The lung is continuously exposed to pathogens and other noxious environmental stimuli, rendering it vulnerable to damage, dysfunction, and the development of disease. Studies utilizing mouse models of respiratory infection, allergy, fibrosis, and cancer have been critical to reveal mechanisms of disease progression and identify therapeutic targets. However, most studies focused on the mouse lung prioritize the isolation of either immune cells or epithelial cells, rather than both populations concurrently. Here, we describe a method for preparing a comprehensive single-cell suspension of both immune and non-immune populations suitable for flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These populations include epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and a variety of myeloid cell subsets. This protocol entails bronchoalveolar lavage and subsequent inflation of the lungs with dispase. Lungs are then digested in a liberase mixture. This method of processing liberates a variety of diverse cell types and results in a single-cell suspension that does not require manual dissociation against a filter, promoting cell survival and yielding high numbers of live cells for downstream analyses. In this protocol, we also define gating schemes for epithelial and myeloid cell subsets in both naïve and influenza-infected lungs. Simultaneous isolation of live immune and non-immune cells is key for interrogating intercellular crosstalk and gaining a deeper understanding of lung biology in health and disease.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, necessitating innovative treatments. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are primary immunosuppressive effectors that foster tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. They are broadly categorized into proinflammatory M1 and tumor-promoting M2 phenotypes, with elevated M2 infiltration correlating with poor prognosis. Strategies aimed at inhibiting TAM recruitment, depleting TAMs, or reprogramming M2 to M1 are therefore highly promising. Key signaling pathways, such as CSF-1/CSF-1R, IL-4/IL-13–STAT6, TLRs, and CD47-SIRPα, regulate TAM polarization. Additionally, macrophage-based drug delivery systems permit targeted agent transport to hypoxic regions, enhancing therapy. Preclinical studies combining TAM-targeted therapies with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors have yielded improved responses and prolonged survival. Several clinical trials have also reported benefits in previously unresponsive patients. Future work should clarify the roles of macrophage-derived exosomes, cytokines, and additional mediators in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These insights will inform the design of next-generation drug carriers and optimize combination immunotherapies within precision medicine frameworks. Elucidating TAM phenotypes and their regulatory molecules remains central to developing novel strategies that curb tumor progression and ultimately improve outcomes in lung cancer. Importantly, macrophage-based immunomodulation may offer expanded treatment avenues.">

        <tr id="As the prospect of engineering primary B‐cells for cellular therapies in cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases grows, there is an increasing demand for robust in vitro culture systems that effectively activate human B‐cells isolated from peripheral blood for consistent and efficient expansion and differentiation into various effector phenotypes. Feeder cell‐based systems have shown promise in providing long‐term signaling for expanding B‐cells in vitro. However, these co‐culture systems necessitate more rigorous downstream processing to prevent various feeder cell‐related contaminations in the final product, which limits their clinical potential. In this study, we introduce a microbead‐based CD40L‐presentation platform for stable and consistent activation of human naïve B‐cells. By employing a completely synthetic in vitro culture approach integrating B‐cell receptor, CD21 co‐receptor, toll‐like receptor (TLR‐9), and cytokine signals, we demonstrate that naïve B‐cells can differentiate into memory B‐cells (IgD‐CD38‐/lo + CD27+) and antibody‐secreting cells (IgD‐CD38++CD27+). During this process, B‐cells underwent up to a 50‐fold expansion, accompanied by isotype class switching and low levels of somatic hypermutation, mimicking physiological events within the germinal center. The reproducible generation of highly expanded and differentiated effector B‐cells from naïve B‐cells of multiple donors positions this feeder‐free in vitro synthetic niche as a promising platform for large‐scale production of effector B‐cell therapeutics.">

        <tr id="During tumor immunosurveillance, leukocytes play a crucial role in the cellular defense system, working collaboratively with other immune components to recognize and eliminate aberrant cells. Integral to this process is the integrin Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen 1 (LFA-1). LFA-1 facilitates adhesion during leukocyte migration and helps establish stable cell-to-cell contacts between leukocytes and their targets. Additionally, as a receptor, LFA-1 signaling activates leukocytes, promoting their differentiation and effector functions against cancer. However, tumors can develop mechanisms to evade immune clearance by disrupting LFA-1 functions or hijacking its pathways. In this review, we first detail how leukocytes utilize LFA-1 during immunosurveillance and then explore how tumors counteract this process in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by either altering LFA-1 functions or exploiting it to drive tumorigenesis. Moreover, we discuss therapeutic strategies targeting LFA-1, including inhibitors tested in laboratory studies and animal models, highlighting their potential as anticancer interventions and the need for further research to evaluate their clinical utility.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT MAIT cells are one of the largest unconventional T cell populations and, recruited to the site of infection, play both protective and pathogenic roles during pulmonary viral infections. MAIT cell activation patterns change significantly during COVID‐19, with a notable decrease in their frequency in peripheral blood of severe cases. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiles of various immune checkpoint pathways on MAIT, MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells in moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients undergoing cytokine storm. Despite numerous studies comparing MAIT cell characteristics based on COVID‐19 disease severity, none have delved into the critical differences in MAIT cell immune checkpoint profiles between moderate and severe COVID‐19 patients, all experiencing a cytokine storm. Flow cytometry was used to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 35 patients, comprising 18 moderate and 17 severe cases, alongside 14 healthy controls. Our investigation specifically focuses on severe COVID‐19 presentations, revealing a marked deletion of MAIT cells. Further exploration into the regulatory dynamics of MAIT cell functionality reveals shifts in the expression profiles of critical immune checkpoint receptors, notably PD‐1 and CD226. In severe COVID‐19 patients, MAIT cells showed a significant decrease in the expression of CD226, whereas MAIT‐like and non‐MAIT cells demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of PD‐1 compared to healthy individuals. The expression of the TIGIT receptor remained unaltered across all investigated groups. Our findings contribute to the existing knowledge by elucidating the changes in MAIT cell subpopulations and their potential role in COVID‐19 disease severity.">

        <tr id="Memory T cells are critical for secondary immunity against pathogens, yet their persistence in the absence of antigen remains unclear. While memory CD8+ T cells are known to persist independently of their cognate antigen, the durability of memory CD4+ T cells in the absence of antigen remains controversial. Recovery from cutaneous leishmaniasis confers lifelong immunity, largely mediated by CD4+ T cells, but the necessity of persistent parasites for sustaining this immunity has not been empirically confirmed. We investigated immunity in mice infected with a dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts)-deficient Leishmania major, which cannot persist due to their thymidine salvage deficiency. These mice lost protection against wild-type challenge, correlating with a decline in Leishmania (PEPCK)-specific CD4+ T cells. To further dissect this relationship, we generated PEPCK-specific CD4+ TCR transgenic (PEG) mice, enabling precise tracking of Leishmania-specific memory CD4+ T cells. Both in vitro and in vivo-generated memory PEG cells gradually disappeared over time in the absence of antigen, irrespective of the host’s MHC II status, and this loss paralleled the erosion of infection-induced immunity. PEG and endogenous PEPCK-specific memory cells were not maintained in mice infected with dhfr-ts- or PEPCK-deficient L. major, resulting in loss of recall responses and secondary immunity. These findings demonstrate that continuous antigen presence is crucial for maintaining Leishmania-specific memory CD4+ T cells and highlight the role of persistent antigen in sustaining long-term immunity against chronic infections.">

HLA-edited PCOs (ePCOs) displayed the same phenotypical and functional characteristics as parental un-edited PCOs.

        <tr id="Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT), particularly tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL), holds great promise for cancer treatment, yet it still faces major challenges such as variability in expansion rates, cytotoxic potency and immune suppression. Recent studies suggest that a “synthetic immune niche” (SIN), composed of immobilized CCL21 and ICAM-1, enhances both the expansion and cytotoxicity of murine and patient-derived T cells. Here, we investigate the mechanism underlying the expansion variability by identifying morphological and molecular markers that distinguish low- and high-expanding TILs and predict their ex vivo expansion potential. We further developed novel SIN-based strategies that differentially reinforce the efficacy of both low- and high-expanding TILs. We demonstrate that a 14-day REP with feeder cells and SIN facilitates the proliferation of the low-expanding cells, while the high-expanding counterparts benefit from a sequential expansion protocol of 7 days with feeder cells only, followed by 7 days with SIN treatment. At the end of the REP both TIL populations display high levels of granzyme B and perforin and reduced levels of exhaustion markers. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the refined CCL21+ICAM1 SIN treatment improves expansion rates and activation profiles of both TIL populations, thereby enabling personalized SIN-enhanced protocols for TIL-based immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has brought hope for patients with cancer and showed promising results and a high cure rate in various types of hematological malignancies. However, cellular therapy can lead to profound immunodeficiency of the innate and adaptive immune systems, whether at the systemic or at the local cellular immune response, which is a major predisposing risk factor for invasive opportunistic infection, including fungal, viral, and bacterial pathogens. The role of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and their antigen specificity in humans remains largely unknown, but Tregs have been implicated in a wide range of modulating viral and fungal infections. Though there have been many advancements regarding the use of CAR T-cells in treating hematological malignancies, the intricate and homeostatic role of Tregs in influencing therapeutic outcomes and infection risk remains underexplored. Most published literature on this topic focuses on the role of Treg in the immunosuppression necessary for successful CAR T-cell therapy rather than the dual function of Treg in immunosuppression and immune recovery. We intend to bridge this gap with a specific focus on the contribution of Tregs in the modulation of CAR T-cell efficacy and their role in opportunistic infections after therapy. In this review, we described the potential role and dynamics of Tregs following CAR T-cell therapy, offering an expanded understanding of their impact on patient outcomes and highlighting areas for future research.">

 Background:
 Recent studies indicate that the efficacy of chemotherapy is significantly influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment. Peritoneal cavity contains many immune cells, however, the relationship between immune response within the peritoneal cavity and tumor response remains poorly understood.
 Methods:
 Single cell suspensions were obtained from ascites or peritoneal lavages from 41 patients with PM from GC. In 28 patients, cells were collected both before and after 1-3 courses of IP chemotherapy. These samples were immunestained with mAbs targeting to specific lymphoid or myeloid subsets, and their proportions in CD45(+) leukocytes were analyzed using flowcytometry. Eosinophils were purified by magnetic cell sorting for subsequent RNA-Seq analysis.
 Results:
 Among 41 patients with PM, tumor leukocyte ratio (TLR) calculated as CD326(+) tumor cells divided by CD45(+) leukocytes varied from 0.002% to 58.1%. TLR was not correlated with any ratios of immune cells, however, the ratios of CD8(+) T cells, NK cells and CD16(-) CD193(+) eosinophils tended to decrease with the increase in TLR. Conversely, the ratios of CD19(+) B cell, CD14(+) macrophages and CD16(+) neutrophils increased with elevated TLR. Mean survival time of these patients was 17.7 months. None of the leukocyte subsets showed significant association with patient outcome. In 28 patients, the ratios of lymphocytes mostly decreased with significant difference in CD4(+) T cells and CD19(+) B cells after IP treatment. In contrast, the ratio of CD11b(+) myeloid cells increased in peritoneal cavity after IP treatment. Among the myeloid cells, the ratio of CD16(-) CD193(+) eosinophils significantly increased. The change was particularly prominent in in post-treatment negative peritoneal lavage cytology (CY0) patients (M=0.47% vs M=10.0%, p<0.0001), while the difference was not significant in post-treatment positive peritoneal lavage cytology (CY1) patients (M=0.93% vs M=0.97%, p=0.84). Patients with eosinophil ratio of ≥2% after IP chemotherapy in peritoneal cavity had significantly longer overall survival compared to those with lower eosinophil ratios (17.3 mo vs 26.7 mo, p=0.034; HR =0.23[0.06-0.89]). The peritoneal eosinophils after IP treatment exhibited elevated levels of CD11b and CD63 expression compared to circulating eosinophils (p<0.01), while SSC-A levels tended to be lower. Gene ontology pathways revealed enrichment of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, extracellular matrix organization and response to interferon-gamma in peritoneal eosinophils (p<0.0001).
 Conclusions:
 IP-PTX induces eosinophil activation and recruitment in the peritoneal cavity, while also affecting other types of immune cells. These effects may potentially contribute to the anti-tumor response against peritoneal metastases.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Statins, a class of HMG‐CoA reductase inhibitors, exhibit prophylactic benefits against immune rejection induced by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo‐HSCT). Despite the protective function is confirmed, the precise mechanism to induce immune tolerance of statin in the initial stages of transplantation remains incompletely understood. Given that Treg cells play a critical role in preventing graft versus host response and Foxp3 as a transcription factor of Treg can be induced by statins, we hypothesize that the immunosuppressive effects of statins are partially mediated through regulation of Treg cells expansion. Methods T cells were stimulated in vitro under anti‐CD3/anti‐CD28/IL‐2/TGF‐β condition or allo‐reactive system with or without the addition of statins. The induction of Tregs were detected using flow cytometry. Allo‐HSCT models were established by transferring donor cells alone or combined with recipient treated by fluvastatin. The proportions of Treg and phenotypes of effector T cells were identified. Cytokine secretion and antigen‐presenting cell (APC) function were tested in irradiated mice. Results Statins induced higher Treg production in classical and allogeneic cell co‐culture conditions in vitro. In the early stage of models treated with fluvastatin only in donors or combined treatment of donors and recipients, a similar phenomenon was observed with elevated levels of Foxp3+ Treg along with increased expression of CCR7, CD62L, and S1P1 on allo‐reactive T cells. Fluvastatin treatment suppressed the secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines IFN‐γ and TNF‐α by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in irradiated mice. Furthermore, fluvastatin also contributed to restraining the numbers and activation of APCs, including dentritic cells (DCs) and macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Our finding demonstrated that statin exposure modulates immune responses during the initial phase of allo‐HSCT by promoting Treg expansion and suppressing inflammatory reactions, which supply a promising strategy for aGVHD prevention.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Introduction Although repeated exposure to HIV‐1 can result in infection, some individuals remain seronegative without clinical or serologic evidence of infection; these individuals are known as HIV‐1‐exposed seronegative individuals. This population has been extensively studied to understand the mechanisms associated with natural resistance to HIV infection. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain this resistance: some researchers associated resistance with a low activation phenotype characterized by a decrease in the activation and proliferation of immune system cells linked with infection control and decreased production of cytokines and pro‐inflammatory molecules, whereas others suggest that resistance is related to immune system activation and the expression of high levels of chemokines, pro‐inflammatory cytokines and antiviral molecules. Aims Our study aims to review and analyze the most relevant evidence supporting the role of the activation level of the immune system during natural resistance to HIV‐1 infection. Methods A search was conducted via the PubMed, SciELO and ScienceDirect databases. The literature search was performed in a nonsystematic manner. Articles published in the last five decades addressing immune activation mechanisms in natural resistance to HIV were reviewed. Results A low‐activation phenotype, characterized by a high frequency of Treg cells; reduced expression of CD25, CD38, and HLA‐DR; and lower production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in peripheral and mucosal tissues, plays a key role in reducing the number of activated cells susceptible to infection, but it minimizes chronic inflammation, facilitating viral entry and spread. In contrast, the activation phenotype is associated with high expression of markers such as CD25, CD38, and HLA‐DR, along with elevated high levels of interferon‐stimulated genes and pro‐inflammatory cytokines. This profile could promote infection control while increasing the number of virus‐susceptible cells. Conclusion The complexity of the immune response during HIV exposure, reflected in the conflicting evidence concerning whether low or high immune activation offers protection against infection, suggests that there may be multiple pathways to HIV‐1 resistance, influenced by factors such as the type of viral exposure, the immune environment, and individual genetics. Further research is needed to determine which immune states are protective and how these responses can be modulated to prevent infection.">

        <tr id="Background Trafficking of immune cells to the central nervous system is hypothesized to facilitate HIV entry and immune-induced neuronal injury and is mediated by surface proteins such as chemokine receptors and α4 integrin. We longitudinally assessed immune cell activation and surface marker expression in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood and their relationship with CSF HIV RNA beginning during primary HIV infection (PHI) before and after antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods Longitudinal paired blood and CSF were obtained in ART-naïve PHI (<12 month since infection) participants; some independently initiated ART during follow up. Multiparameter flow cytometry of fresh samples determined activation (% CD38+HLADR+) and chemokine receptor expression (% CCR5+ and CXCR3+) on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and subtype and α4 integrin expression (% and mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) of CD49d+) on monocytes. HIV RNA was quantified by PCR. Analyses employed Spearman correlation, within-subject correlation, and linear mixed models. Results 51 participants enrolled at a median 3.2 months post HIV transmission with 168 total visits (113 pre-ART, 55 post-ART) and a median of 6.5 months of longitudinal follow up (range 0-40). In pre-ART PHI, frequencies of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were much higher in CSF than in blood, with levels similar to ART-naïve people with chronic HIV infection. Both CSF CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation increased longitudinally prior to initiation of ART. In multivariate analysis, CSF CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell activation independently predicted CSF HIV RNA. Neither CSF monocyte subtypes or α4 expression correlated with CSF HIV RNA. Blood monocyte α4 MFI correlated with CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation (p<0.05). Following ART initiation, blood but not CSF T cell activation declined with days on treatment (slope=-0.06, p=0.001). During ART, blood and CSF monocyte α4 MFI correlated with T cell activation (p<0.05). Conclusions In untreated early infection after PHI, immune activation increases over time, and CSF CD4+ T cell activation but not monocyte activation correlates with CSF HIV RNA. Intrathecal T cell activation does not decline during early follow up on ART. Immunomodulating therapies may be needed to prevent neuronal injury and HIV neuroinvasion during early HIV.">

        <tr id="Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The asymptomatic progression of early-stage HCC often results in diagnosis at advanced stages, significantly limiting therapeutic options and worsening prognosis. Immunotherapy, with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) at the forefront, has revolutionized HCC treatment. Nevertheless, tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and the presence of immunosuppressive components within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) continue to compromise its efficacy. Furthermore, resistance or non-responsiveness to ICIs in some patients underscores the urgent need to unravel the complexities of the TIME and to design innovative strategies that enhance immunotherapeutic outcomes. Emerging evidence has revealed the pivotal role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a prominent RNA methylation modification, in shaping the TIME in HCC. By regulating RNA stability and translation, m6A influences immune-related factors, including cytokines and immune checkpoint molecules. This modification governs PD-L1 expression, facilitating immune escape and contributing to resistance against ICIs. Advances in this field have also identified m6A-related regulators as promising biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy response and as potential therapeutic targets for optimizing treatment efficacy. This review examines the regulatory mechanisms of m6A modification within the TIME of HCC, with a focus on its impact on immune cells and cytokine dynamics. It also explores the therapeutic potential of targeting m6A pathways to improve immunotherapy efficacy and outlines emerging directions for future research. These insights aim to provide a foundation for developing novel strategies to overcome immune resistance and advance HCC treatment.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Lung cancer is among the most common and deadliest malignant tumors worldwide. It is often detected at late stages, resulting in unfavorable outcomes, with tumor cell heterogeneity and medication resistance. Tumor‐associated macrophages are among the key cells contributing to cancer progression. They are categorized into two primary phenotypes: Proinflammatory (M1) and anti‐inflammatory (M2) which are involved in the onset and progression of NSCLC. The role of common cytokines secreted by macrophages in the progression of lung cancer are described, and the effects of various substances such as RNA or protein on the differentiation and polarization of two phenotypes of macrophages are highlighted to characterize the impact of the immune state of tumors on therapeutic effect of treatments and patient prognosis. Researchers have primarily aimed to investigate innovative carriers and strategies based on macrophages to modify the tumor microenvironment. Objectives These approaches are often integrated with other treatments, particularly immunotherapy, to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Methods A comprehensive review was carried out by systematically synthesizing existing literature on PubMed, using the combination of the keywords “TAMs”, “NSCLC”, “Drug resistance”, and “therapy”. The available studies were screened for selection based on quality and relevance. Conclusions TAMs promote tumor invasion, growth, and metastasis by promoting angiogenesis and EMT. In addition, they contribute to the development of drug resistance and the immunosuppressive microenvironment establishment. The immunosuppressive factors secreted by TAM can weaken the activity of immune cells, inhibit their killing effect on tumors, leading to immune suppression and hindering the effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, TAM is a key target for the development of cancer immunotherapy. Various strategies are being explored, including reducing the recruitment of TAMs and influencing their polarization to treat NSCLC. In addition, TAMs based treatment systems can achieve precise delivery of drugs or gene interfering molecules without causing side effects.">

Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have shown clinical benefit in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) derived brain metastasis (BM), however, their efficacy in lung to leptomeningeal brain metastasis (LLBM) remains poor.


METHODS
A paired matched RNA expression dataset of patients with NSCLCs and BMs was analyzed to idenfiy BM specific suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) features. Next, we created immune-competent LLBM mouse models that mimic clinical LLBM. We evaluated the efficacy of intrathecal (IT) delivery of allogeneic stem cells (SCs) engineered to release single-chain variable fragment anti-PD-1 (scFvPD-1). To enhance tumor cell killing and subsequent modulation of the immune TME, we explored the therapeutic activity of dual SCs releasing oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) and scFvPD-1 and profiled immune and metabolic consequences.


RESULTS
RNA sequencing analysis of primary NSCLCs and BMs revealed an immune-suppressive TME with reduced immune cells and increased PD-1+ T cells in BMs. We showed significantly decreased immune cells and increased PD-1+ T cells in the TME of LLBM compared to primary NSCLC tumors in LLBM mouse tumor models. Next, we showed that locoregional IT treatment with SC releasing scFvPD-1, but not conventional systemic injection of anti-PD-1 antibody, suppressed tumor growth and improved survival in our immune-competent LLBM models. Furthermore, dual SCs releasing oHSV and scFvPD-1 (SC-oHSV/scFvPD-1) enhanced therapeutic outcomes by inducing oHSV-mediated immunogenic cell death, activating anti-tumor T cell signaling, and disrupting oxidative phosphorylation, which sensitized tumors to cisplatin.


CONCLUSION
Locoregional delivery of SC-oHSV/scFvPD-1 effectively targets the immune-suppressive TME in LLBM, providing a promising strategy for treating LLBM.">

 A major hurdle in treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is a lack of response (primary resistance) and relapse after an initial response (acquired resistance). Recent studies reveal that responses to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade are associated with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, and high baseline PD-L1 expression within the tumor microenvironment (TME), while impaired tumor antigen presentation and the immunosuppressive TME have been associated with ICB resistance. Numerous studies have established that the generation of an anti-tumor immune response driven by CD8+ T cells requires type I conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) mediated cross presentation of tumor associated antigens, which can license CD8+ T cells to initiate an anti-tumor immune response. In addition, previous publications have shown that systemic administration of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) cytokine can expand endogenous cDC1s in the TME and augment anti-tumor immune responses to ICB therapy. Considering these data, we hypothesize that a viable approach to overcome NSCLC anti-PD-1 resistance is to intratumorally vaccinate tumors with Flt3l-gene modified cDC1s. Using lenti-viral transduction, we engineered murine CD103+ cDC1s to constitutively secrete FLT3L (FLT3L_cDC1) and performed in situ vaccination studies on murine models of NSCLC with Lkb1-deficiency and elevated TMB that better represents human disease. In situ vaccination with FLT3L_cDC1 promotes anti-tumor immune responses in NSCLC tumors that are non-responders to unmodified cDC1 vaccination and synergizes with anti-PD-1 ICB to significantly inhibit tumor growth. FLT3L_cDC1 therapy induces significant activation and expansion T cells within the TME at both an early and late timepoint post vaccination. Furthermore, FLT3L_cDC1 + anti-PD-1 combination therapy significantly increases DC progenitor numbers within the tumor draining lymph node, including DC progenitors that are committed to the cDC1 lineage. NSCLC tumor bearing mice cured following FLT3L_cDC1 + anti-PD-1 therapy independently reject rechallenge with the same NSCLC tumor model, suggesting that combination therapy promotes tumor-specific immune memory responses. Our data suggests in situ vaccination with FLT3L_cDC1 represents a promising strategy to potentiate the efficacy of ICB and can improve outcomes for patients with primary resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy.

In the tumor microenvironment (TME), hypoxia stands as a significant factor that modulates immune responses, especially those driven by T cells. As T cell-based therapies often fail to work in solid tumors, this study aims to investigate the effects of hypoxia on T cell topo-distribution in the TME, gene expression association with T cell states, and clinical responses in melanoma.


METHODS
To generate detailed information on tumor oxygenation and T cell accessibility, we used mathematical modeling of human melanoma tissue microarrays that incorporate oxygen supply from vessels, intratumoral diffusion, and cellular uptake. We created tumor maps and derived plots showing the fraction of CD4 and CD8 T cells against the distance to the nearest vessel and oxygen pressure. To assess their function and transcriptional changes caused by hypoxia, effector T cells were generated and cultured under hypoxia (0.5% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen). The T cell hypoxia-transcriptional signature was compared against datasets from msigDB, iATLAS (clinical trials of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)), ORIEN AVATAR (real-world melanoma patients treated with ICIs), and a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.


RESULTS
We made three specific observations: (1) in melanoma T cells preferentially accumulated in oxygenated areas close to blood vessels (50-100 µm from the vasculature in the regions of high oxygen availability) but not in hypoxic areas far from blood vessels. (2) Our analysis confirmed that under hypoxia, T cell functions were significantly reduced compared with normoxic conditions and accompanied by a unique gene signature. Furthermore, this hypoxic gene signature was prevalent in resting and non-activated T cells. Notably and clinically relevant, the hypoxic T cell gene set was found to correlate with reduced overall survival and reduced progression-free survival in melanoma patients, which was more pronounced in non-responder patients undergoing ICI therapy. (3) Finally, compared with a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating T cells, our hypoxia signature aligned with a population of cells at a state termed stress response state (TSTR).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study highlights the critical role of hypoxia in shaping T cell distribution and its correlation with clinical outcomes in melanoma. We revealed a preferential accumulation of T cells in oxygenated areas. Moreover, hypoxic T cells develop a distinct hypoxic gene signature prevalent in resting, non-activated T cells and TSTR that was also associated with poorer outcomes, particularly pronounced among non-responders to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), are often chronic with no cures. An underlying commonality of autoimmune diseases is immune-mediated inflammation. Control of inflammation is achieved by steroids and disease-modifying therapies, which can result in severe side-effects. CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Treg), are essential to controlling autoimmune responses and are considered a strong therapeutic target with minimal side effects. To that end, we leveraged our identification of B cell IgD low (BDL) B cells that control Treg homeostatic levels in the mouse spleen in a GITRL-dependent manner to demonstrate that overexpression of GITRL by BDL using a B cell-specific GITRL transgene (tg) was sufficient to increase endogenous Treg numbers and attenuate the disease severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model of MS. To determine whether increased GITRL expression by BDL could be a therapeutic strategy, WT mice were transplanted with bone marrow from GITRLtg mice. After reconstitution, GITRL expression was increased on BDL, Treg numbers were significantly elevated, and EAE was dramatically attenuated. These cumulative data further demonstrate that GITRL is a functional receptor on BDL and its overexpression in B cells is a therapeutic strategy to increase endogenous Treg numbers for treating autoimmunity.">

        <tr id="In the initial phase of infections, prior to the development of the follicular antibody response, an extrafollicular B cell response develops in lymphoid organs, with activation of cells displaying B cell receptors with low affinity to the different epitopes of the invading pathogen. To evaluate if this response allows early protection in the murine host, we investigated its role during infection with Sylvio X10/4 (a low virulence Trypanosoma cruzi parasite) of CD28KO mice, a mouse strain that does not develop a follicular antibody response, in parallel with infected C57BL/6 mice (used as control). We observed that T. cruzi infection allowed CD28KO mice to survive for a long period of time, ranging from a few weeks to almost a year. However, the CD28KO mice showed higher levels of subpatent parasitemia than C57BL/6 mice, as well as more intense and long-lasting inflammatory infiltrates in the heart. Following the CD28KO mice throughout the infection, we found a significant reduction in the number of CD8+ T cells in the spleen, but not CD4+ T cells, as well as a strong fluctuation in the number of B cells. Meanwhile, although the production of IFN-γ in the spleen was not affected by CD28 deficiency, a reduction in IL-2 production was observed in anti-CD3 stimulated CD4+ T cells from infected CD28KO mice. Regarding the humoral response, after confirming that the T follicular helper (TFH) cells and germinal center B cells (GC-B) were absent in the infected CD28KO mice, we demonstrated that the extrafollicular antibodies, present in CD28KO infected mice, allowed an early protection in the murine host, since the transfer of serum from chronic CD28KO mice to naïve CD28KO mice, which were infected with T. cruzi 24 hours later, promoted a significant reduction in parasitemia. These results demonstrate that low-affinity anti-T cruzi extrafollicular antibodies contribute to the control of circulating parasites, allowing Sylvio X10/4-infected CD28KO mice to survive for a long time.

        <tr id="Simple Summary Neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cells crucial for fighting infections, exhibit both tumor-promoting and tumor-inhibiting roles in cancer. This dual behavior depends on the environment around the tumor and includes remodeling the extracellular matrix, fostering angiogenesis, inducing cancer cell death, and enhancing immune responses. A notable yet underexplored phenomenon is the engulfment of neutrophils by cancer cells, potentially mediated by LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). This process raises critical questions about its role in either aiding immune evasion or triggering cancer cell death through mechanisms such as ferroptosis. This review delves into neutrophil biology, their complex roles in cancer, the impact of LAP on neutrophil engulfment, and the therapeutic implications of modulating this pathway. Additionally, it highlights the potential of neutrophils as delivery systems for cancer therapies, underscoring the need to unravel tumor-associated neutrophil functions and LAP mechanisms to inform novel and effective cancer treatments.">

STING signaling activation in these myeloid cells enhances local type I interferon (IFN) production, inducing an innate immune response that mobilizes adaptive immunity and reprograms immunosuppressive myeloid populations to drive antitumor immunity. Here, we generated TAK-500, an immune cell directed antibody drug conjugate (iADC), to deliver a STING agonist to CCR2+ human cells and drive enhanced antitumor activity relative to non-targeted STING agonists. Preclinically, TAK-500 triggered dose-dependent innate immune activation in vitro. In addition, a murine TAK-500 iADC surrogate enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses both in vitro and in murine tumor models. Spatially resolved analysis of CCR2 and immune cell markers in the TME of >1,000 primary human tumors showed the CCR2 protein was predominantly expressed in intratumoral myeloid cells.

        <tr id="Introduction. Immune memory is a tool of the adaptive immune system that allows it responding quickly and effectively to repeated contact with an antigen. The role of memory cell populations in the recurrence and progression of immune-dependent diseases is shown. 
Aim. To determine the trend in memory T-cell populations depending on the effectiveness of biological therapy (BT) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis (PS). 
Materials and methods. Four hundred fifty children with immunosuppressive diseases (ISD) were examined during different periods of administration of biological drugs: IBD — 162 children (infliximab /adalimumab), MS — 116 children (interferon β1α — IFNβ1α), PS — 172 children (adalimumab). The effectiveness of BT was assessed using clinical activity indices and functional methods. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry to determine populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell: central (TCM), effector (TEM), and terminally differentiated (TEMRA). Statistical data processing was carried out in the Statistica 16.0 program, using the Mann–Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation analysis (p < 0.05). In the SPSS version 25 software, ROC analysis was performed in the efficiency–inefficiency separation model. 
Results. In all forms of pathology, changes in the content of memory T-cells have been established depending on the activity of inflammation. In IBD and PS patients, with an increase in the indices of disease activity, a decrease in the levels of CD4+ naive T-cells (TNAIVE) and an increase of TCM were detected. In MS patients with active foci, an MRI scan showed a decrease in the percentage of naive CD8+ T-cells (TcytNAIVE) and an increase in the population of CD8+ TEM. The content of TNAIVE populations decreased with age, and memory T-cells increased in patients with all the studied forms of pathology. In patients with BT efficacy, a high content of TNAIVE populations and a low content of TCM were found compared with the levels in patients with insufficient BT efficacy. Thresholds have been determined for IBD, MS, and PS patients, which make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT. An increase in the levels of TNAIVE and TcytNAIVE makes it possible to predict the presence of a BT effect, an increase in the levels of TCM, CD4+ TEM, and CD8+ ТEMRA make it possible to predict the absence or insufficient effect of BT. 
Conclusion. The activity of the inflammatory process is reflected in the differentiation of populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells. With the effectiveness of BT, the number of TNAIVE increases with a decrease in the number of TCM and TEM in patients with immune-dependent diseases, regardless of the form of pathology and the drug used. Threshold values for memory T-cells populations make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors include targeting additional immunosuppressive compartments in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Inhibitory macrophages (Mφ) can be one of the most abundant immune cells in the TME associated with poor prognosis. However, to date, selective Mφ depletion strategies as a cancer immunotherapy have not been successful in clinical trials. Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure (MARCO) is one of a family of class-A scavenger receptors expressed by Mφ in the TME and is one of the most upregulated transcripts in dendritic cells (DC) following their ex vivo uptake of dead tumor cells. The clinical significance of MARCO expression in the TME is not fully understood.


METHODS
The therapeutic potential of targeting MARCO by an anti-murine MARCO (ED31, clone ED31) monoclonal antibody, which inhibits ligand-binding to MARCO, was explored in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) in C57BL/6J mice bearing B16F10 or Pan02 tumors. The mechanism by which ED31 impacts the TME was investigated by flow cytometry in the different treatment arms. The contribution of Mφ was assessed by both in vivo depletion and in vitro functional assays. Chemokine production was measured by a bead-based multiplex assay.


RESULTS
ED31 enhanced antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4, but not of anti-PD-1. Analysis of the TME revealed that adding ED31 to anti-CTLA-4 substantially increased immune cell infiltration, including mature conventional DC recruitment, that was due to a switch to M1-pattern chemokines by Mφ. Mφ depletion completely abrogated both the increase in immune cell infiltration and chemokine production, and abolished the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy.


CONCLUSIONS
Targeting MARCO as an additional checkpoint in the TME can offer a strategy to improve the antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 through a mechanism involving Mφ reprogramming rather than their depletion.">

 Regulatory CD8 T cells (CD8 Treg) are responsible for the selective killing of self-reactive and pathogenic T cells to maintain peripheral immune tolerance. In autoimmune disease, CD8 Treg fail to control the expansion of pathogenic T cells that subsequently cause tissue destruction. This CD8 Treg dysfunction is due in part to the expression of inhibitory KIR receptors (KIR2DL1/2/3), which serve as autoimmune checkpoints, and insufficient ICOS (inducible T cell co-stimulator) signaling, which is a primary costimulatory receptor for CD8 Treg. We have demonstrated that in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the expression of inhibitory KIR and ICOS on CD8 Treg is increased relative to that in healthy controls, with downstream dysfunctions of their cytolytic capacity and signaling pathways that promote CD8 T cell longevity and memory. Here we present pre-clinical characterization of the CD8 Treg modulator MTX-201, a bispecific antibody that binds to inhibitory KIR and ICOS that are co-expressed by CD8 Treg. MTX-201 binding antagonizes inhibitory KIR signaling and promotes ICOS co-stimulation, resulting in restored CD8 Treg activation and memory, cytolytic capacity, and functions in highly inflamed tissues, including improved metabolic flexibility and deferred exhaustion.



 Using in vitro testing of Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis (UC) patient derived PBMC, ex vivo tissue organoids, and in vivo testing in a highly inflammatory humanized acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) mouse model, we assessed the binding, specificity, and mechanisms of action of MTX-201. MTX-201 bound to CD8 Treg in mixed PBMC at low nanomolar concentrations, and select single target expressing immune cells, such as activated CD4 T cells. However, MTX-201 increased ICOS downstream effects in inhibitory KIR-expressing CD8 Treg without activating immune cells expressing only ICOS or KIR. In the GVHD model, MTX-201 extended survival and reduced disease score, marked by an increase in CD8 Treg and a reduction of activated CD4 T cells. In antigen stimulated PBMC from patients with either UC or Crohn’s disease, MTX-201 also reduced pathogenic T cell responses without evidence of broad immunosuppression, and reduced antigen induced epithelial cell death in colonic tissue derived organoids containing either tissue resident or engrafted IBD patient-derived T cells. MTX-201 had antibody-like pharmacokinetic parameters with good tolerability, no toxicity, or induction of proinflammatory serum cytokines in repeat dose studies at doses up to 50 mg/kg in CD34+NSG-Tg(Hu-IL15) mice harboring stable engraftments of human lymphocytes, including CD8 Treg cells.



 Collectively, our data support the development of MTX-201 as a therapeutic to restore CD8 Treg functions in patients for the treatment of IBD.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background There is a need for noninvasive immunological biomarkers that can identify stable kidney allograft immune quiescence to inform individualized immunosuppression. Methods We conducted a cross‐sectional, pilot cohort study evaluating the relative abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to effector T‐cell (Teff) populations as a surrogate marker of long‐term graft tolerance. We obtained fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients, most with recent surveillance biopsies to identify the presence or absence of chronic inflammation. Tregs were sub‐phenotyped as naïve, memory, and activated Tregs (aTreg). Treg/Teff ratios were modeled for association with chronic inflammation and in the context of potential clinical features. Results Twenty‐seven patient samples were included on standard immunosuppression (tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone) with a mean age of 9.2 ± 5.0 years, at 30.2 ± 21.7 months posttransplant. The ratio of aTreg (FOXP3++CD45RA−) to Th17 cells (CD4+IL‐17+) was significantly greater in patients without inflammation than in patients with graft inflammation (p < 0.01). Similarly, there was a trend toward greater aTreg/CD4+ T cells and aTreg/CD8+ Teff in patients without inflammation (p = 0.05 and 0.09, respectively). There was no significant association for inflammation with naïve or memory Treg/Teff ratios. Multiple logistic regression with all three aTreg/Teff ratios modeled allograft inflammation with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.83, 95% CI 0.67–0.98). Conclusions The proportion of peripheral blood aTregs/Teff cells in this pilot cohort of stable pediatric kidney transplant recipients was associated with immune quiescence. These data support further investigation into aTreg/Teff monitoring to inform precision immunosuppressive treatment.">

While it is plausible that HIV-induced immunosuppression could result in a more severe progression, the exact mechanisms remain undetermined. To better understand the immunopathology of MPXV in patients with and without HIV infection, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from six patients hospitalized for MPXV, three of whom had HIV infection (HIV antibody positive and HIV RNA level below the detection limit), and three patients only infected with MPXV (HIV-). We map the peripheral immune response in both the acute phase and the recovery period, showing the reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotypes in acute stage compared with recovery stage, characterized by disturbed cell subsets and intense cell interactions mediated by monocytes and neutrophils. Importantly, we also found obviously dysregulated gene expression and cell subsets in HIV+ patients proposing mechanism underlying their serious condition. Our findings provide a comprehensive cell atlas of MPXV patients, shed light on the mechanisms underlying the severe disease progression and longer recovery time in HIV+ individuals.">

 Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine how T cell engagers (TCEs) impact the localization and phenotype of key T-cell subsets in preclinical solid tumor models. Background: TCEs are a class of immunotherapy that have demonstrated substantial benefit to patients with hematologic cancers and have shown evidence of clinical activity in solid tumor malignancies. Mechanisms of response to TCEs, particularly in solid tumors, are not well understood. Identification of diagnostic strategies to stratify patients that are more likely to respond is expected to enhance the clinical benefit of TCEs. Friedrich et al. (Cancer Cell 2023) found that effector CD8 T cell subsets significantly expanded in TCE responsive but not refractory patients in multiple myeloma using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Furthermore, the increased abundance of exhausted T cells at baseline was associated with a worse prognosis. We hypothesize that analogous populations exist in preclinical solid tumor models, which have distinct localization and cellular interactions within the TCE treated tumor microenvironment. Methods: Either hCD3 transgenic C57BL/6J or wildtype FVB mice were implanted with either ID8-LyPD1 or Fo5-HER2 tumors. Mice were grouped at a tumor volume of ∼ 300mm^3 and treated with either 10mpk of LyPD1 TCE, 5mpk of HER2 TCE, or vehicle. scRNAseq data was produced at day 1 and 4 post-treatment according to the 10X gene expression kit protocol and was processed in R using Seurat. Flow cytometry data was generated using commercially available antibodies, acquired on a BD FACSymphony and analyzed using FlowJo. Xenium data was generated using a custom probe panel according to the 10X Xenium protocol and was processed in either Python or R using the Squidpy or Seurat packages. Results: In the ID8-LyPD1 TCE model, we identified proliferative effector (CD8.pe) and terminally differentiated (CD8.Tex) CD8 populations by scRNAseq. The abundance of CD8.pe increased 3-fold and CD8.Tex expanded 2-fold upon TCE treatment. We then validated the expansion of these CD8 subsets by flow cytometry. Notably, increases in the number of CD8.pe per gram of tumor significantly correlated with reductions in tumor volume. Due to the impact of TCE treatment on these CD8 subsets and the importance of CD8.pe in tumor outcomes, we profiled the localization and cellular interactions of CD8s in preclinical solid tumors. Cell-cell communication inference analysis suggested that CD8s were more frequently targets of cellular interactions in TCE treated tumors. Utilizing Xenium spatial transcriptomics we verified that CD8.pe and CD8.Tex were more abundant in TCE treated samples and that their interactions with other key cell subsets were enhanced by TCE treatment. Conclusions: In summary we found that key CD8 subsets were expanded by TCE treatment in preclinical solid tumor models, that the abundance of CD8.pe correlates with reduced tumor burden, and that TCE treatment promotes cellular interactions among CD8s and other key cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment.

        <tr id="Abstract Background Due to their enhanced responsiveness and persistence, cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML)-natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as new immunotherapeutic tools against malignancies. However, their effects on tumor-cell spread and metastases in solid tumors remain poorly investigated. Moreover, a clear identification of the most effective CIML-NK subsets, especially in controlling cancer stem cells (CSC), is still lacking. Methods We performed combined phenotypical and functional analyses of CIML-NK cell subsets, either selected by flow-cytometry gating, or generated from sorted CD56bright/CD56dim NK cells. By co-culture experiments, we analyzed the effect of CIML-NK cells on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell spheroids, or patient-derived xenografts (PDX), assessing changes in their CSC content, tumorigenicity, and/or tumor disseminating capability in vivo. CIML-NK cells were also infused in PDX-bearing mice to validate their effect on the CSC dissemination from the PDX to the lungs. Finally, we generated and functionally analyzed CIML-NK cells from patients with stages I/III NSCLC (n=6). Results We show that CIML-NK cells exert antitumor activity mostly through their CD56bright cell subset, which greatly expands during CIML differentiation. Compared with NK cells conventionally activated with interleukin-2, CIML-NK cells express lower levels of check-point receptors, TIGIT and TIM3, and higher effector functions against NSCLC cells from PDX, and against in vitro-generated tumor spheroids. Remarkably, CIML-NK cells also significantly reduce the CSC-containing CD133+ cell subpopulation within spheroids and PDX, and limit tumor cell tumorigenicity and ability to disseminate CSCs from primary tumors to distant sites. Sorting experiments on CIML or tumor cell subsets reveal that CD56bright cells drive most of this anti-CSC activity, and suggest that such functional advantage could be related to increased expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 on CD56bright cells and CSCs, respectively. We also show that the tri-specific killer cell engager (TriKE) 1615133 significantly enhances CIML-NK cell activity against CSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that CIML-NK cells, capable of killing autologous tumor cells and responding to the 1615133 TriKE, could be induced from patients with NSCLC. Conclusions Our study discloses for the first time the therapeutic potential of CIML-NK cells in controlling CSCs and metastatic spread, highlighting the role of the CD56bright subset expansion and 1615133 TriKE for optimizing CIML-NK-based therapies against metastatic tumors.">

        <tr id="Advanced metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with deficient DNA mismatch repair (MMR-d), or immune-hot CRCs, show significantly improved clinical outcomes compared to MMR-proficient (MMR-p), or immune-cold CRCs. While the prior represents about 5% of all CRCs, the latter represent 95% and are characterized by low immunogenicity. This study investigates bis-diethyldithiocarbamate (CuET), a novel anticancer compound, and its impact on the colorectal cancer tumor microenvironment (TME). CuET is shown to convert immunologically inactive tumors into hotbeds of antitumor immune responses, marked by increased lymphocyte infiltration, heightened cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) and T cells, and enhanced non-self recognition by lymphocytes. The potent anticancer cytotoxicity and in vivo safety and efficacy of CuET are established. In summary, CuET transforms the colorectal cancer TME, bolstering NK and T cell cytotoxicity and refining tumor cell recognition through non-classical activation via the NKG2D/NKG2DL axis. This study unveils a novel mechanism of action for CuET: a potent immunomodulator capable of turning cold tumors hot.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Glia antigen‐presenting cells (APCs) are pivotal regulators of immune surveillance within the retina, maintaining tissue homeostasis and promptly responding to insults. However, the intricate mechanisms underlying their local coordination and activation remain unclear. Our study integrates an animal model of retinal injury, retrospective analysis of human retinas, and in vitro experiments to gain insights into the crucial role of antigen presentation in neuroimmunology during retinal degeneration (RD), uncovering the involvement of various glial cells, notably Müller glia and microglia. Glial cells act as sentinels, detecting antigens released during degeneration and interacting with T‐cells via MHC molecules, which are essential for immune responses. Microglia function as APCs via the MHC Class II pathway, upregulating key molecules such as Csf1r and cytokines. In contrast, Müller cells act through the MHC Class I pathway, exhibiting upregulated antigen processing genes and promoting a CD8+ T‐cell response. Distinct cytokine signaling pathways, including TNF‐α and IFN Type I, contribute to the immune balance. Human retinal specimens corroborate these findings, demonstrating glial activation and MHC expression correlating with degenerative changes. In vitro assays also confirmed differential T‐cell migration responses to activated microglia and Müller cells, highlighting their role in shaping the immune milieu within the retina. In summary, our study emphasizes the involvement of retinal glial cells in modulating the immune response after insults to the retinal parenchyma. Unraveling the intricacies of glia‐mediated antigen presentation in RD is essential for developing precise therapeutic interventions for retinal pathologies.">

        <tr id="Background/Objectives: Acute otitis media is a common pediatric infection caused primarily by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae. With rising antibiotic resistance, vaccines are essential for combating this public health issue. Although the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has been extensively studied for its role in tumor immunity, its impact on mucosal immunity, particularly in vaccine responses, is unclear. Methods: BALB/c mice were intranasally immunized with nontypeable H. influenzae outer membrane protein and treated with anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Immune responses were evaluated in middle ear mucosa (MEM), the cervical lymph node, and the spleen using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, an enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and flow cytometry. The effects on CD4+ T cells, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and B-cell differentiation were analyzed. Results: Anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment increased CD3+CD4+CD185+ (CXCR5+) Tfh cells in MEM, which play a crucial role in supporting B-cell activation and antibody production. This correlated with a significant increase in IgA- and IgG-producing cells in MEM, which enhanced local bacterial clearance. Although B-cell activation and differentiation into plasmablasts were observed in MEM, no significant changes were noted in the cervical lymph node and spleen, suggesting a localized enhancement of mucosal immunity. Conclusions: Anti-PD-L1 antibodies promoted Tfh cell expansion and B-cell differentiation in MEM, leading to enhanced antibody production and improved bacterial clearance. These findings suggest that PD-L1 blockade can potentiate mucosal vaccine-induced immunity by strengthening local humoral responses. This supports its potential application in developing intranasal vaccines for acute otitis media.">

        <tr id="Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is broadly produced by various cell types, particularly immune cells, and functions as a key modulator of innate and adaptive immunity. Increasing evidence has linked MIF to the pathogenesis of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We previously showed that the global deletion of Mif in the TCL1 transgenic mouse model for CLL significantly delayed disease development leading to longer overall survival of the knockout mice. In this study, we demonstrated that adaptive transfer of murine CLL cells failed to establish disease in Mif-deficient recipients due to impaired homing of leukemic cells into the spleens, indicating that host-derived Mif is essential for leukemic infiltration and expansion. To identify the most relevant source of Mif in CLL, we generated two CLL mouse strains with B-lymphoid- or myeloid-lineage-specific Mif deletion. In contrast to the global Mif knockout, neither conditional Mif knockout significantly altered CLL progression, illustrating that the cellular source of Mif is less critical than its systemic presence in the tissue environment. Taken together, these in vivo findings indicate that MIF plays a relevant role in CLL pathogenesis, acting independently of its specific cellular origin.

        <tr id="Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, characterized by an extremely poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Central to the progression and immune evasion of PDAC is the tumor (immune) microenvironment (TIME), where immune checkpoint proteins such as galectin-9 (Gal-9) play pivotal roles. Gal-9 significantly contributes to the immunosuppressive milieu of PDAC by interacting with various immune cells, such as T cells, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These interactions suppress anti-tumor immunity, thus facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. This review comprehensively examines the multifaceted role of Gal-9 in the TIME of PDAC, detailing its mechanisms of action, including the induction of regulatory T cells, polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, and modulation of apoptotic pathways via Tim-3 and caspase activation. The therapeutic potential of targeting Gal-9, either alone or in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-L1, is also discussed, highlighting preclinical findings that suggest promising avenues for enhancing anti-tumor immune responses. By elucidating the complex biological activities of Gal-9 and its interactions within the TIME, this review underscores the importance of innovative therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the immunosuppressive effects of Gal-9 in PDAC.">

This study investigates the role of CD4+ (T helper), CD8+ (T cytotoxic), regulatory (Tregs: CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+), and gamma delta (Tγδ) T cells in chromium tolerance versus hypersensitivity. Methods: Six chromium-allergic patients and six healthy controls were recruited, confirmed via patch testing. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured, with chromium exposure and proliferation assays conducted. Specific T cell subtypes were isolated and analyzed for chromium-specific proliferative responses, cytokine production, and metabolic activity. Results: Chromium-allergic individuals exhibited broad proliferation across PBMC and T cell subsets, contrasting with restricted responses in controls. Treg cells in healthy subjects effectively suppressed T cell proliferation in response to chromium, while allergic individuals showed unmodulated T cell activity, indicative of impaired regulatory function. Cytokine analysis revealed elevated IL-2 and TNF-α but absent IL-10 in allergic patients. Metabolic assessments showed higher glycolytic activity in Tregs of healthy controls, suggesting enhanced regulatory potential. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of balanced effector and regulatory T cell interactions for chromium tolerance. Dysregulated Treg and Tγδ cell functions in allergic individuals may contribute to hypersensitivity, with implications for targeted therapeutic strategies to restore immune balance and reduce allergic responses in chromium-sensitive patients.">

        <tr id="The activation and infiltration of immune cells are hallmarks of ischemic stroke. However, the precise origins and the molecular alterations of these infiltrating cells post-stroke remain poorly characterized. Here, a murine model of stroke (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion [p-MCAO]) is utilized to profile single-cell transcriptomes of immune cells in the brain and their potential origins, including the calvarial bone marrow (CBM), femur bone marrow (FBM), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This analysis reveals transcriptomically distinct populations of cerebral myeloid cells and brain-resident immune cells after stroke. These include a novel CD14+ neutrophil subpopulation that transcriptomically resembles CBM neutrophils. Moreover, the sequential activation of transcription factor regulatory networks in neutrophils during stroke progression is delineated, many of which are unique to the CD14+ population and underlie their acquisition of chemotaxis and granule release capacities. Two distinct origins of post-stroke disease-related immune cell subtypes are also identified: disease inflammatory macrophages, likely deriving from circulating monocytes in the skull, and transcriptionally immature disease-associated microglia, possibly arising from pre-existing homeostatic microglia. Together, a comprehensive molecular survey of post-stroke immune responses is performed, encompassing both local and distant bone marrow sites and peripheral blood.">

        <tr id="Ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. Patients who have ovarian tumors infiltrated with high frequencies of T cells are associated with a greater survival probability. However, therapies to revitalize tumor-associated T cells, such as PD-L1/PD-1 or CTLA4 blockade, are ineffective for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that for ovarian cancer, Toll-Like Receptor 5 (TLR5) signaling, for which the only known ligand is bacterial flagellin, governed failure of PD-L1 and CTLA4 blockade. Mechanistically, chronic TLR5 signaling on CD11c+ cells in vivo and in vitro impaired the differentiation of functional IL-12-producing XCR1+CD103+ conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), biasing CD11c+ precursor cells toward myeloid subsets expressing high levels of PD-L1. This culminated in impaired activation of CD8+ T cells, reducing CD8+ T-cell function and ability to persist within the ovarian tumor microenvironment. Expansion of cDC1s in situ using FLT3L in combination with PD-L1 blockade achieved significant survival benefit in TLR5 knockout mice bearing ovarian tumors, whereas no benefit was observed in the presence of TLR5 signaling. Thus, we have identified a host-intrinsic mechanism leading to the failure of PD-L1 blockade for ovarian cancer, demonstrating that chronic TLR5 signaling on CD11c+ cells is a barrier limiting the efficacy of checkpoint therapy.">

However, the immune microenvironment in cervical cancer remains poorly described. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) were recently described as markers for better immunotherapy response and overall better prognosis in cancer patients. We evaluated the cervical tumor immune microenvironment, specifically focusing on TLS, using combined high-throughput phenotyping, soluble factor concentration dosage in the TME and spatial interaction analyses. We found that TLS presence was associated with a more inflammatory soluble microenvironment, with the presence of B cells as well as more activated macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, this myeloid cell activation was associated with expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1 and CD40, and proximity of activated conventional type 2 DCs (DC2) to CD8+ T cells, indicating better immune interactions and tumor control. Finally, we associated TLS presence, greater B cell density, and activated DC density with improved progression-free survival, substantiating TLS presence as a potential prognostic marker. Our results provide evidence that TLS presence denotes cell activation and immunotherapy target expression.">

        <tr id="Adaptive resistance to immunotherapy remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment. The reshaping of the tumor immune microenvironment in response to therapeutic pressures is a crucial factor contributing to this resistance. Here, by comprehensive metabolic profiling of tumor tissues, we identified elevated itaconate in response to anti-PD-1 therapy as an adaptive resistance mechanism that promoted immune escape and tumor progression. CD8+ T-cell-derived interferon (IFN)-γ induced a significant upregulation of cis-aconitate decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1) in macrophages via the JAK-STAT1 pathway, thereby rewiring the Krebs cycle toward itaconate production. In murine models, macrophage-specific deletion of Acod1 increased the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy and improved survival. Additionally, itaconate and its derivative, 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), suppressed the tumor antigen presentation and cross-priming ability of dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in the impairment of antigen-specific T-cell anti-tumor responses. In summary, these findings identify an IFN-γ-dependent immunometabolic mechanism of anti-PD-1 resistance, providing a promising strategy for combination therapy.">

        <tr id="Relevance. Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies worldwide, with high mortality primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and the lack of effective early screening. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in cancer progression, immune evasion, and resistance to therapy. Immune cells, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, along with immune checkpoint proteins like PD-L1, significantly influence tumor behavior and therapeutic response. Understanding their roles in ovarian cancer may provide insights into novel immunotherapeutic strategies. Materials and methods of study. A total of 135 ovarian cancer patients from the Republican Specialized Scientific and Practical Medical Center of Oncology and Radiology, Samarkand Branch, were included in this study. Tumor samples were obtained through biopsy or surgical resection, and immune profiling was performed using multiplex immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The expression levels of CD4+, CD8+, and PD-L1 were quantified, and their spatial distribution within the TME was analyzed. Correlations between immune profiles and clinical outcomes, including survival rates and response to immunotherapy, were assessed. Research results. CD4+ T helper cells exhibited functional diversity, with Th1 cells promoting anti-tumor immunity, whereas Th2 and regulatory T cells (Tregs) contributed to immune suppression in advanced tumors. High CD8+ T-cell infiltration correlated with improved survival; however, elevated PD-L1 expression was associated with T-cell exhaustion (PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3) and immune evasion. Increased PD-L1 levels were linked to poor prognosis, reinforcing its role as a key immune checkpoint regulator. Conclusion. This study highlights the prognostic significance of CD4+, CD8+, and PD-L1 expression in ovarian cancer. Immune profiling may aid in personalized treatment strategies, optimizing immunotherapy efficacy. Future research should focus on integrating multi-omics approaches to enhance patient stratification and improve therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives: This study explores the immunological landscapes of non-melanoma skin neoplasms (NMSNs), specifically keratoacanthoma (KA), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and common warts (VV). Although benign, KA shares histological similarities with low-grade SCC. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a key role in tumor progression, affecting angiogenesis, inflammation, and immune evasion. Viral infections, particularly human papillomavirus (HPV), are linked to NMSN development, with various HPV types identified in KA. VV, caused by HPV, serves as a comparative model due to its similar etiopathogenesis. Materials and Methods: This research examines the expression of CTLA4, a critical regulator of T-cell homeostasis, and IFN-γ, a cytokine with immunomodulatory and antiviral effects, in the TME of 41 KA, 37 SCC, and 55 VV samples using multichannel immunofluorescence. Results: The analysis revealed distinct patterns of CTLA4 and IFN-γ expression. SCC exhibited a higher prevalence of CTLA4+IFN-γ+ double-positive lymphocytes, suggesting a more immunosuppressive TME. In contrast, VV showed the highest expression of CTLA4+ cells, while both KA and VV had lower expressions of IFN-γ+ lymphocytes compared to SCC. The increased presence of CTLA4+IFN-γ+ double-positive lymphocytes in SCC suggests that the co-expression of these markers may exert a stronger effect on TME modulation than CTLA4 alone. Conclusions: These findings underscore the potential of immune profiling as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions, such as KA and SCC. Furthermore, the presence of CTLA4+IFN-γ+ lymphocytes, particularly in SCC, may serve as a biomarker for tumor progression and a potential target for future immunotherapy strategies aimed at modulating the immune response in NMSN.">

        <tr id="T-cell-engaging bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are monoclonal antibodies that redirect the cytotoxic activity of T-cells to target malignant neoplasms. B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is a heterogenous group of aggressive and indolent malignancies with significant therapeutic challenges due to high relapse rates and limited options for relapsed/refractory disease. BsAbs function by simultaneously binding to CD3 on endogenous T-cells and a tumor-associated antigen, creating an immunologic synapse which results in the death of the target cell. The widespread T-cell activation that occurs with BsAb administration can result in cytokine release syndrome and neurological adverse events. Mosunetuzumab, epcoritamab, and glofitamab are CD20-targeting BsAbs that have demonstrated promising single-agent activity in both indolent and aggressive B-NHL. BsAbs are now being evaluated in combination with other anti-lymphoma agents and in earlier lines of treatment, and the results of ongoing clinical trials involving these agents have the potential to reshape the treatment landscape for B-NHL. In this review, we describe the structural features, clinical data, and toxicity profile associated with the BsAbs currently used to treat B-NHL and then discuss ongoing studies and future directions for this exciting new class of therapeutic agents.">

        <tr id="Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by dysregulated humoral immunity, leading to the generation of autoreactive B cells that can differentiate both within and outside of lymph node (LN) follicles. Methods Here, we employed spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging to investigate the follicular immune landscaping and the in situ transcriptomic profile in LNs from SLE individuals. Results Our spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed robust type I IFN and plasma cell signatures in SLE compared to reactive, control follicles. Cell deconvolution revealed that follicular T cell subsets are mainly affected by the type I IFN fingerprint of SLE follicles. Dysregulation of TFH differentiation was documented by i) the significant reduction of Bcl6hi TFH cells, ii) the reduced cell density of potential IL-4 producing TFH cell subsets associated with the impaired transcriptomic signature of follicular IL-4 signaling and iii) the loss of their correlation with GC-B cells. This profile was accompanied by a marked reduction of Bcl6hi B cells and an enrichment of extrafollicular CD19hiCD11chiTbethi, age-associated B cells (ABCs), known for their autoreactive potential. The increased prevalence of follicular IL-21hi cells further reveals a hyperactive microenvironment in SLE compared to control. Discussion Taken together, our findings highlight the altered immunological landscape of SLE follicles, likely fueled by potent inflammatory signals such as sustained type I IFN and/or IL-21 signaling. Our work provides novel insights into the spatial molecular and cellular signatures of SLE follicular B and TFH cell dynamics, and points to druggable targets to restore immune tolerance and enhance vaccine responses in SLE patients.">

 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) harness the power of the immune system to fight against systemic cancers. Despite being one of the most promising current therapeutic strategies, response rates remain heterogeneous. Immunologically cold tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), are among those that do not respond well to checkpoint inhibition. Ferroptosis-related therapies are emerging as a new class of therapeutics for chemo-resistant and metastatic cancers, as they exploit the antioxidant dependence of cancer cells, circumventing most resistance mechanisms. However, the relationship between ferroptosis and the tumor microenvironment (TME) is not well characterized. Here, we leverage ferroptosis-inducing therapies as an adjuvant for immunotherapy and monitor the myeloid dynamics in response with immuno-Positron Emission Tomography (immuno-PET). Methods: A myeloid-heavy TNBC model was used to study myeloid dynamics in response to ferroptosis therapy. The immunogenicity of ferroptotic cancer cells was investigated through in vitro quantification of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The impact of ferroptosis therapies on macrophages was also evaluated. Furthermore, the synergy of ferroptosis-inducing therapy (using IKE) and ICB (with aPD-1) was assessed in vivo, and immune infiltration changes were quantified via flow cytometry and tissue staining. To facilitate this investigation, a pan-myeloid radioimmunoconjugate, 89Zr-DFO-CD11b, was developed as an immunoPET agent to quantitatively monitor spatiotemporal dynamics of tumor myeloid cells during ferroptosis-based therapy. Results: TNBC cells undergoing ferroptosis exhibit an immunogenic phenotype, characterized by increased DAMP production, which can contribute to TME reprogramming. Macrophages exposed to cells undergoing ferroptosis were polarized to an anti-tumor phenotype, exhibited increased tumor spheroid infiltration, and increased phagocytosis signaling. In vivo combination of IKE with aPD-1 suppressed tumor growth. The combination therapy increased tumor infiltration of lymphocyte populations, particularly CD8+ T cells, as well as anti-tumor macrophages, into the tumor core. After confirming 89Zr-DFO-CD11b showed high radiochemical conversion, stability in serum, and specific binding to myeloid cells both in vitro and in vivo, 89Zr-DFO-CD11b was injected IV into tumor-bearing mice receiving therapy. Tumor uptake was significantly less in the combination therapy group, with a distinct pocket of myeloid cells in the center of treated tumors, compared to control tumors with myeloid cells around the tumor periphery. Conclusions: This study underscores the potential of ferroptosis as an adjuvant to immunotherapy, with spatiotemporal immune cell dynamics highlighted by 89Zr-DFO-CD11b myeloid imaging. Future studies will multiplex PET imaging with T cell and ferroptosis markers to further elucidate TME dynamics.

Cirrhosis, an advanced stage of liver diseases, induces Cirrhosis-Associated Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CAIDS) characterized by both innate and adaptive immune dysfunction. Inflammation triggered by factors such as alcohol, viruses, toxins, and cholesterol induce metabolic reprogramming of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Our study specifically sought to investigate the compromised adaptive immune response in cirrhosis by focusing on assessing T-cell exhaustion and activation markers on helper and cytotoxic T cells.


METHOD
A prospective observational study involving 19 liver cirrhosis patients and 36 healthy controls was conducted. Hepatic decompensation degree was assessed using various parameters including serum bilirubin, albumin, international normalized ratio, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. T cell activation (CD38, CD44, CD69, HLADR), and exhaustion markers (CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3) were assessed on helper and cytotoxic T cells by flow cytometry.


RESULT
Cirrhosis patients showed reduced T cells with no alteration in CD4:CD8 T cell ratio. Among activation markers, HLADR showed increased expression on CD8+ T cells (P=0.031). Regarding exhaustion markers LAG-3 and TIM-3 exhibited increased expression in cirrhotic patients compared to controls in both CD4 and CD8 T cells (P=0.004, P=0.016, P=0.001, P=0.004, respectively). Neither cirrhotic nor healthy controls showed CTLA expression. PD-1 did not differ significantly between the two groups. Co-expression of PD-1/TIM-3 on CD8+ T cells was notably higher in cirrhotic patients (P<0.002).


CONCLUSION
The observation of impaired adaptive immunity with notable T cell exhaustion and activation in cirrhosis underscores the potential relevance of immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Understanding both local and systemic immunity is essential to optimizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the dynamic alterations in systemic immunity during tumor development are yet to be clearly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized connection that bridges the interaction between the spleen and tumor through erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), which suppress tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. We performed the single-cell RNA-seq and RNA-seq to demonstrate the presence of EPCs and identify the characteristic and an immunomodulatory role of EPCs during tumor progression. These tumor-hijacked EPCs proliferate in situ in spleens and impaired systemic and local antitumor response through the interaction between tumor and spleen. Specifically, the splenic CD45- EPCs secreted heparin-binding growth factor to regulate PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression of splenic CD45+ EPCs. Educated CD45+ EPCs from the spleen then migrated to the tumors via the CCL5/CCR5 axis, thereby weakening local antitumor immunity. Consequently, targeting EPCs not only revitalized antitumor immunity but also improved the anti-PD-L1 effect by promoting intratumoral T cell infiltration. Importantly, CD45+ EPCs are associated with immunosuppression and reduced survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal the role of EPCs in orchestrating the interaction between the spleen and tumor, which could have significant implications for the development of more effective cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Cytokines play a crucial role in mediating cell communication within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages are particularly influential in the regulation of immunosuppressive cytokines, thereby supporting tumor metastasis. The upregulation of Th2 cytokines in cancer cells is recognized for its involvement in suppressing anticancer immunity. However, the association between these cytokines and tumor-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) remains poorly understood. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the connection between tumor-promoting macrophages and melanoma-derived EVs. The analysis from altered cytokine profile data showed that melanoma-derived EVs upregulate Th2 cytokine expression in naïve macrophages, thereby contributing to the promotion of tumor-supporting functions. Notably, many of these cytokines were also found to be upregulated in metastatic melanoma patients (n = 30) compared to healthy controls (n = 33). Overall, our findings suggest a strong connection between melanoma secretory EVs and the induction of tumor-associated macrophages that facilitates the development of an immunosuppressive TME, supporting melanoma metastasis through regulation at both local and systemic levels.">

 Melanoma is the 8th most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, predominantly driven by exposure to UV radiation leading to an abundant oncogenic mutational burden. However, very few models incorporate these mechanisms in their representation of the disease significantly influencing treatment responses. To address this, our lab uses the Yale University Melanoma Model (YUMM) irradiated cell line that contains clinically represented mutations that are imperative to melanoma development. As a result, these cells are sensitive to combination immune checkpoint inhibition making them a superior system to study the immune response in melanoma over less representative lines such as B16. These cells are injected into a syngeneic in vivo murine system C57/Bl6 INK-ATTAC mice with a senescent cell depletion cassette exclusively expressed in the host stroma, incorporating cellular senescence as a key contributor to the host response to cancer. This dual system allows for the exploration of the immune response that patients experience after receiving ICI treatment in concert with senescent stromal cell burden in the tumor microenvironment (TME). INK-ATTAC mice bearing single cell clone YUMM tumors are treated with a combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (aPD-1+aCTLA-4) to generate both responder and non-responder phenotypes. Upon clearance of senescent cells from the TME via injection of AP20187, the proportions of these response phenotypes shift in both pro- and anti-tumor directions. Immunohistochemical analyses show a significant negative correlation of immune infiltration with tumor size, where T cells show a 2-fold increase as tumor size is reduced as a result of ICI and AP+ICI treatment. More in-depth analysis of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and myeloid cells through Cytometry Time of Flight (CyTOF) of a specific single cell clone reveal that the proportions of immunosuppressive myeloid cells to cytotoxic T cells are key drivers of response phenotypes in AP+ICI treated tumors. Our findings suggest that stromal cellular senescence potentially have pro- and anti-tumor effects, thus influencing both treatment efficacy and resistance mechanisms that prevent response to immune checkpoint inhibition.

        <tr id="Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus associated with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), a hematological malignancy, and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM), a progressive neurological disorder. HTLV-1 predominantly infects CD4+ T cells in vivo. The T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex on CD4+ helper T cells plays a pivotal role in immune responses by recognizing antigens and facilitating coordination with other immune cells. Dysfunction of the TCR/CD3 complex may impair immune function. Although CD3 downregulation has been identified as a characteristic of ATL cells, it remains uncertain whether a similar downregulation occurs in HTLV-1-infected cells from HAM patients. We hypothesized that HTLV-1 infection leads to TCR and CD3 downregulation, contributing to immune dysfunction in HAM patients. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed TCR/CD3 expression, TCR signaling, and immune responses in HTLV-1-infected cells from HAM patients. Intracellular HTLV-1 Tax detection revealed that HTLV-1 preferentially targets CD4+ over CD8+ T cells. CD3 and TCR expression levels were significantly lower in CD4+ T cells from HAM patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, HTLV-1-infected cells exhibited markedly reduced CD3 and TCR expression compared to uninfected cells. Impairments in TCR signaling, assessed through Lck and ZAP70 phosphorylation upon CD3 stimulation, were observed in CD4+ T cells from HAM patients compared to those from healthy controls. Notably, this reduction in TCR signaling was more pronounced in HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells than in uninfected CD4+ T cells in HAM patients. Additionally, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD4+ T cells detected by an addition of CMV antigens demonstrated reduced interferon-γ production in HTLV-1-infected cells compared to their uninfected counterparts. These findings suggest that TCR/CD3 downregulation and impaired TCR signaling contribute to immune dysfunction in HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. As CD4+ T cells play a central role in immune responses, this mechanism may partially explain the cellular immune dysfunction to other pathogens observed in HAM patients.">

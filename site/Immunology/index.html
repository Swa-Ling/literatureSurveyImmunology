        <tr id="Background Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are a promising therapeutic for neuroinflammation. MSC-EVs can interact with microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, to exert their immunomodulatory effects. In response to inflammatory cues, such as cytokines, microglia undergo phenotypic changes indicative of their function e.g. morphology and secretion. However, these changes in response to MSC-EVs are not well understood. Additionally, no disease-relevant screening tools to assess MSC-EV bioactivity exist, which has further impeded clinical translation. Here, we developed a quantitative, high throughput morphological profiling approach to assess the response of microglia to neuroinflammation-relevant signals and whether this morphological response can be used to indicate the bioactivity of MSC-EVs. Results Using an immortalized human microglia cell-line, we observed increased size (perimeter, major axis length) and complexity (form factor) upon stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, the overall morphological score (determined using principal component analysis) shifted towards the unstimulated morphology, indicating that MSC-EVs are bioactive and modulate microglia. The morphological effects of MSC-EVs in TNF-γ/IFN-α stimulated cells were concomitant with reduced secretion of 14 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL6, CXCL9) and increased secretion of 12 chemokines/cytokines (e.g. CXCL8, CXCL10). Proteomic analysis of cell lysates revealed significant increases in 192 proteins (e.g. HIBADH, MEAK7, LAMC1) and decreases in 257 proteins (e.g. PTEN, TOM1, MFF) with MSC-EV treatment. Of note, many of these proteins are involved in regulation of cell morphology and migration. Gene Set Variation Analysis revealed upregulation of pathways associated with immune response, such as regulation of cytokine production, immune cell infiltration (e.g. T cells, NK cells) and morphological changes (e.g. Semaphorin, RHO/Rac signaling). Additionally, changes in microglia mitochondrial morphology were measured suggesting that MSC-EV modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Conclusion This study comprehensively demonstrates the effects of MSC-EVs on human microglial morphology, cytokine secretion, cellular proteome, and mitochondrial content. Our high-throughput, rapid, low-cost morphological approach enables screening of MSC-EV batches and manufacturing conditions to enhance EV function and mitigate EV functional heterogeneity in a disease relevant manner. This approach is highly generalizable and can be further adapted and refined based on selection of the disease-relevant signal, target cell, and therapeutic product.">

        <tr id="Monocyte–derived macrophages (mo-macs) drive immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM) fuels these populations. Here, we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin analysis over the continuum of BM myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes, and tumor-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. Analyzing chromatin accessibility and histone mark changes, we show that lung tumors prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in BM myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress. NRF2 activity is sustained and increased during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the lung TME to regulate oxidative stress, in turn promoting metabolic adaptation, resistance to cell death, and contributing to immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced mo-macs’ survival and immunosuppression in the TME, enabling NK and T cell therapeutic antitumor immunity and synergizing with checkpoint blockade strategies. Altogether, our study identifies a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the TME.">

        <tr id="Maintaining tissue function while eliminating infected cells is fundamental to host defense. Innate inflammatory damage contributes to lethal influenza and COVID-19, yet other than steroids, immunomodulatory drugs have modest effects. Among more than 50 immunomodulatory regimes tested in mouse lethal influenza infection, only the previously reported early depletion of neutrophils showed efficacy, suggesting that the infected host passes an early tipping point in which limiting innate immune damage alone cannot rescue physiological function. To re-balance the system late in infection, we investigated whether partial limitation of viral spread using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) together with enhancement of epithelial repair by blockade of interferon signaling or the limitation of further epithelial cell loss mediated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells would prevent death. These treatments salvaged a large fraction of infected animals, providing new insight into the importance of repair processes and the timing of adaptive immune responses in survival of pulmonary infections.">

Here, high resolution mapping of human B cells and PCs sampled from the colon and ileum during both viremic and suppressed HIV-1 infection identified a reduction in germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) during HIV-1 viremia. IgA+ PCs are the major cellular output of intestinal GCs and were significantly reduced during viremic HIV-1 infection. PC-associated transcriptional perturbations, including type I interferon signaling, persisted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated individuals, suggesting ongoing disruption of the intestinal immune milieu during ART. GI humoral immune perturbations were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome composition and systemic inflammation. These findings highlight a key immune defect in the GI mucosa due to HIV-1 viremia.

        <tr id="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex genetically mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where anti-CD20-mediated B cell depletion is remarkably effective in the treatment of early disease. While previous studies investigated the effect of B cell depletion on select immune cell subsets using flow cytometry-based methods, the therapeutic impact on patient immune landscape is unknown. In this study, we explored how B cell depleting therapies modulate the immune landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We demonstrate that B cell depletion leads to cell type-specific changes in the abundance and function of CSF macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes. Specifically, a CSF-specific macrophage population with an anti-inflammatory transcriptomic signature and peripheral CD16+ monocytes increased in frequency post-B cell depletion. This was accompanied by increases in TNFα messenger RNA and protein in monocytes post-B cell depletion, consistent with the finding that anti-TNFα treatment exacerbates autoimmune activity in MS. In parallel, B cell depletion induced changes in peripheral CD4+ T cell populations, including increases in the frequency of TIGIT+ regulatory T cells and marked decreases in the frequency of myelin peptide loaded-tetramer binding CD4+ T cells. Collectively, this study provides an exhaustive transcriptomic map of immunological changes, revealing different cell-type specific reprogramming as a result of B cell depletion treatment in MS.">

        <tr id="The functional plasticity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte B–cells (TIL-B) spans from antitumor responses to noncanonical immune suppression. Yet, how the tumor microenvironment (TME) influences TIL-B development is still underappreciated. Our current study integrated single-cell transcriptomics and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing to profile TIL-B phenotypes and clonalities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using trajectory and gene regulatory network analysis, we were able to characterize plasma cells and memory and naive B cells within the HCC TME and further revealed a downregulation of BCR signaling genes in plasma cells and a subset of inflammatory TNF+ memory B cells. Within the TME, a nonswitched memory B cell subset acquired an age-associated B cell phenotype (TBET+CD11c+) and expressed higher levels of PD-L1, CD25, and granzyme B. We further demonstrated that the presence of HCC tumor cells could confer suppressive functions on peripheral blood B cells that in turn, dampen T cell costimulation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent novel mechanisms of noncanonical immune suppression in HCC. While previous studies identified atypical memory B cells in chronic hepatitis and across several solid cancer types, we further highlighted their potential role as regulatory B cells (Bregs) within both the TME and peripheral blood of HCC patients.">

        <tr id="The mechanisms driving immune evasion in early-stage I high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Our findings revealed a highly immunosuppressive HGSOC microenvironment, characterized by abundant infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Trajectory analysis uncovered differentiation pathways of naïve Tregs, which underwent either activation and proliferation or transcriptional instability. The predicted Treg-cell interaction network, including crosstalk within tumor cells, facilitates Treg mobility and maturation while reinforcing their immunosuppressive function and persistence in the tumor. Moreover, their interactions with immune cells likely inhibit CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting cells, supporting tumor immune escape. Additionally, more immunogenic tumor conditions, marked by IFNγ production, may contribute to Treg destabilization. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of Tregs in early immune evasion of HGSOC and provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting their activity and differentiation fate.">

        <tr id="FOXP3+ natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) promote resolution of inflammation and repair of epithelial damage following viral pneumonia-induced lung injury, thus representing a cellular therapy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Whether in vitro induced Tregs (iTregs), which can be rapidly generated in substantial numbers from conventional T cells, also promote lung recovery is unknown. nTregs require specific DNA methylation patterns maintained by the epigenetic regulator, ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1). Here, we tested whether iTregs promote recovery following viral pneumonia and whether iTregs require UHRF1 for their pro-recovery function. We found that adoptive transfer of iTregs to mice with influenza virus pneumonia promotes lung recovery and that loss of UHRF1-mediated maintenance DNA methylation in iTregs leads to reduced engraftment and a delayed repair response. Transcriptional and DNA methylation profiling of adoptively transferred UHRF1-deficient iTregs that had trafficked to influenza-injured lungs demonstrated transcriptional instability with gain of effector T cell lineage-defining transcription factors. Strategies to promote the stability of iTregs could be leveraged to further augment their pro-recovery function during viral pneumonia and other causes of ARDS.">

        <tr id="Regulatory T cell (Treg) heterogeneity exists in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but we have limited understanding of context-dependent functions and spatiotemporal regulators of heterogenous Treg states, especially during perinatal life when immune tolerance is established. Here, we revealed that the class III PI3K Vps34 orchestrates effector Treg (eTreg) transitional heterogeneity during perinatal life. We found that loss of Vps34 reduced terminal eTreg accumulation in lymphoid tissues, associated with decreased Treg generation in non-lymphoid tissues and development of an early-onset autoimmune-like disease. After perinatal life, Vps34-deficient eTreg accumulation was further impaired due to reduced cell survival, highlighting temporal regulation of eTreg heterogeneity and maintenance by Vps34. Accordingly, inhibition of Vps34 in mature Tregs disrupted immune homeostasis but boosted anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, multiomics profiling approaches uncovered that Vps34-orchestrated transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling promotes terminal eTreg programming. Further, via genetic deletion of the Vps34-interacting proteins Atg14 or Uvrag in Tregs, we established that Atg14 but not Uvrag was required for the overall survival, but not terminal differentiation, of eTregs, suggesting that autophagy but not endocytosis partly contributed to Vps34-dependent effects. Accordingly, mice with Treg-specific loss of Atg14, but not Uvrag, had moderately disrupted immune homeostasis and reduced tumor growth, with Vps34- or Atg14-dependent gene signatures also being elevated in intratumoral Tregs from human cancer patients. Collectively, our study reveals distinct Vps34-orchestrated signaling events that regulate eTreg heterogeneity and functional adaptation and the pathophysiological consequences on autoimmunity versus anti-tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Arginine methyltransferase protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Macrophages are crucial modulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses, and their differentiation into tumor-associated macrophages is critical in shaping the TME. Despite ongoing clinical trials of small molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 for cancer therapy, their effects on macrophages, a key component of the immune system, remain poorly understood. Methods A pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis was initially conducted to investigate the expression of PRMT5 in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 in mice, as well as the use of a PRMT5-specific inhibitor, was performed to evaluate the impact of PRMT5 on macrophage polarization and tumor progression. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics were employed to explore the mechanistic roles of PRMT5 in regulating lipid metabolism and macrophage polarization. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy was assessed to study its effects on antitumor immunity in vivo. Results The pan-cancer single-cell transcriptional analysis revealed that PRMT5 is highly expressed in the PPARG-macrophage subset, which correlates with poor patient survival. Myeloid-specific deletion of Prmt5 reprogrammed macrophages towards an antitumor phenotype, effectively inhibiting tumor progression. Mechanistically, PRMT5 was found to regulate lipid metabolism and drive macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory state via the STAT6-PPARγ pathway, fostering an immunosuppressive TME conducive to tumor growth. Notably, Prmt5 deletion induced PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells. Combining Prmt5 deletion with anti-PD-L1 therapy significantly enhanced antitumor efficacy, demonstrating a synergistic therapeutic effect. Conclusions These findings uncover a crucial role for PRMT5 in macrophage biology and suggest that targeting PRMT5 in myeloid cells offers a promising new approach for cancer immunotherapy. The combination of PRMT5 inhibition with anti-PD-L1 therapy may provide a potent strategy to reprogram the TME and enhance antitumor immune responses.">

        <tr id="Background The bone marrow (BM) niche contains non-hematopoietic elements including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and bone marrow endothelial cells (BMEC) which provide mechanical support, and control hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation. Although it is known that multiple myeloma (MM) cells interact closely with the BM microenvironment, little is known about the impact of MM on non-hematopoietic niche-forming cells. Methods To address the role of the niche in MM pathogenesis, we utilized the 5TGM1 murine model. During the asymptomatic precursor stage of the model, we isolated the rare non-hematopoietic cells and performed single cell RNA sequencing. Using in-silico methods we characterized the individual cellular components of the niche, their relative abundance and differentiation state before and after exposure to MM cells as well as their intercellular interactions. Results MM engraftment increased the abundance of MSC-lineage cells, BMECs and enhanced endothelial to mesenchymal transition. An inflammatory and oxidative stress signal was identified together with polarization of MSC differentiation away from osteocyte formation towards adipocytes which provide growth factors that are known to support MM expansion. BMEC differentiation was polarized towards sinusoidal endothelial cells with a pro-angiogenic/pro-inflammatory phenotype. Conclusions MM cells impact the BM niche by generating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment with MSC differentiation being changed to generate cell subsets that favor MM growth and survival. In order to induce remission and improve long-term outcome for MM patients these inflammatory and oxidative stress signals need to be reduced and normal niche differentiation trajectories restored.

        <tr id="Background Myocarditis is a common inflammatory heart disease in children and young adults, with fulminant myocarditis (FM) being the most severe form due to its rapid onset and high mortality rate. However, the precise pathological immune subsets and molecular change in myocarditis, particularly FM, remain unknown. Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of pediatric peripheral blood mononuclear cells during the acute and recovery phases of FM. A viral myocarditis (MC) mouse model was established using CVB3. Deletion and adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells, as well as blockade of CXCR4, were conducted in vivo. CD8+T cells were sorted and cultivated in vitro, then stimulated with CXCL12 and CXCR4 antagonists to investigate the mechanism of CD8+T cell overactivation. Results CD8+T cells show significant activation, amplification, enhanced cytotoxicity, and increased chemotactic ability in FM. Deletion of CD8+T cells alleviates myocardial injury and improves cardiac function in MC mice, while adoptive transfer of CD8+T cells from MC mice aggravates myocardial inflammation and injury. The transcriptomic analysis reveals elevated CXCR4 expression in CD8+T cells in acute FM. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis drives the overactivation and cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells. In vivo treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist effectively reduces CD8+T cell accumulation in the heart, alleviates myocardial inflammation, and improves cardiac function in MC mice. Conclusions These findings provide deeper insights into the immune landscape of pediatric FM, uncovering a novel role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in driving CD8+T cell responses in myocarditis. Furthermore, they highlight the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis as a promising therapeutic target for myocarditis treatment.

        <tr id="Drug-tolerant persister cancer cells were first reported fifteen years ago as a quiescent, reversible cell state which tolerates unattenuated cytotoxic drug stress. It remains unknown whether a similar phenomenon contributes to immune evasion. Here we report a persister state which survives weeks of direct cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) attack. In contrast to previously known immune evasion mechanisms that avoid immune attack, antigenic persister cells robustly activate CTLs which deliver Granzyme B, secrete IFNγ, and induce tryptophan starvation resulting in apoptosis initiation. Instead of dying, persister cells paradoxically leverage apoptotic caspase activity to avoid inflammatory death. Furthermore, persister cells acquire mutations and epigenetic changes which enable outgrowth of CTL-resistant cells. Persister cell features are enriched in inflamed tumors which regressed during immunotherapy in vivo and in surgically resected human melanoma tissue under immune stress ex vivo. These findings reveal a persister cell state which is a barrier to immune-mediated tumor clearance. Graphical abstract">

        <tr id="Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has expanded therapeutic options for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, progress in improving clinical outcomes has been limited by an incomplete understanding of CAR T-cell differentiation in patients. To comprehensively investigate CAR T-cell differentiation in vivo, we performed single-cell, multi-modal, and longitudinal analyses of CD28-costimulated CAR T cells from infusion product and peripheral blood (day 8-28) of patients with DLBCL who were successfully treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. Here, we show that CD8+ CAR T cells undergo two distinct waves of clonal expansion. The first wave is dominated by CAR T cells with an exhausted-like effector memory phenotype during the peak expansion period (day 8-14). The second wave is dominated by CAR T cells with a terminal effector phenotype during the post-peak persistence period (day 21-28). Importantly, the two waves have distinct ontogeny and are biologically uncoupled. Furthermore, lineage tracing analysis via each CAR T cell’s endogenous TCR clonotype demonstrates that the two waves originate from different effector precursors in the infusion product. Precursors of the first wave exhibit more effector-like signatures, whereas precursors of the second wave exhibit more stem-like signatures. These findings suggest that pre-infusion heterogeneity mediates the two waves of in vivo clonal expansion. Our findings provide evidence against the intuitive idea that the post-peak contraction in CAR abundance is solely apoptosis or extravasation of short-lived CAR T cells from peak expansion. Rather, our findings demonstrate that CAR T-cell expansion and persistence are mediated by clonally, phenotypically, and ontogenically distinct CAR T-cell populations that serve complementary clinical purposes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) depends on restoring immune recognition of cancer cells that have evaded immune surveillance. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) is associated with immune-poor, so-called cold tumors whereas loss of its signaling promotes DNA misrepair that could stimulate immune response. Methods We analyzed transcriptomic data from IMvigor210, The Cancer Genome Atlas, and Tumor Immune Syngeneic MOuse data sets to evaluate the predictive value of high βAlt, a score representing low expression of a signature consisting of TGFβ targets and high expression of genes involved in error-prone DNA repair. The immune context of βAlt was assessed by evaluating tumor-educated immune signatures. An ICB-resistant, high βAlt preclinical tumor model was treated with a TGFβ inhibitor, radiation, and/or ICB and assessed for immune composition and tumor control. Results We found that a high βAlt score predicts ICB response yet is paradoxically associated with an immune-poor tumor microenvironmentcancer in both human and mouse tumors. We postulated that high βAlt cancers consist of cancer cells in which loss of TGFβ signaling generates a TGFβ rich, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, preclinical modeling showed that TGFβ inhibition followed by radiotherapy could convert an immune-poor, high βAlt tumor to an immune-rich, ICB-responsive tumor. Mechanistically, TGFβ inhibition increased activated natural killer (NK) cells, which were required to recruit lymphocytes to respond to ICB in irradiated tumors. NK cell activation signatures were also increased in high βAlt, cold mouse and human tumors that responded to ICB. Conclusions These studies indicate that loss of TGFβ signaling competency and gain of error-prone DNA repair identifies a subset of cold tumors that are responsive to ICB. Our mechanistic studies show that inhibiting TGFβ activity can convert a high βAlt, cold tumor into ICB-responsive tumors via NK cells. A biomarker consisting of combined TGFβ, DNA repair, and immune context signatures is a means to prospectively identify patients whose cancers may be converted from cold to hot with appropriate therapy.">

        <tr id="Humoral immunity is orchestrated by follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, which promote cognate B cells to produce high-affinity, protective antibodies. In aged individuals, humoral immunity after vaccination is diminished despite the presence of Tfh cells, suggesting defects after initial Tfh formation. In this study, we utilized both murine and human systems to investigate how aging alters Tfh cell differentiation after influenza vaccination. We found that young Tfh cells underwent progressive differentiation after influenza vaccination, culminating in clonal expansion of effector-like cells in both draining lymph nodes and blood. In aging, early stages of Tfh development occurred normally. However, aging rewired the later stages of development in Tfh cells, resulting in a transcriptional program reflective of cellular senescence, sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and metabolic reprogramming. We investigated the extent to which this rewiring of aged Tfh cells is due to the age-associated inflammatory ("inflammaging") microenvironment and found that this setting was sufficient to both block the transition of Tfh cells to a post-effector resting state and to skew Tfh cells towards the age-rewired state. Together, these data suggest that aging dampens humoral immunity by cytokine-mediated rewiring of late effector Tfh cell differentiation into an activated, yet less functional, cellular state.">

        <tr id="Introduction The tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, with tumor-associated macrophages significantly influencing immune suppression and tumor growth. Colorectal cancers (CRC) classified as Consensus Molecular Subtype 4 (CMS4) and triple-negative breast cancers subsets are particularly characterized by a mesenchymal phenotype, immune exclusion, and extensive macrophage infiltration. This study aimed to investigate how targeting cancer cell stemness with specific inhibitors could modulate macrophage polarization in CRC in vitro and breast cancer in vivo, potentially shifting the immune balance from pro-tumor M2-like to anti-tumor M1-like macrophages. Methods We used four stemness inhibitors—salinomycin, SB-431542, JIB-04, and napabucasin—each targeting different pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β, histone demethylation, and STAT3, respectively), to evaluate their effects on CMS4 CRC cell lines (HCT116 and SW620) and human peripheral blood-derived macrophages in an indirect co-culture model. Results Our results showed that CMS4 CRC cell lines induced distinct macrophage polarization patterns, with HCT116 promoting M2-like macrophages and SW620 leaning toward M1-like profile. Notably, the combination of stemness inhibitors reduced stemness markers (CD133, CD44) in colorectal cancer cells and shifted macrophage polarization toward an M1-like phenotype, particularly in co-culture with HCT116. In vivo studies using the syngeneic immunocompetent EO771 breast cancer mouse model demonstrated that combination of stemness inhibitors increased the M1/M2 macrophage ratio. Conclusions Our study highlights the dual potential of stemness inhibitors to target both cancer cells and the immune microenvironment. These findings offer promising strategies for enhancing favorable immunomodulation in mesenchymal-like colorectal tumors.">

Objective: To investigate the role of T cells in the immunopathology of CL by characterizing the immune landscape of skin lesions using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Methods: We performed scRNA-seq to profile T cells from PBMC and skin lesions of CL patients. Results: We analyzed the transcriptional profile of distinct populations of CD4+ and CD8+ migratory T cells in CL lesions. CD8+ resident T cells displayed expression of exhaustion markers and were categorized into progenitor, transitional, and terminal stages, with HAVCR2 (TIM-3) identified as a potential driver of dysfunction. Compared to psoriasis and healthy skin, CL lesions showed a reduced frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), potentially linked to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased apoptosis. We also detected double-negative (DN) gd T cells, suggesting their potential role in antigen presentation via MHC class II through TGF-b signaling. Conclusion: This study provides novel insights into immune evasion mechanisms in CL, identifying TIM-3, Treg modulation, and the functional role of DN gd T cells as distinct potential targets for future immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Background Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the main immunosuppressive cells in tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). However, systemic Treg depletion is not favored due to the crucial role of Tregs in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and prevention of autoimmunity. Recently, CCR8 has been identified as a key chemokine receptor expressed on tumor-infiltrating Tregs and targeted blockade of CCR8 exerts anticancer effect in several cancer types, but whether this pathway is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods We determined the involvement of CCR8+ Tregs in HCC using human HCC tissues and TCGA database, and examined the anticancer effect and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the CCR8 antagonist, IPG0521m, which was developed in house, in murine liver cancer model with flow cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and Real-Time PCR. Results Remarkable increase in CCR8+ Tregs was observed in human HCC tissues. Treatment of syngeneic liver cancer model with IPG0521m resulted in dramatic inhibition of tumor growth, associated with increased CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues. Bulk RNA sequencing analysis indicated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in remarkable increase in antitumor immunity. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that IPG0521m treatment resulted in a switch of Tregs from high immunosuppression to low immunosuppression phenotype, associated with elevated CD8+ T and NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity, and decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor tissues. Conclusions IPG0521m inhibited liver cancer growth via reducing the immunosuppressive function of Tregs, thereby boosting anti-cancer immunity. Our study paves the way for the clinical study of CCR8 antagonist in HCC and other cancers.

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with dismal clinical prognosis and resistance to current therapies. GBM progression is facilitated by the tumor microenvironment (TME), with an immune infiltrate dominated by tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The TME is also characterized by hypoxia and the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), with HIF-2α emerging as a potential regulator of tumor progression. However, its role in GBM immunosuppression remains unknown. Here, we investigate HIF-2α and the use of the HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 to modulate the TME in the immunocompetent GL261 mouse GBM model. PT2385 administration in vivo decreased tumor volume and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice, without affecting GL261 viability in vitro. Notably, HIF-2α inhibition alleviated the immunosuppressive TME and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) using αPD-1 and αTIM-3 antibodies to promote long-term survival. Comprehensive analysis of the immune infiltrate through single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry revealed that combining PT2385 with ICB reduced numbers of pro-tumoral macrophages and Tregs while increasing numbers of microglia, with a corresponding transcriptional modulation towards an anti-tumoral profile of these TAMs. In vitro, deletion of HIF-2α in microglia impeded their polarization towards a pro-tumoral M2-like profile, and its inhibition impaired Treg migration. Our results show that targeting HIF-2α can switch an immunosuppressive TME towards one that favors a robust and sustained response to ICB based immunotherapy. These findings establish that clinically relevant HIF-2α inhibitors should be explored not only in malignancies with defects in the HIF-2α axis, but also in those exhibiting an immunosuppressive TME that limits immunotherapy responsiveness.

        <tr id="Patients with peritoneal metastasized colorectal cancer (PM-CRC) have a dismal prognosis. We hypothesized that an immunosuppressive environment in the peritoneal cavity underlies poor prognosis. We define the composition of the human peritoneal immune system (PerIS) using single-cell technologies in 18 patients with- and without PM-CRC, as well as in matched peritoneal metastases (n = 8). Here we show that the PerIS contains abundant immunosuppressive C1Q+VSIG4+ and SPP1+VSIG4+ peritoneal-resident macrophages (PRMs), as well as monocyte-like cavity macrophages (mono-CMs), which share features with tumor-associated macrophages, even in homeostasis. In PM-CRC, expression of immunosuppressive cytokines IL10 and VEGF increases, while simultaneously expression of antigen-presenting molecules decreases in PRMs. These intratumoral suppressive PRMs originate from the PerIS, and intraperitoneal depletion of PRMs in vivo using anti-CSF1R combined with anti-PD1 significantly reduces tumor burden and improves survival. Thus, PRMs define a metastatic site-specific immunosuppressive niche, and targeting PRMs is a promising treatment strategy for PM-CRC.">

        <tr id="Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) play a crucial role in tumor progression and immune regulation. However, the functional heterogeneity of CAFs remains unclear. Here, we identify antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAF), characterized by high MHC II expression, in gastric cancer (GC) tumors and find that apCAFs are preferentially located near tertiary lymphoid structures. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that apCAFs promote T cell activation and enhances its cytotoxic and proliferative capacities, thereby strengthening T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Additionally, apCAFs facilitate the polarization of macrophages toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. These polarized macrophages, in turn, promote the formation of apCAFs, creating a positive feedback loop that amplifies anti-tumor immune responses. Notably, baseline tumors in immunotherapy responders across various cancer types exhibit higher levels of apCAFs infiltration. This study advances the understanding of CAFs heterogeneity in GC and highlights apCAFs as a potential biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in pan-cancer.">

In recent years, the PCV2d subtype has become the most prevalent genotype worldwide, exhibiting higher virulence, leading to more severe viremia and organ damage. Therefore, studying the biological characteristics of the PCV2d subtype is of great significance. Methods We established a PCV2d infection model using BALB/c mice and employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to systematically analyze the transcriptome of 10 cell types in the lung tissues of infected mice. We developed a comprehensive marker gene catalog for these cell types. Results Compared to uninfected mice, PCV2d infection induced extensive viral replication and immunosuppressive responses in most cell types. Monocyte macrophages with high levels of viral replication, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and various cell population interactions occurring through CD40-CD40L and CXCL14-CXCR4 were identified. These cells predominantly mediate antigen presentation and processing pathways in vivo, contributing to PCV2d-driven inflammatory lung injury. Discussion Our data uncovered a complex unique immune response scenario in the lung tissue of mice after PCV2d infection, deciphering the potential mechanisms underlying PCV2d-driven inflammatory responses in mice. Furthermore, this study provides a rich database for the molecular basis of different cell types' responses to PCV2d infection.">

        <tr id="Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) substantially limits long-term survival following lung transplantation. To identify potential targets for CLAD prevention, T cells from explanted CLAD lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes, as well as diseased and nondiseased controls were isolated and single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing were performed. TCR sequencing revealed a clonally expanded population of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) with high cytotoxic potential, including upregulation of KLRK1, encoding the co-receptor NKG2D. These cytotoxic CD8+ TRMs accumulated around the CLAD airways and had a 100-fold increase in clonal overlap with lung-draining lymph nodes when compared with non-CLAD lungs. Using a murine model of orthotopic lung transplantation, we confirmed that cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation was due to chronic rejection and not transplantation alone. Furthermore, blocking NKG2D in vivo attenuated the airway remodeling following transplantation and diminished airway accumulation of CD8+ T cells. Our findings support NKG2D as a potential therapeutic target for CLAD, affecting cytotoxic CD8+ TRM accumulation.">

With the hypothesis that CD8+ tissue resident memory T cell (TRM) phenotypes might be more competent at controlling tissue viral recrudescence, we examined their capacity to control HIV after reactivation and the benefit of inducing TRM-like phenotypes through cytokine stimulation from blood. CD8+TRM derived from cervical tissue were more efficient at eliminating reactivated HIV-infected CD4+T cells compared to circulating effector CD8+T cells. Expansion of CD8+TRM-like phenotypes from blood through IL-15/TGF-β1 stimulation recovered functional HIV-specific CD8+T cells displaying residency features, increased clonotypic diversity and mitochondrial function, and were the most efficient phenotypes at eliminating intact viruses after reactivation. Altogether, we provide a relevant therapeutic strategy to enhance elimination of persistent antigens like HIV by generating functional CD8+TRM-like phenotypes.">

Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase renowned for mitochondrial quality control, has emerged as a regulator of immune response. Here, we show that both systemic and macrophage-specific ablations of Parkin in mice lead to attenuated tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5–dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment and Park2−/− signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor. Our findings uncover Parkin’s involvement in suppressing macrophage antigen presentation for coordinating the cross-talk between macrophages and T cells.">

        <tr id="Immune evasion by cancer cells involves reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) via communication with non-malignant cells. However, resistance-promoting interactions during treatment remain lesser known. Here we examine the composition, communication, and phenotypes of tumor-associated cells in serial biopsies from stage II and III high-risk estrogen receptor positive (ER+ ) breast cancers of patients receiving endocrine therapy (letrozole) as single agent or in combination with ribociclib, a CDK4/6-targeting cell cycle inhibitor. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses on longitudinally collected samples show that in tumors overcoming the growth suppressive effects of ribociclib, first cancer cells upregulate cytokines and growth factors that stimulate immune-suppressive myeloid differentiation, resulting in reduced myeloid cell- CD8 + T-cell crosstalk via IL-15/18 signaling. Subsequently, tumors growing during treatment show diminished T-cell activation and recruitment. In vitro, ribociclib does not only inhibit cancer cell growth but also T cell proliferation and activation upon co-culturing. Exogenous IL-15 improves CDK4/6 inhibitor efficacy by augmenting T-cell proliferation and cancer cell killing by T cells. In summary, response to ribociclib in stage II and III high-risk ER +  breast cancer depends on the composition, activation phenotypes and communication network of immune cells.">

        <tr id="Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown unprecedented success in a subset of immunogenic tumors, however a host of patients with advanced solid tumors fail to respond well or at all to immunotherapy. Refractory tumors commonly display a tumor microenvironment (TME) rich in immunosuppressive macrophages (M2-like) that suppress adaptive immunity and promote tumor progression. The ability to reprogram macrophages in the TME into an immune-active state holds great promise for enhancing responses to ICIs. Lucicebtide (previously referred to as ST101) is a peptide antagonist of the transcription factor C/EBPβ, a key activator of the transcriptional program in immunosuppressive macrophages. Here we show that lucicebtide exposure reprograms human immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype, restores cytotoxic T cell activation in immunosuppressed co-culture assays in vitro, and further increases T-cell activity in M1-like/T cell co-cultures. In immunocompetent, macrophage-rich triple-negative breast and colorectal cancer models, lucicebtide induces repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype and suppresses tumor growth. Lucicebtide synergizes with anti-PD-1 therapy and overcomes resistance to checkpoint inhibition in anti-PD-1-refractory tumors, but in vivo responses are impaired by systemic macrophage depletion, indicating that macrophage reprogramming is integral to lucicebtide activity. These results identify lucicebtide as a novel immunomodulator that reprograms immunosuppressive macrophage populations to enhance anti-tumor activity and suggests its utility for combination strategies in cancers with poor response to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality but heterogeneity in patient responsiveness remains. Thus, greater understanding of the immunologic factors that dictate response to immunotherapy is critical to improve patient outcomes. Here, we show that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is elevated in the setting of melanoma in humans and mice and plays a functional role in inhibiting the CD8+ T cell response. Surprisingly, the tumor itself is not the major cellular source of Fgl2. Instead, we found that macrophage-secreted Fgl2 dampens the CD8+ T cell response through binding and apoptosis of FcγRIIB+CD8+ T cells. This regulation was CD8+ T cell autonomous and not via an antigen-presenting cell intermediary, as absence of Fcgr2b from the CD8+ T cells rendered T cells insensitive to Fgl2 regulation. Fgl2 is robustly expressed by macrophages in 10 cancer types in humans and in 6 syngeneic tumor models in mice, underscoring the clinical relevance of Fgl2 as a therapeutic target to promote T cell activity and improve patient immunotherapeutic response.">

        <tr id="Background and Objectives Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease most frequently caused by autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) located at the neuromuscular junction. Thymic follicular hyperplasia is present in most of the patients with early-onset AChR-Ab+ MG (EOMG), but its cellular and molecular drivers and development remain poorly understood. Methods We constructed a single cell-based transcriptional profile of lymphoid cell types in thymi from 11 immunotherapy-naïve patients with EOMG. Multiplex histology and ELISA were used to determine migration inhibitory factor (MIF) levels. Results Within EOMG thymi, we consistently observed 6 distinct clusters of B-cell populations maturing toward germinal center (GC)–associated and Ab-secreting cells, featuring prominent GC activity, as indicated by substantial clonal expansions and cycling B-cell subsets. Cell-cell interactome predictions identified strong interactions between T cells and GC-associated and memory B cells, dominated by B-cell prosurvival signaling through the MIF-CD74 axis. Multiplex histology confirmed abundant expression of CD74 in MG thymic B cells. Circulating MIF levels in EOMG correlated with higher disease severity as assessed by Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America status. Discussion Our data not only illustrate and define hyperplastic thymic niches in MG as favorable environments for pathogenic B-cell proliferation, maturation, and persistence but also suggest that the MIF-CD74 axis should be investigated for potential novel therapeutic targeting in EOMG.">

        <tr id="Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease. The pathomechanism of RA depends on both B and T cells. Regulatory B cells (Breg) have been shown to suppress T-cell immune responses and play a key role in modulating autoimmune processes. We aimed to investigate the possibility of utilizing PD-L1+ Breg cells in downregulating the Th cells’ immune response in healthy individuals and RA patients. We hypothesized that the PD-1/PD-1L interaction plays a key role in this process, which may be defective in autoimmune diseases. We separated T and B cells from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and RA patients by magnetic cell sorting, and Th cells and Treg cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The cytokine production by CD4+ Th cells was detected by intracellular flow cytometry. CpG and CD40L stimulations were applied to induce PD-L1hi expressing Breg cells. We found that the frequency of PD-L1hi cells is significantly lower in all B-cell subsets in RA compared to healthy controls. Functional analysis of induced PD-L1+ Breg cells in coculture with activated autologous Th cells has shown that healthy control samples containing higher levels of PD-L1hi Breg cells significantly inhibit IFN-ү and IL-21 production by Th cells. In contrast, RA patients’ samples with lower levels of PD-L1hi Breg cells failed to do so. Since the expression of PD-L1 on B cells can be modulated in vitro to induce Breg cell suppressive capacity, these data may provide new perspectives for future therapy for RA.">

        <tr id="Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a unique subset of innate-like T lymphocytes that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. Characterized by their semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR) and abundant localization in mucosal tissues, MAIT cells recognize microbial metabolites, primarily derived from the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related protein 1 (MR1). This interaction, along with co-stimulatory signals, triggers rapid immune responses, including cytokine secretion and cytotoxic activity, highlighting their importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and combating infections. This review provides an in-depth overview of MAIT cell biology, including development, activation pathways, and functional diversity, highlighting their protective roles in immunity, contributions to diseases like cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and context-dependent dual functions in health and pathology. This review also highlights the emerging therapeutic potential of MAIT cells in immunotherapy. Their unique TCR specificity, abundance, and tissue-homing properties make them ideal candidates for engineering novel therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-MAIT cells, targeting infections, cancers, and autoimmune diseases. Challenges like antigen escape, T cell exhaustion, and CAR design optimization must be addressed to enhance clinical efficacy. In summary, MAIT cells are integral to immune function, and their therapeutic potential presents exciting opportunities for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Further research is essential to unlock the full potential of these versatile immune cells.">

        <tr id="Coeliac Disease (CeD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting 0.5-1% of the general population with a wide geographical distribution. Despite recent efforts to deeply phenotype gluten-specific immune activation at the single cell level, recent clinical studies targeting gluten degradation and other immune tolerance mechanisms have been unsuccessful. To this end, a deeper understanding of immune and non-immune cellular dynamics and interactions are required to characterize tissue-specific mechanisms responsible for CeD pathogenesis, repair, and resolution. Here, we assembled the most comprehensive scRNAseq dataset in Coeliac Disease to date, including 203,555 cells across 21 active CeD and 11 control duodenal samples. Compared to control duodenum, CeD was characterized by single cell differential changes in abundance, gene expression and cell-cell interactions across cellular compartments. In the immune compartments, CeD samples showed expected increases in plasma cell abundance and shifts toward type 1 effector biology (e.g., increase in cycling CD8pos, γδ T cells and IFNG transcriptional shifts) and Tfh-related biology (e.g., increases in IL21 signaling to effector T cells). In addition, activated myeloid subsets, including DC2 and monocytes, were increased in disease and were characterized by increased pro-inflammatory pathway expression, including IL-1β. Non-immune compartments showed increased stem/crypt and secretory enterocytes in CeD samples with a decrease in absorptive enterocytes, reflecting the villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia hallmarks of CeD epithelial dysfunction. Accompanying the epithelial changes, distinct changes in stromal populations were identified, particularly with increases in abundance and transcriptional activity of NRG1 and SMOC2 fibroblasts. Cell-cell interaction analysis across multiple cellular compartments proposed a distinct increased role of fibroblasts to support the epithelial reprogramming of the increased stem/crypt epithelial fraction in CeD, mediated by myeloid derived IL-1β signal and lymphoid-derived IFN-γ. This dataset reveals a previously unknown role for T-myeloid-stromal-epithelial cell communication in CeD, highlighting key mechanisms of the tissue-level cellular dynamics in response to gluten ingestion.">

        <tr id="Overcoming immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for developing novel cancer immunotherapies. Here, we report that IL-16 administration enhances the polarization of T helper 1 (Th1) cells by inhibiting glutamine catabolism through the downregulation of glutaminase in CD4+ T cells and increases the production of Th1 effector cytokine IFN-γ, thus improving anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, we find that establishing an IL-16-dependent, Th1-dominant TME relies on mast cell-produced histamine and results in the increased expression of the CXCR3 ligands in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), thereby improving the therapeutic effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Cancer patients exhibit impaired production of IL-16, which correlates with poorer prognosis. Additionally, low IL-16 production is associated with unresponsiveness to immunotherapy in cancer patients. Collectively, our findings provided new insights into the biological function of IL-16, emphasizing its potential clinical significance as a therapeutic approach to augment anti-tumor immunity and sensitize ICB-based cancer immunotherapy.">

Staphylococcus aureus accounts for half of craniotomy infections, increasing morbidity in a medically fragile patient population. T cells preferentially traffic to the brain during craniotomy infection; however, their functional importance is unknown. Using a mouse model of S. aureus craniotomy infection, CD4+ T cells were critical for bacterial containment, as treatment of WT animals with anti-CD4 exacerbated infection that was similar to phenotypes in Rag1–/– mice. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) revealed transcriptional heterogeneity in brain CD3+ infiltrates, with CD4+ cells most prominent that displayed Th1- and Th17-like characteristics, and adoptive transfer of either subset in Rag1–/– animals during early infection prevented S. aureus outgrowth. scRNA-Seq identified a robust IFN signature in several innate immune clusters, and examination of cell-to-cell interactions revealed extensive T cell crosstalk with monocytes/macrophages that was also observed in human craniotomy infection. A cooperative role for Th1 and Th17 responses was demonstrated by treatment of Ifng–/– mice with IL-17A neutralizing antibody that recapitulated phenotypes in Rag1–/– animals. Collectively, these findings implicate Th1- and Th17-mediated proinflammatory responses in shaping the innate immune landscape for S. aureus containment during craniotomy infection.">

        <tr id="Introduction MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88) is a key adaptor protein mediate immune responses, primarily through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling. The TLR/MYD88 pathway plays a critical role in dendritic cells (DC) maturation and function, contributing to the body’s innate immunity. Recent studies have further highlighted MYD88’s pivotal role in intrinsic immunity and its regulatory influence on the tumor microenvironment (TME) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of MYD88 in DCs and its regulatory role in the TME have gained increasing attention. Methods RNA-sequencing data retrieved from the TCGA and GEO databases were utilized for both the training and validation of our signature. Single-cell RNA transcriptome data from GEO were analyzed to investigate the correlation among subclusters of T cells, myeloid cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) within the HCC tumor microenvironment (TME). A combination of bioinformatics and machine learning approaches was employed to perform statistical analyses.Additionally, flow cytometry was conducted to quantify T cell subtypes and assess biomarker expression in DCs. A BALB/c-derived xenograft mouse model was established to evaluate the functional role of MyD88 in tumor progression and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to reassess the biological effects of MyD88 in HCC patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Results Our pan-cancer data analysis further highlights the significant impact of MYD88 on clinical outcomes in HCC. Analysis of TCGA and GEO databases confirms that MYD88 serves as a key signaling molecule in DCs, reinforcing its critical role in immune regulation. Our in vitro experiments demonstrates that MyD88 modulates T cell function through DCs. In vivo, H22 tumor cells exhibited accelerated growth in MyD88 knockout mice and a reduced response to anti-PD-1 treatment, whereas wild-type mice showed the opposite trend. Discussion These findings underscore the critical role of MYD88 in DC function, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for immunoregulation in HCC. By shaping the TME, MYD88 not only regulates the immune response in HCC but also influences patient clinical outcomes. Both ex vivo and in vivo experiments further validate that MYD88 impacts DC functionality, contributing to variations in HCC progression">

        <tr id="Excessive neutrophil infiltration can exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage, contributing to conditions like autoimmune disorders and liver diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects. Our study offers a perspective for advancing MSC-based therapies in tissue repair.">

        <tr id="Introduction Alterations of the adaptive immune system have been shown to impact bone healing and may result in impaired healing in some patients. Apart from T cells, B cells are the key drivers of adaptive immunity. Therefore, their role in age-associated impairments of bone healing might be essential to understand delays during the healing process. B cells are essential for bone formation, and their dysfunction has been associated with aging or autoimmune diseases. But whether age-associated changes in B cell phenotypes are involved in bone regeneration is unknown. Methods Here, we aimed to characterize the role of immune aging in B cell phenotypes during the early inflammatory phase of bone healing. By comparing non-immune experienced with young and immune experienced mice we aimed to analyze the effect of gained immune experience on B cells. Our single cell proteo-genomics analysis quantified thousands of transcriptomes of cells that were isolated from post osteotomy hematoma and the proximal and distal bone marrow cavities, and enabled us to evaluate cell proportion, differential gene expression and cell trajectories. Results While the B cell proportion in young and non-immune experienced animals did not significantly change from 2 to 5 days post osteotomy in the hematoma, we found a significant decrease of the B cell proportion in the immune experienced mice, which was accompanied by the decreased expression of B cell specific genes, suggesting a specific response in immune experienced animals. Furthermore, we detected the most extensive B cell differentiation block in immune-experienced mice compared to non-immune experienced and young animals, predominantly in the transition from immature to mature B cells. Discussion Our results suggest that the pronounced impairment of B cell production found in immune experienced animals plays an important role in the initial phase leading to delayed bone healing. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches may be able target the B cell differentiation defect to retain B cell functionality even in the immune experienced setting, which is prone to delayed healing.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Curative responses to immunotherapy require the generation of robust systemic immunity with limited toxicity. Recruitment of T cell populations such as precursor exhausted T cells (Tpex) from lymphoid tissues to tumors is a hallmark of effective treatment. However, the ability to efficiently induce this recruitment is lacking in current immunotherapy approaches. Furthermore, systemic administration of immunotherapies frequently results in dose-limiting toxicities, yielding an inadequate therapeutic window for eliciting durable responses. Methods In this investigation, we evaluated the safety and antitumor efficacy of locally administered interleukin 12 (IL-12) using a clinically translatable cytokine delivery platform (NCT05538624) to identify Tpex recruitment capabilities at tolerable cytokine doses. Results We show IL-12 cytokine factories can effectively treat a broad spectrum of cancer types. Single-cell RNA sequencing data suggests that the antitumor efficacy seen in our studies was due to retinal pigmented epithelial cells-mIL12 treatment inducing differentiation of Tpex cells within the tumor microenvironment. When administered in combination with checkpoint therapy, IL-12 cytokine factory treatment generated systemic abscopal immunity, preventing subcutaneous tumor outgrowth in 8/9 mice with colorectal cancer and lung metastasis in mice with melanoma. Furthermore, this platform was well tolerated in a non-human primate without signs of toxicity. Conclusions Our new immunotherapy approach provides a robust strategy for inducing Tpex recruitment and systemic immunity against a range of solid peritoneal malignancies, many incurable with current immunotherapy strategies. Notably, these features were achieved using IL-12, and by leveraging our technology, we avoided the toxicities that have prevented the translation of IL-12 to the clinic. Our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical development of IL-12 cytokine factories.">

        <tr id="In solid tumors, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex mix of tumor, immune, stromal cells, fibroblasts, and the extracellular matrix. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute a fraction of immune cells that may infiltrate into the TME. The primary function of these T-cells is to detect and eliminate tumor cells. However, due to the immunosuppressive factors present in the TME primarily mediated by Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) as well as the tumor cells themselves, T-cells fail to differentiate into effector cells or become dysfunctional and are unable to eliminate the tumor. In addition, chronic antigen stimulation within the TME also leads to a phenomenon, first identified in chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, where the T-cells become exhausted and lose their effector functions. Exhausted T-cells (Tex) are characterized by the presence of remarkably conserved inhibitory receptors, transcription and signaling factors and the downregulation of key effector molecules. Tex cells have been identified in various malignancies, including melanoma, colorectal and hepatocellular cancers. Recent studies have indicated novel strategies to reverse T-cell exhaustion. These include checkpoint inhibitor blockade targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (Tim-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), or combinations of different immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) or combination of ICTs with cytokine co-stimulation. In this review, we discuss aspects of T-cell dysfunction within the TME with a focus on T-cell exhaustion. We believe that gaining insight into the mechanisms of T-cell exhaustion within the TME of human solid tumors will pave the way for developing therapeutic strategies to target and potentially re-invigorate exhausted T-cells in cancer.">

        <tr id="Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a malignant hematologic disorder with limited curative options, primarily reliant on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Anemia, a prevalent symptom of MDS, has few effective treatment strategies. Realgar, though known for its therapeutic effects on MDS, remains poorly understood in terms of its mechanism of action. In this study, both in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted using Realgar and its primary active component, As2S2, to examine their impact on mouse erythroblasts at the single-cell level. Realgar treatment significantly altered the transcriptional profiles and cellular composition of bone marrow in mice, both in vivo and in vitro. Differentially expressed genes in erythroblasts regulated by Realgar were identified, unveiling potential regulatory functions and signaling pathways, such as heme biosynthesis, hemoglobin production, oxygen binding, IL-17 signaling, and MAPK pathways.

        <tr id="Significance Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate T cell immunity. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt)-expressing APCs are heterogenous regulators of T cell tolerance but their subtypes and lineage relationships are ill-defined. We report that RORγt+ dendritic cells (DCs) are evolutionarily conserved, exhibit wide tissue distribution and reconcile various RORγt+ APC populations known to promote peripheral T cell tolerance. We show that RORγt+ DCs can sense pathogens, migrate to lymph nodes, activate naïve CD4+ T cells, and accumulate in demyelinating neuroinflammation with a proinflammatory phenotype. Thus, RORγt+ DCs have a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment. This highlights their therapeutic potential and their affiliation with DCs.">

        <tr id="Esophageal cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death, often preceded with chronic inflammation and injuries. The NFκB/IKKβ pathway plays a central role in inflammation, yet its role in early esophageal carcinogenesis remains unclear. This study investigated the role of epithelial IKKβ in early esophageal carcinogenesis. Mice were treated with the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) or a vehicle for one month to induce precancerous lesions. Esophagi were harvested and examined through histological, protein, flow cytometry, and RNA analyses. Histological analysis revealed that 4-NQO treatment led to increased inflammation, intraepithelial CD45+ immune cells, and elevated IKKβ phosphorylation levels. Mice with esophageal epithelial-specific Ikkβ deletion (4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO) showed delayed progression to a precancerous state, with reduced immune cell recruitment compared to 4-NQO/controls. Immunophenotyping showed decreased recruitment of T cells, including CD4+, CD8+ and regulatory (Tregs) T cells, and increased recruitment of macrophages in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice compared to 4-NQO/controls. RNA sequencing data identified 262 differentially expressed genes in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice, implicating pathways related to inflammation and wound healing. Notably, the chemokine CXCL9, a T cell chemoattractant, was significantly upregulated in 4-NQO control mice, but not in 4-NQO/IkkβEEC-KO mice. Further analysis identified IFNγ as an upstream regulator of Cxcl9 expression, and neutralization of IFNγ reduced Cxcl9 expression levels in 4-NQO treated mice. Additionally, in vitro studies demonstrated that IFNγ upregulates Cxcl9 in an NF-ĸB dependent manner in esophageal keratinocytes. These findings suggest that epithelial IKKβ regulates the immune microenvironment in early esophageal carcinogenesis through the IFNγ/CXCL9 axis and influencing T cell recruitment and inflammatory responses. Summary In a mouse model of early esophageal squamous cell carcinogenesis, loss of epithelial Ikkβ reduced inflammation and T cell recruitment, increased macrophage recruitment, inhibited IFNγ/CXCL9 signaling, and delayed the transition to a precancerous state.">

        <tr id="Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune effectors with considerable heterogeneity and potent antitumor capabilities. Intraepithelial ILC1 (ieILC1)-like NK cells, a population of cytotoxic tissue-resident innate lymphoid cells, have recently been documented in the microenvironment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and other solid tumors. These cells have antitumor cytolytic potential and are potent producers of type 1 cytokines, including IFNγ. Here, we identify a subpopulation of ex vivo differentiated ieILC1-like NK cells that produce IL-13 upon stimulation. Functional characterization revealed that these cells co-expressed IFNγ and IL-13 while maintaining an ILC1 transcriptional signature. IL-13 was induced either upon co-culture with tumor cell lines, or in response to TGF-β and IL-15. IL-13-expressing ieILC1-like NK cells were identified among tumor infiltrating lymphocytes expanded from patient HNSCC tumors, in support of their in vivoexistence in primary tumors. These data demonstrate additional heterogeneity within the ieILC1-like NK cell population than previously appreciated and highlight a unique form of ILC plasticity in which cells with clear ILC1 transcriptional profiles express a type 2 cytokine. With the known roles of IL-13 in cancer cell growth dynamics and immunoregulation, the identification of this subset within tumor microenvironments presents a potential target for therapeutic manipulation.">

        <tr id="A primary obstacle for HIV elimination is the long-term viral reservoir in lymphoid tissues (LT) that can cause rebound viremia if therapy is stopped. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are critical for control of HIV and SIV viremia; however, CD8+ T cells that migrate to LT are primarily non-cytotoxic, calling into question whether these cells could reduce the viral reservoir on ART or control viral replication when therapy is halted. To determine if CD8+ T cells can inhibit viral replication when retained in lymphoid tissues, we inhibited lymphocyte egress from LTs in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RM) during analytic treatment interruption (ATI) using the S1PR modulator FTY720 alone or in combination with anti-PD1 and the IL-15 receptor superagonist N-803 to increase cytolytic function. FTY720 retained migrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in LT, whereas cytotoxic CD8+ T cells remained in the vasculature. After ATI and viral rebound, activated SIV-specific CD8+ T cells increased in frequency in LT of FTY720-treated RM but failed to become cytotoxic or control plasma viremia compared to controls, even when combined with anti-PD1 and N-803. These findings indicate that LT-localized CD8+ T cells alone are insufficient to delay or prevent plasma viral rebound during ATI. Significance Statement HIV therapeutic and cure strategies have all operated under the assumption that CD8+ T cells can become cytotoxic in lymph nodes to eliminate infected cells from reservoir repositories. Using FTY720 to prevent lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes, we demonstrated that lymphoid tissue-restricted CD8+ T cells are insufficient to prevent SIV rebound during antiretroviral treatment interruption, even in the presence of immunomodulators such as IL-15 receptor superagonist and PD-1 blockade. These findings call into question the ability of lymph node CD8+ T cells to control or eliminate SIV/HIV infection from lymphoid tissues without substantial immunomodulation, a notion contrary to current efforts to engage CD8+ T cells for therapeutic elimination of HIV viral reservoirs during ART.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains the deadliest cancer in the United States, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) as its most prevalent subtype. While computed tomography (CT)-based screening has improved early detection and enabled curative surgeries, the molecular and cellular dynamics driving early-stage LUAD progression remain poorly understood, limiting non-surgical treatment options. To address this gap, we profiled 2.24 million cells from 122 early-stage LUAD patients using multiplexed imaging mass cytometry (IMC). This analysis revealed the molecular, spatial, and temporal dynamics of LUAD development. Our findings uncover a binary progression model. LUAD advances through either inflammation, driven by a balance of cytotoxic and regulatory immune activity, or fibrosis, characterized by stromal activation. Surprisingly, tumor cell populations did not increase significantly. Instead, they displayed a mixed phenotypic profile consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), effectively masking the expansion of malignant cells. Furthermore, we addressed discrepancies between CT-based and histology-based subtyping. CT scans, while non-invasive, often mischaracterize invasive fibrotic tumors—which account for 20.5% of LUAD cases—as mild, non-solid ground glass opacities (GGOs). Using high-content IMC imaging, we demonstrate that these tumors harbor significant risks and advocate for improved diagnostic strategies. These strategies should integrate molecular profiling to refine patient stratification and therapeutic decision-making. Altogether, our study provides a high-resolution, systems-level view of the tumor microenvironment in early-stage LUAD. We characterize key transitions in oncogenesis and propose a precision-driven framework to enhance the detection and management of aggressive disease subtypes.">

        <tr id="CD4+ T cells play critical roles in the positive and negative regulation of cellular immunity through the many functional subsets they comprise. The progressive growth of immunogenic tumors which nonetheless generate mutation-specific T cells suggests that effective immune control may be avoided or suppressed at the level of the neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cell response. We used a tetramer specific for a validated neoantigen, CTLCH129>Q/I-Ek, to characterize the ontogeny of natural CD4+ T cell responses to an aggressive and poorly immunogenic Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II (MHCII)-deficient tumor, SCC VII, during progressive growth or following therapeutic peptide vaccination. We find that the natural CD4+ T cell response to a growing tumor is phenotypically and functionally diverse, with distinct subsets including type 1 helper (Th1), T follicular helper (Tfh)-like, and regulatory T cell (Treg) lineages appearing as early as 9 days after tumor implantation. Therapeutic vaccination using the CLTCH129>Q peptide in adjuvant plus α-PD-1 sharply reduces the frequency of CLTCH129>Q-specific Treg frequency in both tumor and tumor-draining lymph node (tdLN). Single cell transcriptomic analysis of CLTC-specific CD4+ T cells recapitulated and extended the diversity of the response, with TCRs of varying affinity found within each functional subset. The TCR affinity differences did not strictly correlate with function, however, as even the lowest affinity TCRs isolated from Treg can mediate therapeutic efficacy against established tumors in the setting of adoptive cellular therapy (ACT). These findings offer unprecedented insight into the functional diversity of a natural neoantigen-specific CD4+ T cell response and show how immunotherapeutic intervention influences the phenotype, magnitude, and efficacy of the anti-tumor immune response. What is already known on this topic Little is known about the ontogeny, architecture, development of the CD4+ NeoAg-specific repertoire induced by progressively-growing tumor. This study was performed to address this topic and contribute new information to aid in its understanding What this study adds This study reveals that the NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cell response to a growing tumor is phenotypically and functionally diverse, featuring a range of functional T cells subsets including TH1, TFH, and Treg expressing a range of functional TCR avidities, and demonstrates how an immunotherapeutic NeoAg vaccine can alter their relative composition within the tumor and tumor-draining lymph node. How this study might affect research, practice or policy This study offers new insights into the diversity of NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cells and their response to a tumor in the presence or absence of immunotherapeutic intervention. This information could lead to new approaches to immune monitoring in the clinical setting of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and cancer vaccines. Furthermore, we show that Treg can be a potent source of TCRs that can mediate therapeutic benefit in the setting of adoptive cell therapy (ACT).">

        <tr id="Background Tumor immune evasion extends beyond T cells, affecting innate immune elements like natural killer cells (NK) and macrophages within the tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME). Nevertheless, translational strategies to trigger collaboration of NK cells and macrophages to initiate sufficient anti-tumor cytoxicity remain scarce and are urgently needed. Methods In this study, TCGA datasets was used to confirm the prognosis value of the expression level of NLR family pyrin domain containing 4 (NLRP4) in NSCLC and the tumor tissues microarray was used to further check its clinical-relevance at protein-level. Subsequently, a tumor cell line with stable NLRP4 overexpression was established and subcutaneous tumor models in C57BL/6J mice were used to validate the anti-tumor characteristics of NLRP4. After analyzing the tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry and multiplex immunofluorescence, we further validated our findings through co-culture transwell assays and TCGA analysis. Utilizing bulk-RNA sequencing, proteomics, and mass spectrometry of mouse tumor tissues, we innovatively identified the downstream pathways of NLRP4 and verified them through co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and Western blot (WB) experiments. Results NLRP4 could trigger a distinct anti-tumor ecosystem organized by TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1 in lung cancer, discovered in TCGA analysis and verified in murine model. NLRP4-eco exerted tumor-suppression capacity through chemokine reprogramming including CCL5 and CXCL2. Meanwhile, the cytoxicity of NK could be facilitated by iNOS+M1. Mechanistically, NLRP4 stimulated PI3K/Akt-NF-kB axis through suppression of the activity of PP2A. Besides, knockdown of CCL5 and blockade of CXCL2-CXCR2 axis abolished chemotaxis of TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1 respectively, as well as for LB-100, a PP2A inhibitor. Conclusion Altogether, we delineated NLRP4’s unexplored facets and discovered an NLRP4-driven anti-tumor ecosystem composed of TIGIT+TNFA+ NK and iNOS+ M1. Finally, targeting PP2A by its inhibitor successfully mimicked the anti-tumor capacity of the overexpression of NLRP4.

        <tr id="Cancer cells harbor cell-intrinsic programs capable of sculpting immunogenic landscapes, yet molecular brakes that enforce immune evasion remain poorly defined. Here, we identify C9ORF50, a previously uncharacterized intrinsically disordered protein, as a liquid-liquid phase separation-driven regulator of RNA processing and actionable immunotherapy target. Genetic ablation of C9ORF50 induces selective intron retention in spliceosome component transcripts, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This dsRNA activates type I interferon pathway that in turn orchestrates a chemokine secretory program critical for T cell recruitment. The resultant enhancement of tumor immunogenicity and reprogramming of tumor immune microenvironment drives robust antitumor immunity, effectively converting immunologically “cold” tumors to “hot” phenotypes. Therapeutic targeting of C9ORF50 via RNA interference achieved robust tumor suppression in syngeneic models, suggesting its translational relevance. Notably, C9ORF50 exhibits tumor-predominant expression, with minimal baseline levels detected in healthy tissues or immune cell populations, underscoring its potential safety as a therapeutic target. Our study not only identifies C9ORF50 as a novel LLPS-dependent regulator of RNA splicing but also establishes it as a promising and potentially safe therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can produce a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from active tuberculosis (TB) to asymptomatic latent infection. Although CD4 T-cells are key immune effectors to control TB, early after infection, the innate immune response must play a role in tackling the disease. Here, we performed in-depth analyses of the acute immune response to MTBVAC, a candidate vaccine engineered from Mtb with the aim of protecting adults from pulmonary TB disease, still a major global challenge. scRNA-seq shows expansion of CD4+ and cytotoxic γδ T-cells, data confirmed by flow cytometry. CD4 T-cells exhibited lower HLA-DR and higher L-selectin expression, compared to BCG-stimulation, indicating differential activation or dynamics. Importantly, MTBVAC-activated γδ T-cells had a unique cytotoxic CD16+GZMB+ phenotype, reminiscent of effector cells found in Mtb positive individuals controlling infection. IFN-γ and TNF-α were released in cultures, while IL-17A/F were almost undetectable.">

        <tr id="Trained immunity serves as a de facto memory for innate immune responses, resulting in long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. It enhances resistance to pathogens and augments immunosurveillance under physiological conditions. Given that innate immune cells typically have a short lifespan and do not divide, persistent innate immune memory may be mediated by epigenetic and metabolic changes in long-lived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. HSCs fine-tune their state and fate in various training conditions, thereby generating functionally adapted progeny cells that orchestrate innate immune plasticity. Notably, both beneficial and maladaptive trained immunity processes can comprehensively influence HSC state and fate, leading to divergent hematopoiesis and immune outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize recent advances regarding HSC state and fate in the context of trained immunity. By elucidating the stem cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory network, we aim to refine current models of innate immune memory and provide actionable insights for developing targeted therapies against infectious diseases and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for engineering precision-trained immunity through HSC-targeted interventions.">

For this reason, recent therapeutic algorithms include immunotherapeutic agents that target such cell populations for the treatment of patients with a variety of solid tumors. In contrast to solid tumors, such immunotherapeutic strategies failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of patients with myeloid malignancies, including myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this reason, the study of immunophenotypic and molecular changes in cytotoxic effector cell populations in patients with such disorders would provide the necessary evidence for the development of novel immunotherapies. In this review, we provide an overview of experimental studies describing the modulation of CD8+ T cell populations in patients with myeloid neoplasms, focusing on whether and how specific cell phenotypes are linked to disease progression and treatment.">

        <tr id="Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) frequently develops resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, resulting from an immune-excluded microenvironment. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can increase tumor immunogenicity and further augment immune-cell infiltration by releasing immunogenic molecules. Hence, inducing ICD within tumors might be a promising strategy to restore antitumor immunity and sensitize HNSCC to ICB. Herein, we developed shikonin (SHK)-loaded, CGKRK-modified lipid nanoparticles (C-SNPs) and demonstrated that C-SNPs could enrich in tumor cells and induce necroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that C-SNPs suppressed tumor-cell mismatch repair, which later activated the cGAS-mediated IFN response and further increased the expression of PD-L1. Combining C-SNPs with an anti-PD-1 antibody increased the infiltration of DCs and CD8+ T cells, yet the response was limited. Modifying C-SNPs with Mn2+ (C-SMNPs) enhanced the activation of cGAS-STING signaling and further boosted the maturation of DCs and the differentiation of cytotoxic T cells within ICB-treated tumors. Importantly, compared to C-SNPs, the combination of C-SMNPs with ICB resulted in more sustained tumor suppression in vivo. Together, we developed a versatile nanoparticle that delivered SHK and Mn2+ which sensitized HNSCC to ICB by disrupting tumor-cell mismatch repair and boosting the cGAS-STING-mediated IFN response. This nanosized ICD inducer-based strategy holds therapeutic potential in synergizing with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy to enhance treatment efficacy in HNSCC.">

        <tr id="T cells play diverse roles in cancer immunology, acting as tumor suppressors, cytotoxic effectors, enhancers of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and immune suppressors; providing memory and surveillance; modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME); or activating innate immune cells. However, cancer cells can disrupt T cell function, leading to T cell exhaustion and a weakened immune response against the tumor. The expression of exhausted T cell (Tex) markers plays a pivotal role in shaping the immune landscape of multiple cancers. Our aim was to systematically investigate the role of known T cell exhaustion (Tex) markers across multiple cancers while exploring their molecular interactions, mutation profiles, and potential implications for immunotherapy. The mRNA expression profile of six Tex markers, LAG-3, PDCD1, TIGIT, HAVCR2, CXCL13, and LAYN was investigated in pan-cancer. Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), and other repositories, we characterized the differential expression of the Tex markers, their association with the patients’ survival outcome, and their mutation profile in multiple cancers. Additionally, we analyzed the effects on cancer-related pathways and immune infiltration within the TME, offering valuable insights into mechanisms of cancer immune evasion and progression. Finally, the correlation between their expression and sensitivity to multiple anti-cancer drugs was investigated extensively. Differential expression of all six markers was significantly associated with KIRC and poor prognosis in several cancers. They also played a potential activating role in apoptosis, EMT, and hormone ER pathways, as well as a potential inhibitory role in the DNA damage response and RTK oncogenic pathways. Infiltration of different immune cells was also found to be associated with the expression of the Tex-related genes in most cancer types. These findings underline that the reviving of exhausted T cells can be used to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer patients.">

        <tr id="B cells are essential components of the immune response, primarily recognized for their ability to produce antibodies. However, emerging research reveals their important roles in regulating immune responses and influencing tumor development, independent of antibodies. The connection between tumor progression and alterations in the tumor microenvironment is well-established, as immune infiltrating cells can enhance the survival of tumor cells by modifying their surroundings. Despite this, the majority of studies have focused on T cells and macrophages, creating a gap in our understanding of B cells. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) represent a crucial subpopulation that plays a significant role in maintaining immune balance. They may have a substantial impact on tumor immunity by negatively regulating tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This paper reviews the existing literature on Bregs, examining their development, phenotypes, functions, and the mechanisms through which they exert their regulatory effects. Furthermore, we highlight their potential interventional roles and prognostic significance in cancer therapy. By addressing the current gaps in knowledge regarding Bregs within tumors, we hope to inspire further research that could lead to innovative cancer treatments and improved outcomes for patients.">

        <tr id="Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) are incurable, and new therapies are urgently needed. BCBM upregulates stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, suggesting a potential metabolic vulnerability. Here, we test the effect of a brain-penetrant, clinical-stage SCD inhibitor (SCDi) on breast cancer cells and mouse models of BCBM. We show that SCDi markedly reshapes the lipidome of breast cancer cells, resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress, DNA damage, impaired DNA damage repair, and cytotoxicity. Importantly, SCDi alone or combined with a PARP inhibitor prolongs the survival of BCBM-bearing mice. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of SCD enhances antigen presentation by dendritic cells, increases interferon signaling, promotes the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, and decreases the proportion of exhausted T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a syngeneic mouse model of BCBM. Additionally, SCDi reduces the engagement of immunosuppressive pathways, including the PD-1:PD-L1/PD-L2 and PVR/TIGIT axes in the TME. These findings suggest that SCD inhibition could be an effective strategy to both intrinsically reduce tumor growth and reprogram anti-tumor immunity in the brain microenvironment to treat BCBM.">

Tissue inflammation can reshape macrophage composition through monocyte replacement. Replacement of tissue macrophages with monocytes differentiating in an inflammatory environment can potentially imprint a phenotype that switches the liver from an immune-tolerant organ to one predisposed to tissue damage. We longitudinally sampled the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had active liver inflammation and were starting antiviral therapy. Antiviral therapy suppressed viral replication and liver inflammation, which coincided with decreased myeloid activation markers. Single-cell RNA-Seq mapped peripheral inflammatory markers to a monocyte-derived macrophage population, distinct from Kupffer cells, with an inflammatory transcriptional profile. The inflammatory macrophages (iMacs) differentiated from blood monocytes and were unique from macrophage found in healthy or cirrhotic liver. iMacs retained their core transcriptional signature after inflammation resolved, indicating inflammation-mediated remodeling of the macrophage population in the human liver that may affect progressive liver disease and immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Despite advances in engineered adaptive immune cell therapies, current options for innate immune cell therapies are sparse. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a neutrophil progenitor-based cell therapy. Murine conditionally-immortalized neutrophil progenitors (NPs) overcome the hurdles of alternative cell therapies by engrafting in the unconditioned host and substantially contributing to the host neutrophil population. Here we demonstrate the therapeutic value of NPs using a murine model of the primary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Those with CGD are highly susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus because of genetic mutations that impair neutrophil antimicrobial function. We find that the prophylactic treatment of CGD mice with transfused NPs rescue them from an otherwise lethal S. aureus pulmonary infection. In investigating the mechanisms behind the improved clearance of S. aureus and survival of CGD mice, our data suggests that the antimicrobial function of host CGD neutrophils is rescued by the presence of donor-derived wild-type neutrophils. We also observe that survival is improved to >50% in the CGD model when mice receive NPs post-infection. This work highlights the application of NPs to improving outcomes to acute bacterial infection in CGD, demonstrating the translational potential of conditionally-immortalized myeloid progenitors as a cellular therapy.">

        <tr id="Abstract Persistent systemic inflammation is associated with an elevated risk of cardiometabolic diseases. However, the characteristics of the innate and adaptive immune systems in individuals who develop these conditions remain poorly defined. Doublets, or cell-cell complexes, are routinely eliminated from flow cytometric and other immune phenotyping analyses, which limits our understanding of their relationship to disease states. Using well-characterized clinical cohorts, including participants with controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a model for chronic inflammation and increased immune cell interactions, we show that circulating CD14+ monocytes complexed to CD3+ T cells are dynamic, biologically relevant, and increased in individuals with diabetes after adjusting for confounding factors. The complexes form functional immune synapses with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and greater glucose utilization. Furthermore, in persons with HIV, the CD3+ T cell: CD14+ monocyte complexes had more HIV copies compared to matched CD14+ monocytes or CD4+ T cells alone. Our results demonstrate that circulating CD3+ T-cell: CD14+ monocyte pairs represent dynamic cellular interactions that may contribute to inflammation and cardiometabolic disease pathogenesis. CD3+ T-cell: CD14+ monocyte complexes may originate or be maintained, in part, by chronic viral infections. These findings provide a foundation for future studies investigating mechanisms linking T cell-monocyte cell-cell complexes to developing immune-mediated diseases, including HIV and diabetes.">

        <tr id="Neuroblastoma (NB) is an immunologically “cold” tumor with poor or no inflamed substrates as most of solid pediatric tumors (SPT). Consistent data indicate that NB tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by myeloid cells, with little (but variable) T cell infiltration. The obstacles to lymphocyte infiltration and to their anti-tumor activity are due to different tumor immune evasion strategies, including loss of HLA Class I molecules, high expression of immune checkpoint molecular ligands leading to exhaustion of T effector (and NK) cells, induction of T regulatory, myeloid and stromal cells and secretion of immunosuppressive mediators. In odds with adult solid tumors, NB displays weak immunogenicity caused by intrinsic low mutational burden and scant expression of neoepitopes in the context of MHC-class I antigens which, in turn, are particularly poorly expressed on NB cells, thus inducing low anti-tumor T cell responses. In addition, NB is generated from embryonal cells and is the result of transcriptional abnormalities and not of the accumulation of genetic mutations over time, thus further explaining the low immunogenicity. The poor expression of immunogenic molecules on tumor cells is associated with the high production of immunosuppressive factors which further downregulate lymphocyte infiltration and activity, thus explaining the limited efficacy of new drugs in NB, as immune checkpoint inhibitors. This review is focused on examining the role of T effector and regulatory cells infiltrating TME of NB, taking into account their repertoire, phenotype, function, plasticity and, importantly, predictive value for defining novel targets for therapy.">

        <tr id="Introduction Recent findings reveal that the precursors of exhausted CD8+ T (CD8+ Tpex) cells possess stem-like signatures in tumor immunity, which originate from tumor draining lymph node (TdLN)-derived tumor-specific memory (CD8+ TTSM) cells. Both of these T subsets can be collectively referred to as stem-like CD8+ T cells, which demonstrate robust self-renewal ability and can proliferate and differentiate into transitory effector-like exhausted T cells (Texint). There are reports that chemotherapeutic drugs can promote the antitumor immune responses of patients by increasing the number of CD8+ T cells; however, whether chemotherapeutic drugs increase these two stem-like CD8+ T cells remain further exploration. Methods Tpex cell-associated subpopulations in human colorectal tumors were analyzed by using single-cell sequencing data. CT26 and B16 tumor models of wild type and Eomes conditional knockout mice were constructed, and the changes of TTSM, Tpex and Tex subsets in mice were dissected by flow cytometry after treatment with decitabine (DAC), doxorubicin (DOX) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Results In this study, we demonstrated that DAC and 5-FU expanded CD8+ TTSM cells in TdLNs. At the same time, we validated that DAC and 5-FU substantially promoted the expansion of CD62L+CD8+ Tpex cells and subsequently increased effector function of CX3CR1+ CD8+ Texint cells. In addition, the conditional knockout of transcription factor Eomes in CD8+ T cells partially eliminated DAC-amplified CD62L+ CD8+ Tpex cells, but had no effect on such CD8+ T subset expanded by 5-FU. Conclusion The present study demonstrated that both DAC and 5-FU promoted the differentiation of stem-like CD8+ TTSM cells in TdLNs and significantly enhanced the differentiation and expansion of stem-like CD62L+ CD8+ Tpex and CX3CR1+ Texint cells in tumor microenvironment.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Efficient tumor T-cell infiltration is crucial for the effectiveness of T-cell-based therapies against solid tumors. Eosinophils play crucial roles in recruiting T cells in solid tumors. Our group has previously generated induced eosinophils (iEOs) from human pluripotent stem cells and exhibited synergistic efficacy with CAR-T cells in solid tumor inhibition. However, administrated eosinophils might influx into inflammatory lungs, posing a potential safety risk. Mitigating the safety concern and enhancing efficacy is a promising development direction for further application of eosinophils.


METHODS
We developed a new approach to generate eosinophils with enhanced potency from human chemically reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (hCiPSCs) with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 signaling agonist R848.


RESULTS
R848-activated iEOs (R-iEOs) showed significantly decreased influx to the inflamed lungs, indicating a lower risk of causing airway disorders. Furthermore, these R-iEOs had enhanced anti-tumor functions, preferably accumulated at tumor sites, and further increased T-cell infiltration. The combination of R-iEOs and CAR-T cells suppressed tumor growth in mice. Moreover, the chemo-trafficking signaling increased in R-iEOs, which may contribute to the decreased lung influx of R-iEOs and the increased tumor recruitment of T cells.


CONCLUSION
Our study provides a novel approach to alleviate the potential safety concerns associated with eosinophils while increasing T-cell infiltration in solid tumors. This finding offers a prospective strategy for incorporating eosinophils to improve CAR-T-cell immunotherapy for solid tumors in the future.">

        <tr id="In the last two decades, novel and promising cell-based therapies have populated the treatment landscape for haematological tumors. However, commonly exploited T and NK cell-based therapies show limited applicability to solid tumors. This is mainly given by the impaired tumor trafficking capability and limited effector activity of these cells within a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Myeloid cells spontaneously home to tumors and can thus be reprogrammed and/or engineered to directly attack tumor cells or locally and selectively deliver therapeutically relevant payloads that may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy against difficult-to-access solid tumors. In the context of myeloid cell-based therapies, adoptive transfer of monocytes has often been overshadowed by infusion of differentiated macrophages or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite their promising therapeutic potential. Here, we summarize the recent improvements and benefits of using monocytes for the treatment of solid tumors, their current clinical applications and the challenges of their use as well as some possible strategies to overcome them.">

        <tr id="Background: Clinical features of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) predominantly include respiratory symptoms and exacerbated multi-organ complications, especially in patients with comorbidities. Cellular immunity, including lymphocytes, is a critical factor in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, immune dysregulation occurs in severe COVID-19 patients, characterized by cytokine storm and lymphopenia. The effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies for COVID-19 is being assessed. The secretome released by MSC functions similarly to the cells themselves as an immunomodulator, offering potential advantages in terms of safety and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to assess the effect of umbilical cord MSC-derived (UC-MSC) secretome treatment on lymphocyte count and soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1) levels in severe COVID-19 patient's whole blood.Materials and methods: Twelve whole blood samples from healthy individuals and severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed for lymphocyte count and functional activation using flow cytometry, along with sPD-1 level measurement in pre-treatment and post-secretome conditions.Results: The lymphocyte count in severe COVID-19 patients was significantly decreased, particularly for T cells and NK cells, indicating lymphopenia. Following secretome treatment, CD4+ T cell counts significantly increased compared to pre-treatment, although this change was not significant in the negative control group. Additionally, there was a minimal reduction in B cell count and an increase in sPD-1 levels. Elevated sPD-1 may alleviate T cell exhaustion by interfering with PD-1 binding to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).Conclusion: Administration of UC-MSC secretome to the whole blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggested immune improvement, with significant increases in CD4+ T cell counts, enhanced B cell survival, and elevated sPD-1 levels. Keywords: COVID-19, cellular immunity, lymphocytes, secretome, MSC">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is a prevalent form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and immune abnormalities play a crucial role in promoting its development. However, the dynamic changes and regulatory characteristics of immune cells during TPE progression remain incompletely understood. This study analyzed DNA methylation and transcriptome data from macrophages and CD4+ T cells from pleural lavage fluid of BCG‐induced tuberculous pleurisy mouse models at specific time points (Days 0, 1, 7, and 14). The results revealed substantial alterations in DNA methylation patterns associated with inflammatory factors and interferon genes. Notably, macrophages exhibited the most pronounced differences in DNA methylation profiles on Day 1, while CD4+ T cells demonstrated gradual changes over time. The investigation further indicated that DNA methylation primarily regulated the differentiation of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells but not Th9 cells. Additionally, single‐cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed an increasing expression of C1q during infection, which was regulated by DNA methylation. Importantly, C1q+ and C1q− macrophages demonstrated distinct roles in modulating immune responses during infection. This research provides valuable insights into the DNA methylation profile of immune cells during Mycobacterium bovis infection–induced pleurisy in a mouse model, enhancing our understanding of the upstream regulatory mechanisms underlying immune response development in TPE.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Strategies to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors include targeting additional immunosuppressive compartments in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Inhibitory macrophages (Mφ) can be one of the most abundant immune cells in the TME associated with poor prognosis. However, to date, selective Mφ depletion strategies as a cancer immunotherapy have not been successful in clinical trials. Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure (MARCO) is one of a family of class-A scavenger receptors expressed by Mφ in the TME and is one of the most upregulated transcripts in dendritic cells (DC) following their ex vivo uptake of dead tumor cells. The clinical significance of MARCO expression in the TME is not fully understood. Methods The therapeutic potential of targeting MARCO by an anti-murine MARCO (ED31, clone ED31) monoclonal antibody, which inhibits ligand-binding to MARCO, was explored in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) or anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) in C57BL/6J mice bearing B16F10 or Pan02 tumors. The mechanism by which ED31 impacts the TME was investigated by flow cytometry in the different treatment arms. The contribution of Mφ was assessed by both in vivo depletion and in vitro functional assays. Chemokine production was measured by a bead-based multiplex assay. Results ED31 enhanced antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4, but not of anti-PD-1. Analysis of the TME revealed that adding ED31 to anti-CTLA-4 substantially increased immune cell infiltration, including mature conventional DC recruitment, that was due to a switch to M1-pattern chemokines by Mφ. Mφ depletion completely abrogated both the increase in immune cell infiltration and chemokine production, and abolished the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy. Conclusions Targeting MARCO as an additional checkpoint in the TME can offer a strategy to improve the antitumor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 through a mechanism involving Mφ reprogramming rather than their depletion.">

        <tr id="Although anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cells demonstrate high response rates in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas, a considerable proportion of patients eventually encounter disease progression or relapse. The short-term and long-term outcomes of CAR-T treatment are intricately linked to the tumor microenvironment (TME), wherein macrophages with polarized characteristics can exhibit either anti-tumorigenic or pro-tumorigenic roles. Despite evidence implicating the crucial involvement of macrophages in CAR-T cell-treated lymphoma, their dynamic distribution and immune function related to lymphoma progression remain poorly understood. Immunocompetent mice were utilized to establish syngeneic A20 lymphoma/leukemia models. The distribution and polarization of macrophages were detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry techniques. We observed that CD19 CAR-T therapy exhibited significant efficacy in protecting mice against lymphoma, leading to increased infiltration of macrophages into the tumor tissue. Notably, during remission stages, M1-like macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+C206−CD80+) were predominant, whereas in relapsed mice, there was a shift towards M2-like phenotypes (CD11b+F4/80+C206+CD80+). The transition from remissive to relapsed status was accompanied by a reduction in the M1/M2 ratio and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis confirmed differential expression levels of CD206 and CD163 between remissive and relapsed mice, while signaling pathways involving PI3K and STAT3 may contribute to the skewing towards M2 polarization. In summary, our findings highlight the dynamic transformation of macrophage polarization during different stages of lymphoma progression and underscore its potential implications for immunotherapeutic interventions.">

        <tr id="Background Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis) could regulate inflammatory markers, promote intestinal barrier integrity, and block tumor formation in colon. However, the regulatory effect of P. distasonis on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of P. distasonis on NSCLC and its impact on tumor immunity. Methods We first established a mouse model of Lewis lung cancer, and administered P. distasonis and intrabitoneal injection of anti-mouse PD-1 monoclonal antibody to assess the impact of P. distasonis on tumor immunity, and mouse intestinal barrier. Then, we explored the effect of P. distasonis on CD8+T cells and CXCL9 secretion mediated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). We used the TLR1/2 complex inhibitor CPT22 to evaluate its effect on macrophage activation. Finally, we explored the effect of P. distasonis on CD8+T cells and CXCL9 secreted by TAM in vivo. Results In vivo, P. distasonis enhanced anti-tumor effects of anti-PD-1 in NSCLC mice, improved intestinal barrier integrity, recruited macrophages, and promoted M1 polarization. In vitro, CD86 and iNOS levels in BMDM were elevated and CD206 and Arg1 levels were suppressed in membrane fraction of P. distasonis (PdMb) group in comparison to Control group. With additional CPT22 pre-treatment, the levels of CD86 and iNOS in BMDM were reduced, and the levels of CD206 and Arg1 were increased. Compared to PBS group, P. distasonis group exhibited higher proportion of CD8+T cells in tumor tissues, along with increased positive proportion of GZMB and IFN-γ in CD8+T cells. Additionally, in comparison to Control group, PdMb group showed an elevated proportion of GZMB+T and IFN-γ+T cells within CD8+T cells, and secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin, and GZMB in CD8+T cell supernatant increased. Moreover, the proportion of CXCL9+F4/80+ macrophages in tumor tissues was higher in P. distasonis group compared to PBS group. In comparison to Control group, CXCL9 protein level in BMDM and CXCL9 secretion level in BMDM supernatant were increased in PdMb group. Finally, P. distasonis enhanced CD8+T cell activity by secreting CXCL9 from macrophages in vivo. Conclusions P. distasonis promoted CXCL9 secretion of TAM and enhanced CD8+T cell activity to trigger anti-tumor immunity against anti-PD-1 treatment in NSCLC mice.

        <tr id="Background As a type of autophagy, aggrephagy degrades the aggregation of misfolded protein in cells and plays an important role in key genetic events for various cancers. However, aggrephagy functions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) in endometrial cancer (EC) remain to be elucidated. Methods A total of 36,227 single cells from single-cell RNA-seq data derived from five EC tumor samples were comprehensively analyzed using a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm for 44 aggrephagy-related genes. Bulk RNA-seq cohorts from public repositories were utilized to assess the prognostic value of aggrephagy-related TME clusters and predict immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapeutic response in EC. Results Fibroblasts, macrophages, CD8+T cells, and lymphatic endothelial cells were categorized into two to five aggrephagy-related subclusters, respectively. CellChat analysis showed that the aggrephagy-related subtypes of TME cells exhibited extensive interactions with tumor epithelial cells, particularly for macrophages. Moreover, aggrephagy regulators may be significantly associated with the pseudotime trajectories of major TME cell types as well as the clinical and biological features of EC. Bulk-seq analysis showed that these aggrephagy-related subclusters had significant predictive value for the survival and immune checkpoint blockade response in EC patients. Notably, immunohistochemical staining results manifested that the TUBA1A+ macrophage subtype was linked to less lymph node metastasis and longer survival, which were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis findings. Conclusions This study provided a novel view of aggrephagy signaling in the EC tumor microenvironment, and intervention of aggrephagy was expected to improve the survival rate of EC patients.">

        <tr id="Background
 Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a critical treatment for hematologic disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, and specific immune deficiencies. Despite its efficacy, challenges such as engraftment failure and delayed neutrophil regeneration remain significant barriers. These complications lead to prolonged cytopenia, increased risks of infections and other complications, and elevated morbidity and mortality rates. While mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to play essential roles in supporting hematopoiesis, the precise mechanisms and interactions between MSCs and other cellular components in HSCT require further investigation. Methods To address these challenges, we explored the combined infusion of allotype-cord blood hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and activated T cells from the same donor along with third-party MSCs. The study assessed the effects of this triple-cell therapy on neutrophil differentiation and function ex vivo and in vivo. Using a respiratory infection model, we evaluated the accumulation of human neutrophils, cytokine secretion (IL-6 and IL-8), bacterial clearance, and overall survival compared to control groups. Results The triple-cell therapy demonstrated a significant improvement in the differentiation of human HSCs into neutrophils both in ex vivo and in vivo. In the respiratory infection model, this approach resulted in enhanced accumulation of human neutrophils, increased secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, superior bacterial clearance, and reduced mortality rates compared to the control group. These findings highlight the synergistic interplay between allo-HSCs, MSCs, and activated T cells in promoting neutrophil production and function. Conclusions Our study presents a novel therapeutic strategy combining allo-HSCs, activated T cells, and third-party MSCs to enhance neutrophil production and functionality post-transplantation. This approach not only accelerates neutrophil regeneration but also improves resistance to infections, offering a promising avenue to overcome engraftment challenges in HSCT.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT CD8+ tissue‐resident memory T cells (TRM) are strategically located in peripheral tissues, enabling a rapid response to local infections, which is different from circulating memory CD8+ T cells. Their unique positioning makes them promising targets for vaccines designed to enhance protection at barrier sites and other organs. Recent studies have shown a correlation between CD8+ TRM cells and favorable clinical outcomes in various types of cancer, indicating their potential role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. However, the dual nature of CD8+ TRM cells presents challenges, as their inappropriate activation may lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory conditions. This review highlights significant advancements in the field, focusing on the differentiation pathways and phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8+ TRM cells across different tissues and disease states. We also review their protective roles in various contexts and the implications for vaccine development against infections and treatment strategies for tumors. Overall, this comprehensive review outlines the common features of CD8+ TRM cell differentiation and biological functions, emphasizing their specific characteristics across diverse tissues and disease states, which can guide the design of therapies against infections and tumors while minimizing the risk of autoimmune diseases.">

        <tr id="Neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (NATI) significantly prolonged outcomes for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Residual tumor cells that survive NATI represent high-risk cell populations with metastatic potential and usually evade immunosurveillance by NK cells. Using an 82-protein panel, we here profiled single-cell membrane proteomics of CD56+ (NCAM1+) NK cells from tumor, peri-cancerous tissue, as well as peripheral blood from 28 TNBC patients post-NATI of residual cancer burden II/III. Unsupervised clustering resulted in several distinct clusters: 2 tumor-infiltrating NK (TINK) clusters with divergent functions of immune activation (TNFRSF7+) and suppression (SELL+); 2 immuno-suppressive peri-cancerous clusters; and 1 periphery-specific cluster. Considering the contradiction of the 2 TINK clusters, we further tested cytokine functions of SELL + and TNFRSF7 + TINKs by single-cell secreting proteomics using a 32-cytokine panel. Consistently, SELL + TINK clusters were characterized by immuno-suppressive secretion patterns (IL10+). A low proportion of SELL + TINK cluster and low proportion of IL10 + secreting SELL + TINK cluster (single-cell secreting proteomics) were both associated with better progression-free survival time. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 15 patients during 16-month follow-up. Overall, we identified a distinct immuno-suppressive TINK cell group, featuring IL10 + secreting and SELL expression with a strong relation to poor survival prognosis in TNBC patients post-NATI.

        <tr id="Purpose of review Mucosal-associated invariant T-cells (MAIT) have been associated with lung cancer and pulmonary infections. The treatment of patients with cancer or infections includes host-directed therapies (HDTs). MAIT play a role in shaping the ‘milieu interne’ in cancer and infections and this review addresses the biology of MAIT in pulmonary pathophysiology. Recent findings MAIT represent an attractive target for therapy in pulmonary malignancies and infections. T-cells are often difficult to exploit therapeutically due to the diversity of both T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and its ligandome. MAIT-cells are restricted by the major histocompatibility complex class I-related gene protein (MR1) that presents nondefined tumor-associated targets, bacterial products, vitamin and drug derivates. Due to their plasticity in gene expression, MAIT are able to conversely switch from IFN-γ to IL-17 production. Both cytokines play a key role in protective immune responses in infections and malignancies. MAIT-derived production of interleukin (IL)-17/TGF-β shapes the tumor micro-environment (TME), including tissue re-modelling leading to pulmonary fibrosis and recruitment of neutrophils. MAIT contribute to the gut-lung axis associated with clinical improved responses of patients with cancer to checkpoint inhibition therapy. MAIT are at the crossroad of HDTs targeting malignant and infected cells. Clinical presentations of overt inflammation, protective immune responses and tissue re-modeling are reviewed along the balance between Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 responses associated with immune-suppression or protective immune responses in infections. Summary MAIT shape the TME in pulmonary malignancies and infections. Drugs targeting the TME and HDTs affect MAIT that can be explored to achieve improved clinical results while curbing overt tissue-damaging immune responses.">

        <tr id="LPIN3 has emerged as a key factor in a variety of malignancies, although its precise role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. By analyzing the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we discovered that the expression pattern of LPIN3 and the relevant makeup of the immune microenvironment were immensely diverse among tumors. LPIN3 is abundantly expressed in CRC and may enhance tumor growth by activating the β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition, we discovered that LPIN3 might reduce tumor antigen presentation signals, hence suppressing CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, high expression of LPIN3 predicts decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration and effector function via bioinformatics analysis. Indeed, CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity as well as CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation in vivo were strengthened by LPIN3 knockdown. To sum up, our results highlight the part that LPIN3 plays in driving the progression of CRC by regulating β-catenin signaling and CD8+ T cell activity.

        <tr id="Parasitic infections are a major worldwide health burden, yet most studies of CD8 T cell differentiation focus on acute viral and bacterial infections. To understand effector and memory CD8 T cell responses during erythrocytic malaria infection in mice, we utilized transgenic OT-I T cells and compared CD8 T cell responses between infection with OVA-expressing strains of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). We find that CD8 T cells expand vigorously during both infections. However, in contrast to Lm infection, PbA infection induces T cells that are heavily biased toward an IL-7Ra-deficient and KLRG1+ short-lived effector cell (SLEC) phenotype at the expense of memory precursor effector cell (MPECs) formation. PbA-induced inflammation, including IFNγ, is partially responsible for this outcome. Following treatment with antimalarial drugs and T cell contraction, PbA-primed memory T cells are rarely found in the blood and peripheral tissues but do maintain a low presence in the spleen and bone marrow. Despite these poor numbers, PbA memory T cells robustly expand upon vaccination or viral infection, control pathogen burden, and form secondary memory pools. Thus, despite PbA enforced SLEC formation and limited memory, effective secondary responses can still proceed.">

In this study, we investigated the presence of exhausted T (Tex) cells in patients under certain conditions: HIV infection, chronic leukemia, and hepatocellular carcinoma. To gain insights into the epigenetic signatures and transcriptome changes in Tex cells, we employed a combination of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses. To evaluate the impact of L-2-HG on mitochondrial function, differentiation, and antitumor capacity of Tex cells, we utilized in vitro cell culture experiments and animal tumor models. We observed mitochondrial depolarization and metabolic dysfunction in Tex cells, accompanied by a significant reduction in L-2-HG levels. Moreover, altered epigenetic characteristics were observed in Tex cells, including a substantial increase in H3K27me3 abundance. Culturing Tex cells with L-2-HG demonstrated improved mitochondrial metabolism, reduced H3K27me3 abundance, and enhanced memory T cell differentiation. In a mouse melanoma tumor model, L-2-HG–treated CD8+ T cells for adoptive therapy led to significantly reduced tumor volume and significantly enhanced effector function of T cells. The study revealed that L-2-HG acted as an immune metabolite through epigenetic modifications of Tex cells.">

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of m6A modifications and examine the relationship between m6A regulators and cancer immune responses. Additionally, we summarize recent advances in understanding how m6A modifications influence tumor immune responses by directly modulating immune cells (e.g., dendritic cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and T cells) and indirectly affecting cancer cells via mechanisms such as cytokine and chemokine regulation, modulation of cell surface molecules, and metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, we explore the potential synergistic effects of targeting m6A regulators in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies. Together, this review consolidates current knowledge on the role of m6A-mediated regulation in tumor immunity, offering insights into how a deeper understanding of these modifications may identify patients who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapies.">

        <tr id="Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinical condition. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKI have not been fully elucidated, and effective treatment options remain limited. Studies have shown that immune cells play a critical role in AKI, with regulatory T cells (Tregs) being one of the most important immunosuppressive lymphocytes. Tregs proliferation can attenuate AKI, whereas depletion exacerbates kidney injury. Given that endothelial cells (ECs) are the initial cells that interact with immune cells when they invade the tissue parenchyma, ECs are closely associated with immune reactions. Methods and results In this study, P-selectin binding peptide-extracellular vesicles (PBP-EVs) that target and repair ECs are engineered. Transcriptome sequencing reveals that PBP-EVs reduce the expression of inflammatory genes in AKI mice. Using high-resolution intravital two-photon microscopy (TPM), an increased recruitment of Tregs in the kidneys of AKI Foxp3-EGFP transgenic mice following PBP-EVs treatment is observed, as well as significant Lgr5+ renal stem cell proliferation in AKI Lgr5-CreERT2; R26mTmG mice. Additionally, PBP-EVs treatment result in reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, pathological damage and fibrosis of AKI mice. Upon depletion of Tregs in Foxp3-DTR transgenic mice, we observe diminished therapeutic effect of PBP-EVs on AKI. Conclusions The experimental results indicate that PBP-EVs can promote the repair and regeneration of AKI by mitigating endothelial cell damage and subsequently modulating Tregs and the immune microenvironment. These findings provide novel insights and strategies for the treatment of AKI. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-025-06268-x.">

        <tr id="The body’s innate immune system plays a pivotal role in identifying and eliminating cancer cells. However, as the immune system ages, its functionality can deteriorate, becoming dysfunctional, inefficient, or even inactive—a condition referred to as immunosenescence. This decline significantly increases the risk of malignancies. While the pro-cancer effects of T-cell aging have been widely explored, there remains a notable gap in the literature regarding the impact of aging on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. This review seeks to address this gap, with emphasis on these cell types. Furthermore, although certain cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have demonstrated efficacy across a broad spectrum of cancers, elderly patients are less likely to derive clinical benefit from these treatments. In some cases, they may even experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While senolytic strategies have shown promise in exerting anti-cancer effects, their adverse reactions and potential off-target effects present significant challenges. This review aims to elucidate the pro-cancer effects of immunosenescence, its implications for the efficacy and safety of ICIs, and potential anti-aging treatment strategies. In addition, optimizing anti-aging therapies to minimize adverse reactions and enhance therapeutic outcomes remains a critical focus for future research endeavors.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors, enhancing clinical outcomes by releasing T cells from inhibitory effects of receptors like programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Despite these advancements, achieving durable antitumor responses remains challenging, often due to additional immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute significantly to the immunosuppressive TME and play a pivotal role in shaping T cell-mediated antitumor responses. Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily B member 2 (LILRB2), expressed on myeloid cells, including TAMs, is an inhibitory receptor, which contributes to macrophage-mediated immunosuppression. In this study, we present AZD2796, a high-affinity anti-LILRB2 antibody designed to repolarize TAMs from an immunosuppressive to a proinflammatory phenotype. Methods Anti-LILRB2 antibodies were identified using single-B-cell encapsulation Immune Replica technology. The ability of AZD2796 to enhance proinflammatory responses from macrophages treated with CD40 ligand or lipopolysaccharide was assessed using a macrophage stimulation assay. A tumor cell/macrophage/T cell co-culture assay was developed to evaluate the effect of AZD2796, as a single agent and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody, on the cytolytic activity of antigen-specific T cells. In vivo assessments were then carried out to determine the ability of AZD2796 to alter tumor growth rate in mice humanized with CD34 hematopoietic stem cells. Results In preclinical assessments, AZD2796 skewed macrophage differentiation away from an immunosuppressive phenotype and enhanced the proinflammatory function of macrophages. AZD2796 significantly increased the anti-tumor response of T cells following PD-1 checkpoint blockade, while AZD2796 monotherapy reduced tumor growth in humanized mouse models. Conclusions These findings support the potential of AZD2796 as an anti-cancer therapy, with the ability to synergize with T-cell-based therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Tumors often arise in chronically inflamed, and thus immunologically highly active niches. While immune cells are able to recognize and remove transformed cells, tumors eventually escape the control of the immune system by shaping their immediate microenvironment. In this context, macrophages are of major importance, as they initially exert anti-tumor functions before they adopt a tumor-associated phenotype that instead inhibits anti-tumor immune responses and even allows for sustaining a smoldering inflammatory, growth promoting tumor microenvironment (TME). Type I interferons (IFNs) are well established modulators of inflammatory reactions. While they have been shown to directly inhibit tumor growth, there is accumulating evidence that they also play an important role in altering immune cell functions within the TME. In the present review, we focus on the impact of type I IFNs on anti-tumor responses, driven by monocytes and macrophages. Specifically, we will provide an overview of tumor-intrinsic factors, which impinge on IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, like the presence of nucleic acids, metabolites, or hypoxia. We will further summarize the current understanding of the consequences of altered IFN responses on macrophage phenotypes, i.e., differentiation, polarization, and functions. For the latter, we will focus on macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing and phagocytosis, as well as on how macrophages affect their environment by secreting cytokines and directly interacting with immune cells. Finally, we will discuss how type I IFN responses in macrophages might affect and should be considered for current and future tumor therapies.">

 Natural killer (NK) cells are crucial constituents of innate immunity, playing a vital role in the early defense against viral infections and cancer. Their antiviral capabilities stem from direct cytotoxic activity against infected cells and immunoregulatory functions that modulate adaptive immune responses. In the context of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), NK cells contribute to controlling viral replication and limiting excessive inflammatory responses.



 This review highlights the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity, focusing on their interactions with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). We discuss potential sources of NK cells for adoptive transfer therapy, critical factors influencing their therapeutic efficacy, and considerations for clinical translation in COVID-19 treatment.



 Various NK cell sources for adoptive therapy are discussed, including peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetically engineered NK cells. Key factors influencing the therapeutic efficacy and safety of NK cell-based therapies are analyzed, including cytokine modulation, NK cell subset selection, and delivery methods.



 Understanding the mechanisms underlying NK cell-mediated antiviral activity and the factors that influence the success of adoptive NK cell therapy can inform the design of more effective immunotherapies for COVID-19 patients. Strategies for improving NK cell function, such as genetic modification and optimizing therapy protocols, are highlighted to enhance therapeutic outcomes.



 NK cells neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by releasing cytotoxic granules, inhibiting replication, and modulating inflammation. They originate from peripheral blood, cord blood, and genetic engineering. Therapeutic strategies include adoptive transfer, cytokine modulation, and optimized delivery. Inflammation is controlled, reducing excessive immune responses.

        <tr id="Background Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) initiates secondary injuries that worsen neurological damage and hinder recovery. While peripheral immune responses play a key role in stroke outcomes, clinical results from immunotherapy have been suboptimal, with limited focus on T-cell dynamics. Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) offer therapeutic potential due to their immunomodulatory properties. They can regulate immune responses and reduce neuroinflammation, potentially enhancing recovery by fostering a pro-regenerative peripheral immune environment. However, the effect of UMSCs on T-cell dynamics in AIS remains underexplored. This study investigates T-cell dynamics following AIS and examines how UMSCs may mitigate immune dysregulation to develop better treatment strategies. Methods AIS patients (NIHSS scores 0–15) were recruited within 72 h of stroke onset, with peripheral blood samples collected on Day 0 (enrollment) and Day 7. T-cell compartments were identified by flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine levels were quantified using a cytometric bead array (CBA). Mitochondria in UMSCs were labeled with MitoTracker. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients were isolated, treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cocultured with UMSCs in both direct contact and Transwell systems. Flow cytometry, CBA, RT-qPCR, and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect T-cell compartments, gene expression markers for helper T (Th) cell differentiation, cytokine profiles, mitochondrial transfer, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA in UMSCs was depleted. The effects of UMSCs and mitochondria-depleted UMSCs on ischemic stroke mice were compared through behavioral assessments and analysis of the peripheral immune microenvironment. Results In AIS, T-cell compartments underwent a phenotypic shift from naïve to effector or memory states, with a specific increase in Th17 cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells, leading to alterations in T-cell-mediated immune functions. In an ex vivo co-culture system, LPS stimulation further amplified these disparities, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in T cells. Notably, UMSCs restored mitochondrial function and reversed the shift in T-cell compartments through mitochondrial transfer. Critically, UMSC treatment significantly improved both neurological deficits and peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke mice, whereas mitochondria-depleted UMSCs failed to produce this effect. Conclusions Our comprehensive insights into the key attributes of T-cell compartments in acute ischemic stroke and the immune regulatory mechanisms of UMSCs provide a crucial theoretical foundation for understanding peripheral immune disorders in ischemic stroke and the therapeutic potential of UMSC treatment.

        <tr id="Abstract Checkpoint inhibitors have led to remarkable benefits in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet response rates remain below expectations. High-dimensional analysis and mechanistic experiments in clinical samples and relevant NSCLC models uncovered the immune composition of lung cancer tissues, providing invaluable insights into the functional properties of tumor-infiltrating T cells and myeloid cells. Among myeloid cells, type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) stand out for their unique ability to induce effector CD8 T cells against neoantigens and coordinate antitumoral immunity. Notably, lung resident cDC1 are particularly abundant and long-lived and express a unique tissue-specific gene program, underscoring their central role in lung immunity. Here, we discuss recent insights on the induction and regulation of antitumoral T cell responses in lung cancer, separating it from the tissue-agnostic knowledge generated from heterogeneous tumor models. We focus on the most recent studies dissecting functional states and spatial distribution of lung cDC1 across tumor stages and their impact on T cell responses to neoantigens. Finally, we highlight relevant gaps and emerging strategies to harness lung cDC1 immunostimulatory potential.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background A subset of CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic activity has been identified, and these cells exert their effects by expressing perforin and granzymes. Despite the progress made in characterizing cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in various diseases, the status of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the underlying mechanisms involved in promoting intratumoral cytotoxic CD4+ T-cell activation remain unclear. Methods We used flow cytometry to examine the phenotypic and functional properties of CD4+GzmB+ T cells in the peripheral blood and tumor tissues of patients with NSCLC. Loss-of-function analyses and RNA sequencing were used to identify the underlying mechanisms involved in the effects of interleukin (IL)-15 on the restoration of CD4+GzmB+ T-cell function in vitro. A patient-derived lung cancer explant model and an animal model were used to verify the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors on CD4+GzmB+ T-cell activation. Results In patients with NSCLC, impaired cytolytic function of tumor-infiltrated granzyme B (GzmB)-expressing CD4+ T cells was restored by IL-15 through activation of the AKT-FOXO1-T-bet axis. Moreover, IL-15 stimulation increased solute carrier family 7 member 5 (SLC7A5) expression in CD4+GzmB+ T cells in an Protein Kinase B (AKT)-dependent manner, and inhibition of SLC7A5 abrogated the effect of IL-15 on CD4+GzmB+ T cells. Additionally, we showed that the immune checkpoint molecules programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and CD85j were mutually exclusively expressed in CD4+GzmB+ T cells and that dual targeting of PD-1 and CD85j enhanced the effector function of CD4+GzmB+ T cells by activating the AKT pathway. Notably, tumor cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II and IL-15 determine the effectiveness of CD4+GzmB+ T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity in response to immunotherapy. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating CD4+GzmB+ T cells fail to eliminate tumors. Dual blockade of PD-1 and CD85j alongside IL-15 restores the effector function of CD4+GzmB+ T cells and drives CD4+GzmB+ T-cell transformation in the tumor microenvironment to combat MHC-II-expressing tumors.">

        <tr id="ABSTRACT B cells play a crucial role in autoimmune diseases, as evidenced by autoantibody responses and the effectiveness of B cell‐targeted therapies. Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), which target downstream signaling of cytokine receptors, are potent rheumatic disease‐modifying drugs. However, besides reducing inflammation, JAKi may impact the adaptive immune system. In this study, we examined the effects of JAKi on B‐cell function using in vitro cultures and multiparameter flow cytometry. The results show a JAKi‐mediated reduction in plasma cell differentiation, primarily by inhibition of memory B‐cell stimulation and proliferation. JAKi exposure resulted in stalling R848, IL‐2, and IL‐21 stimulated B cells in an intermediate activated state with elevated naïve cells displaying increased expression of CXCR5, CD71, CD22, and CD20. In addition, the data demonstrate a moderate JAKi‐mediated reduction of B cell TNF and IL‐8 cytokine expression following stimulation. Importantly, the efficacy varied greatly between drugs; tofacitinib and upadacitinib (pan JAKi; JAK1i) exhibited the strongest impact, while baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2i) showed donor‐dependent variation, and filgotinib (JAK1i) had no effect. All JAKi, except filgotinib, inhibited IL‐2 or IL‐21‐induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Still, filgotinib demonstrated similar inhibition of phospho‐STAT5 as other JAKi following IL‐21. These findings underscore the therapeutic impact of JAKi through the modulation of B‐cell functions.">

        <tr id="Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an incurable autoimmune disease. Patients with UC endure the burden of recurrent flare-ups and face a substantial economic burden due to long-term medication. The complex etiology and unclear pathogenesis pose a significant challenge to the development of effective and curative treatments. Recent research indicates that local memory at the site of inflammatory intestinal mucosa in UC is closely associated with the persistent presence of tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells. TRM cells, a subset of memory T cells, exhibit long-lived, low-migration characteristics. These cells reside in tissues, where they provide immediate immune protection while also contributing to chronic, localized inflammation. The presence of TRM cells in the inflamed intestinal mucosa of UC patients is a crucial factor in the recurrence of the disease. However, the process involved in the formation and differentiation of TRM cells within the intestinal mucosa remains poorly understood. Various surface markers, transcriptional networks, and signaling pathways regulate the formation and maintenance of TRM cells in the intestine. To further understand the role of TRM cells in UC pathogenesis, we have summarized the latest findings to pave the way for the development of future targeted therapies.">

        <tr id="Background Arginine metabolism in tumors is often shunted into the pathway producing pro-tumor and immune suppressive polyamines (PAs), while downmodulating the alternative nitric oxide (NO) synthesis pathway. Aiming to correct arginine metabolism in tumors, arginine deprivation therapy and inhibitors of PA synthesis have been developed. Despite some therapeutic advantages, these approaches have often yielded severe side effects, making it necessary to explore an alternative strategy. We previously reported that supplementing sepiapterin (SEP), the endogenous precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4, the essential NO synthase cofactor), could correct arginine metabolism in tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and induce their metabolic and phenotypic reprogramming. We saw that oral SEP treatment effectively suppressed the growth of HER2-positive mammary tumors in animals. SEP also has no reported dose-dependent toxicity in clinical trials for metabolic disorders. In the present study, we tested our hypothesis that a long-term administration of SEP to individuals susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumor would protect them against tumor occurrence. Methods We administered SEP, in comparison to control DMSO, to MMTV-neu mice susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumors for 8 months starting at their pre-pubertal stage. We monitored tumor onsets to determine the rate of tumor-free survival. After 8 months of treatment, we grouped animals into DMSO treatment with or without tumors and SEP treatment with or without tumors. We analyzed blood metabolites, PBMC, and bone marrow of DMSO vs. SEP treated animals. Results We found that a long-term use of SEP in animals susceptible to HER2-positive mammary tumors effectively suppressed tumor occurrence. These SEP-treated animals had undergone reprogramming of the systemic metabolism and immunity, elevating total T cell counts in the circulation and bone marrow. Given that bone marrow-resident T cells are mostly memory T cells, it is plausible that chronic SEP treatment promoted memory T cell formation, leading to a potent tumor prevention. Conclusions These findings suggest the possible roles of the SEP/BH4/NO axis in promoting memory T cell formation and its potential therapeutic utility for preventing HER2-positive breast cancer.

        <tr id="Recent studies on the pathogenesis of leukemia have led to remarkable advances in disease treatment. Numerous studies have shown the potential and viability of immune responses against leukemia. In the classical pathway, this process is often initiated by the upstream activity of CD39, which hydrolyzes extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to AMP. Subsequently, CD73 acts on AMP to generate adenosine, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, CD73 can also utilize substrates derived from other molecules through the non-canonical NAD+ pathway, specifically via the CD38/CD203a/CD73 axis, further enhancing adenosine production and facilitating immune escape. Targeting CD73 has shown potential in disrupting these immunosuppressive pathways, thereby enhancing anti-leukemic immune responses and improving patient outcomes. Inhibiting CD73 not only reduces the levels of immunosuppressive adenosine but also increases the efficacy of existing immunotherapies, such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, making it a versatile therapeutic target in leukemia treatment. This review discusses the potential of CD73 as a therapeutic target and emphasizes its unique position in the immune escape mechanism of leukemia. Moreover, this review provides an overview of the current research progress and future trends, emphasizing the clinical significance of targeting CD73 and other potential therapeutic strategies in leukemia.">

In this review, we first discuss the biology of NK cells, focusing on their functions within the tumor microenvironment (TME), the lymphatic system, and circulation. We then examine the immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells to inhibit NK cell activity, including the upregulation of inhibitory receptors.

        <tr id="Objectives To explore the phenotype and role of gamma delta (γδ) T cells in the pathogenesis of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Methods Flow cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR were employed to analyze γδ T cell subsets, chemokine receptor expression, cytokine production, pro-fibrotic gene expression, and transcription factor profiles. Immunofluorescence assessed Vδ2 T cell infiltration in affected tissues. Chemotaxis assays and co-culture experiments investigated Vδ2 T cell migration and their influence on B cell differentiation. The impact of IL-21 stimulation and JAK/STAT3 inhibitors on γδ T cell was also evaluated. Results Patients with IgG4-RD exhibited decreased peripheral Vδ2 T cells displaying a Th2-like phenotype characterized by elevated Th2 cytokine production and activated IL-21—STAT3—Blimp-1—GATA3 pathway. Vδ2 T cells accumulated in affected tissues through CCR7 upregulation, and co-localizing with B cells. Both Vδ2 T cells and culture supernatants from IgG4-RD patients promoted B cell differentiation. IL-21 stimulation augmented pSTAT3, Blimp-1, and GATA3 expression in Vδ2 T cells, while JAK and STAT3 inhibitors attenuated these effects. IgG4-RD patients exhibited increased TGF-β and pro-fibrotic gene expression in γδ T cells. Conclusion Within the IL-21-rich microenvironment of IgG4-RD, peripheral Vδ2 T cells acquire a Th2-like phenotype via the IL-21—STAT3—Blimp-1—GATA3 pathway. Targeting JAK/STAT3 inhibitors holds therapeutic potential for IgG4-RD.">

        <tr id="Brain metastases (BMs) are a relatively common and severe complication in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), significantly affecting patient prognosis. Metastatic tumor cells can alter the brain tumor microenvironment (TME) to promote an immunosuppressive state, characterized by reduced infiltration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), diminished expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and changes in other proinflammatory factors and immune cell populations. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, play a pivotal role in modulating the central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment through interactions with metastatic cancer cells, astrocytes, and infiltrating T cells. The M2 phenotype of microglia contributes to immunosuppression in BM via the activation of signaling pathways such as STAT3 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. Recent advances have enhanced our understanding of the immune landscape of BMs in NSCLC, particularly regarding immune evasion within the CNS. Current immunotherapeutic strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, have shown promise for NSCLC patients with BM, demonstrating intracranial activity and manageable safety profiles. Future research is warranted to further explore the molecular and immune mechanisms underlying BM, aiming to develop more effective treatments.">

        <tr id="Osteosarcoma, the most prevalent malignant bone tumor among adolescents, frequently exhibits limited responsiveness to immunotherapy, a challenge attributed to poorly understood underlying mechanisms. Here, we identify enhanced polyamine biosynthesis as a key driver of osteosarcoma progression and immunotherapy resistance. We show that osteosarcoma cell proliferation and tumor growth rely on polyamine availability and that disruption of polyamine synthesis significantly boosts the cytotoxic efficacy of TCR-engineered T cells against osteosarcoma cells. Mechanistically, we reveal that the knockdown of antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) or suppression of polyamine production reduces MYC expression, leading to diminished tumor cell viability via the downregulation of cell cycle-related genes. Furthermore, reduced MYC levels are associated with changes in the expression of immunomodulatory cytokines and human leukocyte antigen molecules, pointing to a potential link with enhanced T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Collectively, our findings establish a pivotal role for the AZIN1-polyamine axis in osteosarcoma proliferation and immune evasion, and support the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies targeting polyamine biosynthesis to combat this aggressive cancer.">

        <tr id="Background Ageing-associated remodeling of the murine B cell system is accompanied with a reduction of CD19+ B cells such as follicular B cells (FOB) and an accumulation of age-associated B cells (ABC) or activated B cell subsets. This remodeling is thought to confer an attenuated antibody response, such as to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) vaccines in both aged mice and humans. To gain insight into the de novo development and function of an old B cell system, we reconstituted young and old immune systems by transferring hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from immune-competent young (2–3 months) CD45.1+ donors (DY-HSC) or old (20–24 months) donors (DO-HSC) into T and B cell-deficient young recipient CD45.2+ RAG1−/− mice, followed by protein-based vaccination. Results In the same environment of young RAG1−/− mice, transplanted DO-HSCs compared to DY-HSCs reconstituted lower numbers of CD19+ B cells and CD45.1+ cells, though the engraftment of donor-derived HSCs in the young bone marrow (BM) was very similar. Furthermore, indicative for youthful and unchallenged B cell systems, and in contrast to aged mice, very low levels of antigen-experienced memory B cells or age-associated B cells (ABC) developed in both DY-HSC and DO-HSC hosts. The commercially available recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) induced lower IgG+ S-antibody titers and pseudovirus neutralization activity in old compared to young mice. In contrast, very similar high IgG+ S-antibody titers were induced in DO-HSC and DY-HSC hosts, and pseudovirus neutralization activity was even enhanced in DO-HSC compared with DY-HSC hosts. Conclusions Both DO-HSCs and DY-HSCs established in the young recipient BM to a similar extend, suggesting that the concomitant reduction in the de novo reconstitution of CD19+ B cells in DO-HSC vs. DY-HSC transplanted animals is specifically related to old HSCs. DO-HSCs and DY-HSCs reconstitute very similar unchallenged B cell systems that efficiently elicit antigen-specific IgG antibodies by protein-based vaccination. Old HSCs thus retain competence to reconstitute a youthful and functional B cell system, at least in the young environment of transplanted RAG1−/− mice. This suggests that it is primarily age-related factors, and not HSCs per se, that influence the composition and functionality of the old B cell system.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with limited efficacy of established therapies, and a pronounced immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Targeting HER2 with local immunotherapy allows for high tumor specificity in the brain with physiologically very low expression. Monotherapy with CAR-NK cells targeted against HER2 has previously shown efficacy in medium-sized GL261/HER2 tumors.


METHODS
Advanced GL261/HER2 tumors were treated by local CAR-NK cell injection combined with systemic anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Tumor growth and survival were monitored. In-depth characterization of the microenvironment was performed by multiplex immune fluorescence, spectral flow cytometry and RNAseq.


RESULTS
Untreated GL261/HER2 tumors were characterized by local immunosuppression and high PD-L1 expression. Combined treatment with NK-92/5.28.z and systemic anti-PD-1 induced robust anti-tumor response and long-term survival. Multiplex immunofluorescence and spectral flow cytometry showed increased CD4+ T cell infiltration in mice treated with CAR-NK cell and anti-PD-1 combination therapy. A cluster of T cells specifically emerging in the combination therapy group expressed markers of NKT cells, which was further verified by immunofluorescence staining.


CONCLUSION
The combination therapy reverted the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with increased T and NKT cell infiltration. This resulted in successful treatment of advanced orthotopic tumors refractory to CAR-NK cell monotherapy.">

        <tr id="Background The T cell compartment undergoes significant age-related changes, contributing to the decline of the adaptive immune system and increasing the risk of suboptimal antibody responses to vaccines in older adults. To better understand the association between T cell phenotypes and vaccine responsiveness, we conducted an in-depth analysis of CD4+, CD8+, and γδ + T cells on VITAL cohort participants who are low or high responders to multiple vaccines (influenza, pneumococcal, and SARS-CoV-2). Results Using spectral cytometry and FlowSOM, we identified detailed phenotypes of naïve, regulatory, and terminally differentiated T cells. We observed that the percentages of CD31 + naïve CD4+, CD31 + naïve CD8+, and CD38 + naïve CD8 + T cells were significantly lower in low vaccine responders. Notably, CD31 + naïve T cell subsets showed a stronger correlation with immune entropy, a measure of cumulative immune system perturbations, than with age itself. Conclusions These findings suggest that subsets of naïve cells could be associated with weak vaccine responsiveness and immunosenescence. Furthermore, these naive T cell signatures could help predict weak vaccine responses, potentially informing targeted vaccination strategies in older adults.

        <tr id="Myeloid cells are a major component of immune cells infiltrating tumors, interacting with each other, with tumor cells and other stromal cells, and demonstrating a prominent plasticity. Neutrophils, as a population of such cells, contribute to cancer progression via multiple mechanisms, including stimulation of angiogenesis and the regulation of adaptive immune responses. Importantly, neutrophils were demonstrated to be associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with different kinds of cancer, including head and neck cancer, renal cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma or melanoma. Enrichment of neutrophils was also associated with metastases in various tumor entities. 
Activity of neutrophils strongly depends on the cytokines or growth factors present in the microenvironment. Since these cells are highly plastic and their functionality can be easily altered, they are ideal target for anti-tumor therapies. Since we observe that elevated STAT3 is associated with pro-tumoral activity of neutrophils, we tested here the approach to functionally reprogram these cells by the inhibition of STAT3 signaling pathway. We could show that such STAT3 inhibition solely in neutrophils led to decreased tumor growth and metastasis in cancer, which was accompanied by a significant expansion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Comprehensive multiparameter analyses of tumors and TDLNs revealed a significant enrichment of CD8+ T cell subsets with strongly cytotoxic activity, which effectively killed cancer cells in vitro. These findings provide novel insights in therapeutic avenues and suggest neutrophil-targeted STAT3 inhibition as a promising opportunity for cancer immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="Gastric cancer (GC) remains a significant global health concern due to its poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options, particularly in advanced stages. Tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), plays a key role in tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. TAMs exhibit plasticity, shifting between pro-inflammatory M1 and immunosuppressive M2 phenotypes, with the latter predominating in GC and contributing to poor outcomes. Recent therapeutic advancements focus on targeting TAMs, including inhibiting M2 polarization, reprogramming TAMs to M1 phenotypes, and combining TAM-targeted approaches with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Innovations in nanotechnology, metabolic reprogramming, and targeting key pathways such as interleukin-6 and C-C motif ligand 2/C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 further enhance these strategies. However, challenges remain, including the spatial and functional heterogeneity of TAMs within the TME and the need for selective targeting to avoid disrupting immune homeostasis. Ongoing research on TAM origins, functions, and interactions within the TME is crucial for developing precise and effective therapies. These advances hold promise not only for improving outcomes in GC but also for addressing other cancers with similarly complex microenvironments.">

        <tr id="Relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains a challenging disease with a dismal prognosis. Despite the revolutionary impact of CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19)-T cell therapy, >50% of patients relapse within a year. Both leukemia cell-intrinsic factors favoring immune escape and poor CAR-T cell persistence contribute significantly to clinical failure. Moreover, the expression of immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs) and their ligands within the complex bone marrow (BM) microenvironment may contribute to leukemia progression and therapy resistance. Here, we comprehensively characterized the expression of ICRs and their ligands in leukemic blasts, T cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from B-ALL BM samples at diagnosis (n=47) and relapse (n=38), comparing them with age-matched healthy BM controls. Our findings reveal a significant upregulated expression of TIM-3 in T cells, and its ligand galectin-9 in both blasts and MSCs throughout disease progression. The expression levels of galectin-9 in B-ALL blasts and TIM-3 in CAR19-T cells negatively correlate with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we demonstrate that galectin-9 impairs CAR19-T cell homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Notably, an engineered TIM-3-Fc decoy receptor, delivered either by primary T cells co-administered with CAR19-T cells or via a bicistronic all-in-one CAR19-TIM-3-Fc construct, improved the anti-leukemia efficacy and persistence of CAR19-T cells in B-ALL patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, CAR19-TIM-3-Fc-T cell treatment promotes the in vivo expansion of both transduced and bystander effector and memory T cells, as determined by spectral flow cytometry. Collectively, these potent and persistent TIM-3-Fc decoy-armored CAR19-T cells offer a promising therapeutic strategy for R/R B-ALL patients.">

        <tr id="Effective treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains an urgent unmet need. Adoptive transfer of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) against leukemia-associated antigen (LAA) has strong potential to improve AML treatment. However, the clinical translation of this therapeutic modality is hindered by the difficulty of obtaining large quantities of LAA-specific CTLs. Stimulating naïve T cells using monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) loaded with LAA is commonly used for the generation of CTLs. This approach has drawbacks as MoDCs loaded with desired antigen need to be developed repeatedly with multiple steps and have limited growth potential. We have established immortalized human dendritic cells (DC) lines (termed ihv-DCs). Here, we report the successful generation of CTLs by culturing AML patient-derived T cells with our off-the-shelf ihv-DCs that carry HLA-A2-restricted human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), a known LAA. These CTLs exert a potent cytotoxic activity against leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts in vitro. Importantly, using a highly clinically relevant PDX model where CTLs (derived from clinical donors) were adoptively transferred into NSG mice bearing patient-derived AML cells (that were partial or full HLA match with the donors), we showed that the CTLs effectively reduced leukemia growth in vivo. Our results are highly translational and provide proof of concept using the novel DC methodology to improve the strategy of adoptive T cell transfer for AML treatment.

While γδT cells are relatively rare in peripheral blood, they are enriched in peripheral tissues such as the skin, intestine, and lung. These cells play a crucial role in tumor immunotherapy by exerting direct cytotoxicity through the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-17 (IL-17)) and cytotoxic molecules (e.g., perforin and granzyme). Recent advances in γδT cell research have elucidated their mechanisms of tumor recognition, including the detection of phosphoantigens and stress-induced ligands like MICA (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A), MICB (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B), and ULBP (UL16-binding protein). Furthermore, various strategies to enhance γδT cell-based tumor immunotherapy have been developed, such as in vitro expansion using phosphoantigen-based therapies, cytokine stimulation, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-γδT cell engineering. These advancements have shown promising results in both preclinical and clinical settings, paving the way for γδT cells to become a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy. This review highlights the key mechanisms, functions, and strategies to harness the potential of γδT cells for effective tumor immunotherapy.">

        <tr id="γδ T cells are a unique subset of unconventional T cells and an important component of the innate immune system. Unlike conventional αβ T cells, γδ T cells can respond rapidly during the early stages of infection, and their antigen recognition is not restricted by MHC molecules. These distinctive features underscore the important role of γδ T cells in viral clearance and infection control. Therefore, γδ T cell-based immunotherapies have been extensively explored for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including viral infections and cancers. Several therapeutic strategies based on γδ T cells have advanced to clinical trials, demonstrating promising safety and efficacy. Currently, there are no effective treatments for flavivirus infections, which are typically characterized by acute onset. Research has shown that γδ T cells can rapidly expand during the early phases of flavivirus infections and effectively suppress viral replication, making them an attractive target for the development of novel therapies for flavivirus infections. This review aims to highlight the immunological roles of γδ T cells in flavivirus infections and to explore the potential of γδ T cell-based therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of these infections.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma, an aggressive and lethal brain tumor, presents enormous clinical challenges, including molecular heterogeneity, high recurrence rates, resistance to conventional therapies, and limited therapeutic penetration across the blood-brain barrier. The glioblastoma microenvironment, characterized by a dynamic interplay of cellular and non-cellular components, is a key driver of tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. Neuroinflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, play pivotal roles in this microenvironment, contributing to tumor progression and immune evasion. This review highlights oncolytic virotherapy as a promising therapeutic avenue, focusing on its potential to modulate neuroinflammatory responses, induce localized immune reactions, and deliver immunomodulatory factors directly to the tumor site. While encouraging outcomes have been observed, challenges such as overcoming the blood-brain barrier, managing host antiviral immunity, and mitigating potential risks to normal neuronal cells remain critical barriers to clinical translation. By analyzing the intricate interactions of oncolytic viruses with the glioblastoma microenvironment and synthesizing findings from preclinical and clinical trials, this review provides actionable insights into developing personalized and effective therapeutic strategies for this aggressive tumor based on oncolytic virotherapy alone or when using it combined with conventional therapies, immunotherapy, natural killer-cell therapy, chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy, and dendritic cell therapy.">

        <tr id="CD19 and CXCR4 are pivotal regulators of B-cell activation and migration, respectively. Specifically, CXCR4 signaling critically influences the dissemination of various malignant B cells through constitutive activation and aberrant expression. This study explores the interaction between CD19 and CXCR4 signaling in the context of B-cell lymphomas, particularly focusing on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM). We assessed the roles of CD19 in survival and CXCL12-induced migration by using knockout (KO) cells of DLBCL and WM origin alongside evaluating the impact of CD19 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our results highlight that CD19 is important for survival and CXCL12-induced migration, and mAbs variably increase CXCL12-induced migration and enhance ADCC. Additionally, we demonstrate that the endogenous peptide inhibitor of the CXCR4 (EPI-X4) derivative JM#21 effectively inhibits CD19-mediated migration enhancement and promotes ADCC, thereby augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of CD19 mAb-based immunotherapy in lymphoma models. Our study underscores the potential of targeting both CD19 and CXCR4 to refine therapeutic strategies for treating B-cell malignancies, suggesting a synergistic approach could improve clinical outcomes in WM treatment.">

        <tr id="Graft-versus-host disease remains one of the most formidable barriers to the complete success of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that has emerged as the curative approach for many hematopoietic malignancies because it affects quality of life and overall survival. Macrophages are among the important members of the immune system, which perform dual roles in GVHD as both therapeutic tools and targets. This review epitomizes the multifunctional role of macrophages in the pathophysiology of both acute and chronic GVHD. Macrophages play an important role in the early phase of GVHD because of their recruitment and infiltration into target organs. Furthermore, they polarize into two functionally different phenotypes, including M1 and M2. In the case of acute GVHD, most macrophages express the M1 phenotype characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to tissue damage. In contrast, in chronic GVHD, macrophages tend toward the M2 phenotype associated with the repair of tissues and fibrosis. A critical balance among these phenotypes is central to the course and severity of GVHD. Further interactions of macrophages with other lymphocytes such as T cells, B cells, and fibroblast further determine the course of GVHD. Macrophage interaction associated with alloreactive T cells promotes inflammation. This is therefore important in inducing injuries of tissues during acute GVHD. Interaction of macrophages, B cell, fibroblast, and CD4+ T cells promotes fibrosis during chronic GVHD and, hence, the subsequent dysfunction of organs. These are some insights, while several challenges remain. First, the impact of the dominant cytokines in GVHD on the polarization of macrophages is incompletely characterized and sometimes controversial. Second, the development of targeted therapies able to modulate macrophage function without systemic side effects remains an area of ongoing investigation. Future directions involve the exploration of macrophage-targeted therapies, including small molecules, antibodies, and nanotechnology, which modulate macrophage behavior and improve patient outcomes. This underlines the fact that a profound understanding of the dual role of macrophages in GVHD is essential for developing new and more effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting macrophages might represent one avenue for decreasing the incidence and severity of GVHD and improving the success and safety of HSCT.">

        <tr id="Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer affecting men globally, especially those aged 50 years and above. Despite substantial progress in terms of both prognosis and therapy, PCa remains a significant health concern, necessitating the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have emerged as critical modulators of tumor immunity, exhibiting both pro- and antitumoral effects. However, little is known yet about their contribution in PCa. This study investigated the phenotypic and functional profiles of ILC subsets in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with PCa stratified by Gleason score. Methods PBMCs were isolated by Lymphoprep. ILC frequency and activity were evaluated by flow cytometry. The levels of ILC-activating cytokines were analyzed by multiplex assay in the serum of healthy donors (HDs) and patients with PCa. To evaluate the crosstalk between ILC2s and cancer cells, PC3 and DU145 human PCa cell lines were used. Results We found a stage-dependent increase in the protumoral ILC2 frequency and a concurrent decrease in antitumoral ILC1s in patients with PCa compared with healthy controls. Interestingly, the frequency of ILC2s was higher in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, suggesting their potential as molecular predictor for defining the risk category of patients with PCa at diagnosis. Importantly, patients with PCa exhibited hyperactivated ILC2s, characterized by elevated interleukin (IL)-13 and IL-5 production, while ILC1s displayed reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ secretion. Furthermore, serum levels of ILC2-activating cytokines IL-33, IL-18, and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) were elevated in patients with PCa. In vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated that PCa cell lines, capable of secreting these cytokines, could directly enhance ILC2 activity. Likewise, ILC2-derived IL-13 promoted PCa cell migration and invasion. Conclusions Collectively, our findings highlight a dysregulated ILC profile in PCa, characterized by ILC2 dominance and heightened activity at the expense of ILC1s, suggesting both ILC1s and ILC2s as potential therapeutic targets for PCa treatment.

        <tr id="Co-stimulatory molecules are imperative for CD8+ T cells to eliminate target cell and maintain sustained cytotoxicity. Despite an advanced understanding of the co-stimulatory molecules deficiency that results in tumor escape, the tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms that regulate co-stimulatory molecules remain enigmatic, and an in-depth dissection could facilitate the improvement of treatment options. To this end, in this study, we report that the deficiency of the critical costimulatory molecule CD58, mediated by the expression of ATF4 in tumor cells, impairs the formation of immunological synapses (IS) and leads to the deterioration of antitumor immune function of CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, ATF4 transcriptionally upregulated dynamin 1 (DNM1) expression leading to DNM1-dependent endocytosis (DDE)-mediated degradation of CD58. Furthermore, administration of DDE inhibitor prochlorperazine or ATF4 knockdown effectively restored CD58 expression, boosting CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and immunotherapy efficiency. Thus, our study reveals that ATF4 in tumor cells weakens CD58 expression to interfere with complete IS formation, and indicates potential approaches to improve the cytolytic function of CD8+ T cell in tumor immunotherapy.

Little is known about the precise nature of the anti-cancer immune response triggered by different natural DC subsets and their relevance in preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence.

Using an experimental model of tumor relapse, we show that adjuvant or neoadjuvant cDC1 vaccination improves anti-tumor immune memory, particularly by increasing the infiltrates of CD4+ tissue resident memory (Trm) and CD8+ memory T cells. This translates into complete prevention of tumor relapses. Moreover, elevated abundance of cDC1s positively correlates with CD4+ Trm presence, and both associate with enhanced survival in human breast cancer and melanoma.

        <tr id="ABSTRACT Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal disease with an unknown etiology and complex pathophysiology that are not fully understood. The disease involves intricate cellular interplay, particularly among various immune cells. Currently, there is no treatment capable of reversing the fibrotic process or aiding lung regeneration. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has demonstrated antifibrotic properties, whereas the adoptive transfer of modified T cells is a well‐established treatment for various malignancies. We aimed to understand the dynamics of T cells in the progression of lung fibrosis and to study the therapeutic benefit of adoptive T cell transfer in a bleomycin‐injured mouse lung (BLM) model. Methods T cells were isolated from the spleen of naïve mice and transfected in vitro with mouse HGF plasmid and were administered intratracheally to the mice lungs 7 days post‐bleomycin injury to the lung. Lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage were collected and analyzed using flow cytometry, histology, qRT‐PCR, ELISA, and hydroxyproline assay. Results Our findings demonstrate the successful T cell therapy of bleomycin‐induced lung injury through the adoptive transfer of HGF‐transfected T cells in mice. This treatment resulted in decreased collagen deposition and a balancing of immune cell exhaustion and cytokine homeostasis compared with untreated controls. In vitro testing showed enhanced apoptosis in myofibroblasts induced by HGF‐overexpressing T cells. Conclusions Taken together, our data highlight the great potential of adoptive T cell transfer as an emerging therapy to counteract lung fibrosis.">

Upon activation, the central ISR regulator, eIF2α, was dephosphorylated and stored cytokine mRNA was translated for immediate cytokine production. Genetic or pharmacological activation of the ISR–eIF2α pathway reduced cytokine production and ameliorated autoimmune kidney disease in mice. Consistent with these results, the ISR pathway in CD4+ TRM cells was downregulated in patients with immune-mediated diseases of the kidney and the intestine compared to healthy controls.

        <tr id="Tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (Trm) constitute a distinct population of non-circulating memory T cells1–5 vastly exceeding the number of circulating T cells5, and play a pivotal role in protective immunity against pathogens6–8. How to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm remains an important challenge. Whether Trm contribute also to immune control of tumors or just correlate with an unrelated process linked to clinical outcome has not been unequivocally established9,10, and phenotypic markers such as co-expression of CD69 and CD103 or CD49a integrins commonly used to monitor tumor infiltrating Trm do not unambiguously define this subset. Here we tested the hypothesis that transient downregulation of KLF2, the most conserved feature of Trm ontogeny4,11,12, will promote the differentiation of vaccine activated CD8+ T cells into Trm and enhance antitumor immunity. We show that 4-1BB antibody targeted delivery of a KLF2 siRNA to tumor bearing mice led to the downregulation of KLF2 in vaccine activated CD8+ T cells and the accumulation of phenotypically defined intratumoral CD69+CD103+ and CD69+CD49a+ CD8+ T cells which correlated with enhanced control of tumor growth. This study could serve as the foundation of a broadly applicable and clinically useful way to promote the generation of vaccine specific Trm and provides direct evidence that intratumoral CD8+CD69+CD103+ and CD8+CD69+CD49a+ cells are indeed Trm and that Trm contribute to tumor immunity.">

        <tr id="Lactate has emerged as a key regulator in the tumor microenvironment (TME), influencing both tumor progression and immune dynamics. As a byproduct of aerobic glycolysis, lactate satisfies the metabolic needs of proliferating tumor cells while reshaping the TME to facilitate immune evasion. Elevated lactate levels inhibit effector immune cells such as CD8+ T and natural killer cells, while supporting immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, thus fostering an immunosuppressive environment. Lactate promotes epigenetic reprogramming, stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, and activates nuclear factor kappa B, leading to further immunological dysfunction. In this review, we examined the role of lactate in metabolic reprogramming, immune suppression, and treatment resistance. We also discuss promising therapeutic strategies targeting lactate metabolism, including lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors, monocarboxylate transporter inhibitors, and TME neutralization methods, all of which can restore immune function and enhance immunotherapy outcomes. By highlighting recent advances, this review provides a theoretical foundation for integrating lactate-targeted therapies into clinical practice. We also highlight the potential synergy between these therapies and current immunotherapeutic strategies, providing new avenues for addressing TME-related challenges and improving outcomes for patients with cancer.">

        <tr id="Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, necessitating innovative treatments. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are primary immunosuppressive effectors that foster tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. They are broadly categorized into proinflammatory M1 and tumor-promoting M2 phenotypes, with elevated M2 infiltration correlating with poor prognosis. Strategies aimed at inhibiting TAM recruitment, depleting TAMs, or reprogramming M2 to M1 are therefore highly promising. Key signaling pathways, such as CSF-1/CSF-1R, IL-4/IL-13–STAT6, TLRs, and CD47-SIRPα, regulate TAM polarization. Additionally, macrophage-based drug delivery systems permit targeted agent transport to hypoxic regions, enhancing therapy. Preclinical studies combining TAM-targeted therapies with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors have yielded improved responses and prolonged survival. Several clinical trials have also reported benefits in previously unresponsive patients. Future work should clarify the roles of macrophage-derived exosomes, cytokines, and additional mediators in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These insights will inform the design of next-generation drug carriers and optimize combination immunotherapies within precision medicine frameworks. Elucidating TAM phenotypes and their regulatory molecules remains central to developing novel strategies that curb tumor progression and ultimately improve outcomes in lung cancer. Importantly, macrophage-based immunomodulation may offer expanded treatment avenues.">

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, driven by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and immune-related factors. Among the pivotal pathways implicated in CRC tumorigenesis, the Notch signaling pathway is instrumental in governing cell fate decisions, tissue renewal, homeostasis, and immune cell development. As a highly conserved mechanism, Notch signaling not only modulates tumor cell behavior but also shapes the immune landscape within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Aberrant Notch signaling in CRC fosters immune evasion and tumor progression through its effects on the balance and functionality of immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Elevated Notch pathway activation correlates with advanced clinicopathological features and poorer clinical outcomes, highlighting its relevance as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target. Therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting the Notch pathway, such as γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in combination with other therapies, have demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical and clinical settings. This review examines the impact of Notch signaling on CRC immunity, elucidating its regulatory mechanisms within immune cells and its role in promoting tumor progression. Additionally, this review discusses therapeutic strategies targeting Notch signaling, including GSIs, mAbs, and potential combination therapies designed to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes. By elucidating the multifaceted role of Notch within the CRC TME, this review underscores its potential as a target for innovative therapeutic strategies.">

        <tr id="Inflammation, a hallmark of cancer, has been associated with tumor progression, transition into malignant phenotype and efficacy of anticancer treatments in cancer. It affects all stages of cancer, from the initiation of carcinogenesis to metastasis. Chronic inflammation induces immunosup-pression, providing an environment conducive to carcinogenesis, whereas acute inflammation induces an antitumor immune response, leading to tumor suppression. Solid tumors have an inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) containing cancer cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and soluble molecules, which plays a key role in tumor progression and therapy response. Both cancer cells and stromal cells in the TME are highly plastic and constantly change their phenotypic and functional properties. Cancer-associated inflammation, the majority of which consists of innate immune cells, plays an important role in cancer cell plasticity, cancer progression and the development of anticancer drug resistance. Today, with the combined used of advanced technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial molecular imaging analysis, the pathways linking chronic inflammation to cancer have been largely elucidated. In this review article, we highlighted the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in cancer-associated inflammation and its effects on cancer progression and treatment response. We also comprehensively review the mechanisms linking chronic inflammation to cancer in the setting of GI cancers.">

This effect is mediated both by cell-cell contact through increased PD-L1 expression on plasma cells and by production of a soluble factor. These observations are recapitulated in three cohorts of critically ill patients with bacterial and viral sepsis in association with increased mortality. Our findings thus reveal the function of regulatory plasma cells in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced immune alterations, and present a potential therapeutic target for improving immune cell function impaired by sepsis.">

        <tr id="Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, characterized by rapid proliferation, extensive infiltration, and significant intratumoral heterogeneity. Despite advancements in conventional treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis for GBM patients remains poor, with a median survival of approximately 15 months. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising alternative; however, the unique biological and immunological features, including its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and low mutational burden, render it resistant to many immunotherapeutic strategies. This review explores the key challenges in GBM immunotherapy, focusing on immune evasion mechanisms, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the TME. Immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells have shown promise in preclinical models but have limited clinical success due to antigen heterogeneity, immune cell exhaustion, and impaired trafficking across the BBB. Emerging strategies, including dual-targeting CAR-T cells, engineered immune cells secreting therapeutic molecules, and advanced delivery systems to overcome the BBB, show potential for enhancing treatment efficacy. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving GBM immunotherapy outcomes.">

        <tr id="The spleen, the largest lymphatic organ, comprises a diverse array of immunocytes in approximately one quarter of the body, including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells (such as dendritic cells, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and macrophages). These immune cells undergo dynamic transitions and mobilization, enabling the spleen to execute a wide range of immunological functions. The spleen's structural organization and multicellular composition, along with its reservoir of lymphocytes, facilitate the capture and clearance of blood-borne antigens while also orchestrating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Additionally, the spleen plays critical roles in hematopoiesis and the removal of aged or damaged red blood cells. Despite being innervated by sympathetic (catecholaminergic) nerve fibers, the spleen lacks parasympathetic (vagal or cholinergic) innervation. The neuroimmune axis, particularly the interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system immune circuits, significantly influences disease onset and progression. Extensive research employing physical, genetic, and pharmacological approaches has sought to directly modulate splenic immunocytes and activate neuroimmune interactions to restore immune homeostasis and counteract disease. Two primary mechanisms underlie these immunomodulatory interventions: (1) the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, wherein norepinephrine released by splenic catecholaminergic fibers binds to β2-adrenergic receptors on CD4⁺ T cells, triggering acetylcholine secretion, which in turn suppresses inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages via α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling, and (2) direct immunomodulation of splenic immunocytes, which regulates key genes and signaling pathways, alters cytokine secretion, and modulates ion flux to influence cellular functions. Among various therapeutic strategies, physical methods, particularly electrical stimulation and splenic ultrasound stimulation, have demonstrated the greatest promise for clinical applications in splenic immunomodulation and disease management.">

Beyond proliferation, invasion, and evasion, cells are resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy. In GBM, several mechanisms are in play that contribute to the creation and maintenance of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment, promoting tumor growth and immune escape. Furthermore, the high accumulation of immunosuppressive cells, the pronounced expression of immune checkpoint molecules, and the low number of neoantigens are hallmarks of GBM and contribute to the challenge of therapeutic approaches. In this review, we will discuss how GBM fosters tumor growth and explore treatment options such as small molecules, immunotherapies, and cell therapies, and their potential in clinical trials.">

        <tr id="Background/Aim Ocrelizumab, a CD20-targeting monoclonal antibody, is used for treatment of multiple sclerosis. The aim of this study was to explore the utility of peripheral blood cell subsets in prediction of treatment response to ocrelizumab in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Patients and Methods Thirty-one patients with RRMS resistant to first-line immunomodulating agents were enrolled and followed-up for 12 months under ocrelizumab treatment. Disease activity was monitored by 6-monthly assessments of Expanded Disability Status Scale and cranial-spinal magnetic resonance imaging. No evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) status was determined, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. Results Peripheral blood populations of CD19+ B-cells, plasma cells and CD3+ CD20+ T-cells decreased under ocrelizumab therapy, whereas populations of switched memory B-cells, CD4+ T-cells, naïve T-cells and regulatory B-1a and CD49d+ T-cells were increased. NEDA-3 status was achieved by 19 patients, who exhibited elevated baseline populations of regulatory CD49d+ T- and B-1a-cells, reduced post-treatment (month 6 or 12) populations of switched memory B-cells, and increased post-treatment populations of naïve T-cells. Month 12 Expanded Disability Status Scale scores correlated positively with plasmablast and naïve T-cell populations. Conclusion Response to ocrelizumab is linked to baseline regulatory and post-treatment effector B- and T-cell subset populations. Memory B-cells appear to be a marker of treatment efficacy for ocrelizumab.">

        <tr id="Background CD44, a widely recognized cancer stem cell marker, displayed a vital participation in the cancer immune invasion and may related with the response to the immunotherapy. However, the role of CD44 in cancer immunology is not well defined. Therefore, we intended to explore its prognostic value and potential immunological functions across 33 human cancer types. Methods Based on the data of patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Sangerbox was used to analyze the correlations between CD44 expression and tumor-infiltrated immune cells, immune checkpoints, neoantigens, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in human cancers. A mouse model xenografted with shRNA-CD44 MC38 was established. Results The elevated CD44 was associated with tumor stage and prognosis in several different cancers. GSEA results showed that upregulated CD44 involved in cancer stem cell associated process, antigen processing and presentation, and immune cells proliferation and activation. CD44 plays an essential role in the tumor immune regulation and immune checkpoints inhibitor response. The correlation of CD44 gene expression and infiltration levels of immune cells varied across different cancer types. Notably, the upregulation of CD44 expression is positively correlated with regulatory CD4 T cells, macrophages M1 and M2 in several analyzed cancers. Furthermore, we verified the effect of CD44 on tumor growth and immune microenvironment in mouse xenografted with shRNA-CD44 MC38. Moreover, DNA methylation existed in CD44 expression and associated with dysfunctional T-cell phenotypes via different mechanisms, thus resulting in tissue-dependent prognoses. Conclusion CD44 is both a cancer stem cell marker and a potential prognostic and immunological biomarker in various malignant tumors. Moreover, CD44 could be a novel target for immune-based therapy.

        <tr id="Understanding how different contributors within the tumor microenvironment (TME) function and communicate is essential for effective cancer detection and treatment. The TME encompasses all the surroundings of a tumor such as blood vessels, fibroblasts, immune cells, signaling molecules, exosomes, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Subsequently, effective cancer therapy relies on addressing TME alterations, known drivers of tumor progression, immune evasion, and metastasis. Immune cells and other cell types act differently under cancerous conditions, either driving or hindering cancer progression. For instance, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) include lymphocytes of B and T cell types that can invade malignancies, bringing in and enhancing the ability of immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. Therefore, TILs display a promising approach to tackling the TME alterations and have the capability to significantly hinder cancer progression. Similarly, exosomes and inflammasomes exhibit a dual effect, resulting in either tumor progression or inhibition depending on the origin of exosomes, type of inflammasome and tumor. This review will explore how cells function in the presence of a tumor, the communication between cancer cells and immune cells, and the role of TILs, exosomes and inflammasomes within the TME. The efforts in this review are aimed at garnering interest in safer and durable therapies for cancer, in addition to providing a promising avenue for advancing cancer therapy and consequently improving survival rates.">

        <tr id="Background: As a modulator of pre-mRNA splicing, the anti-cancer agent indisulam can induce aberrantly spliced neoantigens, enabling immunologic anti-tumor activity. Consequently, combining indisulam with immunotherapy is expected to be a promising novel approach in cancer therapy. However, a prerequisite for such a combination is that immune effector cells remain functional and unharmed by the chemical. Methods: To ensure the immunocompetence of human immune effector cells is maintained, we investigated the influence of indisulam on ex vivo-isolated T cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) from healthy donors. We used indisulam concentrations from 0.625 µM to 160 µM and examined the impact on the following: (i) the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by CD3-crosslinking and via a high-affinity TCR, (ii) the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, (iii) the maturation process of moDCs, and (iv) antigen-specific CD8+ T cell priming. Results: We observed dose-dependent inhibitory effects of indisulam, and substantial inhibition occurred at concentrations around 10 µM, but the various functions of the immune system exhibited different sensitivities. The weaker activation of T cells via CD3-crosslinking was more sensitive than the stronger activation via the high-affinity TCR. T cells remained capable of killing tumor cells after treatment with indisulam up to 40 µM, but T cell cytotoxicity was impaired at 160 µM indisulam. While moDC maturation was also rather resistant, T cell priming was almost completely abolished at a concentration of 10 µM. Conclusions: These effects should be considered in possible future combinations of immunotherapy with the mRNA splicing inhibitor indisulam.">

        <tr id="Colon cancer (CC) remains a primary contributor to cancer-related fatalities worldwide, driven by difficulties in early diagnosis and constrained therapeutic options. Recent studies underscore the importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME), notably tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), in fostering malignancy progression and therapy resistance. Through their inherent plasticity, TAMs facilitate immunosuppression, angiogenic processes, metastatic spread, and drug tolerance. In contrast to M1 macrophages, which promote inflammatory and tumoricidal responses, M2 macrophages support tumor expansion and dissemination by exerting immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic influences. Consequently, manipulating TAMs has emerged as a potential avenue to enhance treatment effectiveness. This review outlines the origins, polarization states, and functions of TAMs in CC, highlights their role in driving tumor advancement, and surveys ongoing efforts to target these cells for better patient outcomes. Emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating TAM functions - including depletion strategies, reprogramming approaches that shift M2-polarized TAMs toward an M1 phenotype, and inhibition of key signaling pathways sustaining TAM-mediated immunosuppression-are currently under active investigation. These approaches hold promise in overcoming TAM - induced resistance and improving immunotherapeutic efficacy in CC.">

        <tr id="Rationale: Advances in cancer therapies have significantly improved patient survival; however, tumors enriched in cancer stem cells (CSCs) have poor treatment responses. CSCs are a key source of tumor heterogeneity, contributing to therapeutic resistance and unfavorable patient outcomes. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), cell-in-cell (CIC) structures, where one cell engulfs another, have been identified as markers of poor prognosis. Despite their clinical relevance, the mechanisms underlying CIC formation across different tumor cell subpopulations remain largely unknown. Elucidating these processes could provide novel insights and therapeutic opportunities to address aggressive, treatment-resistant cancers. Method: Fluorescent mCherry-carrying colorectal cancer stem cells (CRCSCs) were expanded as spheroids in serum-free media and cocultured with either parental cancer cell-expressing Venus fluorescent protein or CFSE dye-stained immune cells (T cells, M1/M2 macrophages, neutrophils, and NK cells) or treated with EGFR- or PD-L1-targeting antibodies to assess the formation of CIC structures. Genes potentially crucial for the formation of CIC structures were knocked down or overexpressed, and their effects on CIC formation were evaluated. The clinical relevance of the in vitro findings was confirmed through analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens. Results: CRCSCs have a strong predilection for serving as the outer cell in a CIC structure and forming homotypic CIC structures predominantly with parental CRC cells. The frequency of CIC structure formation increased when the cells were exposed to anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment. Both the outer CRCSC in a CIC structure and CRCSCs released from a homotypic CIC structure showed enhanced resistance to the cytotoxicity of NK-92MI cells. Restoration of Stathmin1 (STMN1) expression but not RAC1 knockdown in CRCSCs reduced the homotypic CIC frequency, disrupted the outer cell fate in CIC structures, and increased cell susceptibility to NK-92MI cytotoxicity. In CRC patients, CIC structures are associated with poor tumor differentiation, negative STMN1 expression, and poor prognosis. Conclusion: CSCs play a crucial role in informing CIC structures in CRC. CIC structure formation partially depends on low STMN1 expression and confers a survival advantage under NK cytotoxicity. Targeting this pathway may significantly improve immunotherapy's efficacy for CRC patients.">

We characterized the T cell responses underlying this difference. Adult mice mounted robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses by 6 days post-infection (dpi), with sustained IFN-γ, granzyme B, IL-2, and TNF-α production. These T cells expanded significantly and exhibited in vivo cytotoxicity against cells pulsed with LACV glycoprotein (Gc) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens. In contrast, weanlings showed weak T cell responses and 100% mortality by 7 dpi.

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
In the tumor microenvironment (TME), hypoxia stands as a significant factor that modulates immune responses, especially those driven by T cells. As T cell-based therapies often fail to work in solid tumors, this study aims to investigate the effects of hypoxia on T cell topo-distribution in the TME, gene expression association with T cell states, and clinical responses in melanoma.


METHODS
To generate detailed information on tumor oxygenation and T cell accessibility, we used mathematical modeling of human melanoma tissue microarrays that incorporate oxygen supply from vessels, intratumoral diffusion, and cellular uptake. We created tumor maps and derived plots showing the fraction of CD4 and CD8 T cells against the distance to the nearest vessel and oxygen pressure. To assess their function and transcriptional changes caused by hypoxia, effector T cells were generated and cultured under hypoxia (0.5% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen). The T cell hypoxia-transcriptional signature was compared against datasets from msigDB, iATLAS (clinical trials of melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)), ORIEN AVATAR (real-world melanoma patients treated with ICIs), and a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.


RESULTS
We made three specific observations: (1) in melanoma T cells preferentially accumulated in oxygenated areas close to blood vessels (50-100 µm from the vasculature in the regions of high oxygen availability) but not in hypoxic areas far from blood vessels. (2) Our analysis confirmed that under hypoxia, T cell functions were significantly reduced compared with normoxic conditions and accompanied by a unique gene signature. Furthermore, this hypoxic gene signature was prevalent in resting and non-activated T cells. Notably and clinically relevant, the hypoxic T cell gene set was found to correlate with reduced overall survival and reduced progression-free survival in melanoma patients, which was more pronounced in non-responder patients undergoing ICI therapy. (3) Finally, compared with a single-cell atlas of tumor-infiltrating T cells, our hypoxia signature aligned with a population of cells at a state termed stress response state (TSTR).


CONCLUSIONS
Our study highlights the critical role of hypoxia in shaping T cell distribution and its correlation with clinical outcomes in melanoma. We revealed a preferential accumulation of T cells in oxygenated areas. Moreover, hypoxic T cells develop a distinct hypoxic gene signature prevalent in resting, non-activated T cells and TSTR that was also associated with poorer outcomes, particularly pronounced among non-responders to ICIs.">

        <tr id="Despite recent advancements, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a therapeutic challenge. While monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) leveraging natural killer (NK) cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity show great potential, none have gained clinical approval for AML. Immunocytokines have emerged as a promising strategy to overcome the limited efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. IL-15 stimulates activation, proliferation cytotoxic activity of NK cells, but its clinical use is prevented by short half-life, poor accumulation in the tumor, and toxicity due to systemic off-target immune activation. Here we report on the generation and preclinical characterization of modified immunocytokines consisting of an Fc-optimized CLEC12A (CLL-1) antibody fused to an IL-15 moiety with E46K mutation. The mutation abrogates binding to IL-15Rα, thereby enabling substitution of physiological trans-presentation by target binding and thus conditional IL-15Rβ/γ stimulation to reduce systemic toxicity. An optimal CLEC12A binder was selected from a range of murine mAbs, based on analysis of AML cell lines and leukemic cells from patients. This antibody was then used to construct an immunocytokine (MIC12) that subsequently was characterized functionally. Analysis of NK cell activation, cytokine release, proliferation and anti-leukemia reactivity demonstrated that MIC12 induced superior target cell killing and NK cell expansion compared to Fc-optimized CLEC12A antibody, with efficacy being dependent on target antigen binding.

        <tr id="Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that detect pathogenic and damage-associated molecular patterns, activating caspase-1, pyroptosis, and the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18Within the tumor microenvironment, inflammasomes like NLRP3 play critical roles in cancer initiation, promotion, and progression. Their activation influences the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity by modulating immune cell recruitment, cytokine secretion, and T-cell differentiation. While inflammasomes can contribute to tumor growth and metastasis through chronic inflammation, their components also present novel therapeutic targets. Several inhibitors targeting inflammasome components- such as sensor proteins (e.g., NLRP3, AIM2), adaptor proteins (e.g., ASC), caspase-1, and downstream cytokines- are being explored to modulate inflammasome activity. These therapeutic strategies aim to modulate inflammasome activity to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve clinical outcomes. Understanding the role of inflammasomes in cancer immunity is crucial for developing interventions that effectively bridge innate and adaptive immune responses for better therapeutic outcomes.">

        <tr id="Abstract Introduction In type 2 diabetes (T2D), beta cell failure is often associated with islet inflammation driven by the innate immune response, with macrophages playing a significant role. However, the composition and phenotype of lymphoid immune cells in the islets of individuals with T2D have not been extensively studied. This study aims to characterize and compare the presence, phenotype, and frequency of islet-associated lymphocytes—specifically T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells—in patients with T2D and non-diabetic organ donors. Research design and methods Multicolor flow cytometry was employed to detect NK, B, and T cells in dissociated pancreatic islets from 13 T2D and 44 non-diabetic donors. The frequencies and phenotypes of T cell subsets were determined using markers for memory differentiation status and tissue-resident T cells. The frequencies of alpha and beta cells were assessed by flow cytometry, and the insulin secretion level was measured by ELISA. Results In both T2D and non-diabetic islets, CD3(+) T cells were the predominant lymphocytes, mainly central and effector memory phenotypes, with a bias toward CD8(+) T cells expressing canonical residency markers (CD69 and CD103). The frequencies of CD19(+) B cells and CD3(−) CD16(+) CD56(+) NK cells were low in both groups. The proportions of these immune and beta cells were similar between T2D and non-diabetic donors. However, T2D donors had a higher proportion of glucagon-producing alpha cells and significantly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared with non-diabetic individuals. Conclusions In T2D islets, resident CD8(+) T cells with a central memory phenotype dominate the lymphoid immune cell population, similar to non-diabetic donors. These findings provide the first insights into the memory T cell composition in human pancreatic islets in T2D, suggesting that the diabetic condition does not significantly alter the lymphoid landscape of pancreatic islets.">

Here we compare TRM populations induced by intranasal adenoviral vector vaccines encoding hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein (NP) with those induced by an H1N1 infection in BALB/c mice. While vaccine-induced TRM express high levels of CD103 and persist longer in the lung parenchyma, short-lived, H1N1-induced TRM have a transcriptome associated with higher cytotoxic potential and distinct transcriptional profile as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing. In both the vaccine and H1N1 groups, NP-specific CD8+ T cells expand during heterologous influenza virus infection and protect the mice from disease. Meanwhile, lung inflammation in response to an infection with unrelated respiratory syncytial virus do not influence the fate of pre-existing TRM. Our preclinical work thus confirms that inflammatory conditions in the tissue shape the phenotypic and functional characteristics of TRM to serve relevant informations for optimizing mucosal vaccines.">

        <tr id="The tumor-immune response is mobilized to suppress tumorigenesis, while the immune microenvironment and lymph node microenvironment are formed gradually during tumor progression. In fact, tumor surface antigens are not easily recognized by antigen-presenting cells. So it is hard for the immune system to kill the newly formed tumor cells effectively. In a normal immune environment, immune function is always suppressed to maintain the stability of the body, and regulatory T cells play an important role in maintaining immune suppression. However, during tumorigenesis, the suppression of regulatory T cell immune functions is more likely to contribute to tumor cell proliferation and migration leading directly to tumor progression. Therefore, focusing on the role of regulatory T cells in tumor immunity could improve tumor immunotherapy outcomes in the clinic. Regulatory T cells are more mature in hematologic system tumors than in solid tumors. However, there are continuing efforts to apply regulatory T cells for immunotherapy in solid tumors. This review describes the role of regulatory T cells in solid tumor immunotherapy from the perspective of prognosis, immune microenvironment remodeling, and current clinical applications. This summary could help us better understand the mechanisms of regulatory T cells in solid tumor immunotherapy and further expand their clinical application.">

        <tr id="Tumor-specific CD8+ T cells play a pivotal role in anti-tumor immunity. Here, we review the heterogeneity of CD8+ T cell subsets during tumor progression. While both acute and chronic viral infections induce distinct CD8+ T cell responses, chronic responses are also observed during tumor development. Chronic immune responses have traditionally been considered to represent a dysfunctional state of CD8+ T cells, whereas the identification of TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells has highlighted their importance in anti-tumor immunity. During tumor progression, TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells differentiate into cytotoxic Tim-3+ terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells through mechanisms that remain largely unknown. We recently identified CD69 as an important regulator of chronic CD8+ T cell responses and showed that blocking CD69 function, either through the administration of anti-CD69 antibody (Ab) or genetic knockout, enhanced the generation of cytotoxic Tim-3+ terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells in both tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) and the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby enhancing the anti-tumor immune response. These findings suggest that CD69 is an attractive therapeutic target that controls the chronic anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response.">

        <tr id="Background Allergic asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by an allergic response and altered immune tolerance. CD4+ tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells are crucial in the chronic and relapsing pathogenesis of asthma. Furthermore, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is an essential transcription factor involved in asthmatic tolerance and has been implicated in the regulation of CD4+CD44+ memory T cells. However, the role of CD4+ TRM cells in asthmatic tolerance, as well as their potential modulation by PLZF, remain unclear. Therefore, in the current study, we explore the role of CD4+ TRM cells in asthmatic immune tolerance and as well as the regulatory role of PLZF in this process. Methods To elucidate the role of CD4+ TRM cells in immune tolerance, asthma memory mouse models were treated with the immunomodulator FTY720. Subsequently, CD4+ T cells were isolated from the lungs and spleens and transferred to oral tolerance mouse models. To explore the regulation of PLZF in CD4+ TRM cells, asthma and oral tolerance were established in Zbtb16flox/flox CD4Cre and wild-type mice. Flow cytometry, histological analysis, and cytokine measurements were performed to characterize the immune response. The regulatory activity of PLZF on CD4+ TRM cells was analyzed through quantitative proteomics and verified in vitro and vivo. Results The CD4+ TRM cell proportion positively correlated with the pathological phenotypes and molecular characteristics of asthma. Adoptive transfer of CD4+ TRM cells induced asthmatic phenotypes. This suggested that CD4+ TRM cells contributed to the pathogenesis of asthma. Conditional knockout of PLZF substantially reduced the proportion of CD4+ TRM cells, relieved asthmatic symptoms, and suppressed the interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15Rα signaling pathway. Furthermore, exposure to the IL-15Rα agonist restored asthma-related Th2 inflammation, accompanied by a markedly increased proportion of CD4+ TRM cells. Meanwhile, IL-15 and ovalbumin(OVA)-primed Beas2b supernatant co-stimulation in vitro enhanced the differentiation of pulmonary PLZF-expressing CD4+ T cells into CD4+ TRM cells. Conclusions This study identified CD4+ TRM cells as key mediators of immune tolerance in asthma. This process is regulated by the transcription factor PLZF in CD4+ T cells through IL-15/IL-15Rα signaling. Thus, targeting PLZF or the IL-15/IL-15Rα pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating asthma.

        <tr id="Colorectal cancer (CRC) presents an obstacle to immunotherapy, primarily because most cases are microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors, which are often described as “cold tumors” with limited immunogenicity. Recent studies have indicated that several therapeutic approaches, such as chemotherapy and targeted therapies, can elicit immunogenic cell death (ICD) and stimulate immune responses. However, challenges such as target affinity and in vivo pharmacokinetics limit the efficacy and immune response of current targeted therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that Macrocarpal I is a potent inducer of ICD by activating the PERK/eIF2A/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway. Furthermore, Macrocarpal I induces apoptosis and ferroptosis, both of which act as triggers for ICD. Mechanistically, Macrocarpal I directly targets TUBB2B and PARP1, disrupting microtubule polymerization and DNA repair processes. Importantly, treatment with Macrocarpal I enhances the anti-tumor immune response and augments responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy in an MC38 syngeneic mouse model of CRC.">

        <tr id="Cellular senescence, a state of stable cell cycle arrest, acts as a double-edged sword in cancer biology. In young organisms, it acts as a barrier against tumorigenesis, but in the aging population, it may facilitate tumor growth and metastasis through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in the immune system, particularly in the surveillance, targeting, and elimination of malignant and senescent cells. However, age-related immunosenescence is characterized by declining NK cell function resulting in diminished ability to fight infection, eliminate senescent cells and suppress tumor development. This implies that preserving or augmenting NK cell function may be central to defense against age-related degenerative and malignant diseases. This review explores the underlying mechanisms behind these interactions, focusing on how aging influences the battle between the immune system and cancer, the implications of senescent NK cells in disease progression, and the potential of adoptive NK cell therapy as a countermeasure to these age-related immunological challenges.">

        <tr id="Immune-mediated disorders are a broad range of diseases, arising as consequence of immune defects, exaggerated/misguided immune response or a mixture of both conditions. Their frequency is on a rise in the developed societies and they pose a significant challenge for diagnosis and treatment. Traditional pharmacological, monoclonal antibody-based or polyclonal antibody replacement-based therapies aiming at modulation of the immune responses give very often dissatisfactory results and/or are burdened with unacceptable adverse effects. In recent years, a new group of treatment modalities has emerged, utilizing cells as living drugs, especially with the use of the up-to-date genetic engineering. These modern cellular therapies are designed to offer a high potential for more targeted, safe, durable, and personalized treatment options. This work briefly reviews the latest advances in the treatment of immune-mediated disorders, mainly those related to exaggeration of the immune response, with such cellular therapies as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and others. We highlight the main features of these therapies as new treatment options for taming the dysregulated immune system. Undoubtfully, in near future such therapies can provide lasting remissions in a range of immune-mediated disorders with reduced treatment burden and improved quality of life for the patients.">

        <tr id="The nature of the effector and memory T cell response in the lungs following acute SARS-CoV-2 infections remains largely unknown. To define the pulmonary T-cell response to COVID-19, we compared effector and memory T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV) in mice. Both viruses elicited potent effector T cell responses in lungs, but memory T cells showed exaggerated contraction in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice. Specifically, unlike the T-bet/EOMES-driven effector transcription program in IAV lungs, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells embarked on a STAT-3-centric transcriptional program, a defining characteristic of a pro-fibro-inflammatory program: limited cytotoxicity, diminished expression of tissue-protective inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT), and augmented mucosal imprinting (CD103). Circulating CD45RO+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells in hospitalized COVID-19 patients expressed elevated levels of STAT-3 and low levels of TIGIT. IL-6 blockade experiments implicated IL-6 in STAT-3 induction and downregulation of PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific primary effector CD8 T cells. Memory CD8 T cells specific to a single epitope, induced by mucosal vaccination, differentiated into cytotoxic effectors and expressed high levels of CD103, effectively reducing viral burden in lungs following a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings have implications for developing targeted immunotherapies to mitigate immunopathology and promote protective T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2.">

        <tr id="Introduction. Immune memory is a tool of the adaptive immune system that allows it responding quickly and effectively to repeated contact with an antigen. The role of memory cell populations in the recurrence and progression of immune-dependent diseases is shown. 
Aim. To determine the trend in memory T-cell populations depending on the effectiveness of biological therapy (BT) in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis (PS). 
Materials and methods. Four hundred fifty children with immunosuppressive diseases (ISD) were examined during different periods of administration of biological drugs: IBD — 162 children (infliximab /adalimumab), MS — 116 children (interferon β1α — IFNβ1α), PS — 172 children (adalimumab). The effectiveness of BT was assessed using clinical activity indices and functional methods. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry to determine populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell: central (TCM), effector (TEM), and terminally differentiated (TEMRA). Statistical data processing was carried out in the Statistica 16.0 program, using the Mann–Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation analysis (p < 0.05). In the SPSS version 25 software, ROC analysis was performed in the efficiency–inefficiency separation model. 
Results. In all forms of pathology, changes in the content of memory T-cells have been established depending on the activity of inflammation. In IBD and PS patients, with an increase in the indices of disease activity, a decrease in the levels of CD4+ naive T-cells (TNAIVE) and an increase of TCM were detected. In MS patients with active foci, an MRI scan showed a decrease in the percentage of naive CD8+ T-cells (TcytNAIVE) and an increase in the population of CD8+ TEM. The content of TNAIVE populations decreased with age, and memory T-cells increased in patients with all the studied forms of pathology. In patients with BT efficacy, a high content of TNAIVE populations and a low content of TCM were found compared with the levels in patients with insufficient BT efficacy. Thresholds have been determined for IBD, MS, and PS patients, which make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT. An increase in the levels of TNAIVE and TcytNAIVE makes it possible to predict the presence of a BT effect, an increase in the levels of TCM, CD4+ TEM, and CD8+ ТEMRA make it possible to predict the absence or insufficient effect of BT. 
Conclusion. The activity of the inflammatory process is reflected in the differentiation of populations of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells. With the effectiveness of BT, the number of TNAIVE increases with a decrease in the number of TCM and TEM in patients with immune-dependent diseases, regardless of the form of pathology and the drug used. Threshold values for memory T-cells populations make it possible to predict the effectiveness of BT.">

        <tr id="In a recent study published in Cancer Cell , Braun et al. introduced extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) as a novel immunomodulatory approach to mitigate immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) without compromising anti-tumor immunity. 1 ECP suppressed Th1/Trm cell activation and neutrophil in ﬁ ltration while enhancing an anti-in ﬂ ammatory macrophage phenotype through adiponectin, facilitating the resolution of steroid-refractory irAEs. Given the increasing application of ICIs in cancer therapy, ECP might offer a promising alternative to glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive treatments that may diminish therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy. 2 ECP is an immunomodulatory therapy initially developed for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Its clinical applications have expanded to include conditions such as acute graft-versus-host disease and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. 3 The procedure involves leukapheresis, photoactivation, and reinfusion of treated cells. This article explores the mechanisms of action in immune regulation in the context of irAEs. Braun et al. investigated the impact of ECP vs. glucocorticoids on anti-PD-1 therapy in multiple cancer models. 1 Their ﬁ ndings revealed that glucocorticoids treatment led to reduced survival, increased tumor burden, and diminished in ﬁ ltration of tumor-speci ﬁ c T cells across various cancers, including melanoma, lung, colon, and renal cancers. Conversely, ECP preserved anti-PD-1 ef ﬁ cacy by maintaining tumor-speci ﬁ c T cell responses while also mitigating irAEs. The study also identi ﬁ ed recipient-derived adiponectin as">
